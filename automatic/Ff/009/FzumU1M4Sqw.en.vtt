00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
for a second this one is teaching you
how<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:48.990> use<00:01:49.200> infection<00:01:49.680> sequences<00:01:50.189> how<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
how to use infection sequences how to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.100 
how to use infection sequences how to
complete<00:01:50.880> infection<00:01:51.329> sequences<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.899> just

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
complete infection sequences you just

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
complete infection sequences you just
heard<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:53.159> I'll<00:01:53.250> explain<00:01:53.460> about<00:01:53.610> those<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> bit

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
heard and I'll explain about those a bit

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.850 
heard and I'll explain about those a bit
basically<00:01:54.930> once<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> idea<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.619> once<00:01:55.740> you've

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
basically once the idea is once you've

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.260 
basically once the idea is once you've
completed<00:01:56.219> all<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.579> admissions<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.060> Wolfpack

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
completed all the admissions of Wolfpack

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.030 
completed all the admissions of Wolfpack
discovery<00:01:57.869> you'll<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.560> ready<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> head<00:01:59.009> into

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
discovery you'll be ready to head into

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.310 
discovery you'll be ready to head into
Wolfpack<00:01:59.579> Unleashed<00:01:59.969> which<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.329> more<00:02:00.630> like

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
Wolfpack Unleashed which is more like

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
Wolfpack Unleashed which is more like
the<00:02:01.350> traditional<00:02:01.920> ac3<00:02:02.460> style<00:02:02.759> Wolfpack<00:02:03.180> where

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the traditional ac3 style Wolfpack where

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.670 
the traditional ac3 style Wolfpack where
all<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.990> these<00:02:04.110> different<00:02:04.409> things<00:02:04.439> you

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
all of these different things you

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.099 
all of these different things you
learned<00:02:04.829> are<00:02:04.979> put<00:02:05.159> together<00:02:05.310> into

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
learned are put together into

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.290 
learned are put together into
one<00:02:07.649> big<00:02:07.950> Wolfpack<00:02:08.489> mode<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.149> get

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
one big Wolfpack mode for you to get

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.339 
one big Wolfpack mode for you to get
through

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
through

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.180 
through
and<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.800> hopefully<00:02:13.800> it'll<00:02:13.890> help<00:02:14.010> with

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
and so you hopefully it'll help with

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.259 
and so you hopefully it'll help with
some<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.489> newer<00:02:14.640> players<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.030> learning

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
some of the newer players and learning

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.070 
some of the newer players and learning
how<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.360> play<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:18.209> anyway<00:02:18.480> these<00:02:18.599> are<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.019> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
how to play so anyway these are in the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.780 
how to play so anyway these are in the
infection<00:02:19.440> modes<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.280> what<00:02:20.370> they've<00:02:20.489> done<00:02:20.640> for

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
infection modes so what they've done for

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.180 
infection modes so what they've done for
Wolfpack<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.629> c4<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.200> they've<00:02:22.379> also<00:02:22.560> added<00:02:22.860> a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
Wolfpack in a c4 is they've also added a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.470 
Wolfpack in a c4 is they've also added a
little<00:02:23.340> more<00:02:23.549> variety<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.209> different

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
little more variety to the different

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.610 
little more variety to the different
sequences<00:02:24.930> sometimes<00:02:25.260> they'll<00:02:25.379> encounter

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
sequences sometimes they'll encounter

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.460 
sequences sometimes they'll encounter
these<00:02:25.860> infection<00:02:26.370> sequences<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.150> or<00:02:27.599> kind<00:02:28.410> of

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
these infection sequences and or kind of

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.259 
these infection sequences and or kind of
once<00:02:28.620> or<00:02:28.799> more<00:02:28.920> like<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.099> chest<00:02:29.459> capture<00:02:30.000> esque

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
once or more like a chest capture esque

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.680 
once or more like a chest capture esque
ones<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.760> right<00:02:32.910> now<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.060> can't<00:02:33.360> kill<00:02:33.569> my

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
ones and so right now I can't kill my

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.720 
ones and so right now I can't kill my
target<00:02:34.019> because<00:02:34.349> you<00:02:35.160> need<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.400> pick<00:02:35.519> up<00:02:35.610> an

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
target because you need to pick up an

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.580 
target because you need to pick up an
infection<00:02:36.209> pack<00:02:36.420> at<00:02:36.599> first<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.410> Tim's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
infection pack at first and so Tim's

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.930 
infection pack at first and so Tim's
going<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.799> go<00:02:37.920> over<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.190> capture<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.610> third

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
going to go over and capture that third

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.460 
going to go over and capture that third
packet<00:02:39.329> there<00:02:39.510> were<00:02:39.569> three<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.870> start<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.290> used

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
packet there were three to start we used

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.240 
packet there were three to start we used
up<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.829> this<00:02:41.549> is<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.790> third<00:02:42.000> one<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:43.130> then<00:02:44.130> you

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
up to this is the third one and then you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.470 
up to this is the third one and then you
can<00:02:44.400> kill<00:02:44.549> your<00:02:44.640> targets<00:02:45.000> that's<00:02:45.239> basically

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
can kill your targets that's basically

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.030 
can kill your targets that's basically
how<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.750> fix<00:02:45.959> your<00:02:46.049> arcs<00:02:46.200> now<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.860> might

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
how you fix your arcs now you might

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.650 
how you fix your arcs now you might
notice<00:02:47.430> if<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.849> want<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.090> rewind<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.510> that

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
notice if you want to rewind on that

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.809 
notice if you want to rewind on that
kill<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.560> they've<00:02:49.709> actually<00:02:49.890> modified

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
kill is that they've actually modified

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.819 
kill is that they've actually modified
the<00:02:51.060> kill<00:02:51.450> how<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.959> hidden<00:02:52.290> bonus<00:02:52.380> works<00:02:52.769> a

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
the kill how the hidden bonus works a

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.550 
the kill how the hidden bonus works a
little<00:02:53.040> bit<00:02:53.130> I've<00:02:53.220> noticed<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:53.849> video

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
little bit I've noticed it in this video

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.839 
little bit I've noticed it in this video
it's<00:02:55.560> kind<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.160> interesting<00:02:56.430> I'm<00:02:56.700> not<00:02:56.819> a

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
it's kind of interesting I'm not a

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.430 
it's kind of interesting I'm not a
hundred<00:02:57.150> percent<00:02:57.299> sure<00:02:57.599> exactly<00:02:58.079> how<00:02:58.349> it

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
hundred percent sure exactly how it

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.729 
hundred percent sure exactly how it
works<00:02:58.620> but<00:02:59.519> if<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:01.200> lot<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.560> who<00:03:01.650> have

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
works but if you a lot of you who have

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.710 
works but if you a lot of you who have
played<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> recent<00:03:02.370> or<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:03.239> previous<00:03:03.540> games

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
played the recent or the previous games

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.080 
played the recent or the previous games
in<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.410> multiplayer<00:03:04.829> might<00:03:05.700> remember<00:03:05.910> that

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
in the multiplayer might remember that

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.750 
in the multiplayer might remember that
when<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:06.989> enter<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.200> blank<00:03:07.379> group<00:03:07.709> you'll<00:03:08.549> gain

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
when you enter a blank group you'll gain

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.750 
when you enter a blank group you'll gain
your<00:03:08.910> hidden<00:03:09.150> bonus<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:10.079> can<00:03:10.230> actually

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
your hidden bonus and you can actually

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.979 
your hidden bonus and you can actually
keep<00:03:11.760> your<00:03:11.940> hidden<00:03:12.090> bonus<00:03:12.450> after<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.840> leave

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
keep your hidden bonus after you leave

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.809 
keep your hidden bonus after you leave
the<00:03:13.109> blank<00:03:13.319> room<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:13.799> about<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.280> second

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
the blank room for about a second

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.460 
the blank room for about a second
roughly<00:03:15.239> really<00:03:16.079> briefly<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:18.299> you'll<00:03:19.260> notice

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
roughly really briefly and you'll notice

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.500 
roughly really briefly and you'll notice
here<00:03:20.040> as<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.310> blend<00:03:20.549> with<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:20.880> civilian<00:03:21.269> right

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
here as I blend with this civilian right

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.490 
here as I blend with this civilian right
here<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.720> can<00:03:21.810> blend<00:03:21.930> with<00:03:22.019> single<00:03:22.350> people

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
here you can blend with single people

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.590 
here you can blend with single people
now<00:03:22.709> watches<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.430> hidden<00:03:23.700> bonus<00:03:24.000> comes<00:03:24.389> in

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
now watches the hidden bonus comes in

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.840 
now watches the hidden bonus comes in
but<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.230> immediately<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:26.220> times<00:03:26.459> two<00:03:26.670> goes

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
but it immediately the times two goes

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.699 
but it immediately the times two goes
away<00:03:27.000> as<00:03:27.209> soon<00:03:27.480> as<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.750> leave<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.049> group<00:03:28.200> it

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
away as soon as I leave the group it

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.470 
away as soon as I leave the group it
doesn't<00:03:28.980> stay<00:03:29.190> around<00:03:29.430> for<00:03:29.639> a<00:03:29.670> little<00:03:29.730> bit<00:03:29.910> so

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
doesn't stay around for a little bit so

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.030 
doesn't stay around for a little bit so
they've<00:03:30.750> made<00:03:30.930> some<00:03:31.079> changes<00:03:31.139> to<00:03:31.709> it

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
they've made some changes to it

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.400 
they've made some changes to it
there<00:03:32.670> are<00:03:32.819> situations<00:03:33.359> where<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.660> times<00:03:34.109> to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
there are situations where the times to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.770 
there are situations where the times to
hidden<00:03:34.920> does<00:03:35.549> stick<00:03:35.790> around<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.239> times<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.660> is

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
hidden does stick around the times to is

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.720 
hidden does stick around the times to is
next<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.170> your<00:03:37.319> approach<00:03:37.560> meter<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:38.519> shows

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
next to your approach meter it shows

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.390 
next to your approach meter it shows
when<00:03:38.880> your<00:03:39.000> hidden<00:03:39.150> bonus<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.540> active<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:41.010> so

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
when your hidden bonus is active and so

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.670 
when your hidden bonus is active and so
what<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.579> think<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.510> that<00:03:42.959> it's<00:03:43.500> they're

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
what I think it is is that it's they're

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.259 
what I think it is is that it's they're
trying<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:43.980> avoid<00:03:44.130> people<00:03:44.519> who<00:03:44.700> duck<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.180> to

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
trying to avoid people who duck in to

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.270 
trying to avoid people who duck in to
blend<00:03:45.510> groups<00:03:45.720> really<00:03:46.200> quickly<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.799> then

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
blend groups really quickly and then

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.789 
blend groups really quickly and then
really<00:03:47.819> quickly<00:03:48.000> leave<00:03:48.329> them<00:03:48.599> to<00:03:49.530> get<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
really quickly leave them to get the

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.259 
really quickly leave them to get the
hidden<00:03:50.040> bonus<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.519> target<00:03:50.910> that's<00:03:51.030> further

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
hidden bonus to a target that's further

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.360 
hidden bonus to a target that's further
away<00:03:51.590> because<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.709> looks<00:03:52.950> like<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.190> need<00:03:53.310> to

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
away because it looks like you need to

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.699 
away because it looks like you need to
stay<00:03:53.669> in<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:53.880> blend<00:03:54.120> group<00:03:54.239> for<00:03:54.660> at<00:03:55.049> least<00:03:55.410> a

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
stay in that blend group for at least a

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.530 
stay in that blend group for at least a
few<00:03:55.739> seconds<00:03:56.340> before<00:03:56.639> that<00:03:57.090> hidden<00:03:57.269> bonus

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
few seconds before that hidden bonus

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.300 
few seconds before that hidden bonus
will<00:03:57.690> stick<00:03:57.959> around<00:03:57.989> after<00:03:58.919> you<00:03:59.010> leave<00:03:59.160> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
will stick around after you leave the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.259 
will stick around after you leave the
plane<00:03:59.489> group<00:03:59.669> that's<00:04:00.630> as<00:04:00.780> best<00:04:00.989> as<00:04:01.109> I<00:04:01.230> can

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
plane group that's as best as I can

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.170 
plane group that's as best as I can
kind<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:02.950> figure<00:04:03.950> out<00:04:03.980> for<00:04:04.370> now<00:04:04.489> based<00:04:04.849> on<00:04:05.030> just

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
kind of figure out for now based on just

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.330 
kind of figure out for now based on just
the<00:04:05.239> information<00:04:05.599> I<00:04:05.659> have<00:04:05.810> but<00:04:06.409> kind<00:04:07.280> of

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
the information I have but kind of

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.280 
the information I have but kind of
interesting<00:04:07.760> something<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.120> keep<00:04:08.209> in<00:04:08.359> mind<00:04:08.599> as

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
interesting something to keep in mind as

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.979 
interesting something to keep in mind as
it<00:04:09.469> changes<00:04:09.769> mechanics<00:04:10.450> NPCs<00:04:11.450> of<00:04:11.629> course<00:04:11.810> can

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
it changes mechanics NPCs of course can

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.390 
it changes mechanics NPCs of course can
still<00:04:12.200> use<00:04:12.319> abilities<00:04:12.769> against<00:04:13.099> you<00:04:13.189> like

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
still use abilities against you like

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.880 
still use abilities against you like
smoke<00:04:13.670> bomb<00:04:13.879> you'll<00:04:14.870> see<00:04:15.079> one<00:04:15.260> that<00:04:15.379> uses<00:04:15.530> time

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
smoke bomb you'll see one that uses time

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.259 
smoke bomb you'll see one that uses time
phase<00:04:16.070> later<00:04:16.310> as<00:04:16.489> well<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:19.910> might<00:04:20.000> also<00:04:20.150> be

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
phase later as well so you might also be

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.189 
phase later as well so you might also be
wondering<00:04:20.530> what<00:04:21.530> happens<00:04:21.889> if<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:22.960> use<00:04:23.960> up<00:04:24.110> all

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
wondering what happens if you use up all

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.510 
wondering what happens if you use up all
your<00:04:24.259> packets<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.710> haven't<00:04:24.949> killed<00:04:25.100> all<00:04:25.280> the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
your packets you haven't killed all the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.180 
your packets you haven't killed all the
infected<00:04:26.090> target<00:04:26.509> since<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:26.990> asked<00:04:27.889> him<00:04:28.009> this

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
infected target since I asked him this

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.950 
infected target since I asked him this
way<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.180> gave<00:04:29.330> me<00:04:29.419> an<00:04:29.479> answer<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.810> don't

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
way you gave me an answer I don't

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.680 
way you gave me an answer I don't
remember<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.650> exact<00:04:31.039> nuance<00:04:31.669> details<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.419> but

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
remember the exact nuance details of but

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.090 
remember the exact nuance details of but
I<00:04:32.720> believe<00:04:33.139> it's<00:04:33.350> something<00:04:33.470> along<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.949> lines

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
I believe it's something along the lines

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.100 
I believe it's something along the lines
of<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:35.060> either<00:04:35.210> can't<00:04:35.599> complete<00:04:35.990> the

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
of you either can't complete the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.409 
of you either can't complete the
sequence<00:04:36.320> or<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:37.070> just<00:04:37.280> is<00:04:37.460> gonna<00:04:37.820> take<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.060> lot

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
sequence or it just is gonna take a lot

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.300 
sequence or it just is gonna take a lot
longer<00:04:38.690> so<00:04:39.199> something<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:39.889> really<00:04:40.220> really

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
longer so something you really really

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.860 
longer so something you really really
want<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.580> avoid<00:04:40.699> you<00:04:41.240> want<00:04:41.389> to<00:04:41.479> make<00:04:41.570> sure<00:04:41.750> you

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
want to avoid you want to make sure you

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.080 
want to avoid you want to make sure you
kill<00:04:42.050> all<00:04:42.259> your<00:04:42.380> targets<00:04:42.710> within<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.580> packets

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
kill all your targets within the packets

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.310 
kill all your targets within the packets
that<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.330> were<00:04:44.389> given<00:04:44.630> for<00:04:44.840> this

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.450 

see<00:04:48.320> right<00:04:48.470> here<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.680> can<00:04:48.800> see<00:04:49.009> when<00:04:49.430> I

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
see right here you can see when I

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.860 
see right here you can see when I
blended<00:04:49.759> with<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:49.970> sibling<00:04:50.330> that<00:04:50.419> times<00:04:50.660> two

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
blended with that sibling that times two

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.510 
blended with that sibling that times two
hung<00:04:51.080> around<00:04:51.289> a<00:04:51.470> little<00:04:51.560> longer<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:52.310> I'm<00:04:52.370> not

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
hung around a little longer so I'm not

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.279 
hung around a little longer so I'm not
exactly<00:04:53.120> sure<00:04:53.300> what<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.599> mechanics<00:04:53.990> are<00:04:54.110> but

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
exactly sure what the mechanics are but

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.060 
exactly sure what the mechanics are but
looks<00:04:54.500> like<00:04:54.560> they<00:04:54.740> clicked<00:04:55.070> in<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.250> little<00:04:55.460> time

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
looks like they clicked in a little time

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
looks like they clicked in a little time
or<00:04:58.070> maybe<00:04:58.220> it's<00:04:58.400> always<00:04:58.490> been<00:04:58.699> like<00:04:58.820> this<00:04:58.940> and

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
or maybe it's always been like this and

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.129 
or maybe it's always been like this and
I<00:04:59.150> just<00:04:59.270> never<00:04:59.389> noticed<00:04:59.599> because<00:04:59.930> we<00:05:00.020> never

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
I just never noticed because we never

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.370 
I just never noticed because we never
had<00:05:00.320> a<00:05:00.349> visual<00:05:00.710> indicator<00:05:01.599> is<00:05:02.599> hard<00:05:03.110> to<00:05:03.199> say

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
had a visual indicator is hard to say

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.870 
had a visual indicator is hard to say
but<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.620> think<00:05:03.710> it<00:05:03.919> is<00:05:04.039> I<00:05:04.190> think<00:05:04.490> it<00:05:04.610> is<00:05:04.699> a<00:05:04.729> little

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
but I think it is I think it is a little

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.040 
but I think it is I think it is a little
different<00:05:07.510> now<00:05:08.510> they're<00:05:08.659> introducing

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
different now they're introducing

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.159 
different now they're introducing
multiple<00:05:09.409> targets<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:09.860> kill<00:05:10.070> for<00:05:10.870> this<00:05:11.870> part

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
multiple targets to kill for this part

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.920 
multiple targets to kill for this part
here<00:05:13.120> another<00:05:14.120> thing<00:05:14.360> that's<00:05:14.510> going<00:05:14.720> to<00:05:14.810> be

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
here another thing that's going to be

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.110 
here another thing that's going to be
different<00:05:15.289> for<00:05:15.680> Wolfpack<00:05:16.490> in<00:05:16.729> Assassin's

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
different for Wolfpack in Assassin's

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.659 
different for Wolfpack in Assassin's
Creed<00:05:17.300> 4<00:05:17.330> is<00:05:17.750> actually<00:05:18.139> in<00:05:18.289> addition<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.770> more

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
Creed 4 is actually in addition to more

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.360 
Creed 4 is actually in addition to more
variety<00:05:20.150> of<00:05:20.180> sequences<00:05:20.810> sequence<00:05:21.740> types<00:05:22.010> you

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
variety of sequences sequence types you

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.040 
variety of sequences sequence types you
might<00:05:22.550> say<00:05:22.789> this<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.300> time<00:05:23.479> phase<00:05:23.659> ability

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
might say this is the time phase ability

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.659 
might say this is the time phase ability
by<00:05:24.169> the<00:05:24.229> way<00:05:24.380> of<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:24.560> enemy<00:05:25.190> using<00:05:25.460> this<00:05:25.520> is

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
by the way of the enemy using this is

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.460 
by the way of the enemy using this is
kind<00:05:26.030> of<00:05:26.060> annoying<00:05:26.270> when<00:05:26.690> you're<00:05:27.229> trying<00:05:27.349> to

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
kind of annoying when you're trying to

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.469 
kind of annoying when you're trying to
get<00:05:27.560> out<00:05:27.620> of<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:28.210> another<00:05:29.210> change<00:05:29.419> that

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
get out of it another change that

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:30.580 
get out of it another change that
they're<00:05:29.659> making<00:05:29.930> is<00:05:30.020> that<00:05:30.050> you'll<00:05:30.320> actually

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
they're making is that you'll actually

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.029 
they're making is that you'll actually
also<00:05:30.830> get<00:05:31.070> more<00:05:31.370> sequences<00:05:31.990> in<00:05:32.990> wolf<00:05:33.470> packs<00:05:33.740> so

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
also get more sequences in wolf packs so

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.320 
also get more sequences in wolf packs so
I<00:05:34.880> I'm<00:05:35.599> pretty<00:05:35.990> sure<00:05:36.409> that<00:05:37.099> it's<00:05:37.310> 25<00:05:37.729> sequences

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
I I'm pretty sure that it's 25 sequences

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.450 
I I'm pretty sure that it's 25 sequences
for<00:05:38.509> normal<00:05:40.360> 30<00:05:41.360> for<00:05:41.750> difficult<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:42.650> 35<00:05:43.159> for

for normal 30 for difficult and 35 for
hardcore<00:05:43.880> if<00:05:44.180> it's<00:05:44.960> not<00:05:45.139> that<00:05:45.349> then<00:05:45.680> I'm

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
hardcore if it's not that then I'm

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.950 
hardcore if it's not that then I'm
pretty<00:05:45.949> sure<00:05:46.159> it's<00:05:46.310> 20<00:05:46.669> 25<00:05:47.330> 30<00:05:47.570> fine<00:05:47.750> pretty

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
pretty sure it's 20 25 30 fine pretty

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.020 
pretty sure it's 20 25 30 fine pretty
sure<00:05:48.110> it's<00:05:48.229> 25<00:05:48.590> 30<00:05:48.860> 35

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
sure it's 25 30 35

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.610 
sure it's 25 30 35
so<00:05:51.600> to<00:05:51.690> give<00:05:51.870> you<00:05:51.900> a<00:05:51.990> little<00:05:52.290> more<00:05:52.530> of<00:05:52.590> a

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
who weren't a big fan of Wolfpack in 83

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.530 
who weren't a big fan of Wolfpack in 83
you<00:06:23.520> might<00:06:23.700> find<00:06:23.940> some<00:06:24.120> things<00:06:24.270> that<00:06:24.390> are<00:06:24.480> kind

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
you might find some things that are kind

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.930 
you might find some things that are kind
of<00:06:24.660> interesting<00:06:25.050> but<00:06:25.170> at<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:26.190> core<00:06:26.430> of<00:06:26.460> it<00:06:26.880> is

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
of interesting but at the core of it is

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.070 
of interesting but at the core of it is
pretty<00:06:27.480> much<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:27.840> same<00:06:28.020> so<00:06:29.690> you'll<00:06:30.690> probably

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
pretty much the same so you'll probably

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.150 
pretty much the same so you'll probably
won't<00:06:31.380> change<00:06:31.410> your<00:06:31.650> opinion<00:06:31.920> too<00:06:32.010> much<00:06:32.100> you

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
won't change your opinion too much you

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.980 
won't change your opinion too much you
might<00:06:32.280> have<00:06:32.370> a<00:06:32.400> little<00:06:32.550> more<00:06:32.640> fun<00:06:32.880> and<00:06:33.570> execute

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
might have a little more fun and execute

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.440 
might have a little more fun and execute
a<00:06:34.020> sync<00:06:34.230> kill<00:06:34.470> I'm<00:06:35.310> sure<00:06:35.670> some<00:06:36.030> people<00:06:36.150> will<00:06:36.300> be

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
a sync kill I'm sure some people will be

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.550 
a sync kill I'm sure some people will be
disappointed<00:06:36.810> that<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.200> sync<00:06:37.410> kill

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
disappointed that the sync kill

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.260 
disappointed that the sync kill
animations<00:06:37.980> are<00:06:38.100> the<00:06:38.190> same<00:06:38.430> at<00:06:38.910> least<00:06:39.120> for

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
animations are the same at least for

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.360 
animations are the same at least for
this<00:06:39.390> new<00:06:39.600> person<00:06:39.870> one<00:06:40.080> here<00:06:40.320> is<00:06:40.580> wah-wah<00:06:42.350> and

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
this new person one here is wah-wah and

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.160 
this new person one here is wah-wah and
that<00:06:44.370> wraps<00:06:44.520> up<00:06:44.640> mission<00:06:44.880> 7<00:06:45.150> so<00:06:45.450> that<00:06:46.050> one

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
that wraps up mission 7 so that one

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.720 
that wraps up mission 7 so that one
teaches<00:06:46.470> you<00:06:46.530> how<00:06:46.620> to<00:06:46.650> infection<00:06:47.130> packets<00:06:47.430> you

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
teaches you how to infection packets you

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.490 
teaches you how to infection packets you
know<00:06:47.760> other<00:06:48.090> ones<00:06:48.270> teach<00:06:48.480> you<00:06:48.660> just<00:06:49.140> different

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
know other ones teach you just different

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.740 
know other ones teach you just different
guard<00:06:50.100> archetypes<00:06:50.640> other<00:06:51.180> ones<00:06:51.450> teach<00:06:51.630> you

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
guard archetypes other ones teach you

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.260 
guard archetypes other ones teach you
how<00:06:51.840> to<00:06:51.900> do<00:06:52.050> sync<00:06:52.320> kills<00:06:53.030> hopefully<00:06:54.030> I'll<00:06:54.150> make

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
how to do sync kills hopefully I'll make

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.600 
how to do sync kills hopefully I'll make
the<00:06:54.510> process<00:06:54.900> of<00:06:55.230> playing<00:06:55.500> with<00:06:55.680> random

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
the process of playing with random

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.580 
the process of playing with random
people<00:06:56.700> a<00:06:56.880> little<00:06:57.150> a<00:06:57.570> little<00:06:57.870> less<00:06:58.140> painless

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
people a little a little less painless

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.460 
people a little a little less painless
or<00:06:58.800> a<00:06:59.310> little<00:06:59.550> more<00:06:59.700> painless<00:06:59.880> I<00:07:00.120> should<00:07:00.240> say

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
or a little more painless I should say

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.080 
or a little more painless I should say
anyway<00:07:01.470> so<00:07:01.830> that's<00:07:02.010> pretty<00:07:02.160> much<00:07:02.220> it<00:07:02.580> for<00:07:02.970> this
