hey what's going on guys we're gonna be
doing<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:03.060> deck<00:00:03.330> profile<00:00:03.659> for<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.959> chaos

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
doing a deck profile for the chaos

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.260 
doing a deck profile for the chaos
inductor<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.250> was<00:00:05.460> playing<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.790> while<00:00:05.970> ago

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
inductor so I was playing a while ago

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.350 
inductor so I was playing a while ago
this<00:00:06.750> was<00:00:06.930> actually<00:00:07.170> before<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:08.130> was<00:00:08.519> playing

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
this was actually before I was playing

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.990 
this was actually before I was playing
the<00:00:09.990> injectors<00:00:10.769> with<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.010> sword<00:00:11.280> so<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.670> mean

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
the injectors with the sword so I mean

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.580 
the injectors with the sword so I mean
this<00:00:12.179> deck<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.540> little<00:00:12.780> bit<00:00:12.870> older<00:00:13.019> but<00:00:13.380> I

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
this deck is a little bit older but I

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.200 
this deck is a little bit older but I
still<00:00:13.769> think<00:00:13.950> it's<00:00:14.130> viable<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.969> reason

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
still think it's viable and the reason

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.609 
still think it's viable and the reason
why<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.540> had<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.690> play<00:00:15.870> chaos<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.320> sectors

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
why I just had to play chaos in sectors

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.830 
why I just had to play chaos in sectors
or<00:00:16.890> made<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.609> deck<00:00:17.789> was<00:00:18.180> essentially<00:00:18.600> because

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
or made the deck was essentially because

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.960 
or made the deck was essentially because
as<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.710> guys<00:00:19.830> know<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.130> sectors<00:00:20.520> they<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
as you guys know in sectors they have to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.730 
as you guys know in sectors they have to
throw<00:00:21.210> one<00:00:21.390> summon<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.960> then<00:00:22.170> that's<00:00:22.320> if

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
throw one summon and then that's if

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.259 
throw one summon and then that's if
you've<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.100> l'heure<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.460> torrential<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.090> book

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
you've a l'heure you torrential you book

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.939 
you've a l'heure you torrential you book
a<00:00:24.300> moon<00:00:24.570> that's<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.560> good<00:00:25.680> that's<00:00:25.769> all

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
a moon that's really good that's all

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.560 
a moon that's really good that's all
they<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.130> do<00:00:26.250> they<00:00:26.400> can<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:26.730> basically<00:00:27.150> pass

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
they can do they can just basically pass

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.660 
they can do they can just basically pass
their<00:00:27.810> turn<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.260> that's<00:00:28.980> why<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> decided<00:00:29.250> no

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
their turn and that's why I decided no

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.950 
their turn and that's why I decided no
chaos<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.090> zakir<00:00:30.269> sound<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:30.869> idea

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
chaos and zakir sound like a good idea

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.479 
chaos and zakir sound like a good idea
because<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.470> had<00:00:31.590> someone's<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.250> cyber

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
because you had someone's like cyber

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.370 
because you had someone's like cyber
dragon<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> go<00:00:33.090> chaos<00:00:33.300> sorcerer<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> if

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
dragon you go chaos sorcerer and if

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.630 
dragon you go chaos sorcerer and if
they're<00:00:34.530> already<00:00:34.739> use<00:00:34.920> their<00:00:35.040> resources<00:00:35.190> like

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
they're already use their resources like

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.370 
they're already use their resources like
you<00:00:35.760> know<00:00:35.880> warning<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> dragonfly

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
you know warning on like a dragonfly

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.660 
you know warning on like a dragonfly
then<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.489> chaos

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
then you can just some of the chaos

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
then you can just some of the chaos
sorcerer<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.540> problematic<00:00:39.750> for

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
sorcerer and that can be problematic for

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.139 
sorcerer and that can be problematic for
your<00:00:40.350> opponent<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.700> was<00:00:41.850> kind<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
your opponent so that was kind of the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209 
your opponent so that was kind of the
reason<00:00:42.329> why<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.570> decided<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.230> check<00:00:43.739> out<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
reason why I decided to check out the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.190 
reason why I decided to check out the
cows<00:00:44.399> inductors<00:00:44.969> attend<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.539> deck<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.899> pretty

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
cows inductors attend the deck is pretty

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.410 
cows inductors attend the deck is pretty
good<00:00:46.379> however<00:00:47.190> personally<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.789> still<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.180> favor

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
good however personally I still do favor

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420 
good however personally I still do favor
the<00:00:48.600> soy<00:00:48.750> branch<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.890> otk<00:00:50.280> with

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the soy branch because you can otk with

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.639 
the soy branch because you can otk with
two<00:00:50.520> cards<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.360> fast<00:00:51.649> but

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
two cards and it's just really fast but

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.600 
two cards and it's just really fast but
yeah<00:00:52.770> let's<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:53.070> ahead<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.219> get<00:00:53.340> start<00:00:53.520> with

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
yeah let's go ahead and get start with

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.610 
yeah let's go ahead and get start with
the<00:00:53.670> deck<00:00:53.789> profile<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> wouldn't<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.289> chaos

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the deck profile so I wouldn't be chaos

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
the deck profile so I wouldn't be chaos

the maxi as much as like a deck like

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.470 
the maxi as much as like a deck like
wind-ups<00:02:15.620> but<00:02:16.610> yeah<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:16.910> mean<00:02:17.120> as<00:02:17.240> long<00:02:17.300> as<00:02:17.390> you

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
wind-ups but yeah I mean as long as you

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
have that veiler you should be pretty

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.920 
have that veiler you should be pretty
good<00:02:18.710> against<00:02:19.010> wind-ups<00:02:19.430> anyways<00:02:19.820> all<00:02:20.780> those

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
good against wind-ups anyways all those

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.720 
good against wind-ups anyways all those
times<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.320> can<00:02:21.380> still<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.740> go<00:02:22.160> for<00:02:22.340> multiples

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
times it can still just go for multiples

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.790 
times it can still just go for multiples
in<00:02:22.790> babies<00:02:23.060> anyways<00:02:23.540> next<00:02:24.410> up<00:02:24.500> we're<00:02:24.620> playing

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
gorse because the back row is kind of

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.270 
gorse because the back row is kind of
weak<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.200> deck<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:27.920> know<00:02:28.010> guards

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
weak in this deck and you know guards

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.550 
weak in this deck and you know guards
just<00:02:28.430> another<00:02:28.640> dark<00:02:28.910> place<00:02:29.090> he's<00:02:29.240> quite<00:02:29.480> good

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
just another dark place he's quite good

just another dark place he's quite good
then<00:02:30.560> there's<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:31.010> standard<00:02:31.370> injector

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
then there's the standard injector

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.250 
then there's the standard injector
lineup<00:02:32.000> which<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.360> would<00:02:32.540> consider<00:02:32.780> three

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
lineup which I would consider three

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.770 
lineup which I would consider three

and three sector Hornets and so yeah I'd

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.260 
and three sector Hornets and so yeah I'd
say<00:02:40.400> that's<00:02:40.580> pretty<00:02:40.670> standard<00:02:40.910> for<00:02:41.150> the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
say that's pretty standard for the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.360 
say that's pretty standard for the
inside<00:02:41.870> your<00:02:41.990> lineup<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.320> then<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.010> help<00:02:43.190> out

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
inside your lineup and then to help out

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.580 
inside your lineup and then to help out
more<00:02:43.730> with<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.330> getting<00:02:44.959> those<00:02:45.200> cards<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
more with the getting those cards to the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.560 
more with the getting those cards to the
Graveyard<00:02:45.920> sometimes<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.520> really<00:02:47.420> required

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
Graveyard sometimes is really required

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.840 
Graveyard sometimes is really required
so<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.080> decided<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.470> put<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.709> raikos<00:02:49.010> because<00:02:49.459> i

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
so I decided to put in raikos because i

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.550 
so I decided to put in raikos because i
