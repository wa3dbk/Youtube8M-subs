00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
because Connor thought that the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.060 
because Connor thought that the
punishment<00:03:41.670> of<00:03:42.180> throwing<00:03:42.750> him<00:03:42.930> out<00:03:43.070> didn't

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
punishment of throwing him out didn't

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.670

fit<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.790> crime<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.120> actually<00:03:45.810> i<00:03:46.019> agree<00:03:46.650> with

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
fit the crime and actually i agree with

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.009 
fit the crime and actually i agree with
Connor<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.340> think<00:03:47.790> for<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.000> first<00:03:48.269> offense<00:03:48.720> it

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
Connor I think for a first offense it

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.380 
Connor I think for a first offense it
didn't<00:03:49.560> fit<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.980> crime<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:50.760> for<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:50.970> second

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
didn't fit the crime but for a second

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.990 
didn't fit the crime but for a second
offense<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.840> would<00:03:51.959> however<00:03:52.549> he<00:03:53.549> didn't<00:03:53.850> give

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
offense it would however he didn't give

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.610 
offense it would however he didn't give
up<00:03:54.180> give<00:03:54.390> me<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.570> chance<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.049> do<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.470> he's

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
up give me a chance to do that so he's

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.420 
up give me a chance to do that so he's
left<00:03:55.890> anything

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
left anything

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.330
