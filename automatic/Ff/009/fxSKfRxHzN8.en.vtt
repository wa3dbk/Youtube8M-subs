00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
the Sigma e25 we're gonna dip into some

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.609 
the Sigma e25 we're gonna dip into some
water<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.179> grab<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:23.600> color<00:01:23.840> tempered<00:01:24.410> and

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
we're gonna be blending this into our

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.660 
we're gonna be blending this into our
speed<00:01:26.630> I<00:01:26.900> did<00:01:27.380> find<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.979> matte<00:01:28.220> shuttles

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
speed I did find that the matte shuttles

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.370 
speed I did find that the matte shuttles
were<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.880> little<00:01:29.090> bit<00:01:29.329> more<00:01:29.540> harder<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.170> blend

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
were a little bit more harder to blend

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.950 
were a little bit more harder to blend
so<00:01:31.159> I<00:01:31.520> don't<00:01:31.820> recommend<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.299> matte<00:01:32.509> shadows

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
so I don't recommend the matte shadows

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.319 
so I don't recommend the matte shadows
being<00:01:33.200> used<00:01:33.680> with<00:01:33.920> water<00:01:34.189> but<00:01:34.909> still

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
being used with water but still

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.210 
being used with water but still
nonetheless<00:01:35.689> they<00:01:36.170> could<00:01:36.350> be<00:01:36.560> blended<00:01:37.040> it

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
nonetheless they could be blended it

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.889 
nonetheless they could be blended it
just<00:01:37.430> saves<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.729> little<00:01:37.970> bit<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.210> more<00:01:38.420> time<00:01:38.689> to

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
just saves a little bit of more time to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.830 
just saves a little bit of more time to
blend<00:01:39.110> those<00:01:39.259> shadows<00:01:39.649> now

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.050 

now<00:01:45.840> dipping<00:01:46.289> that<00:01:46.320> Sigma<00:01:46.829> e55<00:01:47.189> we're<00:01:47.969> gonna

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
now dipping that Sigma e55 we're gonna

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.359 
now dipping that Sigma e55 we're gonna
go<00:01:48.329> into<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> color<00:01:48.930> called<00:01:49.259> quartz<00:01:49.740> which<00:01:50.219> is

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
go into the color called quartz which is

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.490 
go into the color called quartz which is

could have used this one for all over

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.810 
could have used this one for all over
the<00:01:54.390> lid<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.590> all<00:01:55.710> works<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.429> got<00:01:56.640> to
