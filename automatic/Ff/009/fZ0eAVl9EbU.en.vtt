make<00:00:03.629> one<00:00:03.659> of<00:00:03.870> these<00:00:04.110> because<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.859> ever<00:00:05.190> had

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
make one of these because I ever had

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.829 
make one of these because I ever had
that<00:00:05.609> many<00:00:05.819> views<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.390> thought<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.810> know

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
that many views and I thought you know

that many views and I thought you know
the<00:00:07.049> point<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.290> me<00:00:07.379> doing<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:07.890> like<00:00:08.340> I

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
the point of me doing this is so like I

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.080 
the point of me doing this is so like I
can<00:00:09.809> then<00:00:10.019> tell<00:00:10.920> people<00:00:11.219> about<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.580> the
