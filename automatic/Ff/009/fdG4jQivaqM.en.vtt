inches so another world's biggest screen

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.160 
inches so another world's biggest screen
but<00:01:31.240> you'll<00:01:31.420> remember<00:01:31.540> this<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.960> the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
but you'll remember this is the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.460 
but you'll remember this is the
blackberry<00:01:32.950> with<00:01:33.250> a<00:01:33.280> qwerty<00:01:33.550> keypad<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.470> it

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
blackberry with a qwerty keypad and it

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.510 
blackberry with a qwerty keypad and it
has<00:01:35.680> got<00:01:36.010> a<00:01:36.040> resolution<00:01:36.610> of<00:01:36.760> 720<00:01:37.660> x<00:01:37.870> 720<00:01:38.800> so

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
has got a resolution of 720 x 720 so

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.610 
has got a resolution of 720 x 720 so
that<00:01:39.730> gives<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:39.940> a<00:01:39.970> pixel<00:01:40.330> density<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.660> 328

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
that gives you a pixel density of 328

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.590 
that gives you a pixel density of 328
pixels<00:01:42.490> per<00:01:42.640> inch<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:42.850> very<00:01:43.210> high<00:01:43.420> resolution

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600

64 gigabytes with a memory card you can

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.020 
64 gigabytes with a memory card you can
see<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.320> little<00:02:56.950> pad<00:02:57.250> there<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.610> don't<00:02:57.850> think

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
see that little pad there I don't think

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.220 
see that little pad there I don't think
that's<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.239> wireless<00:02:58.660> charger<00:02:59.020> I<00:02:59.080> think

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
that's the wireless charger I think

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.290 
that's the wireless charger I think
that's<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.470> NFC<00:03:00.070> yeah<00:03:00.820> that's<00:03:01.120> why<00:03:01.239> this

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
that's the NFC yeah that's why this

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.990 
that's the NFC yeah that's why this
phone<00:03:01.570> has<00:03:01.780> got<00:03:01.959> NFC<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.860> usual<00:03:03.100> 4G<00:03:03.850> LTE

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000

schwartz micro-hdmi at the top yeah at
the<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:34.300> far<00:03:34.480> top<00:03:34.660> you've<00:03:34.840> got<00:03:34.870> three<00:03:35.200> and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
the to the far top you've got three and

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.930 
the to the far top you've got three and
a<00:03:35.320> half<00:03:35.350> mil<00:03:35.650> headphone<00:03:35.980> jack<00:03:36.220> microphone

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
a half mil headphone jack microphone

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.080 
a half mil headphone jack microphone
ports<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:38.530> or<00:03:38.920> not<00:03:39.160> ports<00:03:39.520> but<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.880> actual

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
ports and or not ports but the actual

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.430 
ports and or not ports but the actual
microphones<00:03:40.450> themselves<00:03:40.870> are<00:03:41.020> just<00:03:41.050> there

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
microphones themselves are just there

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.500 
microphones themselves are just there
and<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.800> lot<00:03:42.070> power<00:03:42.430> key<00:03:42.760> just<00:03:43.090> there<00:03:43.300> so

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
and a lot power key just there so

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.910 
and a lot power key just there so
hopefully<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:44.020> is<00:03:44.110> got<00:03:44.260> some<00:03:44.440> battery<00:03:44.830> in

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
hopefully this is got some battery in

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:53.250 
hopefully this is got some battery in
there<00:03:45.070> let's<00:03:45.280> find<00:03:45.460> out<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:52.050> typically<00:03:53.050> it

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
there let's find out and typically it

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.420 
there let's find out and typically it
hasn't<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:53.710> I'm<00:03:53.770> gonna<00:03:53.860> put<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.040> on<00:03:54.190> charge

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
hasn't so I'm gonna put this on charge

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.720 
hasn't so I'm gonna put this on charge
and<00:03:55.000> then<00:03:55.090> I'll<00:03:55.240> be<00:03:55.450> right<00:03:55.690> back<00:03:55.870> okay<00:03:56.610> so<00:03:57.610> I've

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
and then I'll be right back okay so I've

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.340 
and then I'll be right back okay so I've
got<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.910> very<00:03:58.060> small<00:03:58.240> amount<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.780> battery<00:03:59.200> life

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
got a very small amount of battery life

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.520 
got a very small amount of battery life
left<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:01.000> we<00:04:01.180> can<00:04:01.390> quickly<00:04:01.840> have<00:04:02.260> a<00:04:02.320> little

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
left so we can quickly have a little

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.590 
left so we can quickly have a little
tour<00:04:02.800> around<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:03.070> phone<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.180> is<00:04:04.210> only<00:04:04.480> a

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
tour around the phone so this is only a

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.310 
tour around the phone so this is only a

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
BlackBerry's own app world so let's have

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.550 
BlackBerry's own app world so let's have
a<00:04:17.110> quick<00:04:17.350> tour<00:04:17.709> round<00:04:17.980> so<00:04:18.489> if<00:04:18.850> we<00:04:19.030> look<00:04:19.390> at<00:04:19.989> say

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
a quick tour round so if we look at say

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.010 
a quick tour round so if we look at say
the<00:04:20.830> camera<00:04:21.010> for<00:04:21.280> example<00:04:21.730> and<00:04:22.720> for<00:04:22.930> that

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
the camera for example and for that

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.220 
the camera for example and for that
we'll<00:04:23.170> need<00:04:23.230> the<00:04:23.470> subject<00:04:23.980> so<00:04:24.070> we'll<00:04:24.520> just<00:04:24.550> put

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
we'll need the subject so we'll just put

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.200 
we'll need the subject so we'll just put
that<00:04:26.230> bike<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:26.890> down<00:04:27.100> there<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:27.790> let's<00:04:27.970> try

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
that bike just down there so let's try

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.980 
that bike just down there so let's try
it<00:04:28.330> out<00:04:31.980> so<00:04:32.980> once<00:04:33.250> it's<00:04:33.460> focused<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.660> can<00:04:34.810> take

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
it out so once it's focused you can take

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.950 
it out so once it's focused you can take
the<00:04:35.110> foot<00:04:35.340> several<00:04:36.340> photographs<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:37.660> let's

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
the foot several photographs so let's

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.460 
the foot several photographs so let's
try<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.470> go<00:04:38.560> from<00:04:38.710> a<00:04:38.860> different<00:04:39.190> angle<00:04:40.470> there

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
try and go from a different angle there

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.000 
try and go from a different angle there
we<00:04:41.560> go<00:04:42.090> it<00:04:43.090> has<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.330> be<00:04:43.390> focused<00:04:43.780> first<00:04:44.010> and

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
we go it has to be focused first and

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.320 
we go it has to be focused first and
then<00:04:45.190> it<00:04:45.310> will<00:04:45.430> let<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.640> take<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.940> pictures

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
then it will let you take the pictures

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.990 
then it will let you take the pictures
so<00:04:46.870> if<00:04:46.960> we<00:04:47.020> will<00:04:47.200> review<00:04:47.410> these<00:04:47.560> pictures<00:04:47.919> back
