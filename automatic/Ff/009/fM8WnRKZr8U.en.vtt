00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.260
 error launching gta 5 erroneous image 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.390
 bink2w64.dll is either not intended for 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.550
 run under windows either 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.890
 contains an error at all here this one 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.970
 The picture is the quintessence of computer 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.449
 knowledge of the current digital generation in 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.279
 The first is a picture of the monitor screen 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.329
 made on a smartphone through the application 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 in contact with 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.880
 this we so screenshots do it all 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.130
 equal to glands removed through the ass 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.140
 and this is not an isolated case of shkolota 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.870
 more than half of the screenshots send me 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.060
 It is in the form of photos on the mobile phone problem 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.000
 not that shkolota doesn't know or not 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.030
 can it just excusable problem 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.460
 in the fact that it does not soar them they do not want 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.550
 know anything learn to make beautiful 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.610
 screenshots for example suits them 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.450
 own ignorance and precisely this 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.500
 it makes me mad 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.990
 secondly, the wrong gta 5 file is running . 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.510
 although I already broke my tongue exactly 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.760
 file must run the game but in this 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.440
 particular case it is excusable so 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.570
 as in the background you can see that in the game 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.310
 there are generally few suspicious files and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.530
 just did not appear here 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.020
 launched a feast and crawled under the arm 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.200
 After all, not a torrent with the game, but only 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.050
 update here you see the folder weighs only 400 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.170
 megabyte and don't know by my very first 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.720
 three-dimensional gta 3 it took more a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.080
 here gta 5 move 400 megabytes trying 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.290
 fit and we do not bother us at all 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.960
 it leads to never we proudly yell 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.620
 we did everything according to instructions in all common 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.350
 triumph noise for the flag and still nothing 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.600
 doesn't work if you did everything by 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 instructions and would download the desired torrent 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.970
 from my group the folder with the game you have 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.860
 It would look something like this, and here it is 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.470
 This file bink2w64.dll drl for which 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.860
 the system would not have to go into the folder with 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.860
 windows
