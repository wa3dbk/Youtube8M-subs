00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 yo everyone i'm enjoying this 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.220
 back to make this video 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.020
 explanatory on why is there 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.849
 could take complete on my channel needs 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.670
 have not made a video since three 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.320
 four months or even if it's not over 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.289
 then an exit to make simple the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.330
 reason it's the spidart my chain is 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.039
 mostly composite spidart and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.430
 so much at the beginning, well, I can do it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.220
 an image yes we filming I wanted the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.810
 do it in one hour two hours and then go 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.789
 as and when it fades time club 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.360
 and today I got to a point 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.700
 where now when I make an image I 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.160
 do more about two hours lived on a 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.760
 metal evening that over several days to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.680
 to be talented that I end up with 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.510
 several video files that can 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.559
 sometimes last an hour and then 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.480
 another 1h that I take another 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.129
 minor with three other two that's 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.920
 to say that I would have liked to have gone from 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.510
 empty map saved when creating the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.420
 mark because I texture when I 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.250
 the light then continue and she 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.750
 resume video when I 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.730
 already passed all the strict characters to 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.949
 standards too much and that it annoys me 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.770
 enormously located that I find video to 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.280
 because of that just because 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.500
 the fact that yes I spread myself too creation 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.990
 so good and I thought a little about the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.729
 the idea is what I continue to suffer from 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.110
 this way in the name because the exchange 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.680
 video is what I'm trying to do other 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.820
 thing and I have another idea 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.490
 clearly if the player is narcissistic 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.610
 at my level I think that 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.350
 it's really only in profitable matter 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.229
 but good and more interesting to 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.790
 start making videos where I you 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.490
 just watch me breathe 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.830
 just demonstrates how I do that while 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.570
 the idea gül simply made you 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.340
 why do character 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.929
 so why was I stand 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.429
 to the zouk and the composition of the image 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.869
 why is it forced to 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.179
 what is the link between this image this 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.130
 picture you explain the creation of the 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.890
 anecdotes show you the rails of for 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.110
 that ryd wade and we'll say that to 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.429
 French you see there you sting a 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.709
 little how did I do that than that 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.590
 I did and again just like me I 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.729
 so do them good frankly I thought 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.410
 not be a good idea especially for 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.360
 those who are interested in the 3d ones 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.549
 who want to get down to 3d what's 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.239
 goes to silverstone and graphics 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:18.160
 good I will ask you to tell me what 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.620
 you think about it in the comments 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.420
 so otherwise I had other 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.340
 generates a lot of others now I 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.130
 have a little near two other others 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.810
 video ideas for some one will say 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.330
 furnished my channel because I count 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.160
 really do not leave her gl chain and 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.709
 kamla for two years and I think I 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.299
 do you like a lot of work on it and even if 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.290
 I'm very active and I honestly 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.690
 not want to delete it so both 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.790
 the first ideas that would make 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.310
 put me back to the template so that 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.540
 free storms for the most part by 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.640
 example here I 'm afraid to model a 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.920
 guardian so the fish there a point 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.030
 common it will be good bah I prefer you 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.120
 download free 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.290
 according to the sphere already paying good I 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.329
 will resume the example of 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.370
 rather to do at the game he had there 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:11.540
 not long ago started making babies 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:16.370
 the shoots and yes he exhibits having so 5 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.930
 euros good the pictures are low there are the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.980
 sticks and links to his idea that it must 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.189
 I never had to start playing 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.060
 directly but precisely because of the 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.980
 that is 5 euros 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.109
 we totally fuck her race 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.659
 clearly clearly in songs of the 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.519
 group like this in him it's expensive we 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.799
 use it must do less blah 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.900
 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah because me 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.849
 I tell myself that if it's for 5 euros 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.530
 a budget image in the process of rallying 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.550
 then 60 euros the same production 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.870
 system 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.550
 even if we take this scale it's worth 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.160
 clearly not going to be more 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.240
 down at that moment if I leave I know 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.960
 scream on just hand over 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.840
 and I play them by declaring yes finally 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.070
 so all that to say that the idea this 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.100
 would be right to start doing some 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.980
 complex and that is match tarbes in 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.390
 free or even totally free 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.550
 because that's what I told you if you 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.590
 fidelity dad the intruction maybe not 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.250
 given my ride my character is 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.270
 maybe not give it 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.630
 and then here and finally the last idea 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.519
 the loss a little weird there 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.470
 people need advice from advice launches 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.510
 even doing tests that would be 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.550
 start doing some tmx my 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.520
 chain so yes good I know that my 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.020
 thermography chain and images from 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.700
 very early in the very beginning I thought 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.310
 Monday spyder introductory to the five 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.590
 body and I did very little minecraft 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:42.530
 I think I had to make two wins 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:44.720
 three dangers and I thought about doing a 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.110
 little bit of gaming on it then j no 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.730
 of full gaming gip started doing 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.280
 like the big tubes hours to do 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.700
 of explain it but considering making 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.290
 small series 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.480
 I think I can tell you 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.800
 clearly there is normally a series 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.570
 to big n who is in preparation 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.400
 will it be done hopefully and 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.680
 because I think it's close 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.720
 frankly please you even if at the base 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.270
 happened at the espionage chain m 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.300
 so I say good to you if you had to do 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.000
 a series on minecraft adventure tracking 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.310
 we will say why not do others 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.570
 sets again and see what that gives 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:23.360
 so is only minecraft that has 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.380
 started to get drunk but I take I 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.730
 have less fun playing in the 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.100
 meaning where there are fewer game modes a 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.080
 little tested a lot of things 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.669
 maybe not everything but it is enormously 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.090
 claude is called mini games that 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.160
 interess me 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.080
 finally so rather than making point 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.510
 but kraft why not do other 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.870
 games and especially think of place 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.500
 religious 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.540
 I see this in fact I have not 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.580
 other ideas 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:51.740
 so yeah father dsp museum for my dear 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.600
 to make cash made a choice 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.970
 interesting but not catching you 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.910
 the game of little things 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.169
 story to finally say on this I think 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.729
 that my dog ​​is moaning 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.530
 because I 'm from this hard video 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.419
 too long it is already 7 minutes 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.820
 30 pretty much so I'll leave you 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.430
 I invite you clearly frankly 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.440
 a lot a site does not mean anything a 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.270
 posted comments give your opinion 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.640
 a very often thought of the idea is this 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.570
 that I should do what I said where 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.160
 should not I do that 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.510
 I will continue to be done by then 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.190
 knowing that I will take less and 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.750
 less pleasure 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.890
 finally on this I leave you and I you 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.890
 say goodbye and the project must
