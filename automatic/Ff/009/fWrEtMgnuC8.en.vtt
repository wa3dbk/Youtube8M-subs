00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.700
 the fire salamander is very strong 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.220
 hardwood forests bound 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.010
 he lives with preference on the slopes of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.679
 in which he hides abundantly 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.379
 takes place 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930
 what is going on through the picture that is 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.050
 of course no fire salamander but 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.039
 a mountain or alu salamander that exist 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.769
 not with us but in the old ones 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.060
 but here we are right again 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.410
 are especially popular for 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 feuersalamander vast 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.840
 hiding blogs and keeping 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.329
 overgrown with moss or leaves 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.190
 are covered 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.700
 if you want to observe fire salamander 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.219
 then this is wet rainy 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.370
 weather with temperatures over ten degrees 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.629
 Celsius in the evening possible because 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.000
 they are nocturnal 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.910
 they also breathe through the skin 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.090
 That's why non- express countries are there 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.940
 stage are they move on 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.939
 found very sluggish and while date fixed 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.460
 delivered but nature has them 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.060
 Gland glands give the poison 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.330
 they can spray salamandra 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.939
 fell against fox and or caps like 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.670
 many animals showed fire salamander these 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.259
 Toxicity through a yellow wall 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.860
 with signal effect 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.780
 which is also effective for this reason 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.909
 you should not salamander before 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.650
 touch 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.380
 He is also endangered in Bavaria 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.790
 classified and thus stands on the red 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.560
 list and nature conservation 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.590
 every fire salamander has one 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.899
 individual drawing he is living 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.170
 you can not lose it long 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.350
 individual animals therefore over years 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.140
 identify 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.030
 it is also in our human world 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.920
 from the completely signal colors for the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.469
 to use individual areas 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.430
 this is especially true of parade protection 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.630
 or so functions too 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.390
 today was hiding the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.140
 fire salamander and you have to wait until 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.700
 He's out of his hiding place 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.610
 Fire salamanders are nocturnal 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.260
 they can not be well targeted 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.930
 with the food as well as with her 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.970
 sense of smell the salamander gets through 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.850
 Warm temperatures are getting more agile and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.709
 brave in the spring in damp in it 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.590
 the first females come out of theirs 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.270
 hide and climb downhill 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.970
 to bring their young to the world 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.519
 they have about eight months 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.360
 During the period of time it kept the mating 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.040
 usually takes place during the summer months 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.920
 The seed of the male can do that 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.769
 Retain female and several years 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.069
 decide when you ova yourself 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.920
 fertilize before bringing salamander 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.480
 live the young to the world 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.440
 these and puppies with clean water 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.980
 bear 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.170
 unlike the old salamander of 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.920
 boy with fully trained flowers to 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.590
 world come 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.870
 and therefore he does not need blood for certain 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.739
 the fire salamander has a certain 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.390
 look up because the boys would come 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.930
 lungs develops late 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.820
 you only have to follow the sound 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.640
 the bubbling springs with oxygen 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.000
 Enriched in water are preferred 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.280
 places in the rhine park you can especially 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.430
 Good the birth of young fire salamander 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.470
 observe 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.400
 while still giving birth or shortly 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.100
 after that the ila bursts after the beginning of the 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.030
 Production of salamander with the outside 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.030
 would come to breathe 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.540
 the boys are at birth 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.810
 two and a half to three cm 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.430
 You can give birth to females from may to 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.430
 to watch in the summer 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.270
 after that give birth to many 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.290
 Days or weeks can extend 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.979
 uphill again 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:03.050
 and that can be up to 54 meters the way 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:06.800
 a fire salamander to his place of residence 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.440
 the return migration to the back lives 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.500
 Winterquartier is a tedious thing 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.440
 the temperatures have fallen sharply 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:23.990
 the leaves fall as well 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:26.120
 turned in dingle request the way 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.500
 right next to the stove is not 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.500
 live area posted 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.870
 the first snow fell too 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.310
 Fire salamanders like to run up 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.120
 a wide cushioned with leaves 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.300
 Street 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.229
 the leaves are yellow and the salamander 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.229
 well camouflaged 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:07.030
 Fire salamanders are up in nature 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.520
 20 years old in england park are the 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:13.480
 conditions ideal 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:16.180
 whether deadwood area blogs loading the 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.790
 ground cold air springs or waters 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.730
 to spawn everything is there 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.810
 also the former gen2 is one 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.810
 been typical slightly
