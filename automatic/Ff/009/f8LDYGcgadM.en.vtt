00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
shooting now we've reduced that to 90

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.830 
shooting now we've reduced that to 90
seconds<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.670> that's<00:03:47.790> through<00:03:48.300> creating<00:03:48.750> a

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
seconds and that's through creating a

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.230 
seconds and that's through creating a
true<00:03:49.020> MMO<00:03:49.530> style<00:03:49.830> launcher<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.460> the<00:03:50.880> beginning

true MMO style launcher in the beginning

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.990 
true MMO style launcher in the beginning
so<00:03:51.450> it's<00:03:51.660> only<00:03:51.750> one<00:03:52.050> click<00:03:52.290> you're<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:53.000> and

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
so it's only one click you're in and

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.430 
so it's only one click you're in and
we've<00:03:54.180> optimized<00:03:54.660> all<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.110> loading

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
we've optimized all of the loading

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.250 
we've optimized all of the loading
around<00:03:55.740> that<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.100> then<00:03:56.760> as<00:03:56.880> well<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.240> all<00:03:58.200> of

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
around that and then as well as all of

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.870 
around that and then as well as all of
the<00:03:58.710> loading<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.310> middle<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.760> game

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
the loading in the middle of the game

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.170 
the loading in the middle of the game
we've<00:04:00.480> spent<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:00.990> up<00:04:01.110> considerably<00:04:01.710> so

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
we've spent that up considerably so

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.980 
we've spent that up considerably so
pretty<00:04:03.180> much<00:04:03.330> loading<00:04:03.660> throughout<00:04:03.870> the

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
pretty much loading throughout the

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.780 
pretty much loading throughout the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
entirety of the dust client is much much

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.320 
entirety of the dust client is much much
faster<00:04:06.030> now

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
faster now

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.630

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
really part of the core concept to how

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.910 
really part of the core concept to how
we<00:05:00.610> run<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:00.910> franchise<00:05:01.390> so<00:05:01.690> with<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.770> EVE

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
we run a franchise so with the EVE

we run a franchise so with the EVE
universe<00:05:02.950> we<00:05:03.550> have<00:05:03.640> all<00:05:03.760> these<00:05:03.940> different

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
universe we have all these different

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.880 
universe we have all these different
experiences<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.140> plug<00:05:05.350> into<00:05:05.560> it<00:05:05.770> which

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
experiences that plug into it which

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.740 
experiences that plug into it which
we've<00:05:06.040> discussed<00:05:06.400> at<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.760> keynote<00:05:07.300> in<00:05:07.600> here

but we wanted to create a new experience

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.950 
but we wanted to create a new experience
that's<00:05:45.580> more<00:05:45.820> accessible<00:05:46.330> and<00:05:46.450> what's<00:05:46.840> more

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
that's more accessible and what's more

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.650 
that's more accessible and what's more
accessible<00:05:47.380> than<00:05:47.410> the<00:05:47.590> shooter<00:05:47.860> in<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.940> video

game<00:05:49.720> arena<00:05:50.200> you<00:05:50.680> know<00:05:50.800> so<00:05:51.190> we<00:05:51.340> so<00:05:51.640> the<00:05:52.180> way<00:05:52.270> we

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
game arena you know so we so the way we

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.030 
game arena you know so we so the way we
look<00:05:52.540> at<00:05:52.720> this<00:05:53.080> analogy<00:05:53.470> is<00:05:53.650> sort<00:05:53.830> of<00:05:53.860> like<00:05:53.979> a

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
look at this analogy is sort of like a

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.710 
look at this analogy is sort of like a
pool<00:05:54.280> and<00:05:54.520> at<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.180> shallow<00:05:55.390> end<00:05:55.450> of<00:05:55.600> the<00:05:55.660> pool

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
pool and at the shallow end of the pool

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.659 
pool and at the shallow end of the pool
we<00:05:55.990> want<00:05:56.169> it<00:05:56.229> to<00:05:56.290> be<00:05:56.380> really<00:05:56.530> shallow<00:05:56.830> we<00:05:57.430> want

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
we want it to be really shallow we want

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.370 
we want it to be really shallow we want
anyone<00:05:58.330> who<00:05:58.419> plays<00:05:58.630> shooter<00:05:58.930> just<00:05:59.140> to<00:05:59.200> be<00:05:59.320> able

anyone who plays shooter just to be able

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.080 
anyone who plays shooter just to be able
to<00:05:59.560> jump<00:06:00.040> in<00:06:00.190> say<00:06:00.400> hey<00:06:00.520> this<00:06:00.700> is<00:06:00.850> a<00:06:00.880> cool

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
to jump in say hey this is a cool

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.480 
to jump in say hey this is a cool
free-to-play<00:06:01.750> sci-fi<00:06:02.290> shooter<00:06:02.500> and<00:06:02.800> just

free-to-play sci-fi shooter and just

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.070 
free-to-play sci-fi shooter and just
jump<00:06:03.700> in<00:06:03.820> have<00:06:04.060> fun<00:06:04.240> and<00:06:04.360> sort<00:06:04.540> of<00:06:04.630> intuitively

jump in have fun and sort of intuitively
know<00:06:05.320> how<00:06:05.740> to<00:06:05.800> run<00:06:05.979> around<00:06:06.130> shoot<00:06:06.520> stuff<00:06:06.870> so<00:06:07.870> we

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
know how to run around shoot stuff so we

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.960 
know how to run around shoot stuff so we
continue<00:06:08.919> to<00:06:09.040> strive<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.520> make<00:06:09.640> the<00:06:09.760> shallow

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
continue to strive to make the shallow

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.909 
continue to strive to make the shallow
end<00:06:10.060> of<00:06:10.210> the<00:06:10.270> pool<00:06:10.330> shallower<00:06:10.840> but<00:06:11.680> then<00:06:11.830> of

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
end of the pool shallower but then of

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:12.990 
end of the pool shallower but then of
course<00:06:12.130> there's<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.400> deep<00:06:12.610> end<00:06:12.729> of<00:06:12.880> the<00:06:12.910> pool

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
course there's the deep end of the pool

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.210 
course there's the deep end of the pool
which<00:06:13.390> arguably<00:06:13.750> is<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.260> deepest<00:06:14.650> of<00:06:14.830> any

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
which arguably is the deepest of any

which arguably is the deepest of any
shooter<00:06:15.580> out<00:06:15.610> there<00:06:15.760> and<00:06:16.120> it<00:06:16.419> will<00:06:16.510> continue

shooter out there and it will continue

to get deeper and deeper as we continue
