towards<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> rope<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.319> go<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
towards the rope you just go on the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.890 
towards the rope you just go on the
right-hand<00:02:11.489> side<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.569> what<00:02:12.720> would

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
right-hand side this is what would

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
right-hand side this is what would
happen<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.410> could

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
on the rope there's a jade over here too

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.869 
on the rope there's a jade over here too
if<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.709> miss<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.069> one<00:02:17.280> you're<00:02:17.489> really

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.410 
before or after you cut the bridge it
doesn't<00:02:36.659> really<00:02:36.750> matter<00:02:36.989> on<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:38.420> left-hand

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420

keep dropping down and as you can see
i'm<00:02:55.829> still<00:02:55.859> dropping<00:02:56.669> down<00:02:56.790> that's<00:02:57.090> how<00:02:57.209> far

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
i'm still dropping down that's how far

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.479

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
you're about to cross the chasm as you

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.560 
you're about to cross the chasm as you
can<00:04:11.290> see<00:04:11.940> Sully's<00:04:12.940> over<00:04:13.180> there<00:04:13.360> on<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.510> other

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
can see Sully's over there on the other

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.890 
can see Sully's over there on the other
side<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:15.430> basically<00:04:15.610> have<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:15.880> get<00:04:16.030> up<00:04:16.180> and

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
side you basically have to get up and

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.890 
side you basically have to get up and
get<00:04:17.260> ready<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.530> jump<00:04:17.770> don't<00:04:18.070> jump<00:04:18.190> yet<00:04:18.580> though

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
get ready to jump don't jump yet though

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.500 
get ready to jump don't jump yet though
because<00:04:19.900> there's<00:04:20.140> actually<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.560> treasure<00:04:20.859> in

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
because there's actually a treasure in

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.750 
because there's actually a treasure in
behind<00:04:22.510> hiding<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.940> don't<00:04:25.120> jump<00:04:25.360> too<00:04:25.570> quickly

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
behind hiding so don't jump too quickly

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.730 
behind hiding so don't jump too quickly
so<00:04:27.760> Jade<00:04:28.090> there<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:28.780> then<00:04:29.110> you<00:04:29.230> jump<00:04:29.500> across

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
so Jade there and then you jump across

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.960 
so Jade there and then you jump across
and<00:04:30.310> then<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.460> push<00:04:30.700> past<00:04:30.970> Sully<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:32.040> down<00:04:33.040> at

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
and then you push past Sully and down at

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
and then you push past Sully and down at
the<00:04:34.030> bottom<00:04:34.090> of<00:04:34.330> these<00:04:34.420> rocks<00:04:34.690> there's<00:04:34.930> a

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
the bottom of these rocks there's a

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.130 
the bottom of these rocks there's a
photo<00:04:35.230> that<00:04:35.320> you<00:04:35.440> take<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.120> struggled<00:04:37.960> for<00:04:38.110> a

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
photo that you take so I struggled for a

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.020 
photo that you take so I struggled for a
little<00:04:38.260> while<00:04:38.410> trying<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.770> get<00:04:39.340> into<00:04:39.490> position

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
little while trying to get into position

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.140 
little while trying to get into position
but<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:41.110> is<00:04:41.230> literally<00:04:41.530> right<00:04:41.950> after<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:42.880> drop

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
but it is literally right after you drop

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.230 
but it is literally right after you drop
down<00:04:44.310> take<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.340> picture<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.730> two<00:04:45.760> waterfalls

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
down take a picture the two waterfalls

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.060 
down take a picture the two waterfalls
and<00:04:48.090> voila<00:04:49.440> I'm<00:04:50.440> going<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.680> believe<00:04:50.890> there's

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
and voila I'm going to believe there's

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.150 
and voila I'm going to believe there's
only<00:04:51.220> two<00:04:51.670> treasures<00:04:52.270> left<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.900> they<00:04:53.890> take

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
only two treasures left and they take

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.920 
only two treasures left and they take
place<00:04:54.400> right<00:04:54.700> at<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.910> very<00:04:54.940> end<00:04:55.420> instead<00:04:55.840> of

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
place right at the very end instead of

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.090 
place right at the very end instead of
going<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.290> right<00:04:56.380> hand<00:04:56.620> side<00:04:56.710> which<00:04:56.980> you

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
going to the right hand side which you

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.920 
going to the right hand side which you
would<00:04:57.220> take<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.760> get<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.210> two-headed

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
would take to get to the two-headed

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.620 
would take to get to the two-headed
snake<00:04:59.230> statues<00:05:00.160> or<00:05:00.190> whatever<00:05:00.550> you'll<00:05:01.450> take

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
snake statues or whatever you'll take

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.900 
snake statues or whatever you'll take
the<00:05:01.750> left<00:05:01.960> and<00:05:02.320> then<00:05:03.010> there's<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.310> tall<00:05:04.060> grass

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
the left and then there's a tall grass

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.180 
the left and then there's a tall grass
you<00:05:06.910> cut<00:05:07.120> it<00:05:07.210> down<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.780> then<00:05:08.140> there's<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.530> jade

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
you cut it down and then there's a jade

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.880 
you cut it down and then there's a jade
behind<00:05:09.640> there<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:09.880> believe<00:05:10.410> there's<00:05:11.410> not<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.620> jit

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
behind there I believe there's not a jit

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.460 
behind there I believe there's not a jit
is<00:05:12.130> there<00:05:12.280> Jade<00:05:12.550> yet<00:05:13.060> as<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.240> jade<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:13.780> then<00:05:14.350> the

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
is there Jade yet as a jade and then the

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.350 
is there Jade yet as a jade and then the
last<00:05:14.620> thing<00:05:14.860> is<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.160> photo<00:05:15.520> what<00:05:16.270> you're

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
last thing is the photo what you're

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.220 
last thing is the photo what you're
going<00:05:16.480> to<00:05:16.570> have<00:05:16.660> to<00:05:16.750> do<00:05:16.870> is<00:05:16.990> you're<00:05:17.050> going<00:05:17.170> to

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
the path back over

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.879 
the path back over
the<00:05:20.780> right<00:05:20.990> hand<00:05:21.110> side<00:05:21.259> which<00:05:21.650> is<00:05:21.680> where
