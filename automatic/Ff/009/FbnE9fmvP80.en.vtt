volume buttons it's going to test out
the<00:02:07.020> buttons<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:07.680> how<00:02:07.770> they<00:02:07.920> perform

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.990 

it<00:02:13.530> takes<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.860> little<00:02:14.040> bit<00:02:14.250> more<00:02:14.459> effort<00:02:14.610> than<00:02:14.790> I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
cuts or any kind of bad angles so that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.699 
cuts or any kind of bad angles so that
it<00:02:51.030> did<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.329> good<00:02:51.450> job<00:02:51.510> with<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:54.560> here<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.620> the

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
top the whole front is going to be

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:23.059 
top the whole front is going to be
exposed<00:03:17.340> but<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.450> do<00:03:18.600> have<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:21.470> case<00:03:22.470> raised

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
exposed but you do have the case raised

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.170 
exposed but you do have the case raised
above<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.519> screen<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.760> you're<00:03:26.910> going<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.060> be

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
above the screen so you're going to be

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.780 
above the screen so you're going to be
safe<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.599> put<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.870> on<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.230> flat<00:03:29.220> side<00:03:29.489> of<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
safe to put it on the flat side of the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.300 
safe to put it on the flat side of the
front<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.769> going<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:34.980> have<00:03:35.099> a<00:03:35.130> little

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
front and it is going to have a little

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.490 
front and it is going to have a little
bit<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.549> shock<00:03:35.880> absorption<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.810> just

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
bit of shock absorption to it just

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.550 
bit of shock absorption to it just
because<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.829> material<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.519> made<00:03:38.700> of

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
because of the material that is made of

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.589 
because of the material that is made of
and<00:03:40.760> some<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.880> things<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.120> like<00:03:42.239> about<00:03:42.299> this

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
and some of the things I like about this

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.930 
and some of the things I like about this
case<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.230> it's<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:44.400> doesn't<00:03:44.609> really<00:03:44.760> take

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
case is that it's it doesn't really take

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.879 
case is that it's it doesn't really take
away<00:03:45.150> from<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.419> design<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:46.019> iphone<00:03:46.680> the

so just a recap you're going to have

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.820 
so just a recap you're going to have
covers<00:04:04.930> for<00:04:05.860> your<00:04:06.040> volume<00:04:06.670> buttons<00:04:07.530> which<00:04:08.530> are

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
covers for your volume buttons which are

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.009 
covers for your volume buttons which are
not<00:04:09.069> as<00:04:09.310> easy<00:04:09.519> as<00:04:09.640> I<00:04:09.879> like<00:04:10.090> them<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.360> be<00:04:10.720> pressed

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
not as easy as I like them to be pressed

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.530 
not as easy as I like them to be pressed
and<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:12.220> power<00:04:12.430> button<00:04:12.640> is<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:13.000> same<00:04:13.209> as<00:04:13.390> the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
and the power button is the same as the

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.690 
and the power button is the same as the
volume<00:04:13.900> with<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.739> little<00:04:15.040> slight<00:04:15.310> difference

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
volume with a little slight difference

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.430 
volume with a little slight difference
in<00:04:15.819> pressure<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:19.209> case<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:19.810> raised<00:04:20.049> above<00:04:20.199> the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
in pressure the case is raised above the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.460 
in pressure the case is raised above the
phone<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.459> little<00:04:21.669> bit<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.660> there's<00:04:23.260> not<00:04:23.440> that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
phone a little bit and there's not that

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.629 
phone a little bit and there's not that
much<00:04:23.710> play<00:04:25.830> when<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:26.919> bend<00:04:27.130> this<00:04:27.250> back<00:04:27.490> and

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
much play when you bend this back and

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.120 
much play when you bend this back and
forth<00:04:27.729> so<00:04:28.350> you're<00:04:29.350> going<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.590> be<00:04:29.650> protected
