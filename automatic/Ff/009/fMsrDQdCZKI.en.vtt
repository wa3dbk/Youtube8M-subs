00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.600
 this season does not have to challenge honey from piauí the state expects a production 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.729
 record 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:10.729
 the small beekeepers are satisfied with the price 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.249
 in itaí new collection 77 beekeepers 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:21.130
 who coordinates the group is natanael there fair they care where 8 thousand hives and 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.079
 this one started the harvest we had a show here in the correct period 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.539
 where it was used mainly the flowering of quince tree that the main 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.489
 outside of the region when I fell rains in the quince period usually has 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.690
 a good policy of technicians and consultants of the bank foundation sebrae 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.920
 of Brazil 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.840
 accompanying the operation of mello houses are weekly meetings with 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.760
 information for beekeepers on handling and production 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.210
 but with the empowerment and street decision 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.160
 the beekeepers' organization to speak to the management practices of 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.920
 the bidding process make appropriate management 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.000
 quality of honey, improving productivity and especially 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.160
 are injured 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.270
 has a vision a concession lethality that beekeeping is a business thing 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.170
 that we say all the beekeeping activity and in this region of the northeastern semi-arid 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.970
 of family farming ' 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.110
 and the orientation of credits is very important for 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.510
 so we can focus on better productivity and also improve 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.520
 our quality said piauí expects this year a record production 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.490
 in the day 6 thousand tons of honey the double of the last year claudeci file to 12 years 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.250
 performs researches from the semiarid to agronomic the flowering of the vegetation 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.510
 low rainfall intensity 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.840
 contribute to the high production of honey in the piauí our dilution space 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.010
 days of light are 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.020
 and we can have a bigger production of honey because of this bee 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.540
 a solution having access to the latest action with more intensity 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.570
 The production of honey is coordinated by the house says 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.189
 center of semi-arid beekeeping cooperatives 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:18.680
 the activity involves 910 families that maintains 27,000 hives producing in 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.499
 nine municipalities 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.789
 two in ceará and seven in piauí 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:28.579
 all the honey produced in the cooperatives be taken to the industry in the house 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.859
 apis 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.979
 and four reais and twenty cents per 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:39.279
 formerly the man from the countryside in this region of Piauí sobradinho df only 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:44.969
 gives agriculture a difficult situation because of the scarcity of rain 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.929
 now with the creation of bees 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:49.759
 reality is another 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:55.039
 with the money of my your Jose gave a tidy in the house lacked furniture for 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.849
 tv room 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.860
 A brand new refrigerator I want for me is the best or percent concessions 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.619
 can have another time 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.549
 the retraction by who initiates region 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.549
 At most I had to go in. He commented to sell. 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.349
 and today with honey 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.759
 the people 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:21.719
 who names the region sells commitments he is able to distinguish between 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.739
 your exit occurred this week 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.329
 all local press 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.559
 and it is not only the production that has excited beekeepers the quality of honey 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:32.809
 it is also very good 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:37.179
 reporter marcos teixeira now speaks live from the quality lab of honey 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:39.499
 of the embrapa in teresina in piauí 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.020
 it was milestones good morning 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.020
 Have you learned how to distinguish between my good and bad? 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.799
 good morning do not look confess not to table a full analysis this is a 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.130
 difficult analysis 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.120
 because it's a physical-chemical analysis, that's why we came here 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.530
 to embrapa's lab but we are here with the agronomist bruno de 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.880
 almeida oliveira who coordinates the actions around here kate these of the world 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.599
 are made in my that the market exists 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:07.539
 motions 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:12.199
 seven physical-chemical tests these tests required as an obligation 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.559
 by the Ministry of Agriculture 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.680
 in all of them important with potentialities classifying the product 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.469
 to the external marketplace actress that you are there with which are 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.509
 we can highlight here for example instead of sugars 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:30.339
 apart from that determination of the moisture content prevents color from my we will show 

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:33.449
 this differentiation that attacked 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.789
 we work here 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.249
 we separate here two or more and the best is the ceste leading the color scale is 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.770
 very beautiful we have here two colors it did not take more clear it has another dilma 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.800
 darker 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.300
 but remember that there is no difference in quality that is independent of the color 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.810
 qualitative issues of the sock are preserved make it clear how much 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.629
 dark they all have the same qualitative pattern 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.009
 and tagged sequence questions that intrigue us that state is which causes 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.009
 it is lighter or darker 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.900
 it causes the same to be lighter darker 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.069
 for araujo 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.969
 much of the extension of the contracting of several factors the main one of them is 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.180
 the botanical origin of my 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.950
 or the flora that his visited silver produce this product 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:25.159
 in the report for example was quoted that the main move the Guarani antipathy 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.069
 in the backwoods of the piauí and the median sea 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.489
 this flowered for example is one that has characteristic of my clear 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:34.360
 Thank you very much for the information. 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.219
 lighter 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.830
 has a market value greater than my darkest 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.500
 Anapaula, thank you, Marques, good morning to you.
