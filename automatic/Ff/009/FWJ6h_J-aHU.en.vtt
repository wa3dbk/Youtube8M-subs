it's 10 10 8 and do a descending slide
and<00:02:22.319> then<00:02:22.799> stop<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.640> part<00:02:24.030> way<00:02:24.180> down<00:02:24.209> after

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
and then stop that part way down after

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.570 
and then stop that part way down after
four<00:02:24.930> or<00:02:24.959> five<00:02:25.019> frets<00:02:28.519> one<00:02:29.519> more<00:02:29.700> done<00:02:31.580> so

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
four or five frets one more done so

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.880 
four or five frets one more done so
right<00:02:32.760> around<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> fifth<00:02:33.209> fret<00:02:33.390> I'm<00:02:33.890> stopping

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
right around the fifth fret I'm stopping

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.229 
right around the fifth fret I'm stopping
that<00:02:35.010> slide<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.519> then<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.760> start<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.120> over

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
that slide and then you start it over

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.960 
that slide and then you start it over
again<00:02:38.930> then<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.049> go<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.350> tenth<00:02:40.560> fret<00:02:40.970> and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
again then you go to the tenth fret and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.120 
again then you go to the tenth fret and
then<00:02:42.840> he<00:02:43.440> does<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.910> no<00:02:44.910> it's<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.480> funky<00:02:45.870> type<00:02:46.080> feel

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.490 

you've<00:02:50.130> seen<00:02:50.370> these<00:02:50.849> fingers<00:02:51.380> because<00:02:52.380> I'm

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
you've seen these fingers because I'm

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.750 
you've seen these fingers because I'm
hitting<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.160> then<00:02:53.250> you've<00:02:53.400> seen<00:02:53.579> this

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
hitting that and then you've seen this

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.009 
hitting that and then you've seen this
probably<00:02:54.030> thinking<00:02:54.359> why<00:02:54.450> am<00:02:54.540> i<00:02:54.630> doing<00:02:54.870> that

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
probably thinking why am i doing that

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.750 
probably thinking why am i doing that
it's<00:02:55.109> because<00:02:55.290> I'm<00:02:55.440> muting<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:56.430> know<00:02:56.519> I'm<00:02:56.609> not

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
it's because I'm muting you know I'm not

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.880 
it's because I'm muting you know I'm not
muting<00:02:57.120> all<00:02:57.209> six<00:02:57.510> strings<00:02:57.690> but<00:02:58.109> it's<00:02:58.260> it's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
muting all six strings but it's it's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.289 
muting all six strings but it's it's
just<00:02:59.130> comfortable<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.670> do<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.940> on<00:03:00.090> mute<00:03:00.269> so

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
just comfortable to do that on mute so

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.050 
just comfortable to do that on mute so
mute<00:03:00.690> regardless<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:02.220> we<00:03:02.370> want<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:02.609> muting<00:03:02.940> as

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
mute regardless but we want a muting as

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.690 
mute regardless but we want a muting as
G<00:03:03.359> B<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.690> E<00:03:03.870> or<00:03:04.260> B<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.739> he<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.280> doesn't<00:03:05.579> matter

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
G B and E or B and he it doesn't matter

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.240 
G B and E or B and he it doesn't matter
a<00:03:05.790> mute<00:03:06.320> there<00:03:07.320> even<00:03:07.799> though<00:03:07.890> it's<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.160> a

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
a mute there even though it's just a

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.770 
a mute there even though it's just a
dead<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.609> sound<00:03:08.880> there<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.299> difference<00:03:09.660> if

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
dead and sound there is a difference if

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.699 
dead and sound there is a difference if
you're<00:03:09.900> going<00:03:10.109> and<00:03:11.040> going<00:03:12.019> on<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.079> few<00:03:13.350> strings

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
you're going and going on a few strings

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.460 
you're going and going on a few strings
so<00:03:13.950> just<00:03:14.190> aim<00:03:14.820> for<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> G<00:03:15.420> B<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.750> E<00:03:15.870> or<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.200> B

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
so just aim for the G B and E or the B

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.449 
so just aim for the G B and E or the B
and<00:03:16.590> E<00:03:18.170> but<00:03:19.170> that's<00:03:19.380> created<00:03:19.920> by<00:03:19.950> just<00:03:20.250> resting

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
and E but that's created by just resting

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.520 
and E but that's created by just resting
your<00:03:20.910> fingers<00:03:21.480> lightly<00:03:21.840> I'm<00:03:22.140> not<00:03:22.290> pushing

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
down there just resting on the string if

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.720 
down there just resting on the string if
I<00:03:25.079> don't<00:03:25.319> it's<00:03:25.500> gonna<00:03:25.560> go<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:29.250> then<00:03:29.579> go
