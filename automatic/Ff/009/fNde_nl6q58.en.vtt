00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.759
 As you can see it is neat 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.809

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:32.730

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.520
 me a slightly wet rag and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.520
 distribute that first differently 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:56.860

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.860
 Game covers it 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:15.460

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:58.370

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:59.810
 tidy towel from who 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.550

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.550

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:12.430
