the only one with the coding knowledge

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.950 
the only one with the coding knowledge
to<00:04:28.070> pull<00:04:28.310> this<00:04:28.460> off<00:04:28.669> yeah<00:04:29.060> right<00:04:29.360> plus<00:04:29.750> it's<00:04:29.900> a

three so that we do I like to do get
into<00:04:33.530> his<00:04:33.740> computer<00:04:33.889> once<00:04:34.490> I<00:04:34.610> can<00:04:34.729> get<00:04:34.850> in

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
into his computer once I can get in

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.250 
into his computer once I can get in
there<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.120> can<00:04:35.300> reverse<00:04:35.540> engineer<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:36.080> code

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
there I can reverse engineer the code

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.689 
there I can reverse engineer the code
once<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.680> have<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:37.040> code<00:04:37.190> base<00:04:37.310> i<00:04:37.430> can<00:04:37.550> destroy

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
once I have the code base i can destroy

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.770 
once I have the code base i can destroy
