00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
like this quad is very like nostalgic

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.619 
like this quad is very like nostalgic
for<00:05:27.379> me<00:05:27.529> is<00:05:27.830> about<00:05:27.979> only<00:05:28.279> 150<00:05:28.999> copies<00:05:29.210> of<00:05:29.509> this

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
for me is about only 150 copies of this

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.320 
for me is about only 150 copies of this
card<00:05:29.839> in<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.050> game<00:05:30.229> so<00:05:31.039> I<00:05:31.429> think<00:05:32.149> it's

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
card in the game so I think it's

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.260 
card in the game so I think it's
anywhere<00:05:32.599> from<00:05:32.779> 150<00:05:33.709> to<00:05:33.919> 200<00:05:34.490> copies<00:05:34.639> which

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
anywhere from 150 to 200 copies which

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.209 
anywhere from 150 to 200 copies which
makes<00:05:35.479> it<00:05:35.659> very<00:05:35.719> rare<00:05:36.229> and<00:05:36.439> very<00:05:36.529> hard<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:36.949> come

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219 
makes it very rare and very hard to come

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:39.669
