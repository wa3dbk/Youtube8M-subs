Oh! Pudge!

00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:14.545
Pudge! FXOpen!! Pudge!!

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:15.852
(Since Dragon_Knight has been killed) He scored.

00:00:15.852 --> 00:00:17.707
And then he moves in and hits!

00:00:17.707 --> 00:00:18.467

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:19.713
He made it~~

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:20.760

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.774

00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:27.876
And! Last shot!

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:30.285
Hello, Febby~ Can you do me a favor?

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.642
Q : Because you picked Pudge, 
we want to check your Meat Hook hit rate 
to follow a NSL tradition...

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.310
I don't think I hit that many times..

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.171
Q : For your information, the hit rate of S4L was 50%(15/30)

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.376
Oh, S4L?
I think I hit more than 50%.

00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:40.343
You can count.

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:42.090
NSL proudly presents

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.429
If you pick Pudge, weâ€™re always going to count

Bulba and MVP HOT6 talking after the match is over...

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.507
Q : You talked with Bulba for a long time. What was it about?

00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:41.988
First, we asked about

00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:45.269
What our weaknesses or even disadvantages were...

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:47.253
As you already know, they already participated at The International,

00:01:47.253 --> 00:01:49.300
and that means we need to learn a lot from them.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.561
Therefore, we discussed 
(about our weaknesses and solutions) with them.

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:53.225
Q : Are you confident enough to overcome tonight's loss 
and advance to the Grand Finals?

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:55.621
Of course we are!
There's no other teams that can advance over us.

00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:58.310
We are... the best team in Korea......

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.135
Even though we lost tonight, 
we will continue to be the best team in Korea.

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:08.031
Hi

00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:10.060
Q : According to online communities,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.734
you don't do the interviews with foreign players 
because your English is not fluent.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:15.672
Hahaha... English?

00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:18.999
I'll show you tonight.

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.095
My English is not bad~

00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:21.650
Hi, Everyone~ :)

00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:25.488
Interview before the second match

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.131
Dota2 Girl is here again.

00:02:37.884 --> 00:02:41.657
I'll ask if he knows any Korean players.

00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:44.078
You told me that you are confident with English...

00:02:44.078 --> 00:02:46.476
Well, I should have brought a pen.

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:48.756
I understood what he was saying, but translating...

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:52.562
While I was thinking about what I should next translate, he just kept talking.

00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:55.590
So I forgot what I was thinking about.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.781
Well, I did my best. I have no regrets.

00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:01.335
If I get one more chance,

00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:03.214
I will certainly bring a pen and write down

00:03:03.214 --> 00:03:06.049
so I can translate everything for you.

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.720
Bye~
