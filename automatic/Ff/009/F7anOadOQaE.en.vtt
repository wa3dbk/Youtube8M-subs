00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
several years and then finally the clip

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.000 
several years and then finally the clip
it<00:00:47.000> slipped<00:00:47.390> off<00:00:47.540> one<00:00:47.809> day<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:47.989> I<00:00:48.140> lost<00:00:48.379> it<00:00:48.619> so

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
it slipped off one day and I lost it so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.039 
it slipped off one day and I lost it so
I<00:00:49.040> saw<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.489> stainless<00:00:50.000> steel<00:00:50.030> one<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:50.629> picked

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
I saw the stainless steel one and picked

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:52.570 
I saw the stainless steel one and picked
it<00:00:51.170> up<00:00:51.260> thought<00:00:51.530> I'd<00:00:51.650> like<00:00:51.830> it<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.159> actually

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
it up thought I'd like it and actually

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.009 
it up thought I'd like it and actually
found<00:00:52.940> out<00:00:53.119> that<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.330> stainless<00:00:53.690> steel<00:00:53.869> is

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
found out that the stainless steel is

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.390 
found out that the stainless steel is
horrible<00:00:54.409> because<00:00:54.559> there's<00:00:54.830> no<00:00:54.949> grip<00:00:55.220> it's

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
horrible because there's no grip it's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.240 
horrible because there's no grip it's
slick<00:00:55.780> slides<00:00:56.780> around<00:00:56.960> can't<00:00:57.710> really<00:00:57.830> grip<00:00:58.129> it

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
slick slides around can't really grip it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.799 
slick slides around can't really grip it
or<00:00:58.339> hold<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.030> I<00:00:59.089> didn't<00:00:59.330> carry<00:00:59.570> this<00:00:59.690> one

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
or hold it so I didn't carry this one

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.329 
or hold it so I didn't carry this one
for<00:01:00.019> very<00:01:00.199> long<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:00.439> I<00:01:00.650> started<00:01:00.920> looking<00:01:00.979> for<00:01:01.309> a

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
for very long so I started looking for a

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.640 
for very long so I started looking for a
new<00:01:01.489> knife<00:01:01.670> immediately<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.479> because<00:01:03.439> of<00:01:03.470> the

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
new knife immediately and because of the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.010 
new knife immediately and because of the
serration<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:04.729> was<00:01:05.150> difficult<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.570> sharpen

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
serration it was difficult to sharpen

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.390 
serration it was difficult to sharpen
even<00:01:06.229> though<00:01:06.290> it<00:01:06.410> can<00:01:06.560> be<00:01:06.650> done<00:01:06.770> just<00:01:07.220> took<00:01:07.310> a

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
even though it can be done just took a

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.370 
even though it can be done just took a
lot<00:01:07.550> more<00:01:07.670> time<00:01:07.940> didn't<00:01:08.690> like<00:01:08.810> sharpening<00:01:09.260> the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
lot more time didn't like sharpening the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.900 
lot more time didn't like sharpening the
Federation<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.100> decided<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.580> go<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:10.760> a

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
Federation so I decided to go to a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.000 
Federation so I decided to go to a
straight<00:01:11.390> blade<00:01:11.510> knife<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.470> next<00:01:12.710> life<00:01:12.860> I
