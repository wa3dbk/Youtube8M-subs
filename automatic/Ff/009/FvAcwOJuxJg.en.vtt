joules<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:38.360> heat<00:00:41.719> of<00:00:42.719> heat<00:00:43.020> energy<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:46.640> add

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
joules of heat of heat energy so I add

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.660 
joules of heat of heat energy so I add
some<00:00:48.000> heat<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> system<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:50.070> add<00:00:50.250> one

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
some heat to the system and I add one

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.010 
some heat to the system and I add one
point<00:00:50.969> four<00:00:51.180> times<00:00:51.449> ten<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> eighth

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
point four times ten to the eighth

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:01.250 
point four times ten to the eighth
joules<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.649> heat<00:00:53.120> now<00:00:58.969> if<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.989> balloon

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
joules of heat now if the balloon

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:16.210 
joules of heat now if the balloon
expands<00:01:05.990> against<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:09.680> constant<00:01:10.680> pressure<00:01:12.830> of

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:26.270 

0.95<00:01:18.140> atmospheres<00:01:21.380> what<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:24.740> Delta<00:01:25.740> e<00:01:25.920> for

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
0.95 atmospheres what is the Delta e for

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.230 
0.95 atmospheres what is the Delta e for
the<00:01:26.400> process<00:01:31.130> okay<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.729> let's<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.060> draw<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the process okay so let's just draw a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
the process okay so let's just draw a
quick<00:01:33.390> picture<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:35.009> this

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
quick picture here so we have this

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.679 
quick picture here so we have this
balloon<00:01:35.579> obviously<00:01:36.060> we're<00:01:36.210> talking<00:01:36.479> about<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
balloon obviously we're talking about a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.230 
balloon obviously we're talking about a
really<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.200> large<00:01:37.439> balloon<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:38.579> pump<00:01:38.970> in

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
really really large balloon we pump in

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.310 
really really large balloon we pump in
heat<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.950> pumping<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.790> heat<00:01:42.210> energy<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.020> heat

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
heat so pumping in heat energy so heat

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
heat so pumping in heat energy so heat
is<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:43.890> positive<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.950> this<00:01:46.950> balloon

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
is going to be positive and this balloon

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.280 
is going to be positive and this balloon
is<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.700> expand<00:01:48.360> which<00:01:48.750> means<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.079> it's

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
is going to expand which means that it's

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.670 
is going to expand which means that it's
going<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.790> push<00:01:50.790> out<00:01:51.030> against<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.049> point<00:01:52.320> 9<00:01:52.439> 5

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
going to push out against the point 9 5

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.230 
going to push out against the point 9 5
atmospheres<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> balloon<00:01:54.090> is

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
atmospheres so now the balloon is

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.850 
atmospheres so now the balloon is
actually<00:01:54.509> doing<00:01:54.659> work<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.290> surroundings

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
actually doing work on the surroundings

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.490 
actually doing work on the surroundings
so<00:01:56.189> work<00:01:57.770> work<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.219> negative

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
so work work is going to be negative

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.660 
so work work is going to be negative
okay<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> now<00:02:03.060> let's<00:02:03.090> work<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.509> out<00:02:04.280> Delta<00:02:05.280> e<00:02:05.430> is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
okay so now let's work it out Delta e is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.169 
okay so now let's work it out Delta e is
equal<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.840> Q<00:02:07.170> plus<00:02:08.069> W<00:02:08.099> we've<00:02:08.789> worked<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.149> our

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
equal to Q plus W we've worked out our

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.390 
equal to Q plus W we've worked out our
sign<00:02:09.479> convention<00:02:10.020> heat<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.830> work<00:02:11.250> is

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
sign convention heat is going in work is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.610 
sign convention heat is going in work is
going<00:02:11.730> out<00:02:11.910> because<00:02:12.120> its<00:02:12.420> expansion<00:02:13.849> okay<00:02:14.849> and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
going out because its expansion okay and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.979 
going out because its expansion okay and
we<00:02:16.620> also<00:02:16.830> know<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.220> work<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:18.030> equal<00:02:18.660> to

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
we also know that work is equal to

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.020 
we also know that work is equal to
negative<00:02:19.319> P<00:02:20.540> Delta<00:02:21.540> V<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:23.489> let's<00:02:23.670> go<00:02:23.790> ahead<00:02:23.819> and

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
negative P Delta V so let's go ahead and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.869 
negative P Delta V so let's go ahead and
calculate<00:02:24.330> our<00:02:24.810> work<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.890> work<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.430> equal

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
calculate our work so the work is equal

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.190 
calculate our work so the work is equal
to<00:02:30.090> negative<00:02:31.280> zero<00:02:32.280> point<00:02:32.400> nine<00:02:32.849> five

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
to negative zero point nine five

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.330 
to negative zero point nine five
atmospheres<00:02:34.200> that's<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> external<00:02:35.099> pressure

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
atmospheres that's the external pressure

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.880 
atmospheres that's the external pressure
and<00:02:35.640> again<00:02:35.849> pressure-volume<00:02:36.269> work<00:02:36.660> p<00:02:37.319> delta<00:02:37.590> v

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
and again pressure-volume work p delta v

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.490 
and again pressure-volume work p delta v
that<00:02:38.280> p<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.879> external<00:02:39.239> pressure<00:02:39.629> against

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
that p is the external pressure against

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.320 
that p is the external pressure against

just<00:03:35.190> who<00:03:35.489> know<00:03:36.450> we<00:03:36.720> definitely<00:03:37.080> don't<00:03:37.170> want

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
just who know we definitely don't want

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.350 
just who know we definitely don't want
that

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.560 

a<00:03:43.110> now<00:03:44.110> we<00:03:44.170> just<00:03:44.440> said<00:03:44.710> that<00:03:45.010> Delta<00:03:45.520> e<00:03:45.550> equals<00:03:46.210> Q

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
a now we just said that Delta e equals Q

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.350 
a now we just said that Delta e equals Q
plus<00:03:46.900> W<00:03:46.930> we<00:03:47.560> calculated<00:03:48.070> w<00:03:48.640> that's<00:03:48.940> negative

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
plus W we calculated w that's negative

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.970 
plus W we calculated w that's negative
four<00:03:49.600> point<00:03:49.870> eight<00:03:50.050> times<00:03:50.320> ten<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.710> seven

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
four point eight times ten to the seven

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.140 
four point eight times ten to the seven
joules<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:52.390> now<00:03:52.600> Delta<00:03:53.140> e<00:03:53.350> equals<00:03:54.130> Q<00:03:54.460> Plus<00:03:54.880> that

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
joules so now Delta e equals Q Plus that

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.490 
joules so now Delta e equals Q Plus that
well<00:03:55.720> Q<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.590> positive<00:03:56.740> it<00:03:57.520> is<00:03:59.010> 1.4<00:04:01.170> times<00:04:02.170> ten

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
well Q is positive it is 1.4 times ten

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.710 
well Q is positive it is 1.4 times ten
to<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.650> eighth<00:04:02.800> jewels<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.970> know<00:04:07.090> what<00:04:07.270> I'm

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
to the eighth jewels you know what I'm

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.090 
to the eighth jewels you know what I'm
always<00:04:08.050> confused<00:04:08.620> about<00:04:08.740> whether<00:04:08.920> i<00:04:09.040> should

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
always confused about whether i should

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.580 
always confused about whether i should
write<00:04:09.370> it<00:04:09.550> out<00:04:09.640> or<00:04:09.910> do<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.209> letter<00:04:10.390> heads<00:04:10.690> for

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
write it out or do the letter heads for

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.130 
write it out or do the letter heads for
years<00:04:11.860> it's<00:04:12.010> been<00:04:12.130> like<00:04:12.340> this<00:04:12.520> okay<00:04:13.180> i'll<00:04:13.870> just

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
years it's been like this okay i'll just

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.900 
years it's been like this okay i'll just
do<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.350> letter<00:04:14.670> minus<00:04:16.290> 4.8<00:04:17.290> times<00:04:17.760> 10<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.790> the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
do the letter minus 4.8 times 10 to the

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.080 
do the letter minus 4.8 times 10 to the
7<00:04:19.329> j<00:04:20.290> so<00:04:21.040> our<00:04:21.160> change<00:04:21.400> in<00:04:21.579> energy<00:04:21.760> is<00:04:23.100> 9.2<00:04:24.100> times

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
7 j so our change in energy is 9.2 times

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.610 
7 j so our change in energy is 9.2 times
10<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.260> 7<00:04:26.680> j<00:04:28.110> notice<00:04:29.110> what's<00:04:29.290> happened

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
10 to the 7 j notice what's happened

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.780 
10 to the 7 j notice what's happened
here<00:04:30.419> energy<00:04:31.419> flowed<00:04:31.720> in<00:04:31.990> as<00:04:32.169> heat<00:04:35.070> work<00:04:36.070> it

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
here energy flowed in as heat work it

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.290 
here energy flowed in as heat work it

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
ended up expanding the gas the gas ended

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.000 
ended up expanding the gas the gas ended
up<00:04:40.450> pushing<00:04:40.900> against<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.560> external

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
up pushing against the external

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.820 
up pushing against the external
atmosphere<00:04:42.610> so<00:04:43.180> energy<00:04:43.720> came<00:04:44.260> in<00:04:44.410> as<00:04:44.530> heat

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
atmosphere so energy came in as heat

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.700 
atmosphere so energy came in as heat
energy<00:04:45.130> left<00:04:46.000> as<00:04:46.210> work<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:47.200> total<00:04:47.530> energy

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
energy left as work the total energy

energy left as work the total energy
change<00:04:48.190> for<00:04:48.370> this<00:04:48.490> process<00:04:49.000> was<00:04:49.240> nine<00:04:49.630> point

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
change for this process was nine point

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.700 
change for this process was nine point
two<00:04:51.750> times<00:04:52.750> ten<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.140> negative<00:04:53.260> seven

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
two times ten to the negative seven

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.680 
two times ten to the negative seven
joules<00:04:53.979> this<00:04:54.250> is<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.400> positive<00:04:54.700> value<00:04:55.210> so

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
joules this is a positive value so

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.330 
joules this is a positive value so
there's<00:04:55.870> now<00:04:56.020> more<00:04:56.050> energy<00:04:56.890> in<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.160> system

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
there's now more energy in the system

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.510 
there's now more energy in the system
