HTML editor and add that line of code in
your<00:01:47.729> header<00:01:48.409> now<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.619> thing<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> mention<00:01:50.159> is

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
your header now one thing to mention is

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.700 
your header now one thing to mention is
if<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:50.939> developing<00:01:51.390> locally<00:01:52.200> which<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.560> am

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
if you're developing locally which I am

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.480 
if you're developing locally which I am
right<00:01:53.040> now<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.490> you're<00:01:53.659> you're<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
right now and you're you're not on a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.990 
right now and you're you're not on a
hosted<00:01:57.380> server<00:01:58.430> you're<00:01:59.430> going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.850> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
hosted server you're going to have to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.800 
hosted server you're going to have to
add<00:02:00.119> HTTP<00:02:01.110> colon<00:02:01.579> for<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.630> work

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
add HTTP colon for this for this to work

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.719 
add HTTP colon for this for this to work
so<00:02:04.460> now<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.520> we've<00:02:05.909> actually<00:02:06.390> installed<00:02:07.229> it

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
so now that we've actually installed it

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.430 
so now that we've actually installed it
let's<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.879> ahead<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.390> start<00:02:09.959> adding<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
let's go ahead and start adding the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.760 
let's go ahead and start adding the
icons

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
icons

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
text-decoration:none so what this will

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.760 
text-decoration:none so what this will
do<00:04:43.690> is<00:04:43.930> any<00:04:44.850> link<00:04:45.850> within<00:04:46.390> a<00:04:46.660> navbar<00:04:47.170> text
