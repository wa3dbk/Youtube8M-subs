00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.170 
eyelashes right and a lot of eyelash
years<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.130> they<00:01:38.250> claim<00:01:38.580> to<00:01:38.730> do<00:01:38.940> that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
years out there they claim to do that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.600 
years out there they claim to do that
the<00:01:39.690> try<00:01:39.870> anticipation<00:01:40.620> had<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.860> whole<00:01:41.280> bunch

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the try anticipation had a whole bunch

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.360 
the try anticipation had a whole bunch
and<00:01:41.940> apparently<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.810> 14:1<00:01:43.590> gives<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> most

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
and apparently this 14:1 gives the most

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.130 
and apparently this 14:1 gives the most
dramatic<00:01:44.970> results<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.600> I'm<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:45.960> test

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
dramatic results so I'm going to test

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.230 
dramatic results so I'm going to test
this<00:01:46.260> out<00:01:46.410> every<00:01:47.100> night<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.580> see<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.120> this

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
this out every night and see if this

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.100 
this out every night and see if this
vessel<00:01:48.630> me<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.560> I'll<00:01:49.740> slide<00:01:50.960> let's<00:01:51.960> have

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
vessel me because I'll slide let's have

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.720 
vessel me because I'll slide let's have
a<00:01:52.170> look<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.440> what's<00:01:52.620> inside<00:01:52.800> okay<00:01:53.670> so

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
a look at what's inside okay so

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.520

but<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.300> used<00:05:17.510> this<00:05:17.660> for<00:05:17.900> about<00:05:17.990> a<00:05:18.110> week<00:05:18.350> when<00:05:18.410> I

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
but I used this for about a week when I

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.350 
but I used this for about a week when I
started<00:05:18.920> to<00:05:19.040> realize<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.700> I<00:05:19.850> was<00:05:20.090> starting

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
started to realize that I was starting

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.660 
started to realize that I was starting
to<00:05:20.390> get<00:05:20.600> small<00:05:20.900> dots<00:05:21.200> around<00:05:21.410> my<00:05:21.650> eyes<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:22.640> I

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
to get small dots around my eyes so I

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.610 
to get small dots around my eyes so I
think<00:05:23.120> that<00:05:23.420> this<00:05:23.690> was<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.930> little<00:05:24.290> bit<00:05:24.440> too

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
think that this was a little bit too

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.580 
think that this was a little bit too
strong<00:05:25.070> for<00:05:25.430> my<00:05:25.610> skin<00:05:25.640> so<00:05:26.270> I<00:05:26.300> stopped<00:05:26.780> so<00:05:27.560> that

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
strong for my skin so I stopped so that

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.730 
strong for my skin so I stopped so that
means<00:05:27.980> unfortunately<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:29.240> I<00:05:29.270> cannot<00:05:29.690> read

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
means unfortunately that I cannot read

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.080 
means unfortunately that I cannot read
alright<00:05:31.160> I've<00:05:31.280> been<00:05:31.400> using<00:05:31.580> this<00:05:31.820> for<00:05:32.030> about

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
alright I've been using this for about

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.660 
alright I've been using this for about
three<00:05:32.480> weeks<00:05:32.600> now<00:05:32.990> and<00:05:33.110> I'm<00:05:34.070> convinced<00:05:34.460> I<00:05:34.610> can

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
three weeks now and I'm convinced I can

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.660 
three weeks now and I'm convinced I can
see<00:05:34.940> a<00:05:34.970> difference<00:05:35.560> but<00:05:36.560> is<00:05:36.920> not<00:05:37.070> obvious<00:05:37.550> in

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
see a difference but is not obvious in

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.250 
see a difference but is not obvious in
the<00:05:37.730> before<00:05:38.030> and<00:05:38.090> after<00:05:38.330> photos<00:05:38.540> so<00:05:38.750> TV<00:05:39.140> it's

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
the before and after photos so TV it's

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.210 
the before and after photos so TV it's
just<00:05:39.440> all<00:05:39.590> in<00:05:39.620> my<00:05:39.860> head

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
just all in my head

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.320 
just all in my head
but<00:05:40.340> there's<00:05:40.520> some<00:05:40.640> people<00:05:40.670> that<00:05:40.940> trying<00:05:41.270> to

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
but there's some people that trying to

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.810 
but there's some people that trying to
test<00:05:41.540> it<00:05:41.660> Timur<00:05:41.960> tried<00:05:42.230> this<00:05:42.470> for<00:05:42.890> about<00:05:43.220> two

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
test it Timur tried this for about two

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.490 
test it Timur tried this for about two
to<00:05:44.030> three<00:05:44.060> months<00:05:44.510> and<00:05:44.810> it<00:05:44.900> was<00:05:45.020> then<00:05:45.260> they

to three months and it was then they

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.460 
to three months and it was then they
said<00:05:45.740> it<00:05:45.890> is<00:05:46.040> so<00:05:46.250> different<00:05:46.580> so<00:05:47.540> maybe<00:05:48.200> I<00:05:48.290> just

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
said it is so different so maybe I just

for<00:05:57.319> everything<00:05:57.889> I<00:05:58.069> guess<00:05:58.280> would<00:05:58.520> have<00:05:58.729> to<00:05:58.879> be

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
for everything I guess would have to be

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.249 
for everything I guess would have to be
in<00:05:59.360> fairness<00:06:00.729> pending<00:06:01.729> with<00:06:02.569> high<00:06:02.750> hopes

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:03.259 
in fairness pending with high hopes

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.839 
in fairness pending with high hopes
all<00:06:03.800> right<00:06:03.979> I've<00:06:04.129> used<00:06:04.340> almost<00:06:04.580> more<00:06:04.819> than

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
all right I've used almost more than

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.490 
all right I've used almost more than
half<00:06:05.210> of<00:06:05.330> this<00:06:05.449> bottle<00:06:05.689> and<00:06:06.080> if<00:06:06.199> you<00:06:06.289> look<00:06:06.409> at

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
half of this bottle and if you look at

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.869 
half of this bottle and if you look at
my<00:06:06.590> legs<00:06:06.830> I<00:06:07.039> think<00:06:07.099> the<00:06:07.340> condition<00:06:07.729> has

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:07.879 
my legs I think the condition has

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.529 
my legs I think the condition has
improved<00:06:08.349> quite<00:06:09.349> a<00:06:09.680> bit<00:06:09.789> like<00:06:10.789> um<00:06:11.060> of<00:06:11.479> course

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
improved quite a bit like um of course

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.170 
improved quite a bit like um of course

I'm here scars and but I think like the

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.790 
I'm here scars and but I think like the
old<00:06:14.389> scars<00:06:14.750> especially<00:06:14.900> like<00:06:15.379> if<00:06:15.530> you<00:06:15.620> see

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
old scars especially like if you see
