00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.899
 the fourth fight of pacquiao against 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.670
 marquez I think it was defined by 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.400
 marquez that eventually exorcised the 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.080
 pacman manny pacquiao spirit finished 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.359
 with a long list of fighters 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.359
 Mexican quality one by one 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.950
 and marquez has been his great frustration he 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.390
 has never been able to overcome the obstacle in 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.510
 the three fights and he always has a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.430
 same ink the ink that was going to enter 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.180
 and at the time of sale we 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.830
 we have to grab I did it in the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.770
 workouts nothing but my hand but 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.739
 I could not where to find the hit 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.129
 the day of the fight because there is a monitor 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.010
 in the dressing room of each of the two 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.320
 stellar fighters and we realized 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.449
 because we saw him warm freddie roach 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.820
 with the mittens 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.860
 making indications to pacquiao of the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.050
 movements that I had to follow and they were 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.009
 identical to the ones we like we go down 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.170
 but of law in Mexico they always say 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.720
 I will all go out to do this or I will 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.030
 do that marquez and pacquiao said 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.610
 let's go out to the ring and let's put it 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.070
 everything at stake and they did and it sounds 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.740
 bell is round number one or it will be 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.930
 number 37 what was a planned 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.350
 doctor was good to fight in the center of the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:31.060
 ring was dangerous for both 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.840
 Marquez is really a student of 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:40.530
 boxing is a great great fighter and is a 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.530
 fighter who has improved with age 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.660
 but that fourth fight where he sent the 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.450
 lona a pacquiao in the third episode 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.220
 for me it was something great something 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.690
 spectacular I think they are the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.280
 results of a great job the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.220
 results a great effort that we are going to 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.110
 done and for me it was very important 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.680
 and that gave me confidence in that fourth 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.900
 fight and when he got up he was more 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.140
 distressing for me in the corner because 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.420
 I knew what I was capable of when it was not 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.540
 knocked down in the third round we said yo 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.710
 what happened to manny but then he 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.710
 he got up and woke up 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.010
 the exchange of blows in the scholarships to 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.080
 final 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.329
 manny pacquiao was knocked down by juan 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.920
 Manuel Marquez he tried to answer 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.410
 but more 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.960
 what this point will tell 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.240
 in the four fights they had this 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.910
 last was where the two received a 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.480
 most severe punishment the fifth round was 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.670
 a nightmare for us the first 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.750
 four rounds have been fascinating the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.850
 main story 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.800
 the movement of pacquiao and the right 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.800
 Demolishing Marquez in the third round 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.200
 if there's going to be a knockout that night everything 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.790
 the world hoped that manny pacquiao 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.790
 Knock out Juan Manuel Tuesday 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.200
 stop it 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.810
 and to talk to him 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.269
 because in the fifth round I connect a 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.250
 quite strong blow that he thought that 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.440
 possibly in the fight to finish 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.690
 we knew that Juan was conscious 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.690
 lucid of what was happening and that in 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.379
 a small moment could take advantage of 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.379
 opportunity 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.170
 in a fight like that is not to lose the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.349
 fight he just missed that round 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.930
 but it leaves us the opportunity in the 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.019
 next to be able to stop the great 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.430
 ask if Juan Manuel Marquez and 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.130
 will be able to endure what manny 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.470
 pacquiao was going to give you agusta 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.660
 killing marques with his strategy is 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.760
 tiring marks the blow with the 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.000
 left without marquez does not back off the 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.139
 next time it will end up on the canvas 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.010
 partially blocked to the right of 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.010
 marketing 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.370
 I was thinking every day I 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.170
 I said I have to take advantage of the movement 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.240
 that he makes to be able to connect 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.910
 we know that in a feint he was going to be the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.190
 then I was going to go into that 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.130
 moment is a matter of seconds does not have 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.420
 one that think and connect the blow 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.320
 marketing truth has not realized 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.210
 how much pacquiao has approached 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.880
 so that he loses his balance again 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.150
 now he recovers it and tries to maintain the 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.150
 distance 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.180
 I think that's all the effort that 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.620
 we have done in each of the fights 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.050
 all the effort that we have made 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.750
 race is reflected in that blow it 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.880
 is reflected in that fourth fight that 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.140
 we do not want the decision to go away 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.870
 what had happened in the three 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:44.680
 previous and for that we trained 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.510
 a blow that we are not practicing I 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.220
 I knew that in this fight the change 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.930
 very small that was going to be important 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.600
 it was already the change I grabbed he took it in 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.070
 a tape entering him and it was that at 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.780
 moment that I entered it I connect it with 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.770
 that right that is what makes the 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.530
 impact is stronger 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.990
 Juan Manuel Marquez became what 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.080
 largest in Mexico since July Cesar 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.300
 That is to say, he earned a name among 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.860
 the three or four best fighters in 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.420
 the history of mexico 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.070
 this is what Juan Manuel Marquez achieved 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.460
 after his victory against manny 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.460
 pacquiao
