00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.890 
before but what's impressive about this
is<00:01:58.550> that<00:01:58.580> you<00:01:58.730> didn't<00:01:59.030> do<00:01:59.090> any<00:01:59.270> work<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.660> line

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
is that you didn't do any work to line

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.170 
is that you didn't do any work to line
it<00:01:59.930> at<00:02:00.200> all<00:02:00.350> yeah<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.250> mean<00:02:01.550> it's<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:01.940> easy<00:02:02.090> to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
it at all yeah I mean it's so easy to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.870 
it at all yeah I mean it's so easy to
use<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.510> just<00:02:02.540> tap<00:02:02.990> button<00:02:03.680> twice<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.520> boom

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
use you just tap button twice and boom

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.580 
use you just tap button twice and boom
you<00:02:05.090> have<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.300> PDF<00:02:05.750> good<00:02:05.960> looking<00:02:06.170> video<00:02:06.380> file

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
you have a PDF good looking video file

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.710 
you have a PDF good looking video file
that<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:06.860> can<00:02:06.950> upload<00:02:07.280> anywhere<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.149> guess<00:02:08.540> one

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
that you can upload anywhere I guess one

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.210 
that you can upload anywhere I guess one
advantage<00:02:09.110> was<00:02:09.290> you<00:02:09.410> put<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.679> document<00:02:10.100> on<00:02:10.190> a

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
advantage was you put the document on a

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.770 
advantage was you put the document on a
black<00:02:10.460> background<00:02:10.490> so<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.120> helps<00:02:11.480> but<00:02:11.600> if<00:02:11.690> I

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
black background so that helps but if I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.600 
black background so that helps but if I
ended<00:02:11.990> on<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.140> desk<00:02:12.470> or<00:02:12.680> something<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.040> mean<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
ended on a desk or something I mean the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.580 
ended on a desk or something I mean the
problems<00:02:13.760> was<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.660> but<00:02:15.050> at<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.350> this

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
problems was this but at this this

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.620 
problems was this but at this this
boosts<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:15.980> white<00:02:16.190> because<00:02:16.850> if<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:17.420> white<00:02:17.600> a

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
boosts is white because if I white a

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.760 
boosts is white because if I white a
white<00:02:17.900> wouldn't<00:02:18.230> work<00:02:18.320> why<00:02:18.440> don't<00:02:18.650> why

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
white wouldn't work why don't why

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.620 
white wouldn't work why don't why
wouldn't<00:02:19.250> work<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.610> haven't<00:02:19.970> got<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> desk<00:02:20.390> or

something<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.990> be<00:02:21.080> perfect<00:02:21.440> yeah<00:02:21.590> desk<00:02:21.950> it's

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
something to be perfect yeah desk it's

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.430 
something to be perfect yeah desk it's
perfectly<00:02:22.760> good<00:02:22.940> yes<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:23.570> in<00:02:23.660> your<00:02:23.810> hand<00:02:24.020> like

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
perfectly good yes but in your hand like

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.949

a<00:02:24.500> business<00:02:24.860> card<00:02:25.100> not<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.090> much<00:02:26.300> because<00:02:26.450> it

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
a business card not so much because it

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.350 
a business card not so much because it
fine<00:02:27.530> tries<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.100> find<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.550> borders<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.150> it

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
fine tries to find the borders so it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.250 
fine tries to find the borders so it
needs<00:02:29.660> kind<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.490> interaction<00:02:31.490> between

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
needs kind of interaction between

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.930 
needs kind of interaction between
between<00:02:33.260> your<00:02:33.500> documents<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.700> the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
between your documents and and and the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.699 
between your documents and and and the
background<00:02:35.120> yeah<00:02:35.720> some<00:02:36.020> sort<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.230> contrast

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709
