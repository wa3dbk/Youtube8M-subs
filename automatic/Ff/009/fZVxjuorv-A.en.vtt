flip but double footed landing but it

00:03:56.320 --> 00:05:06.270 
flip but double footed landing but it
could<00:03:56.470> have<00:03:56.560> been<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.710> lot<00:03:56.800> worse<00:03:56.980> than<00:03:57.400> that

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.120

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
happened about a minute from the end

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.559 
happened about a minute from the end
there<00:05:18.370> it<00:05:19.370> could<00:05:19.610> well<00:05:19.789> be<00:05:19.819> just<00:05:20.150> a<00:05:20.240> loss<00:05:20.419> of

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
there it could well be just a loss of

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.749 
there it could well be just a loss of
power<00:05:20.840> from<00:05:21.680> Daniel<00:05:22.220> but<00:05:22.310> it<00:05:22.400> looked<00:05:22.580> for<00:05:22.729> a

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
power from Daniel but it looked for a

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.839 
power from Daniel but it looked for a
moment<00:05:22.910> like<00:05:23.180> he<00:05:23.330> was<00:05:23.479> injured<00:05:24.580> but<00:05:25.580> there<00:05:25.759> was

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
moment like he was injured but there was

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.020 
moment like he was injured but there was
no<00:05:26.090> sign<00:05:26.120> of<00:05:26.780> it<00:05:26.870> after<00:05:27.199> that<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:28.550> crowd<00:05:28.789> here

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
no sign of it after that the crowd here

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.050 
no sign of it after that the crowd here
well<00:05:29.569> they<00:05:29.720> lapped<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.139> up<00:05:30.259> it<00:05:31.099> strikes<00:05:31.819> me

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
well they lapped it up it strikes me

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.330 
well they lapped it up it strikes me
it's<00:05:32.240> an<00:05:32.330> object<00:05:32.870> lesson<00:05:33.080> in<00:05:33.349> poise<00:05:33.889> and

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
it's an object lesson in poise and

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.600 
it's an object lesson in poise and
confidence<00:05:34.610> from<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.300> man<00:05:35.509> because<00:05:36.349> my<00:05:37.069> sense

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
confidence from the man because my sense

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.010 
confidence from the man because my sense
of<00:05:37.819> it<00:05:37.940> there<00:05:38.120> was<00:05:38.270> that<00:05:38.419> lift<00:05:38.630> went<00:05:38.840> down

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
of it there was that lift went down

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.830 
of it there was that lift went down
early<00:05:39.380> and<00:05:39.500> so<00:05:40.370> that<00:05:40.550> just<00:05:40.819> adjust<00:05:41.389> the<00:05:41.599> timing

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
early and so that just adjust the timing

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.990 
early and so that just adjust the timing
a<00:05:42.110> little<00:05:42.139> bit<00:05:42.470> and<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:42.979> for<00:05:43.340> a<00:05:43.370> moment<00:05:43.550> Mahlon

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
a little bit and and for a moment Mahlon

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.510 
a little bit and and for a moment Mahlon
was<00:05:44.180> following<00:05:44.930> him<00:05:45.080> and<00:05:45.169> watching<00:05:45.620> and<00:05:45.830> that

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
was following him and watching and that

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.040 
was following him and watching and that
you<00:05:46.880> wouldn't<00:05:47.060> have<00:05:47.210> known<00:05:47.419> that<00:05:47.449> anything

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
you wouldn't have known that anything

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.960 
you wouldn't have known that anything
was<00:05:48.139> amiss<00:05:48.289> from<00:05:48.620> his<00:05:48.830> face<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:49.669> way<00:05:49.789> he

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
was amiss from his face and the way he

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.219 
was amiss from his face and the way he
then<00:05:50.120> moved<00:05:50.330> into<00:05:50.449> the<00:05:50.690> next<00:05:50.930> bit<00:05:51.110> the

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
then moved into the next bit the

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.740 
then moved into the next bit the
drinking<00:05:51.710> bit<00:05:51.889> and<00:05:52.090> for<00:05:53.090> a<00:05:53.150> moment<00:05:53.300> she<00:05:53.630> was

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
drinking bit and for a moment she was

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.930 
drinking bit and for a moment she was
just<00:05:54.080> like<00:05:54.289> oh<00:05:54.560> where<00:05:55.370> are<00:05:55.400> we<00:05:55.550> going<00:05:55.819> it

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
just like oh where are we going it

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.730 
just like oh where are we going it
looked<00:05:56.150> like<00:05:56.330> that<00:05:56.599> and<00:05:56.900> then<00:05:56.990> after<00:05:57.349> the<00:05:57.440> next

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
looked like that and then after the next

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.890 
looked like that and then after the next
lift<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:58.220> smiles<00:05:58.520> came<00:05:58.789> back<00:05:59.000> all<00:05:59.210> right<00:05:59.599> now

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
the way that the choreography was put

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.939 
the way that the choreography was put
together<00:06:09.949> and<00:06:11.139> that<00:06:12.139> just<00:06:12.349> counts<00:06:12.650> for<00:06:12.830> so

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
together and that just counts for so
