I wasn't sure but I knew her for my
first<00:00:21.900> night<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.440> definitely<00:00:22.650> had<00:00:22.950> a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
first night that I definitely had a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.350 
first night that I definitely had a
passion<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.700> and<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:23.970> something<00:00:24.150> I

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
passion for it and it was something I

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.630 
passion for it and it was something I
wanted<00:00:24.540> to<00:00:24.750> pursue<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.310> turned<00:00:26.490> into

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
wanted to pursue and it just turned into

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.220 
wanted to pursue and it just turned into
so<00:00:27.000> much<00:00:27.119> more<00:00:27.180> though<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> ever<00:00:27.960> really

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
so much more though I ever really

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
so much more though I ever really
thought<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.770> it<00:00:29.369> could<00:00:29.430> potentially<00:00:29.790> be

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
thought that it could potentially be

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.229 
thought that it could potentially be
because<00:00:30.750> at<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.380> point<00:00:31.730> was<00:00:32.730> still<00:00:32.970> so<00:00:33.180> small

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
because at that point was still so small

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
because at that point was still so small
scale<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.840> even<00:00:34.050> Ben's<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.980> grown<00:00:35.250> so

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
scale and even Ben's like it's grown so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.189 
scale and even Ben's like it's grown so
rapidly<00:00:35.460> over<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.090> past<00:00:36.360> three<00:00:36.629> navigators

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
rapidly over the past three navigators

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.990 
rapidly over the past three navigators
that<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:38.550> opportunity<00:00:39.120> seemed<00:00:39.330> endless<00:00:39.540> go

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
that the opportunity seemed endless go

emotionally and physically sound going

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.260 
emotionally and physically sound going
into<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> fight<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.459> they<00:02:21.580> really<00:02:21.790> cover<00:02:22.060> all

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
into a fight so they really cover all

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.729 
into a fight so they really cover all
the<00:02:22.390> bases<00:02:22.720> there<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.380> feel<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.590> hundred

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
the bases there and I feel a hundred

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.000 
the bases there and I feel a hundred
percent<00:02:24.250> ready<00:02:25.260> how<00:02:26.260> do<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.380> feel<00:02:26.560> about<00:02:26.620> the

potential<00:02:27.280> rematch<00:02:27.700> with<00:02:27.880> Sarah<00:02:28.090> Kaufman

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
potential rematch with Sarah Kaufman

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.660 
potential rematch with Sarah Kaufman
she's<00:02:29.800> definitely<00:02:30.130> my<00:02:30.190> most<00:02:30.370> sought-after

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
she's definitely my most sought-after

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.900 
she's definitely my most sought-after
rematch<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.690> think<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.350> going<00:02:33.010> into<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.430> second

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
rematch I think that going into a second

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.370 
rematch I think that going into a second
fight<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.209> her<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.600> would<00:02:34.959> definitely<00:02:35.170> be

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
fight with her that would definitely be

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.309 
fight with her that would definitely be
different<00:02:35.830> because<00:02:36.010> she<00:02:36.760> taught<00:02:37.030> me

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
different because she taught me

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.330 
different because she taught me
confidence<00:02:38.319> that's<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.010> thing<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.220> I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
confidence that's the thing that I

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.680 
confidence that's the thing that I
learned<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.730> most<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.090> fight<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.540> never

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
learned that most of that fight I never

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.870 
learned that most of that fight I never
tested<00:02:41.110> myself<00:02:41.230> against<00:02:41.890> someone<00:02:42.640> her

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
tested myself against someone her

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.580 
tested myself against someone her
caliber<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:43.959> think<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.560> just

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
caliber and I think I just

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.380 
caliber and I think I just
underestimated<00:02:44.980> us<00:02:45.430> up<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.760> little<00:02:45.940> bit<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.269> I

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
underestimated us up a little bit and I

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.369 
underestimated us up a little bit and I
promised<00:02:46.750> us<00:02:46.930> off<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.110> would<00:02:47.380> never<00:02:47.590> be

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
promised us off that would never be

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.390 
promised us off that would never be
I'm<00:02:50.379> definitely<00:02:50.620> looking<00:02:50.860> forward<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.280> that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
I'm definitely looking forward to that

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.900 
I'm definitely looking forward to that
we<00:02:51.520> match<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.060> if<00:02:52.300> it's<00:02:52.450> for<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:52.660> belt
