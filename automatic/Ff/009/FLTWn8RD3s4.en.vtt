00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi everyone how is my name is 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.270
 macarena and today I will be showing you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.429
 the books that I read during March that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.090
 they were super few because as you know 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.660
 this in reading land which costs me 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.150
 horrors makes me read very little and it puts me 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.650
 very bad but at least I'm 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.860
 distracting with things that I like 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.470
 like youtube and series and things that and 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.150
 games too so I'm not 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.970
 happening so bad but it bothers me is not 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.680
 reading law only four books in March 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.330
 and I'm going to show them the first 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.840
 book I read was we do prison web 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.510
 blood grayson and deivid 9 tan this 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.309
 book was one of the few books of 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.960
 shonn greene that I have left to see I think 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.880
 I am that I read the book that has 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.489
 published on the internet and the 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.620
 unicorns zombies but this is supposed 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.850
 which is the last published book of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.250
 shonn greene I have yet to see 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.980
 obviously is co written with the bird 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.870
 the visual and that's a book about two 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.210
 guys called will grace are a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.890
 written by David and the other explained by 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.009
 This book contains themes of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.770
 sexuality friendship love diseases 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.350
 mental and more things is a book that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.869
 covers many issues in very little because 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.580
 it has no more than 300 and some pages is 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.319
 a book that I would recommend many today that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.240
 They translated it into Spanish. I've been talking 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.070
 this robbery has come down this month 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.439
 he does not believe in what he says he just was not 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.450
 for girls I had a couple of problems with 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.490
 the book at the beginning was very 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.200
 Slow eye the Chinese and its not expecting that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.540
 verizon and william obviously 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.100
 find fast but that does not happen in 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.500
 a lot of development of both characters 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.640
 before the book can be found 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.530
 in general I liked him I gave him four 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.630
 stars but with witnesses I had a few 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.979
 how many problems at the beginning another of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.110
 the problems is that the chapters 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.509
 written by dave and tlevisa I do not 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.360
 they liked it a lot mainly because 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.580
 the character that describes all his 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.950
 chapters are written without capital letters 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.380
 and from what I understand in the version in 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.270
 Spanish of this same are written without 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 capital letters and it's not that it bothered me 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.780
 because it's something interesting has to do 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.209
 with the personality of the character of his 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.819
 guild grayson but I had a hard time reading it 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.830
 because I really never understood 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.560
 how important are the capitals 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.970
 confuses a lot that is a name that 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.980
 it was a proper name that was a place 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.430
 that was the beginning of a sentence to 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.620
 beginning of 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.569
 paragraph whatever it was confused me a lot 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.480
 end of the book at least of this 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.120
 my edition in English there is a 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.799
 conversation between blood and also of 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.959
 vision which was very interesting in 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.810
 January because that was the time in the 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.849
 that the book and the characters of the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.069
 history they locked me completely 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.689
 when they start when davey of 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.280
 johann start talking about their own 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.930
 characters in the story that they wanted 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.489
 narrate this is the first book since 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.709
 Bildu vision I read though there was 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.500
 I read the novel Cordoba and wrote in 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.599
 machu the gates um and that was the first 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.440
 short novel of the idibell but this was 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.690
 the first 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.970
 complete novel although it is with written 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.500
 with john green 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.990
 and there are things that still do not close 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.630
 of man I have one more book of him in 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.340
 my shelves and I'm going to read it to try 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.490
 if I still like it but are described 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.870
 very good books with themes of 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.490
 sexuality homosexuality thing of 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.440
 sense so if you are looking for something 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.840
 so I recommend that you read day vÃ­ctor and 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.970
 such the next book graphic novel 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.060
 that I read then by teeth of the collection 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.350
 the complete collection of birds and the niche 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.360
 the only one I knew of guardians of 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.160
 thank the movie that came out the year 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.660
 past that I love you are in 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.360
 favorite teams 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.340
 I bought the bluray because it's a 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.050
 movie that I love but a million 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.210
 of times more I think since I 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.310
 buy was a few weeks ago 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.560
 I saw it like twice and I love it but 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.050
 if he commented as far as I understand 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.850
 Follow the story of the edge of the galaxy 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.160
 occurs after the events address 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.570
 in the galaxy I'm not sure if it goes 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.140
 the movie that keeps coming back to this 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.500
 galaxy will follow the argument 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.080
 these volumes or how will it continue but 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.000
 I loved one of the things that most 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.850
 I liked it was the art obviously there is a 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.690
 process there are many shadows in a lot 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.410
 detail is too beautiful and I love it 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.410
 this kind of art 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.980
 the truth is that in the argument now 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.930
 I do not remember much because I read this 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.459
 book at the beginning of the month 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.100
 it's sad that I remember what happened to the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.380
 principle but good happens if you like 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.120
 would go back to the 0 super recommend I do not know if 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.789
 is in Spanish and I do not think it's in 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.380
 Spanish but it is not very difficult to read 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.780
 in English it's more if they want them 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.830
 recommend something to read in English 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.900
 any kind of graphic novel I 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.180
 it seems very appropriate for good to believe 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.270
 get a very high level because 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.139
 obviously they are small balloons 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.850
 dialogue that are explained with the images 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.630
 so it's not very complicated to understand the 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.020
 amazing five-star rhythm and I'm 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.310
 waiting to buy the second volume 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.680
 soon these are book that I read during 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.470
 this month and the longest took me to 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.539
 read was insurgent of veron and coal 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.370
 they knew that I was going to read this book for the 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.650
 problem between you there was better 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.669
 sound where we went up there is a hangout 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.810
 whole with sophie with fede and with carla 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.060
 talking about what we think is a 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.560
 book conversion movie so no 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.060
 I'm going to talk about nothing but I'm going to 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.979
 leave the link abc hangout in the 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.780
 description so that they go see it are 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.699
 two hours of us talking about the 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.480
 insurgent so at least they want 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.220
 see it whole but 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.410
 this second of edge law I did not like 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.690
 as much as the first one was a bit 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.450
 disappointing bores me a bit I guess 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.390
 that has to do with the fact that already 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.220
 I'm how the whole saga ends and I gave myself 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.660
 count a lot of things that I do not 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.500
 She had noticed before is more there 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.230
 Mark a lot of things about 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.880
 3 Why I will not say because 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.650
 spoilers realities but if they want 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.600
 know more can watch hangout or read the 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.610
 second review of writing about the 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.960
 reading of this book that is also the 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.090
 I will leave in the description along with 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.340
 teaches them of all the books that they 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.590
 I will show in this video 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.240
 - of the graphic novel can or reviewed 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.760
 in the geographical ones although I could start 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.910
 to do it not and the last one I think I read 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.910
 that still the domains yesterday was broken 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.680
 heart sense and other things your mind 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.200
 almost end this is the first book one 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.570
 trilogy called broken hearts and 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.360
 revanche and it is a very light book 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.270
 contemporary obviously that is super 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.010
 I recommend if you like books 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.530
 this style the fiction books 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.940
 realistic and this book the truth is that 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.310
 it might seem like it contains a lot 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.020
 romance but does not have it which many 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.069
 thanks why 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.569
 you have romances waiting for me it seemed that 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:38.669
 will take the argument completely which 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:42.930
 it's very good this book is basically 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:44.520
 about friendship and revenge and no pain 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.169
 I counted for years something very different because 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.180
 Usually that kind of thing we'll see 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.849
 in fantasy when it means of these 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.560
 you got this kind of thing and it was a very 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.530
 good reading really as we say 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.110
 superlight and it came in handy for me 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.180
 ring england in which I am currently 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.500
 of which I'm still sure not 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.389
 I left I did not have many expectations 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.990
 neither about the argument because 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:08.490
 obviously he did not know anything and it is a euro not 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.840
 you can add a lot pretty much you put me 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.479
 they like the ones that I do not like is that 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.250
 plus other things I enjoy my 375 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.500
 stars because I did not like it that much 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.750
 because there were things that if a 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.460
 little I could not have a connection with the 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.469
 characters have a link with the 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.630
 characters makes some more shocking 

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:27.300
 things in history and this did not 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.940
 but it's still a good read of and 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.650
 365 stars and you can also read my 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.360
 review
