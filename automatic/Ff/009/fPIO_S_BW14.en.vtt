if<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.240> think<00:00:21.420> about<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.980> considering<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
if you think about it considering the

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.720 
if you think about it considering the
tea<00:00:25.260> bag<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.920> there<00:00:26.099> what's<00:00:26.310> that

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
tea bag and going on there what's that

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.830 
tea bag and going on there what's that
about<00:00:26.970> um<00:00:28.160> considering<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.369> large<00:00:29.910> map<00:00:30.390> that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
about um considering the large map that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.600 
about um considering the large map that
this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.170> an<00:00:31.260> incredibly<00:00:31.619> large<00:00:31.859> scale<00:00:32.189> map<00:00:32.399> I

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
this is an incredibly large scale map I

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.459 
this is an incredibly large scale map I
mean<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.120> definitely<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:34.050> there<00:00:34.110> with

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
mean it's definitely up there with

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.200 
mean it's definitely up there with
wasteland<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.489> more<00:00:35.760> vertical

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
wasteland it's just more vertical

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.600 
wasteland it's just more vertical
stretch<00:00:36.690> not<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.890> circle<00:00:38.309> e<00:00:38.430> as

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
stretch not not as like circle e as

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.060 
stretch not not as like circle e as
wasteland<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.629> where<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.320> guess<00:00:40.500> square<00:00:40.860> e

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
wasteland can get where I guess square e

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.799 
wasteland can get where I guess square e
would<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> better<00:00:41.640> term<00:00:41.879> as<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
would be a better term as all of the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.270 
would be a better term as all of the
maps<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.170> rectangular<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.920> some<00:00:44.550> sense<00:00:44.899> but<00:00:45.899> I

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
maps are rectangular in some sense but I

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.330

for somebody who knows you're coming and

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.680 
for somebody who knows you're coming and
that<00:02:15.830> that's<00:02:16.040> was<00:02:16.130> not<00:02:16.220> smart<00:02:16.400> idea<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.450> here<00:02:17.660> I

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
that that's was not smart idea so here I

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.630 
that that's was not smart idea so here I
didn't<00:02:18.050> actually<00:02:18.140> want<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:19.160> guy<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.370> take

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
didn't actually want this guy to take

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.479 
didn't actually want this guy to take
see<00:02:19.910> he<00:02:20.120> was<00:02:20.239> sort<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.420> an<00:02:20.510> asshole<00:02:20.720> doing<00:02:21.230> so

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
see he was sort of an asshole doing so

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.580 
see he was sort of an asshole doing so
but<00:02:22.489> he<00:02:22.790> did<00:02:22.970> anyway<00:02:23.360> nonetheless<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.380> had

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
but he did anyway nonetheless so I had

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.229 
but he did anyway nonetheless so I had
to<00:02:24.620> deal<00:02:24.830> with<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.099> that's<00:02:25.880> one<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
to deal with it that's one of the

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.820 
to deal with it that's one of the
reasons<00:02:26.510> why<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.690> match<00:02:27.230> went<00:02:27.470> really<00:02:27.590> fast

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
reasons why this match went really fast

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.610 
reasons why this match went really fast
but<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.790> key<00:02:29.000> here<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.080> just<00:02:30.230> take<00:02:30.410> a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
but the key here is is to just take a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.470 
but the key here is is to just take a
and<00:02:30.800> B<00:02:30.890> from<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.190> beginning<00:02:31.310> get<00:02:32.060> them<00:02:32.209> spawn

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
and B from the beginning get them spawn

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.620 
and B from the beginning get them spawn
trap<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.959> some<00:02:33.170> extent<00:02:33.530> at<00:02:33.739> sea<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:35.360> just

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
trap to some extent at sea and I just

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.809 
trap to some extent at sea and I just
can't<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.080> hell<00:02:36.290> out<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.500> them<00:02:36.709> um<00:02:36.890> because

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
can't the hell out of them um because

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.250 
can't the hell out of them um because
though<00:02:38.150> they'll<00:02:38.420> keep<00:02:38.599> spawning<00:02:38.870> there<00:02:39.110> no

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
though they'll keep spawning there no

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.750 
though they'll keep spawning there no
matter<00:02:39.380> what<00:02:39.470> as<00:02:39.830> long<00:02:40.220> as<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.489> don't<00:02:40.610> push

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
matter what as long as you don't push

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.970 
matter what as long as you don't push
for<00:02:41.000> forward<00:02:41.900> enough<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.349> you<00:02:42.560> really<00:02:42.860> have

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
for forward enough and you really have

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.100 
for forward enough and you really have
to<00:02:43.069> push<00:02:43.250> very<00:02:43.819> far<00:02:44.180> if<00:02:44.300> you've<00:02:44.450> ever<00:02:44.540> tried<00:02:44.900> to

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
to push very far if you've ever tried to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.440 
to push very far if you've ever tried to
actually<00:02:45.500> change<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.860> spawns<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.489> derail<00:02:46.760> to

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
actually change the spawns on derail to

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.960 
actually change the spawns on derail to
get<00:02:47.600> them<00:02:47.720> back<00:02:47.870> at<00:02:48.049> a<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:49.310> see<00:02:49.549> it's<00:02:49.670> sort<00:02:49.850> of

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
get them back at a but see it's sort of

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.140 
get them back at a but see it's sort of
a<00:02:50.030> beneficial<00:02:50.600> spawn<00:02:51.640> when<00:02:52.640> you're<00:02:52.790> when<00:02:53.060> you

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
a beneficial spawn when you're when you

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.220 
a beneficial spawn when you're when you
have<00:02:53.330> air<00:02:53.510> support<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.900> up<00:02:53.989> in<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.200> air

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
have air support it up in the air

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.780 
have air support it up in the air
because<00:02:54.470> they<00:02:54.709> tend<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.010> spawn<00:02:55.340> if<00:02:55.610> you're

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
because they tend to spawn if you're

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.660 
because they tend to spawn if you're
anywhere<00:02:56.209> close<00:02:56.709> over<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.950> left<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.430> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
anywhere close over to the left in the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.720 
anywhere close over to the left in the
demolition<00:02:59.450> plant<00:03:00.200> spot<00:03:00.560> or<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.310> guess<00:03:01.549> that's

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
demolition plant spot or I guess that's

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.699 
demolition plant spot or I guess that's
search<00:03:02.000> too<00:03:02.360> for<00:03:03.049> those<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.319> that<00:03:03.500> play

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
search too for those of you that play

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.789 
search too for those of you that play
search<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.099> do<00:03:04.160> not<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.660> yeah<00:03:06.019> i'm<00:03:06.200> using<00:03:06.739> a

deagle as my secondary that's why i have

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.809 
deagle as my secondary that's why i have
stopping<00:03:08.840> power<00:03:08.959> equipped<00:03:09.349> I'm<00:03:10.280> thinking

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
stopping power equipped I'm thinking

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.490 
stopping power equipped I'm thinking
about<00:03:10.849> doing<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.209> deagle<00:03:11.510> only<00:03:11.840> akimbo<00:03:12.170> match

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
about doing a deagle only akimbo match

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.309 
about doing a deagle only akimbo match

this because you would encounter

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.120 
this because you would encounter
painkiller<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:36.389> it<00:05:36.599> will<00:05:36.690> not<00:05:36.840> be<00:05:36.960> nice<00:05:37.130> but
