the disk so necessary first chord we

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.480 
the disk so necessary first chord we
have<00:01:07.840> up<00:01:08.020> yeah<00:01:08.619> as<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.860> can<00:01:08.920> see<00:01:09.100> this<00:01:09.220> side<00:01:09.400> is

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
have up yeah as you can see this side is

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.090 
have up yeah as you can see this side is
a<00:01:09.550> firewire<00:01:10.000> 800<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.560> other<00:01:11.740> side<00:01:11.950> is<00:01:12.040> a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
a firewire 800 and the other side is a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.790 
a firewire 800 and the other side is a
firewire<00:01:12.550> 400<00:01:13.030> so<00:01:13.840> there's<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.080> conversion

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
firewire 400 so there's a conversion

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.230 
firewire 400 so there's a conversion
cable<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.430> work<00:01:15.580> between<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.940> two<00:01:15.970> if<00:01:16.180> you

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
cable to work between the two if you

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.050 
cable to work between the two if you
have<00:01:16.330> an<00:01:16.420> older<00:01:16.720> Mac<00:01:17.110> or<00:01:17.800> Windows<00:01:17.910> next<00:01:18.910> we

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
it does have rubber feet to prevent it

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.080 
it does have rubber feet to prevent it
from<00:01:53.860> scratching<00:01:54.429> which<00:01:54.550> is<00:01:54.670> good<00:01:54.910> because

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
from scratching which is good because

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.499 
from scratching which is good because
the<00:01:55.330> aluminum<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:56.289> know<00:01:56.380> could<00:01:56.679> do<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:57.509> we

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
the aluminum you know could do that we

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.880 
the aluminum you know could do that we
have<00:01:58.660> right<00:01:58.869> here<00:01:58.899> on<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.140> bottom<00:01:59.440> this<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.619> a

have right here on the bottom this is a

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.740 
have right here on the bottom this is a
heatsink<00:02:00.670> it's<00:02:01.000> built<00:02:01.239> in<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:01.509> there's<00:02:01.660> no

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
heatsink it's built in so there's no

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.889 
heatsink it's built in so there's no

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
now we're gonna look at the ports on the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.390 
now we're gonna look at the ports on the
back<00:02:29.650> here<00:02:29.980> okay

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
back here okay

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.220 
back here okay
so<00:02:30.940> first<00:02:31.270> up<00:02:31.420> on<00:02:31.510> our<00:02:31.599> left<00:02:31.780> we<00:02:31.989> have<00:02:32.140> the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
so first up on our left we have the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.990 
so first up on our left we have the
kensic<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.770> lot<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.920> work<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.700> got<00:02:33.879> our

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
kensic and a lot of work and got our

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.750 
kensic and a lot of work and got our
eSATA<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:34.959> two<00:02:35.260> firewire<00:02:35.860> 800<00:02:36.129> which

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
eSATA you have two firewire 800 which

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.690 
eSATA you have two firewire 800 which
will<00:02:36.940> convert<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.800> 500<00:02:38.800> or<00:02:38.890> 400<00:02:39.069> if<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.550> need

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
will convert to 500 or 400 if you need

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.059 
will convert to 500 or 400 if you need
to<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.480> we<00:02:40.629> have<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.810> micro<00:02:41.080> USB<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
to and we have the micro USB we have the

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.820 
to and we have the micro USB we have the
power<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.150> on/off<00:02:43.450> button<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:44.110> I'm<00:02:44.680> too

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
power and the on/off button so I'm too

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:52.590 
power and the on/off button so I'm too
much<00:02:44.920> going<00:02:45.129> on

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.390 

so<00:02:53.600> here<00:02:53.780> we<00:02:53.900> have<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.320> G<00:02:54.650> Drive<00:02:54.800> connected<00:02:55.280> to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
so here we have the G Drive connected to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.370 
so here we have the G Drive connected to
a<00:02:55.430> Mac<00:02:55.640> Mini<00:02:55.820> using<00:02:56.390> firewire<00:02:56.660> 800<00:02:56.750> there's

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
a Mac Mini using firewire 800 there's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.600 
a Mac Mini using firewire 800 there's
the<00:02:57.560> light<00:02:57.710> on<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.860> front<00:02:57.980> which<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.190> very
