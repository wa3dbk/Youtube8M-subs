00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.600
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:21.300
 At a last is this blue pedal finally 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:27.100
 Let me introduce this and say that the accelerator pedal 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:31.650
 It only has time to step on it, and it has the function of taking effects . 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.410
 Is I think the earlier you had you heard this I Eeemaa in 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.880
 Yeah I think I want to play 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.880
 ni 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.880
 wh 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:56.230
 Be big time some people are seemed Therefore, I use it anywhere in the I missile 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:58.180
 This but please ask may not is but because you try to use in this you later I song 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.199
 It is shot with a laser beam 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.199
 Only while you are stepping on this school 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.860
 t 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.780
 Out the effect of Yeah 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:15.000
 Well in even Toka end speed of this now line nutrition 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:19.950
 Also Toka fast as it can various control that begins to bite 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.890
 Well, let 's adjust it later, I think if you can start making various sounds 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.030
 There are many other things 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.850
 Is 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.720
 Please listen to this too 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.720
 ni 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.610
 It's only while you 're walking like Kofu , so it's delayed and even modulation 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:02.280
 It is an effector like that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.690
 Oriental trying to do it even Yes Well Ema gt shop until it is this now the same as a similar kind of thing 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.360
 I was able to 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.350
 There is also a fact that came out to better the previous sound to it is now easy to high setting Well Table 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.310
 You 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.630
 It's easy to set up the effect at the accelerator pedal 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.920
 It is only this that changes 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.960
 High complex I have become in effect and was able to in their school easy to write 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.770
 Say 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:30.540
 Tteyuu this feedback after another one menu 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.930
 Well this effect please listen to this too 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.239
 It is in this state 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.239
 It's like this, but it's about this 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.120
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.490
 It begins to take anti-spray and feedback It is in the wind Tteyuu 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.190
 It's pretty hard to say that this setting is a difficult feedback 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:24.490
 Even if it is this, it is easy to do 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:26.069
 It is a feeling that is another one s bent this is a bend it is a 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.849
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.849
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.420
 ame 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.140
 Yes me 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.640
 This is like s better 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:46.620
 Well really I only high Aksu while you are in 5 minutes but you can of course also in the pedal bed 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.470
 Things like that put out effects, such as I mean Tsu win Hey good like a accelerator pedal 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.620
 There is also 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.930
 It did hey are also other 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.480
 There are a lot of things here too Hey by all means 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.480
 Later on, you actually touch me like this 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:07.340
 twist twist and ring modulator 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:12.480
 The effect is said to be, but they are actually actually two more after that 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:17.430
 I think if you can listen at the time of layering 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.609
 It will be the last, but I use those medical uniforms 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.880
 1 song 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.440
 I will try to make a picture 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.940
 If you can hear me 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.580
 think 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.060
 What effect do you use? 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.060
 Sore throat 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.760
 And feedback whether a laser beam 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.460
 later 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.670
 Because it can be used at key points 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.000
 What if I could pull it 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.230
 I think in the end the song 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.230
 I would like to make a picture 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.670
