Cube<00:00:07.799> man<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.309> can't<00:00:08.639> do<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.090> full<00:00:09.300> thing<00:00:09.510> yet

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
Cube man I can't do the full thing yet

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.780 
Cube man I can't do the full thing yet
but<00:00:09.830> I'm<00:00:10.830> working<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.400> it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.480 
mine's red so pick red so it should show
the<00:00:20.340> cube<00:00:20.670> Joey<00:00:20.990> okay

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
the cube Joey okay

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.359 
the cube Joey okay
so<00:00:23.490> first<00:00:24.410> first<00:00:25.410> really<00:00:25.920> my<00:00:26.220> tip<00:00:28.010> stop<00:00:29.010> stop

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
so first first really my tip stop stop

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.849 
so first first really my tip stop stop
Burke<00:00:30.119> my<00:00:30.359> first<00:00:30.599> tip<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.109> pick<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.619> side

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
Burke my first tip is to pick the side

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.940 
Burke my first tip is to pick the side
with<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> most<00:00:32.610> red<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.680> one

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
with the most red on it so it's this one

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889 
with the most red on it so it's this one
and<00:00:35.219> then<00:00:35.670> you're<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.000> gonna<00:00:36.180> add<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.750> and

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and then you're just gonna add on it and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:50.209 
and then you're just gonna add on it and
onto<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:38.059> so<00:00:44.570> Chris<00:00:45.570> stop<00:00:48.620> do<00:00:49.620> that

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
onto it so Chris stop do that

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.220 
onto it so Chris stop do that
there<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> trick<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.340> use<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
there that's the trick I use like if I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
there that's the trick I use like if I
have<00:00:55.469> something<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> want<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.610> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
have something in here I want to get it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.729 
have something in here I want to get it
here<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:56.969> can't<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.960> cuz<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:58.530> it's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
here I can't just do this cuz then it's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.360 
here I can't just do this cuz then it's
gonna<00:00:58.920> take<00:00:59.100> away<00:00:59.340> these<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.789> know<00:01:00.050> stop<00:01:01.370> get

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
gonna take away these you know stop get

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.000 
gonna take away these you know stop get
out<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:03.739> okay

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
out of here okay

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.789 
out of here okay
so<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.210> don't<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> cut<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> sail<00:01:07.350> off<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
so I don't have to cut the sail off and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.929 
so I don't have to cut the sail off and
make<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> new<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.400> no<00:01:09.560> okay<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.610> is

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
make a new one no okay so what I do is

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.780 
make a new one no okay so what I do is
like<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.240> turn<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.020> opposite<00:01:13.500> side<00:01:13.790> okay

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
like I turn it to the opposite side okay

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.890 
like I turn it to the opposite side okay
is<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.119> oh<00:01:15.860> okay<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:17.159> farther<00:01:17.400> then

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
is there oh okay then go farther then

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.429 
is there oh okay then go farther then
okay<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.110> good

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
okay that's good

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.640 
okay that's good
and<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.689> what<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.320> put<00:01:22.530> this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and so then what I do and I put this

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.830 
and so then what I do and I put this
down<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.990> slide<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:26.400> there's<00:01:27.360> no<00:01:27.570> over

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
down I slide it but here there's no over

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.240 
down I slide it but here there's no over
dynamo<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.799> put<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.340> back<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:31.250> yeah

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
dynamo so you just put it back and yeah

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.310 
dynamo so you just put it back and yeah
here<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.000> same<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.900> fell<00:01:34.049> off

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.219 

this<00:01:37.320> case<00:01:37.619> did<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.250> at<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> other<00:01:38.579> side

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.940 

and<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:47.180> there<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.299> go

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
and so there we go

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.160 
and so there we go
and<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.220> pretty<00:01:50.430> straightforward<00:01:51.170> because

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and it's pretty straightforward because

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.590 
and it's pretty straightforward because
just<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.520> same<00:01:53.759> technique<00:01:54.329> every<00:01:54.540> time<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:56.600> if

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
just the same technique every time so if

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.539 
just the same technique every time so if
you<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.810> any<00:01:57.990> trouble<00:01:58.469> doesn't<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:58.950> if

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
you have any trouble doesn't really if

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.190 
you have any trouble doesn't really if
you<00:01:59.700> really<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.360> really<00:02:00.509> think<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:00.930> stuck

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
you really you really think it's stuck

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.389 
you really you really think it's stuck
like<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.409> Rubik's<00:02:01.619> Cube<00:02:01.740> doesn't<00:02:02.219> matter

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
like a Rubik's Cube doesn't matter

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.080 
like a Rubik's Cube doesn't matter
because<00:02:03.979> as<00:02:04.979> long<00:02:05.100> as<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.460> strategies

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
because as long as you have strategies

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.280 
because as long as you have strategies
you'll<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.780> fine

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
you'll be fine

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.160 
you'll be fine
first<00:02:07.710> diamond<00:02:07.950> suck<00:02:08.520> too

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
first diamond suck too

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.080 
first diamond suck too
shut<00:02:11.170> up<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:13.709> see<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.830> bouncing<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.120> video
