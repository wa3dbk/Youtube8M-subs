00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.690
 I'll explain. 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.210
 Now you can create a sound in user mode and save it. 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.140
 I'll let you know. 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.610
 Usually it gonna create a sound that is most difficult for those who initially it 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.620
 I'm sorry. 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:37.080
 First , when you make a sound, 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.120
 I'll make a sound with three. 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:46.739
 For example, if you want to preset 1 or 2, 3 or 4 in preset 1 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.640
 Listen to me. Listen, what's the best thing is a clean tone or drive sound. 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.350

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:05.040
 Here are the things that are on fire. 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:07.650
 Preamplifier then amp simulation and equalizer river some next 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.909
