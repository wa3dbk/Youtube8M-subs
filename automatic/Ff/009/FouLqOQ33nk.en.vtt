how this all happens and ones fingers

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.990 
how this all happens and ones fingers
crossed<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.010> colors<00:00:47.280> meant<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> come<00:00:47.670> out<00:00:47.820> all

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
crossed the colors meant to come out all

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.630 
crossed the colors meant to come out all
right<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.600> apparently<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.620> whatever<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
right this apparently but whatever it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.689 
right this apparently but whatever it
does<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.660> i<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.770> says<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.219> bag<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
does which i see it says in the bag it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.630 
does which i see it says in the bag it
fades<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.260> four<00:00:55.530> washes<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.340> guess

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
fades out in one to four washes I guess

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.450 
fades out in one to four washes I guess
it's<00:00:56.820> dependent<00:00:57.300> how<00:00:57.510> LIBOR<00:00:58.109> hair<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.129> for

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it's dependent how LIBOR hair is so for

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.880 
it's dependent how LIBOR hair is so for
washings<00:00:59.879> would<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.210> more<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.739> this

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
washings would be more but I think this

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
washings would be more but I think this
was<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> purchase<00:01:05.150> think<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570

different<00:02:47.700> than<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.239> says<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.600> box<00:02:49.970> it

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
different than it says in the box it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.010 
different than it says in the box it
looks<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.300> should<00:02:51.630> be<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> lot<00:02:51.840> more

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
looks like it should be a lot more

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.650
