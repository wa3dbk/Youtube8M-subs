00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.030 

one<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.760> cool<00:00:03.149> things<00:00:03.179> about<00:00:03.570> lasers<00:00:04.110> is

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
one of the cool things about lasers is

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.270 
one of the cool things about lasers is
that<00:00:05.400> they<00:00:05.549> make<00:00:05.790> pretty<00:00:06.480> much<00:00:06.799> one<00:00:07.799> color<00:00:08.160> of

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
that they make pretty much one color of

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.009 
that they make pretty much one color of
light<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:09.090> here's<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.389> red<00:00:09.660> laser<00:00:10.460> and<00:00:11.929> here's<00:00:12.929> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
light so here's a red laser and here's a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.980 
light so here's a red laser and here's a
green<00:00:13.469> laser<00:00:16.789> now<00:00:17.789> I'm<00:00:18.150> not<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.750> really

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
green laser now I'm not going to really

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.660 
green laser now I'm not going to really
talk<00:00:19.109> about<00:00:19.289> lasers<00:00:20.070> I'm<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.580> use

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
talk about lasers I'm just going to use

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.220 
talk about lasers I'm just going to use
them<00:00:20.880> because<00:00:21.240> they<00:00:21.539> only<00:00:21.660> make<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.020> color

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
them because they only make one color

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.029 
them because they only make one color
and<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.920> show<00:00:23.960> what<00:00:24.960> happens<00:00:25.039> when

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and I'm going to show what happens when

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.939 
and I'm going to show what happens when
you<00:00:26.189> take<00:00:26.519> light<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.570> goes<00:00:27.720> through<00:00:28.080> this

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
you take light and it goes through this

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.620 
you take light and it goes through this
does<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.429> hard<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.670> show<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.330> too

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
does it's hard to show up but it's a too

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.569 
does it's hard to show up but it's a too
green<00:00:31.189> it's<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.309> green<00:00:32.930> gel<00:00:34.219> okay<00:00:35.219> here's<00:00:35.520> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
green it's a green gel okay here's a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.069 
green it's a green gel okay here's a
green<00:00:35.790> gel<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> dark<00:00:37.469> blue<00:00:39.079> I'm

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
green gel here I have a dark blue I'm

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.299 
green gel here I have a dark blue I'm
looking<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.469> there<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> camera<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
looking at there with the camera and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.340 
looking at there with the camera and
here's<00:00:41.730> magenta<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.450> want<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.899> red<00:00:45.350> let's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
here's magenta I want to have red let's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.260 
here's magenta I want to have red let's
start<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> red<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.610> two<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.059> top<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
start with the red I have two on top of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.340 
start with the red I have two on top of
each<00:00:48.390> other<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.750> makes<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.110> little<00:00:49.200> more

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
each other just makes it a little more

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.700 
each other just makes it a little more
redder<00:00:50.120> what<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.809> does<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.320> light

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
redder what what does this do to light

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.779 
redder what what does this do to light
how<00:00:53.190> does<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> make<00:00:53.579> things<00:00:53.969> look<00:00:54.149> red<00:00:54.770> well

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
how does it make things look red well

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.160 
how does it make things look red well
here<00:00:56.789> I'm<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> take<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> red<00:00:57.629> laser<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
here I'm going to take the red laser and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.900 
here I'm going to take the red laser and
I'm<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> pass<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.059> through<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.449> red<00:01:00.629> gel

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
I'm going to pass it through the red gel

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.710 
I'm going to pass it through the red gel
and<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:04.680> goes<00:01:04.890> right<00:01:05.010> through<00:01:05.720> what

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and you see it goes right through what

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.840 
and you see it goes right through what
if<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> green<00:01:07.799> laser<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
if I do this with the green laser so the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.170 
if I do this with the green laser so the
green<00:01:15.210> color<00:01:15.770> what<00:01:16.770> does<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.790> does<00:01:17.970> not

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
green color what does it do it does not

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.660 
green color what does it do it does not
go<00:01:18.420> through<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> gel<00:01:19.220> okay<00:01:20.220> well<00:01:20.430> here's<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
go through the gel okay well here's a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.950 
go through the gel okay well here's a
green<00:01:20.909> gel<00:01:21.180> let<00:01:22.049> me<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.530> green<00:01:23.340> laser

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.929 

you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.579> see<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.759> goes

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
you can see you like that see it goes

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:41.060 
you can see you like that see it goes
through<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.689> fine<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:32.280> red

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.980 

does<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:42.800> okay<00:01:43.800> what<00:01:43.950> about<00:01:44.220> blue<00:01:44.990> here's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
does not okay what about blue here's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.060 
does not okay what about blue here's
blue<00:01:46.729> okay

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
blue okay

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
blue okay
here's<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> red<00:01:53.030> does<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.420> through<00:01:54.450> or

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
here's the red does not go through or

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.010 
here's the red does not go through or
little<00:01:55.729> maybe<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.820> little<00:01:57.090> bit<00:01:57.270> no<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.720> doesn't

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
little maybe a little bit no it doesn't

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.390 
little maybe a little bit no it doesn't
go<00:01:58.110> through<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:59.160> green<00:02:04.310> doesn't<00:02:05.310> go

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
go through and the green doesn't go

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.020 
go through and the green doesn't go
through<00:02:05.520> either

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
through either

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.320 
through either
okay<00:02:06.780> one<00:02:06.990> more<00:02:07.140> color<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.660> magenta<00:02:11.330> so

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
okay one more color this is magenta so

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.150 
okay one more color this is magenta so
here<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:14.720> green<00:02:15.720> light<00:02:18.770> barely<00:02:19.770> goes

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
here is the green light barely goes

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:29.540 
here is the green light barely goes
through<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.989> red<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.860> don't<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.489> a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
through and the red so I don't have a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.100 
through and the red so I don't have a
blue<00:02:29.880> laser<00:02:30.090> pointer<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.690> if<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.840> did<00:02:31.080> that

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
blue laser pointer but if I did that

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.320 
blue laser pointer but if I did that
would<00:02:31.410> be<00:02:31.500> pretty<00:02:31.709> cool<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.430> blue<00:02:32.700> would

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
would be pretty cool the blue would

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.570 
would be pretty cool the blue would
actually<00:02:33.690> go<00:02:33.810> through<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.290> magenta<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
actually go through the magenta and the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.460 
actually go through the magenta and the
red<00:02:35.790> would<00:02:36.000> go<00:02:36.150> all<00:02:36.269> through<00:02:36.630> also<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
red would go all through also and the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.949 
red would go all through also and the
blue<00:02:37.680> would<00:02:37.830> go<00:02:37.980> through<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:39.480> blue<00:02:39.750> filter

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
blue would go through the blue filter

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.670 
blue would go through the blue filter
too<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:42.140> hopefully<00:02:43.140> that's<00:02:43.320> enough<00:02:43.500> evidence

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
too so hopefully that's enough evidence

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.949 
too so hopefully that's enough evidence
for<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.340> think<00:02:44.550> about<00:02:44.730> what<00:02:45.450> these<00:02:45.630> gels

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
for you to think about what these gels

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.449 
for you to think about what these gels
do<00:02:46.200> when<00:02:46.380> different<00:02:46.650> colors<00:02:46.950> pass<00:02:47.160> through

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
do when different colors pass through

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.610 
do when different colors pass through
them
