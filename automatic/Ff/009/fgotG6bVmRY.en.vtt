how<00:04:54.750> you<00:04:54.810> actually<00:04:54.960> do<00:04:55.139> it<00:04:55.230> so<00:04:55.380> you<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:56.010> things

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
how you actually do it so you the things

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.760 
how you actually do it so you the things
you<00:04:56.430> need<00:04:56.730> are<00:04:57.000> preferably<00:04:57.810> two<00:04:58.080> people<00:04:58.410> to

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
you need are preferably two people to

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.860 
you need are preferably two people to
fishing<00:04:59.100> rods<00:04:59.310> you<00:05:00.000> don't<00:05:00.150> need<00:05:00.480> two<00:05:00.720> people

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
fishing rods you don't need two people

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.390 
fishing rods you don't need two people
but<00:05:01.140> it<00:05:01.230> makes<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.470> lot<00:05:01.650> easier<00:05:01.680> because<00:05:03.440> if<00:05:04.440> so

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
but it makes a lot easier because if so

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.420 
but it makes a lot easier because if so
say<00:05:05.700> for<00:05:05.730> example<00:05:05.910> you<00:05:06.240> get<00:05:06.830> one<00:05:07.830> XP<00:05:08.160> bottle

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.190 
say for example you get one XP bottle
and<00:05:08.580> i'll<00:05:09.030> probably<00:05:09.270> get<00:05:09.450> you<00:05:09.570> between<00:05:09.720> like<00:05:10.020> a
