00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.370
 today I want to share with you something 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.550
 very strong here in the hospital where I 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.799
 work and it's a way to reflect 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.959
 what we do in our 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.959
 everyday happen I want you to see this 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.900
 respectfully and I hope with this doing 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.970
 awareness to the message I want to make 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.340
 arrive today until you do not 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.529
 we are in a situation so it is the 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.150
 day to day that we see our 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.420
 patients that we help them out 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:40.000
 go ahead look at the conditions in the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.000
 who are fighting for their lives 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.060
 since I want to get through this 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.360
 that when we are dedicated in other 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.970
 things in other aspects of our 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.100
 lives in political projects in 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.920
 work projects in projects of 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.780
 family and we have a sick family member 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.630
 as serious as the one we are reviewing 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.050
 right here in the hospital is when 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.600
 we worry and we say my God that 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.450
 I will not get sick because then 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.120
 everyone who depends on me as they go to 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.180
 finish 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.430
 I invite you to think that with this reflection 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.820
 you expect to be in such a situation 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.560
 and that your life goes by long that your 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.410
 life goes by by passing 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.930
 such important moments with your family 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.670
 with those you love most with your children with 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.430
 your brothers with your parents with your 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.970
 friends with the people that you live 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.220
 with your partner even 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.470
 or when you have a family member directly 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.440
 sick like that and break your schemes because 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.180
 we have to take care of ourselves in a 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.420
 moment more let's put this poor 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.190
 patient the surgery in trying to help 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.990
 with the destiny that they have up there 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.570
 to continue giving him a break more than 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.409
 life think a little about what you are 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.890
 doing in your life 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.210
 you think if you are on the right path 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.520
 value the situations you live in 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.069
 daily and if you have to make decisions 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.299
 because your life is not happy with whom or 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.050
 how are you 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.940
 do it do not expect to be in a bed 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.520
 to be able to determine and not even 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.990
 conscience are you going to have of it for 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.120
 to be able to do this message is very strong 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.430
 if it hits you, it's because there's something 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.170
 is wrong in your life if you have a 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.959
 family like this 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.209

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.910
 prayers when we are going to operate we 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.280
 help I invite you to that reflection of the day 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.959
 today do not expect to be prostrate 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.420
 in a bed where you can no longer do 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.430
 nothing or where the most loved relative and 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.430
 the most beloved person no longer listen to you 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.750
 and you could not tell him this year 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.410
 please that this generates awareness to 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.750
