00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.410
 which is of my standard soil is blended 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.640
 I do it to plant the same jeans and 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.540
 plants later I'll just add 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.420
 the nutrients 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.270
 so it's very simple I just cut the run 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.720
 of any take take the case the ps here 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.050

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.650
 it in a coke one or a pet bottle with 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.840
 one place of the small the world's feet

 today is monday people look just this 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.770
 From here it's a bundle and tornadoes 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.770
 apparently got it right 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 yesterday the others 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.939
 so what I usually use 3 pound of 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:59.789
 sifted vegetable land of any kind 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:04.740
 or EUR, the manure of tanned corral or 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:07.020
 June in a miniature as a spoon of 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.979
 soup I do not know if you can see here 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.970
 tablespoon every three pounds of 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.110
 earth on the stretch over fires a spoon 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.110
 soup from around the world 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.220
 3 km of land you should think it is 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:30.180
 but it is not because these products 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.670
 still a lot and do not forget you 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.330
 will add the nutrients 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.330
 in the future 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.070
 So this is just basic land that I 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.750
 I usually use transplants and even 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.100
 even to plant just leave 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.690
