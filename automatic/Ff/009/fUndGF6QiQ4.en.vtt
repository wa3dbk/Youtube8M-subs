accidents again maybe in this one you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.030 
accidents again maybe in this one you
blame<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:22.759> fellow<00:01:22.939> behind<00:01:23.740> certainly<00:01:24.740> he<00:01:24.920> was

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
blame the fellow behind certainly he was
