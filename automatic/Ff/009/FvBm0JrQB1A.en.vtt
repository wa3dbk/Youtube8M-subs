have that i have a little bit of a raspy
voice<00:03:42.790> but<00:03:43.209> that's<00:03:43.390> because<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.750> fluid

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
voice but that's because of the fluid

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.860 
voice but that's because of the fluid
buildup<00:03:44.560> but<00:03:45.340> in<00:03:45.459> general<00:03:45.670> everything<00:03:46.120> went

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
buildup but in general everything went

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.660 
buildup but in general everything went
positive<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.860> doctor<00:03:48.130> told<00:03:48.310> me<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.519> I

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
positive the doctor told me that I

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.490 
positive the doctor told me that I
believe<00:03:49.000> in<00:03:49.120> did<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.720> didn't<00:03:50.140> bleed<00:03:50.470> a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
believe in did it that I didn't bleed a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.789 
believe in did it that I didn't bleed a
lot<00:03:50.769> a<00:03:51.070> very<00:03:51.700> little<00:03:52.000> blood<00:03:52.180> was<00:03:52.420> lost<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:53.170> had<00:03:53.769> a

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
lot a very little blood was lost I had a

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.800 
lot a very little blood was lost I had a
steady<00:03:54.070> pulse<00:03:54.340> everything<00:03:54.820> went<00:03:55.000> fine<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:55.600> the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
steady pulse everything went fine so the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.340 
steady pulse everything went fine so the
cancer<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.200> out<00:03:56.350> of<00:03:56.470> me<00:03:57.690> usually<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.870> thyroid

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
cancer is out of me usually a thyroid

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.680 
cancer is out of me usually a thyroid
cancer<00:03:59.799> spreads<00:04:00.790> into<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.150> lymph<00:04:01.390> nodes

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
cancer spreads into the lymph nodes

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.930 
cancer spreads into the lymph nodes
surrounding<00:04:02.530> area<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.130> thyroid<00:04:03.340> but<00:04:03.760> he

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
surrounding area of the thyroid but he

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.850 
surrounding area of the thyroid but he
looked<00:04:04.150> at<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.570> dissected<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.470> lymph

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
looked at it and dissected the lymph

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.740 
looked at it and dissected the lymph
nodes<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:06.640> he<00:04:06.790> said<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:07.030> he<00:04:07.360> didn't<00:04:07.630> see

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
nodes and he said that he didn't see

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.830 
nodes and he said that he didn't see
anything<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.400> next<00:04:09.549> step<00:04:09.730> is<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:10.390> get<00:04:10.600> my

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
anything so the next step is to get my

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.170 
anything so the next step is to get my
radioactive<00:04:11.230> iodine<00:04:11.860> pill<00:04:12.100> which<00:04:12.820> is<00:04:13.000> gone

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
radioactive iodine pill which is gone

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.259 
radioactive iodine pill which is gone
which<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:13.570> am<00:04:13.720> going<00:04:13.959> to<00:04:14.110> take<00:04:14.350> a<00:04:15.030> month<00:04:16.030> from

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
which I am going to take a month from

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.319 
which I am going to take a month from
now<00:04:16.359> which<00:04:17.019> should<00:04:17.290> kill<00:04:17.530> any<00:04:17.739> residual

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
now which should kill any residual

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.120 
now which should kill any residual
cancer<00:04:19.329> cells<00:04:19.630> or<00:04:19.900> or<00:04:20.229> thyroid<00:04:20.590> cells<00:04:20.950> that

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
cancer cells or or thyroid cells that

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.740 
cancer cells or or thyroid cells that
might<00:04:21.340> be<00:04:21.489> left<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.030> that<00:04:22.270> should<00:04:22.479> be<00:04:22.510> pretty

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
might be left and that should be pretty

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.690 
might be left and that should be pretty
much<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.169> right<00:04:23.950> now<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.130> only<00:04:24.250> thing<00:04:24.460> that

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
much it right now the only thing that

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.180 
much it right now the only thing that
I'm<00:04:24.910> really<00:04:25.260> worried<00:04:26.260> about<00:04:26.320> not<00:04:26.800> really

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190
