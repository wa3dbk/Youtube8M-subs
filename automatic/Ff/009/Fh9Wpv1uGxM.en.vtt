so see see these screws right here okay
see<00:00:20.880> these<00:00:21.060> silver<00:00:21.660> dots<00:00:22.490> instead<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.670> using

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
see these silver dots instead of using

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.390 
see these silver dots instead of using
like<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.300> Philips<00:00:24.630> screwdriver<00:00:25.160> I'm<00:00:26.160> using

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400

the hex screwdriver because I got the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.040 
the hex screwdriver because I got the
titanium<00:00:29.960> screws<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> front<00:00:31.529> suspension

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
titanium screws for the front suspension

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.100

I<00:00:34.190> also<00:00:35.190> got<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> atomic<00:00:37.879> arms<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.239> fission

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I also got the atomic arms the fission

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.369 
I also got the atomic arms the fission
arms<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:41.719> they're<00:00:42.719> not<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> stock<00:00:43.170> ones

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
arms on it they're not the stock ones

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.490 
arms on it they're not the stock ones
anymore<00:00:43.850> then<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.940> also<00:00:45.090> got<00:00:45.500> aluminum

anymore then I also got aluminum
knuckles<00:00:47.100> from<00:00:47.340> atomic<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.620> atomic<00:00:49.890> mods

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
knuckles from atomic the not atomic mods

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.930 
knuckles from atomic the not atomic mods
but<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> actual<00:00:50.850> company<00:00:51.210> atomic<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.760> got

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
the parts I'm waiting for right now are

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.960 
the parts I'm waiting for right now are
the<00:01:02.180> is<00:01:03.180> my<00:01:03.989> chassis<00:01:05.540> SP<00:01:06.540> chassis<00:01:06.960> from<00:01:07.260> Kyosho

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
the is my chassis SP chassis from Kyosho

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.090 
the is my chassis SP chassis from Kyosho
the<00:01:08.970> SPS<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> SP<00:01:10.140> chassis<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.500> great<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the SPS at the SP chassis is great and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.640 
the SPS at the SP chassis is great and
it<00:01:11.220> has<00:01:11.250> gold<00:01:12.060> terminals<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.470> what<00:01:13.560> I'm

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it has gold terminals so that's what I'm

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.440 
it has gold terminals so that's what I'm
waiting<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.040> right<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.920> I'm<00:01:17.220> also

waiting for right now and I'm also

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.359 
waiting for right now and I'm also
debating<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.780> should<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:19.110> an<00:01:19.680> atomic

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
debating if I should get an atomic

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.140 
debating if I should get an atomic
differential<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.420> PN<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.030> other

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
differential or PN so that's the other

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.080 
differential or PN so that's the other
upgrading<00:01:24.630> needed<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.759> I'm<00:01:26.759> actually

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
upgrading needed to get and I'm actually

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
upgrading needed to get and I'm actually
almost<00:01:27.390> done<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:27.900> upgrading<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.530> car<00:01:30.110> -

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
almost done with upgrading this car -

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.740 
almost done with upgrading this car -
it's<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.500> max<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.250> guess<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.240> entire<00:01:33.479> car

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
it's like max I guess so the entire car

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.010 
it's like max I guess so the entire car
is<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.960> pretty<00:01:34.170> much<00:01:34.229> blue<00:01:35.869> but<00:01:36.869> it's

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
is like pretty much blue but it's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.359 
is like pretty much blue but it's
different<00:01:37.380> shades<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.650> blue<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.130> then<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
different shades of blue but then you

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.429 
different shades of blue but then you
can't<00:01:38.549> really<00:01:38.610> tell<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.090> camera<00:01:39.140> but<00:01:40.140> they're

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
can't really tell on camera but they're

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.499 
can't really tell on camera but they're
like<00:01:40.650> different<00:01:41.220> shades<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.490> blue<00:01:41.930> all<00:01:42.930> over

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
like different shades of blue all over

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.929 
like different shades of blue all over
and<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> finally<00:01:46.049> got<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.100> got<00:01:47.310> uh<00:01:47.340> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and then I finally got and I got uh I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.399 
and then I finally got and I got uh I
got<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.140> tall<00:01:49.439> work<00:01:50.180> little<00:01:51.180> kale<00:01:51.509> module<00:01:54.409> so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
got this tall work little kale module so

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.190 
got this tall work little kale module so
turn<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:57.259> named<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.469> MRO<00:01:59.310> three<00:02:00.200> turn

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
turn that on I named it MRO three turn

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.920 
turn that on I named it MRO three turn
the<00:02:01.320> chassis<00:02:01.649> on

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.560 

for<00:02:05.930> some<00:02:06.080> reason<00:02:06.550> when<00:02:07.550> I<00:02:07.580> turn<00:02:07.910> this<00:02:08.180> right

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
for some reason when I turn this right

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.800 
for some reason when I turn this right
the<00:02:09.140> car<00:02:09.320> turns<00:02:09.560> left<00:02:09.680> and<00:02:10.330> when<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.360> turn<00:02:11.600> left

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
the car turns left and when I turn left

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.780 
the car turns left and when I turn left
it<00:02:12.020> turns<00:02:12.230> right<00:02:13.810> see<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.250> when<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.280> pull<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
it turns right see and when I pull the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.710 
it turns right see and when I pull the
throttle<00:02:17.060> back<00:02:18.940> that's<00:02:19.940> when<00:02:20.120> he<00:02:20.210> goes<00:02:20.390> and

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
throttle back that's when he goes and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.420 
throttle back that's when he goes and
then<00:02:20.930> when<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.110> pull<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.740> way<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:22.250> is

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
then when I pull it this way this is

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.420 
then when I pull it this way this is
written<00:02:22.550> here<00:02:22.790> versus<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:24.410> got<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.190> look<00:02:25.340> at

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
written here versus so I got a look at

00:02:25.430 --> 00:03:08.559 
written here versus so I got a look at
the<00:02:25.490> manual<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.560> figure<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.680> out<00:02:27.740> but<00:02:28.220> so

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.290 

and<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.690> stiffened<00:03:10.319> um<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:11.250> honor<00:03:11.640> why<00:03:11.910> why

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
and I stiffened um this honor why why

just defend it I could have uh multiple

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.570 
just defend it I could have uh multiple
settings<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.849> could<00:03:19.160> have<00:03:20.160> different

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
settings and it could have different

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.850 
settings and it could have different
cars<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:21.030> could<00:03:21.180> have<00:03:21.330> see<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.959> says<00:03:22.110> m1<00:03:24.860> let's

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
cars I could have see it says m1 let's

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:34.850 
cars I could have see it says m1 let's
see<00:03:26.129> I<00:03:30.080> could<00:03:31.080> have<00:03:31.319> different<00:03:31.590> cars<00:03:33.829> see<00:03:34.829> I

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
see I could have different cars see I

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.270 
see I could have different cars see I
could<00:03:35.099> have<00:03:35.190> up<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.519> ten<00:03:35.700> cars<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:37.069> this<00:03:38.069> one

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
could have up to ten cars but this one

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.940 
could have up to ten cars but this one
is<00:03:39.290> mm1<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.610> then<00:03:41.610> most<00:03:42.239> ASF<00:03:42.780> mini-z<00:03:43.319> antennas

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
is mm1 and then most ASF mini-z antennas

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.309 
is mm1 and then most ASF mini-z antennas
are<00:03:44.069> black<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:45.000> then<00:03:45.180> mine's<00:03:45.480> white<00:03:45.840> because

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
are black but then mine's white because

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.740 
are black but then mine's white because
I<00:03:46.349> had<00:03:46.590> my<00:03:46.829> mine<00:03:47.579> replaced<00:03:48.000> because<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.569> broke

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
I had my mine replaced because it broke

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:58.000 
I had my mine replaced because it broke
so<00:03:49.670> have<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.819> replaced<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.569> my<00:03:52.470> gyro<00:03:52.920> unit

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.860 

so<00:03:59.010> um<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.549> can't<00:03:59.879> I<00:04:00.060> gotta<00:04:00.329> go

RC<00:04:04.799> shop<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.730> could<00:04:06.090> go<00:04:06.859> figure<00:04:07.859> out<00:04:08.010> why

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
RC shop so I could go figure out why

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.379 
RC shop so I could go figure out why
this<00:04:08.280> turns<00:04:08.730> left<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.269> into<00:04:09.630> his<00:04:09.750> right

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
this turns left and this into his right

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.440 
this turns left and this into his right
kind<00:04:12.389> of<00:04:12.420> figure<00:04:12.630> this<00:04:12.720> out<00:04:12.900> still<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:15.150> then

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
kind of figure this out still and then

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.770 
kind of figure this out still and then
here's<00:04:15.750> my<00:04:15.900> um<00:04:16.139> my<00:04:17.000> f430<00:04:18.000> body<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.510> one<00:04:18.599> that

days ago whatever looks pretty good I
didn't<00:04:29.940> use<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.270> sharpie<00:04:30.810> on<00:04:30.930> this<00:04:31.110> I<00:04:31.490> use<00:04:32.490> a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
didn't use a sharpie on this I use a

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.480 
didn't use a sharpie on this I use a
different<00:04:33.810> type<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.139> marker<00:04:34.590> but<00:04:35.250> it's<00:04:35.370> not

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
different type of marker but it's not

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.250 
different type of marker but it's not
it's<00:04:35.760> like<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.000> it's<00:04:36.450> it's<00:04:36.810> like<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:36.990> hobby

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
it's like a it's it's like a hobby

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.510 
it's like a it's it's like a hobby
marker<00:04:37.710> but<00:04:38.580> then<00:04:38.729> I<00:04:38.820> did<00:04:39.030> paint<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.570> wing<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
marker but then I did paint the wing the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.390 
marker but then I did paint the wing the
exhaust<00:04:41.910> pipes<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.349> headlights<00:04:44.479> so<00:04:46.400> but

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
exhaust pipes and the headlights so but

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.279 
exhaust pipes and the headlights so but
then<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:47.610> just<00:04:47.639> outline<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.300> everything<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:49.110> get

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
then I just outline it everything to get

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.370 
then I just outline it everything to get
all<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.680> details<00:04:50.039> up<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:51.090> then<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.360> faded<00:04:51.810> I

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
all the details up and then I faded I

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.909 
all the details up and then I faded I
did<00:04:53.280> like<00:04:53.460> this<00:04:54.050> this<00:04:55.050> technique<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.590> I

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
did like this this technique that I

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.070 
did like this this technique that I
learned<00:04:56.190> in<00:04:56.370> our<00:04:56.490> class<00:04:56.760> where<00:04:57.060> like<00:04:57.300> Eve<00:04:57.660> um

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
learned in our class where like Eve um

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.770 
learned in our class where like Eve um
you<00:04:59.070> fade<00:04:59.370> something<00:04:59.970> so<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.300> looks<00:05:00.479> like<00:05:00.570> it's

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
you fade something so it looks like it's

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.339 
you fade something so it looks like it's
smoky<00:05:01.260> so<00:05:02.039> I<00:05:02.099> did<00:05:02.250> that<00:05:02.430> to<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.820> side<00:05:03.030> vents

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
smoky so I did that to the side vents

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:08.120 
smoky so I did that to the side vents
and<00:05:04.349> then<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.770> front<00:05:05.039> vents<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:05.520> then<00:05:07.130> you

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
and then the front vents and then you

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.340 
and then the front vents and then you
can<00:05:08.280> see<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:09.539> headlights<00:05:09.870> in<00:05:09.990> there<00:05:10.169> but

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
can see that the headlights in there but

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:20.330 
can see that the headlights in there but
yeah<00:05:12.070> this<00:05:12.370> is<00:05:12.490> my<00:05:12.580> race<00:05:12.730> body<00:05:18.480> pretty<00:05:19.480> nice<00:05:19.660> so

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
yeah this is my race body pretty nice so

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.040 
yeah this is my race body pretty nice so
yeah<00:05:21.340> that's<00:05:21.700> all<00:05:21.850> my<00:05:21.970> updates<00:05:22.120> on<00:05:22.450> my<00:05:22.540> mode<00:05:22.810> 3

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
yeah that's all my updates on my mode 3

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.400 
yeah that's all my updates on my mode 3
for<00:05:23.260> now<00:05:24.660> I'll<00:05:25.660> bring<00:05:25.990> it<00:05:26.110> to<00:05:26.200> the<00:05:26.290> track

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
for now I'll bring it to the track

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.950 
for now I'll bring it to the track
pretty<00:05:26.680> soon<00:05:26.920> and<00:05:27.130> test<00:05:27.730> it<00:05:27.850> out<00:05:27.940> with<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.840> new

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
pretty soon and test it out with the new

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.110 
pretty soon and test it out with the new
controller<00:05:29.380> this<00:05:30.250> controller<00:05:30.310> is<00:05:30.850> not<00:05:30.940> new

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
controller this controller is not new

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.220 
controller this controller is not new
but<00:05:31.300> then<00:05:31.780> use<00:05:31.960> 2.4<00:05:32.800> system<00:05:33.190> well<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.840> know

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
but then use 2.4 system well you know

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.620 
but then use 2.4 system well you know
anything<00:05:35.500> but<00:05:36.060> that's<00:05:37.060> pretty<00:05:37.240> much<00:05:37.330> it<00:05:37.510> for

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
anything but that's pretty much it for

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:47.670 
anything but that's pretty much it for
now<00:05:37.690> on<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.410> pianist<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:40.170> so<00:05:46.170> and<00:05:47.170> I<00:05:47.260> might<00:05:47.470> um

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
now on the pianist and so and I might um

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.640 
now on the pianist and so and I might um
switch<00:05:48.100> to<00:05:48.340> an<00:05:48.490> atomic<00:05:48.760> USA<00:05:49.390> motor<00:05:49.660> instead<00:05:50.500> of

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
switch to an atomic USA motor instead of

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.940 
switch to an atomic USA motor instead of
the<00:05:50.740> peanut<00:05:51.010> 70<00:05:53.010> so<00:05:54.750> that's<00:05:55.750> it<00:05:55.900> so<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.920> only

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
the peanut 70 so that's it so the only

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.880 
the peanut 70 so that's it so the only
thing<00:05:57.490> stock<00:05:57.970> on<00:05:58.240> this<00:05:58.420> is<00:05:58.720> the<00:05:59.500> chassis

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
thing stock on this is the chassis

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.100 
thing stock on this is the chassis
that's<00:06:00.490> all<00:06:00.760> at<00:06:00.940> stock<00:06:01.330> and<00:06:02.190> yeah<00:06:04.080> thanks<00:06:05.080> for
