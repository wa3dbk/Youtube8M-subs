anything that the average person doesn't

anything that the average person doesn't

unless he or she properly practices that

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
technique the breathing aspect as far as

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.019 
technique the breathing aspect as far as
I'm<00:00:27.650> concerned<00:00:28.130> is<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.550> single<00:00:29.000> most

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
I'm concerned is the single most

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.330 
I'm concerned is the single most
important<00:00:29.840> thing<00:00:30.019> in<00:00:30.289> sustaining<00:00:31.070> a<00:00:31.160> good

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
important thing in sustaining a good

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.759 
important thing in sustaining a good
quality<00:00:31.640> sound<00:00:31.910> on<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.150> sax<00:00:32.480> I<00:00:32.750> think<00:00:33.470> that<00:00:33.590> so

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
quality sound on a sax I think that so

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:35.200 
quality sound on a sax I think that so
many<00:00:33.890> beginners<00:00:34.489> are<00:00:34.640> under<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:35.000> illusion

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
many beginners are under the illusion

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.360 
many beginners are under the illusion
that<00:00:35.390> all<00:00:35.600> they<00:00:35.780> need<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:36.079> do<00:00:36.260> is<00:00:36.410> waggle<00:00:37.070> their

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
that all they need to do is waggle their

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.220 
that all they need to do is waggle their
fingers<00:00:37.700> a<00:00:37.730> bit<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:38.120> blow<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.450> little<00:00:38.780> bit<00:00:38.930> and

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
fingers a bit and blow a little bit and

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.319 
fingers a bit and blow a little bit and
hey<00:00:39.500> presto<00:00:39.530> they've<00:00:40.010> got<00:00:40.160> a<00:00:40.190> good<00:00:40.430> sound<00:00:40.610> well

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
hey presto they've got a good sound well

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.720 
hey presto they've got a good sound well
it's<00:00:41.510> not<00:00:41.750> true<00:00:42.160> try<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:43.280> think<00:00:43.430> of<00:00:43.579> the

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
it's not true try and think of the

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.110 
it's not true try and think of the
saxophone<00:00:44.239> as<00:00:44.570> an<00:00:44.719> extension<00:00:45.410> of<00:00:45.500> your<00:00:45.680> body

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
saxophone as an extension of your body

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.580 
saxophone as an extension of your body
remember<00:00:47.120> when<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.329> great<00:00:47.629> singer<00:00:48.050> produces<00:00:48.559> a

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
remember when a great singer produces a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.590 
remember when a great singer produces a
great<00:00:48.890> sounding<00:00:49.370> note<00:00:49.640> it's<00:00:50.149> normally

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
great sounding note it's normally

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.209 
great sounding note it's normally
because<00:00:50.780> all<00:00:50.989> their<00:00:51.289> breathing<00:00:51.739> muscles<00:00:52.100> are

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
because all their breathing muscles are

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.910 
because all their breathing muscles are
properly<00:00:52.730> engaged<00:00:53.149> in<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.510> process<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.289> so

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
properly engaged in the process and so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.439 
properly engaged in the process and so
often<00:00:55.250> too<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:55.399> see<00:00:55.610> beginners<00:00:56.059> just<00:00:56.270> take<00:00:56.420> a

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
often too I see beginners just take a

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.600 
often too I see beginners just take a
shallow<00:00:56.870> breath<00:00:57.110> filling<00:00:57.770> up<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.039> upper<00:00:58.370> part

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
shallow breath filling up the upper part

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.819 
shallow breath filling up the upper part
of<00:00:58.730> their<00:00:58.910> chest<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.660> as<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:00.320> result<00:01:00.710> they

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
of their chest and as a result they

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.090 
of their chest and as a result they
produce<00:01:01.129> a<00:01:01.250> weakened<00:01:01.670> unsustained<00:01:02.539> tone<00:01:03.100> so

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
produce a weakened unsustained tone so

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.160 
produce a weakened unsustained tone so
the<00:01:04.220> bus<00:01:04.460> phrase<00:01:04.759> here<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.270> going<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.660> be<00:01:05.810> deep

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
the bus phrase here is going to be deep

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.770 
the bus phrase here is going to be deep
breathing<00:01:06.800> if<00:01:07.130> we<00:01:07.850> can<00:01:08.060> learn<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.479> breathe

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
breathing if we can learn to breathe

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.990 
breathing if we can learn to breathe
properly<00:01:09.170> then<00:01:09.710> we've<00:01:09.920> really<00:01:10.189> set<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.610> basis

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
properly then we've really set the basis

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.969 
properly then we've really set the basis
for<00:01:11.150> producing<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.810> good<00:01:12.110> quality<00:01:12.710> sound

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
for producing a good quality sound

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.859 
for producing a good quality sound
throughout<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.700> entire<00:01:14.150> range<00:01:14.479> of<00:01:14.810> the

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
throughout the entire range of the

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.360 
throughout the entire range of the
instrument

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.860 

okay<00:01:23.370> now<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.760> time<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.270> talk<00:01:24.450> about<00:01:24.480> the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
okay now it's time to talk about the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.290 
okay now it's time to talk about the
diaphragm<00:01:25.310> not<00:01:26.310> only<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.760> a<00:01:26.850> really<00:01:27.000> hard

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
diaphragm not only is it a really hard

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.450 
diaphragm not only is it a really hard
word<00:01:27.510> to<00:01:27.540> spell<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.040> also<00:01:29.280> a

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
word to spell but it's also a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.640 
word to spell but it's also a
dome-shaped<00:01:29.790> organ<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.870> like<00:01:31.020> which<00:01:31.470> is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
dome-shaped organ if you like which is

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.130 
dome-shaped organ if you like which is
situated<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:33.000> below<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.480> ribcage<00:01:33.690> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
situated here just below the ribcage and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770 
situated here just below the ribcage and
above<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> abdomen<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.180> idea<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
above the abdomen and the idea of the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.990 
above the abdomen and the idea of the
diaphragm<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> when<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.250> breathe<00:01:38.580> in<00:01:38.790> is

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
diaphragm is that when we breathe in is

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.420 
diaphragm is that when we breathe in is
the<00:01:39.420> thing<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.780> pulls<00:01:40.050> down<00:01:40.260> and<00:01:40.710> draws<00:01:41.070> air

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the thing that pulls down and draws air

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.060 
the thing that pulls down and draws air
into<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.120> lungs<00:01:42.440> now<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.500> funny<00:01:43.770> thing<00:01:43.890> about

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
into the lungs now the funny thing about

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.860 
into the lungs now the funny thing about
the<00:01:44.340> diaphragm<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.300> don't<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.720> any

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
the diaphragm is that we don't have any

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.900 
the diaphragm is that we don't have any
direct<00:01:46.290> experience<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:47.370> we<00:01:47.760> only

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
direct experience of it we only

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.090 
direct experience of it we only
experience<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.540> effects<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.320> its<00:01:49.560> use

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
experience the effects of its use

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.300 
experience the effects of its use
however<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.540> controlled<00:01:52.170> by<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> abdominal

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
however it's controlled by the abdominal

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.070 
however it's controlled by the abdominal
muscles<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.940> this<00:01:54.330> is<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> area<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
muscles so this is the area to

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.840 
muscles so this is the area to
concentrate<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.400> we're<00:01:56.550> trying<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
concentrate on when we're trying to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.930 
concentrate on when we're trying to
perfect<00:01:57.240> diaphragm<00:01:57.900> breathing<00:01:58.490> one<00:01:59.490> analogy

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
perfect diaphragm breathing one analogy

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.090 
perfect diaphragm breathing one analogy
I<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.570> apply<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.260> that<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.560> see<00:02:01.800> our

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
I like to apply is that we see our

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.130 
I like to apply is that we see our
diaphragm<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.119> our<00:02:03.420> lungs

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
diaphragm and our lungs

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.100 
diaphragm and our lungs
this<00:02:04.320> whole<00:02:04.530> cavity<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.490> giant<00:02:06.000> balloon<00:02:06.180> so

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
this whole cavity as a giant balloon so

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.719 
this whole cavity as a giant balloon so
that<00:02:07.140> when<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.530> breathe<00:02:07.800> in<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.010> try<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.459> fill

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that when we breathe in we try and fill

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.300 
that when we breathe in we try and fill
up<00:02:08.880> this<00:02:09.060> giant<00:02:09.450> balloon<00:02:09.750> now<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.770> try<00:02:11.010> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
up this giant balloon now we can try a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.850 
up this giant balloon now we can try a
few<00:02:11.700> practice<00:02:12.120> exercises<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:13.320> we<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.560> place

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
few practice exercises if we just place

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.490 
few practice exercises if we just place
our<00:02:14.070> hands<00:02:14.400> around<00:02:15.120> here<00:02:15.810> such<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.200> we're

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
our hands around here such that we're

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.010 
our hands around here such that we're
just<00:02:16.620> touching<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.490> lower<00:02:18.060> part<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.810> ribs

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
just touching the lower part of the ribs

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.600 
just touching the lower part of the ribs
are<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> front<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.890> with<00:02:20.100> our<00:02:20.190> thumbs

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
are in the front and with our thumbs

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.940 
are in the front and with our thumbs
we're<00:02:21.540> also<00:02:21.840> touching<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.350> ribs<00:02:22.530> at<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> back

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
we're also touching the ribs at the back

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.920 
we're also touching the ribs at the back
and<00:02:23.550> as<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:23.940> try<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.240> take<00:02:24.360> in<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.630> deep<00:02:24.870> breath

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
and as we try and take in a deep breath

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.290 
and as we try and take in a deep breath
we're<00:02:25.860> gonna<00:02:25.980> try<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.459> feel<00:02:26.670> some<00:02:26.910> movement

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
we're gonna try and feel some movement

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.449 
we're gonna try and feel some movement
not<00:02:27.720> only<00:02:27.780> around<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.350> front<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:28.890> also<00:02:29.280> run

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
not only around the front but also run

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:38.930 
not only around the front but also run
the<00:02:29.580> back<00:02:36.680> now<00:02:37.680> as<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.130> do<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.610> feel<00:02:38.910> a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the back now as I do that I feel a

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.580 
the back now as I do that I feel a
little<00:02:39.150> bit<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.480> expansion<00:02:39.900> around<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.410> back

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
little bit of expansion around the back

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.620 
little bit of expansion around the back
and<00:02:40.830> when<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.250> when<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.790> get<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.150> expansion

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
and when you when you get that expansion

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.300 
and when you when you get that expansion
you<00:02:42.989> know<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.320> you're<00:02:43.440> really<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.860> business

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
you know that you're really in business

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.580 
you know that you're really in business
so<00:02:45.209> let's<00:02:45.450> put<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.840> embouchure<00:02:46.230> and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
so let's put the embouchure and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.830 
so let's put the embouchure and
breathing<00:02:47.010> aspects<00:02:47.489> into<00:02:47.700> practice<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.360> try

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
breathing aspects into practice and try

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.199 
breathing aspects into practice and try
playing<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.350> long<00:02:49.560> note<00:02:49.769> on<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.190> saxophone<00:02:53.209> now

if you remember from before we had our

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.120 
if you remember from before we had our
two<00:02:57.239> thumbs<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.810> position<00:02:58.290> here<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.830> here

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
fingering yet so when we just brought

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.330 
fingering yet so when we just brought
down<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.019> saxophone<00:03:04.500> without<00:03:04.769> choosing<00:03:05.220> to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
down the saxophone without choosing to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.160 
down the saxophone without choosing to
play<00:03:05.459> any<00:03:05.640> fingering<00:03:06.060> we<00:03:06.360> get<00:03:06.540> what<00:03:06.900> we<00:03:07.019> call

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170

mention here it's really important to
try<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.650> avoid<00:03:30.800> putting<00:03:31.430> tension<00:03:31.970> into<00:03:32.090> all

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360

notes the only tension should be in the

reach the end of the long note that the
feeling<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:50.810> I've<00:03:50.959> emptied<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.620> my<00:03:51.739> lung

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
feeling that I've emptied to my lung

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.979

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
muscles have gone to their limit so this

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.729 
muscles have gone to their limit so this
time<00:03:56.690> I'm<00:03:56.810> going<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.989> plead<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.349> note<00:03:57.500> again

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
time I'm going to plead the note again

and I'm gonna place my hand just here
and<00:04:00.170> try<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:00.890> feel<00:04:01.160> for<00:04:01.819> that<00:04:01.970> movement<00:04:02.329> in

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
and try it and feel for that movement in

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.120

the ribs as I reached the end of the
