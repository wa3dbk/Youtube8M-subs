00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.610
 many people think that the 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.130
 brain functioning is similar 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.400
 to a machine , however, it does not have 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.320
 as many similarities as it seems in 10 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.800
 data know the differences between 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 human brain and a computer 1 the 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.490
 brain is analog and the computer 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.560
 digital 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.870
 neurons are often described 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.460
 as binaries because they lead to a 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.649
 concrete action when they reach 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.510
 determined threshold for this is that it 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.430
 he wrongly said that the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.450
 neurons can work for only one 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.270
 combined linear function 2 memory is 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.880
 of addressable content in the 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.770
 computers access information 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.230
 by the direction in which exact 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.050
 finds however the brain has 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.560
 a content memory addressed is 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.650
 ie through concepts close 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.140
 the brain is parallel the computer 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.300
 serial while computers 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.060
 they have specific areas for memory 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.520
 and other functions in the brain this is 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.430
 more complex the neurons that help the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.620
 memory process are scattered in the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.000
 brain and not located in a place 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:22.150
 specific 4 the time is different in 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.690
 the brain the computer owns a clock 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.980
 and its parts act in a precise time 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.510
 determined by your side of the brain 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.070
 human depends on factors such as 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.960
 time of the signals that electro 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.500
 chemicals that determine some 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.290
 neuronal activities 5 memory a 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.180
 short term is not like ram memory the 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.430
 short- term memory has to do with 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.110
 nearby indications and ideas that we 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.750
 lead to long- term memory 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.140
 while the ram contains information 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.570
 equal to the one on the hard drive 6 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.810
 the brain and the mind can not be 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.670
 distinguish how software and hardware is 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.979
 tempting to think that the brain can 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.120
 distinguish yourself as a hardware and mind 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.460
 as a software 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.380
 however the problem is that everything 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.350
 change in the mind brings a change in the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.290
 brain and that the mind emerges 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.480
 directly from the brain 7 the synapse 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.370
 is more complex than the electrical process 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.930
 although it is usually thought that neurons 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.360
 they work by electrical impulses 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.310
 similar to those of a computer in 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.280
 reality are electrochemical impulses 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.930
 that travel much slower 8 the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.780
 information processing and 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.190
 memory depend on the same in the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.680
 brain information processing 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.690
 and the memory are carried out by the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.170
 same areas while in a 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.630
 computer are two very different things 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.060
 9 the brain is an auto system 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.340
 organized the brain can heal itself 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.740
 same as multitask 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.960
 same time from the same areas in 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.810
 change in computers each piece 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.020
 it works separately by dividing these 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.390
 areas 10 the brain remembers the 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.400
 spatiality unlike the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.380
 computers the brain keeps 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.170
 information about spatiality and 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.270
 size of objects giving us this 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.270
 information in a matter of seconds 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.459
