00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.939
 i 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:18.860
 Exercise number 24 extension 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.779
 knee extension there is that has 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.619
 leg extension but a distension 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.509
 of only kneeling legs is so 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.480
 easy to carry that roller that has 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.360
 days from bottom to top we will choose from 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.300
 up and down it 's that simple 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.770
 machine what to keep in mind 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.719
 As always, you have to accompany 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.030
 movement we go from above we have to do 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.920
 the movement trying to make the plates 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.910
 do not get to crash when they are 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.250
 Going up and down 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.750
 and things that we can take into account in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.480
 this exercise for example is that it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.570
 can use a little more intensity 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.090
 if we leave the knees stretched there 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.010
 above 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.420
 another thing that we can take into account 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.620
 It seems that in the press machine 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.590
 many people have it in mind but 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.100
 It seems that this machine does not reach us 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.080
 to think what is the tips of the feet if 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.710
 we take them in that position and we do 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.110
 the movement we will talk a little more about 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.140
 importance to the musculature of the part 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.840
 external of the box is equal says it is 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.790
 anterior part of the leg points towards 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.830
 inside is more important the work of 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.110
 the outside part if we take the tips 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.330
 to the other position we will be working 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.180
 is cutting more importance to the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.670
 inner part of the leg 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.010
 although we take the neutral tips in the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.030
 center at the beginning as we are giving 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.030
 a general job 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.979
 we take the air by going down what 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.979
 we throw up 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.840
 i 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.750
 Y
