00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.910
 another hint of carpentry here as 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.119
 pass glue on fashion ribbon devices 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.090
 on the team and I saw some on the internet 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.870
 May develop in my own way that I 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.040
 I adapted better so I'll tell you 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.160
 how do you do 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.640
 This is the end to come down that are 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.399
 this is a blue tube like 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.270
 You gotta understand, and he's better than 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.980
 work and what you do with nt brings 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.590
 pleasure three parts 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.320
 here we already have a practical part used 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:08.710
 on this side and now I'm going to do the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:08.710
 another here ready to be used 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:19.990
 and this part is where the 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:27.979
 cartel in case I did this here 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:31.220
 just a screw here put the 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.940
 tape roll right out the screw here 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.920
 Go out, this one puts the tape on and then 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.789
 prize is the poster 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.179
 then we will not put here and acre 2 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.179
 to 0 here in the base to facilitate ne 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:56.239
 in place of this piece here I left it 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.789
 schaffrah of a piece of mdf that is 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:02.720
 From the height to the glue always stay a little 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:06.160
 tilted to the side of the tape where 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.160
 is installing in the case 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.770
 screw her here on the bar 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:48.290

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:24.950
 dock here offer alan 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:29.000
 here we will get the tape to go under 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.799
 iaee presses the mud puts the other there 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.109
 that you can to give me the gift of 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:44.230
 from the glue reservoir 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:44.230
 there we go there at the table 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:57.420
 A little one, so now we're going to 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.650
 Test here to go a little bit 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:10.440
 or is it that we put glue here 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:13.890
 in this reservoir and in the mud to test 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.919
 firm and just pull there you will see here 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.090

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:36.930
 tape in the past and not the glue is 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:05:00.479
 dirt on the sides 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:05:03.120
 here the device is for the tape of 18 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:07.440
 it passes here and depending on the width 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.680
 tape is the width apart from here 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.260
 of the device in the center 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.810
 as the tape width leave this 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.100
 piece in the same width and will spend with 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.090
 arise here 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.580
 tape with the glue well past or 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.850
 detailed line and no tape arises because 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:30.419
