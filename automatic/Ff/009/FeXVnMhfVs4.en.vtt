00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.060
 all rushing 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.340
 and spend 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.340
 day 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.490
 when forging a bar 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.769
 small house 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.730
 the total grinding area is about 600 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.730
 square meters 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.009
 here we have 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.009
 the task is complicated by a large number 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.160
 here are the hooks yet 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.700
 they pass 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.700
 these are 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:51.100
 these are the ones we need to close up 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.100
 many blacks also have cracks 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:02.270
 that's how evil 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:08.000
 as evil I do not see any bad where 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:14.570
 they are very large but here they are 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.290
 Well, she stenochka we have area 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.290
 polished 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.090
 you can see the difference here with us too 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.899
 polished 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:40.930
 here for example unpolished still there 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:40.930
 while pokuisty covered protective impregnation 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.560
 Well, actually we are doing 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.630
 Long thought how to close up these 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.810
 crack knots found special 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.039
 composition for parquet flooring fil 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.630
 from the company or pie and 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:06.690
 experimented about race skill and 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.569
 then here this stenochki express 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.219
 rotten 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:18.219
 in nile and laid parquet philon 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:20.930
 together with Kohler Kohler found dry 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:25.700
 added it with sawdust well, not on 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:29.450
 files with sanding dust composition of liquidation 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:34.669
 rock and now got so close in tone 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.650
 color with a knot here in principle we 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.480
 Of course not artists pick each 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.549
 like under each bitch your color we donâ€™t 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.299
 we will be because in the future we will 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:47.180
 cover it with four layers 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.120
 white oil is basically enough to 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.150
 the tone was just close to not 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:58.389
 there are no such places right here 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.969
 Kohler this here is a bitch he hurt he just 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:06.290
 grinding dust with a face lesson without 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:10.340
 pigment and from afar generally these places 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.750
 they are noticeable so we will be here again 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:18.919
 same engrave them and close up 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.150
 the composition that we will go all all 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:23.150
 Thanks for attention 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.549
 so I can say right away that this 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.939
 the composition of it is quite non-shrink 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.689
 have we putty putty with a little 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:36.409
 mood and flow are ground off 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:41.419
 it dries quickly 20 30 minutes 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:43.349
 the layer may be longer in general rather 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:46.090
 all that 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.930
 will this composition hold on enough 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.750
 long anyway up to two 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:58.020
 centimeters 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.210
 potholes and it covers all thanks for 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.930
 Attention 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.870

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.040
