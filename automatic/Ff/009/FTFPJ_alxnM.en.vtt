let's<00:00:23.000> have<00:00:23.180> a<00:00:23.210> look<00:00:23.420> at<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.840> left<00:00:24.110> hand<00:00:24.440> now

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
let's have a look at the left hand now

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.000 
let's have a look at the left hand now
the<00:00:26.030> soft<00:00:26.330> pad<00:00:26.690> of<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.870> thumb<00:00:26.990> should<00:00:27.770> be<00:00:27.920> at

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
the thickest part of the neck where it's

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.040 
the thickest part of the neck where it's
curved<00:00:30.880> there's<00:00:31.880> always<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.180> temptation<00:00:32.480> to

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
curved there's always a temptation to

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.410 
curved there's always a temptation to
move<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.530> thumb<00:00:33.740> up<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:34.400> almost<00:00:34.850> hook<00:00:35.270> it

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420

move the thumb up and almost hook it
around<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.810> top<00:00:36.050> but<00:00:36.800> try<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:37.190> avoid<00:00:37.370> this<00:00:37.670> as
