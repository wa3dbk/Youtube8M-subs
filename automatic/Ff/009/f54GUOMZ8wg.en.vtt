00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
this they come up for oxygen because

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.800 
this they come up for oxygen because

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
there's when it gets hot the hotness

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.539 
there's when it gets hot the hotness
takes<00:01:56.140> away<00:01:56.409> all<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.619> oxygen<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.460> water

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
takes away all the oxygen in the water

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.840 
takes away all the oxygen in the water
and<00:01:58.390> there<00:01:58.659> are<00:01:58.869> one

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and there are one

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.910

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
well all the fish move to other places

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.789 
well all the fish move to other places
the<00:02:03.250> GAR<00:02:03.490> stay<00:02:03.789> here<00:02:04.270> because<00:02:05.049> they<00:02:05.229> can<00:02:05.409> come

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
the GAR stay here because they can come

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.709 
the GAR stay here because they can come
out<00:02:05.950> of<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.130> water<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.640> breathe<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.119> air<00:02:07.359> and

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
out of the water and breathe the air and

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.850 
out of the water and breathe the air and
get<00:02:07.869> oxygen

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
get oxygen

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.369 
get oxygen
