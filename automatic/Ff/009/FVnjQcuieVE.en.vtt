00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.400
 and now what I do is the first time 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.769
 I'm with the black classics and good 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.559
 surviving that is my lady has 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.769
 left the girl and I do not know my in-laws 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.539
 they walk from ill discussions at home a 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:23.670
 disaster and the Lord loves your family 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.490
 but they are your parents 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.980
 you have never been married as you know and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.199
 you saw the doctor does not need to be 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.200
 sick to heal to understand the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.930
 family you have to contemplate in Mary the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.030
 mother at the wedding of the Canary Islands 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.480
 Fortune with the curiosity of others 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 he does not get involved in his world he does not criticize 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.440
 the weddings and cataluña realizes that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.290
 lack wine sign of joy and love 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.579
 how many young children grandparents mothers 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.409
 single women do not perceive that at home 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:03.079
 the gramado has not been decided for a while 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:05.500
 now it is not a sound that said 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.500
 to be entertained with Maria's mistakes 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.979
 it's just mother and the scream listen 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.979
 this so let me repeat 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.650
 when the term dying already comes with 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.780
 trust to jesus the answer seems 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.020
 uninhabited the trouble klose teaches to 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.760
 pray, lighting our hope 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.180
 worries are also 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.550
 God's concerns in the family the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.600
 prayer also reminds us I think 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.260
 us with close neighbors who live 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.510
 under the same roof and is needed 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.750
 praying always makes us pray when 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.880
 speak or what we lack and help 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.880
 put ourselves in the shoes of the others 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.830
 who loves and serves especially in the 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.259
 family there we make ourselves for love 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.259
 servers from each other 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.650
 özil and we learn to ask permission to 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.650
 say thank you 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.240
 or voracity and there I learned too 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.370
 to ask for forgiveness when we do some damage 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.430
 We overcome a mother loves her children 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.220
 with are anyone discarded any 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.230
 others like the sad fingers if they puncture 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.720
 extinct in the same thing that is punctured in 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.360
 she the love of the wallabies does 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.670
 feel more God's love plane like this 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.160
 like the new wine in the family the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.650
 miners are made with what we are with 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.620
 that this hand and many times is not what 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.550
 that we dream nothing their answers 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.459
 nothing is useless but how difficult I am 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.989
 live in the midst of so much difficulty here 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.110
 there is the detail 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.090
 in the end they liked the best of the children 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.489
 although the statistics say what 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.880
 otherwise the best wines are 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.940
 to come in those moments 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.060
 he murmured in them until they whispered to him 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.410
 desperate achievements to the loveless my 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.470
 patience 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.860
 has hope as well as Maria prays 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.610
 current opens the heart because the best 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.620
 the wines are coming Jesus wants to give 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.020
 to take the best of the wines between 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.800
 Who are you routeing all the jars 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.330
 where only wine discouragement 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.560
 I 'm going better I do not know how to recover the joy 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.560
