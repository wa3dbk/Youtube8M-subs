 perch twitching perch catching his son 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.750
 in careers lakes ponds 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.650
 so it is possible for the rivers it will not 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.519
 so relevant to the reservoir in the course but 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.090
 for ponds 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:42.090
 they seemed all right and I'll start 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:44.550
 perhaps here with these baits is in the mountains 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:52.620
 from pontoon21 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:54.780
 croc jackie in general initially that is 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.280
 actively began to engage in fishing twitching 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.059
 I'm in the ninth year and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.059
 where a glimpse 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.420
 or online or somewhere learned big 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.110
 not bad caught fish on a pontoon wobbler 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.110
 21 cheerful 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.770
 and I came to the area in my area this 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.360
 Noginsk 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:28.700
 to shop and get cheerful and 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.979
 consultant from the store as if for a heap 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.310
 offered to try the project 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.170
 I bought 48 crane jack such a plan 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.979
 Of course it is no longer here for a long time 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:44.060
 I will cut off 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:46.729
 long ago you are torn off bought 40 with microjig 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:53.509
 and I arrived at the pond with perch 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:56.319
 where before so a perch smacked at 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.810
 turntable tried on this wobbler 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:03.590
 beetle wiring and seemed great here 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.429
 48 model project they come with 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.109
 different depths of me 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:15.160
 Well, I have mr this moment seemed 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.160
 from excellent 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:28.510
 casting distance excellent opera 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:30.489
 hooks he is beautiful well only 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.689
 minus very fast round 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.730
 coating peeling off but even at noblesse 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:41.909
 I had almost no cover at all 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.909
 lure on them perch took well 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.620
 which wiring 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.430
 generally perch catching different wiring 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.560
 but one of the most optimal postings 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.129
 this is to say so in expression 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.489
 famous angler andrey petertsov a 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.230
 this is a chaotic monotonous twitching in 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.590
 principle on the channel i have wiring 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.599
 lures and I then sit down on 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:16.389
 I think for every respectable mountain I will do 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:20.310
 separate video with postings and a little 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:24.040
 larger model Kara Jack 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.519
 58 on it can get bigger he sits a 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.250
 also pikes tumble well naturally 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.939
 if mediocre bite is better to catch 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.310
 this one 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:41.400
 48 aurora in general seemed 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:44.400
 great the only thing annoying is that 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 moskanella 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:52.449
 The main supplier of these cranks 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.150
 lures too began to break prices 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:58.769
 these lures 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.370
 that is, they are already coming out of the middle 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.370
 price budget 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:16.290
 already expensive approaching so well here it is 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:19.500
 most famous choosing a wobbler from the company 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.710
 debate all clean ridge clothing 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:29.970
 floating that's my favorite 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:37.970
 wobbler then from the ninth year on him 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:43.950
 caught more than 500 perches already 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:49.650
 the second pair of hooks here are tees i'm with 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:53.940
 some ponto on 21 took too 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.970
 soon on to replace the wobbler 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.610
 show just great yet 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.640
 the height of the amount of akunin just caught 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.720
 awesome and by this wobbler i'm 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.130
 I'll take off soon 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:13.100
 surely the video is just the last time 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:17.160
 he chose badly now closer to september 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.669
 I think the bite will increase and it will be possible to remove 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.070
 good video and you can try the other day 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.070
 possible postings are also allowed and 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.910
 chaotic monotonous twitching and 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.740
 delays i mean i do two three jerks 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:39.419
 short pause withstood two more 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:43.650
 Handle pause and bass attacks well, all the 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:47.570
 kite she constantly in principle and pike 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.510
 attack cover better than pontoons 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:56.910
 But in four years, of course, where 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:59.550
 touching hooks noticeably scratched but 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.720
 it's all the same to him confuse Jack already 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.020
 long 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.850
 new of 9 that's exactly from the ninth year 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.080
 my favorite forehead came in October 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:17.310
 forest ice water 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:23.040
 sometimes to save him so here it is 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:27.660
 bait this kosadaka ion xs 55s 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.940
 In principle, this analogue can be said 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.720
 guys from college whom just 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:37.340

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:46.640
 poklevok less than ridge but all 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.640

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.160
