like well I mean you'd use them but you
could<00:04:09.239> just<00:04:09.329> hit<00:04:09.569> on<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> bottle<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.260> just

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
could just hit on a bottle and just

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.589 
could just hit on a bottle and just
watch<00:04:10.739> yourself<00:04:10.949> when<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:13.220> guess<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:14.599> let's

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
watch yourself when I guess like let's

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.719 
watch yourself when I guess like let's
coming<00:04:15.810> in<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:15.989> future<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.970> don't<00:04:17.970> even<00:04:18.060> know

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
coming in the future I don't even know

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.930 
coming in the future I don't even know
Vargas<00:04:20.729> legend<00:04:21.419> vortex<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.729> don't<00:04:23.729> know<00:04:23.789> if<00:04:23.849> I'd

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
Vargas legend vortex I don't know if I'd

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.790 
Vargas legend vortex I don't know if I'd
use<00:04:23.969> errands<00:04:24.510> for<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:24.900> though<00:04:25.169> probably

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
use errands for that though probably

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.960 
use errands for that though probably
actually<00:04:26.490> yep

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
actually yep

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.480 
actually yep
all<00:04:27.000> because<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:28.380> reason<00:04:28.500> sarens<00:04:28.950> so<00:04:29.130> strong

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
all because the reason sarens so strong

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.250 
all because the reason sarens so strong
especially<00:04:29.880> even<00:04:30.300> in<00:04:30.420> frontier<00:04:30.780> hunter<00:04:30.900> is

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
especially even in frontier hunter is

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.740 
especially even in frontier hunter is
because<00:04:31.560> she<00:04:31.710> had<00:04:31.830> she<00:04:31.980> causes<00:04:32.280> weakness

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
because she had she causes weakness

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.040 
because she had she causes weakness
weakness<00:04:33.750> reduces<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:36.150> enemy<00:04:36.450> units<00:04:36.750> attack

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
weakness reduces the enemy units attack

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.590 
weakness reduces the enemy units attack
by<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.410> lot<00:04:37.680> like<00:04:37.980> Dragon<00:04:38.820> mimics<00:04:39.120> can<00:04:39.300> normally

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
by a lot like Dragon mimics can normally

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.380 
by a lot like Dragon mimics can normally
do<00:04:39.750> like<00:04:39.960> 1600<00:04:40.800> damage<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.640> you<00:04:41.760> when<00:04:42.360> they

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
do like 1600 damage to you when they

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.650 
do like 1600 damage to you when they
have<00:04:42.570> weakness<00:04:42.930> on<00:04:43.080> them<00:04:43.290> they<00:04:43.500> do<00:04:43.560> like<00:04:43.800> 400

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
have weakness on them they do like 400

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.180 
have weakness on them they do like 400
so<00:04:45.660> like<00:04:45.900> when<00:04:46.230> I'm<00:04:46.350> grinding<00:04:46.530> now<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:47.010> can<00:04:47.160> just

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
so like when I'm grinding now I can just

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.270 
so like when I'm grinding now I can just
like<00:04:47.430> Auto<00:04:47.670> through<00:04:49.100> formidable<00:04:50.100> presence

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
like Auto through formidable presence

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.680 
like Auto through formidable presence
which<00:04:50.670> is<00:04:50.850> like<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.120> best<00:04:51.240> place<00:04:51.450> to<00:04:51.600> get

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
which is like the best place to get

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.480 
which is like the best place to get
experience<00:04:52.140> in<00:04:52.500> drops<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:52.980> Zelan<00:04:53.190> everything

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
experience in drops and Zelan everything

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.880 
experience in drops and Zelan everything
right<00:04:53.610> now<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.200> never<00:04:55.410> had<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.650> worry<00:04:55.830> about

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
right now and I never had to worry about

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.220 
right now and I never had to worry about
drag<00:04:56.220> mimic<00:04:56.520> killing<00:04:57.330> one<00:04:57.450> of<00:04:57.480> my<00:04:57.690> units

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
drag mimic killing one of my units

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.740 
drag mimic killing one of my units
because<00:04:58.620> they're<00:04:59.550> so<00:04:59.940> weak<00:05:00.150> when<00:05:00.480> they<00:05:00.600> get

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
because they're so weak when they get

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.770 
because they're so weak when they get
weakened<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.940> like<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.060> bosses<00:05:03.360> themselves

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
weakened and like the bosses themselves

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.080 
weakened and like the bosses themselves
they<00:05:03.870> get<00:05:03.990> weakened<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:04.800> thinking<00:05:05.370> cause

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
they get weakened to you thinking cause

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.870 
they get weakened to you thinking cause
weakness<00:05:06.300> on<00:05:06.540> miracle<00:05:06.870> totem<00:05:07.490> at<00:05:08.490> least<00:05:08.670> I

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
weakness on miracle totem at least I

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.420 
weakness on miracle totem at least I
didn't<00:05:09.420> this<00:05:09.600> run<00:05:09.870> for<00:05:10.050> whatever<00:05:10.350> reason<00:05:10.740> but

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
didn't this run for whatever reason but

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.200 
didn't this run for whatever reason but
you<00:05:11.610> can<00:05:11.730> see<00:05:11.880> here<00:05:12.120> still<00:05:12.660> I<00:05:13.400> do<00:05:14.400> so<00:05:14.670> much<00:05:14.820> like

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
you can see here still I do so much like

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.330 
you can see here still I do so much like
case<00:05:15.540> errands<00:05:15.840> do<00:05:15.960> so<00:05:16.170> much<00:05:16.320> damage<00:05:16.350> already<00:05:16.950> I

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
case errands do so much damage already I

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.980 
case errands do so much damage already I
mean<00:05:17.730> I<00:05:17.820> guess<00:05:17.850> a<00:05:18.000> zebra<00:05:18.360> is<00:05:18.510> helping<00:05:18.870> like

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
mean I guess a zebra is helping like

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.200 
mean I guess a zebra is helping like
he's<00:05:19.200> providing<00:05:19.710> more<00:05:20.280> damage<00:05:20.640> with<00:05:20.669> critical

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
he's providing more damage with critical

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.880 
he's providing more damage with critical
but<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.020> mean<00:05:22.169> if<00:05:22.260> I<00:05:22.290> brought<00:05:22.470> another<00:05:22.590> stair

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
but I mean if I brought another stair

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.380 
but I mean if I brought another stair
and<00:05:23.010> I<00:05:23.130> would<00:05:23.250> have<00:05:23.340> had<00:05:23.460> fifty<00:05:23.880> percent<00:05:24.150> more

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
and I would have had fifty percent more

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.010 
and I would have had fifty percent more
base<00:05:24.660> damaged<00:05:25.380> which<00:05:25.680> like<00:05:25.919> additive<00:05:26.400> bonus

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
base damaged which like additive bonus

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.020 
base damaged which like additive bonus
and<00:05:28.190> then<00:05:29.190> I<00:05:29.220> just<00:05:29.310> would<00:05:29.490> have<00:05:29.580> another<00:05:29.790> stair

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
and then I just would have another stair

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.310 
and then I just would have another stair
and<00:05:30.120> attacking<00:05:30.419> creating<00:05:30.990> more<00:05:31.110> brave

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
and attacking creating more brave

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.800 
and attacking creating more brave
crystals<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:31.980> more<00:05:32.610> sparks<00:05:33.120> and<00:05:33.419> more<00:05:33.600> heart

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
crystals and more sparks and more heart

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.260 
crystals and more sparks and more heart
crystals<00:05:35.510> but<00:05:36.510> I<00:05:36.750> mean<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:37.880> can<00:05:38.880> see<00:05:39.090> like

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
crystals but I mean you can see like

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.620 
crystals but I mean you can see like
it's<00:05:39.960> going<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.140> dynamics<00:05:40.530> turn<00:05:40.820> it<00:05:41.820> I<00:05:42.090> did<00:05:42.479> not

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
it's going to dynamics turn it I did not

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.840 
it's going to dynamics turn it I did not
use<00:05:42.750> a<00:05:42.780> single<00:05:43.110> item<00:05:43.229> you<00:05:43.710> could<00:05:43.860> like<00:05:44.220> I<00:05:44.460> did

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
use a single item you could like I did

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.980 
use a single item you could like I did
not<00:05:44.970> even<00:05:45.090> bring<00:05:45.270> an<00:05:45.419> item<00:05:45.540> that's<00:05:45.750> how

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
not even bring an item that's how

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.930 
not even bring an item that's how
confident<00:05:46.440> I<00:05:46.530> was<00:05:46.680> that<00:05:46.860> my<00:05:46.979> 17<00:05:47.460> would<00:05:47.669> squash

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
confident I was that my 17 would squash

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.630 
confident I was that my 17 would squash
this<00:05:48.120> guy<00:05:48.360> I<00:05:48.800> might<00:05:49.800> have<00:05:49.919> even<00:05:50.100> been<00:05:50.310> able<00:05:50.430> to

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
this guy I might have even been able to

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.600 
this guy I might have even been able to
just<00:05:50.850> auto<00:05:51.060> battle<00:05:51.450> through<00:05:51.630> it<00:05:51.720> too<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:53.490> i'm

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
just auto battle through it too and i'm

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.760 
just auto battle through it too and i'm
not<00:05:53.729> saying<00:05:53.790> miracle<00:05:54.300> totem<00:05:54.630> is<00:05:55.410> really<00:05:55.620> that

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
not saying miracle totem is really that

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.460 
not saying miracle totem is really that
easy<00:05:56.180> because<00:05:57.180> not<00:05:57.540> everyone<00:05:57.930> has<00:05:58.169> five

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
easy because not everyone has five

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.780 
easy because not everyone has five
sirens<00:05:58.950> at<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.610> disposal<00:06:00.890> but<00:06:01.890> yeah<00:06:02.760> no

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
sirens at the disposal but yeah no

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.610 
sirens at the disposal but yeah no
actually<00:06:03.450> I'm<00:06:03.780> saying<00:06:04.020> that<00:06:04.080> miracle<00:06:04.380> totem

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
actually I'm saying that miracle totem

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.010 
actually I'm saying that miracle totem
is<00:06:04.710> easy<00:06:05.240> I'm<00:06:06.240> sorry<00:06:06.600> for<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.750> people<00:06:06.870> who
