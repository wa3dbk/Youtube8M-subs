00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
to about to measure phrase this was the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.490 
to about to measure phrase this was the
pattern<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.660> were<00:00:39.719> playing<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.469> the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.110

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.020 
what's happening is the right hand is
playing<00:01:06.740> all<00:01:07.040> of<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.250> accented<00:01:07.670> notes<00:01:07.730> it's

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
playing like the lead line or the

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.870 
playing like the lead line or the
melodic<00:01:09.470> line<00:01:09.530> if<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:09.800> like<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.670> left

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
melodic line if you like and the left

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.580 
melodic line if you like and the left
hand<00:01:11.030> is<00:01:11.120> basically<00:01:11.570> filling<00:01:11.870> in<00:01:12.110> all<00:01:12.320> of<00:01:12.500> the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590

in-between<00:01:13.130> triplets<00:01:13.550> as<00:01:13.730> and<00:01:14.150> non<00:01:14.420> accented

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
in-between triplets as and non accented

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.270 
in-between triplets as and non accented
strokes<00:01:15.200> all<00:01:15.620> right<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:15.890> we've<00:01:16.040> got<00:01:16.070> that

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
strokes all right so we've got that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.160 
strokes all right so we've got that
really<00:01:16.520> big<00:01:16.670> dynamic<00:01:17.180> difference<00:01:17.330> there<00:01:17.660> the

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
really big dynamic difference there the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.750 
really big dynamic difference there the
left<00:01:18.380> hand<00:01:18.560> really<00:01:18.770> isn't<00:01:18.950> moving<00:01:19.220> any<00:01:19.520> higher

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
left hand really isn't moving any higher

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.640 
left hand really isn't moving any higher
than<00:01:19.940> about<00:01:20.180> tap<00:01:20.420> stroke<00:01:20.660> and<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.170> right<00:01:21.380> hand

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
than about tap stroke and the right hand

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.500 
than about tap stroke and the right hand
is<00:01:21.800> moving<00:01:22.010> anywhere<00:01:22.490> from<00:01:22.670> say<00:01:23.030> half<00:01:23.240> stroke

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
is moving anywhere from say half stroke

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.969 
is moving anywhere from say half stroke
to<00:01:23.630> full<00:01:23.780> stroke<00:01:23.990> depending<00:01:24.350> on<00:01:24.440> how<00:01:24.680> loud<00:01:24.860> you

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
to full stroke depending on how loud you

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.040 
to full stroke depending on how loud you
want<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.190> accents<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.610> be<00:01:25.840> basically<00:01:26.840> what

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
want the accents to be basically what

you can actually just crash it on the
edge<00:02:47.150> alright<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.360> little<00:02:48.570> bit<00:02:48.720> faster<00:02:49.080> with

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
edge alright so a little bit faster with

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:13.810 
edge alright so a little bit faster with
some<00:02:49.320> accents<00:02:49.680> too

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820

around<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.830> drum<00:03:20.010> kit<00:03:20.130> from<00:03:20.459> basic<00:03:20.850> sticking

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
around the drum kit from basic sticking

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.030 
around the drum kit from basic sticking
patterns<00:03:21.450> every<00:03:22.080> feel<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.530> play<00:03:22.740> around

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
patterns every feel that you play around

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.310 
patterns every feel that you play around
the<00:03:23.160> kit<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.459> basically<00:03:23.850> can<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:25.290> know

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
the kit it basically can be you know

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.960 
the kit it basically can be you know
derived<00:03:25.770> from<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.160> just<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.340> really<00:03:26.610> simple

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
derived from it just a really simple

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.580 
derived from it just a really simple
pattern<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:28.020> play<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.440> begin

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
pattern that you can just play to begin

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.440 
pattern that you can just play to begin
with<00:03:28.860> on<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.100> pad<00:03:29.400> or<00:03:29.430> even<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.180> your<00:03:30.270> leg

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
with on a pad or even just on your leg

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.490 
with on a pad or even just on your leg
if<00:03:30.570> you're<00:03:30.690> trying<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.870> figure<00:03:31.110> things<00:03:31.260> out

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
if you're trying to figure things out

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.320 
if you're trying to figure things out
just<00:03:32.070> get<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.310> sticking<00:03:32.700> pattern<00:03:32.970> right<00:03:33.150> get

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
just get this sticking pattern right get

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.699 
just get this sticking pattern right get
all<00:03:33.420> your<00:03:33.570> dynamics<00:03:34.140> right<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.440> get<00:03:34.560> your

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
all your dynamics right and get your

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.310 
all your dynamics right and get your
sticking<00:03:35.040> correct<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.700> then<00:03:36.150> from<00:03:36.360> there<00:03:36.660> try

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
sticking correct and then from there try

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.720 
sticking correct and then from there try
and<00:03:37.500> figure<00:03:37.620> out<00:03:37.739> ways<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.250> putting<00:03:38.489> that

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
and figure out ways of putting that

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.280 
and figure out ways of putting that
sticking<00:03:39.060> pattern<00:03:39.390> around<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.900> kit<00:03:40.080> all

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
sticking pattern around the kit all

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.720 
sticking pattern around the kit all
right<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:40.650> that's<00:03:41.070> what<00:03:41.280> we're<00:03:41.400> doing<00:03:41.430> we're

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
right so that's what we're doing we're

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:52.790 
right so that's what we're doing we're
taking<00:03:41.880> this<00:03:42.150> basic<00:03:42.360> pattern<00:03:51.440> by<00:03:52.440> playing<00:03:52.709> the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
taking this basic pattern by playing the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.380 
taking this basic pattern by playing the
right<00:03:52.980> hand<00:03:53.250> on<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.370> right<00:03:53.430> cymbal<00:03:54.000> with<00:03:54.270> the

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
right hand on the right cymbal with the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.300 
right hand on the right cymbal with the
bass<00:03:54.570> drum<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.020> all<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.650> in-between<00:03:55.830> notes

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
bass drum and all the in-between notes

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.300 
bass drum and all the in-between notes
are<00:03:56.459> played<00:03:56.640> with<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.910> left<00:03:57.120> hand
