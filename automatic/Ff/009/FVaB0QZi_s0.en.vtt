00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.100
 Hello this Zabi 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.949
 and in the seventeenth video it will be about 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.160
 lords of heaven air of winds and storms on 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.230
 the dawn of Azeroth and the lacquer was 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.810
 perhaps the most unpredictable among 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.519
 his anger his anger could 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.249
 abruptly changed to calm like 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.290
 on the contrary, faithful allies for him could 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.860
 become sworn enemies without visible 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.590
 reasons 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.079
 all this made the lord of the winds dangerous 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.149
 adversary among the four lords 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.789
 elementals and lacquer was considered the most 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.160
 weak but his physical weakness he 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.480
 compensated by intelligence and cunning in 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.840
 times of ancient gods 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.609
 lacquer played the role of air tactics 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.070
 elemental worship all creatures that 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.890
 one way or another connected with his element 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.260
 flight to the sky to attack him by 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.899
 reckless idea that will cost 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.030
 opponent life after the battle of the gods and 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.100
 Titans pantheon destroyed the citadel 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.870
 the ancient gods and concluded them themselves in 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.900
 dungeon deep beneath the surface of the earth 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.510
 without the support of the gods the elementals were 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.770
 banished to the monastery of the elements where they were waiting 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.860
 unfortunate fate 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.850
 eternal battle against each other 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.220
 unknown what the relationship was 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.560
 allakira and other masters of the elements in 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.360
 ancient times war elementals 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.400
 started already after the titans 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.860
 concluded and in the space of elementals 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.110
 most likely the purpose of this war was 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.060
 power struggle and true causes 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.400
 hate elemental lords friend 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.260
 no one knows a friend maybe they 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.690
 hated each other before joining 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.820
 titanium and lacquer was one of the most 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.310
 capricious and at the same time calm and 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.350
 peaceful elementals he preferred not 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.689
 attack your 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.420
 Oleg and ignored their intrusion on his 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.759
 territory but the situation escalated when 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.040
 Ragnaros almost completely swallowed 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.180
 the essence of the son of allakir tandyr she 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.549
 prince of air 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.490
 and the particles of that to absorb he could not 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.440
 he gave his lieutenant after that 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.590
 and lacquer hated ragnaros 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.539
 but didnâ€™t take war with him instead 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.790
 this he erected around his 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.040
 kingdom insurmountable wall of 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.440
 storms storms and hurricanes lonely 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.600
 its air fortress and even with 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.459
 the arrival of the cataclysm when a lacquer and 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.680
 Ragnaros fought on the same side as 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.040
 destroyer them last time when not 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.950
 forgotten he himself amalene allakir 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.590
 very little after five thousand years 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.319
 the imprisonment of Ragnaros summoned the tandyr she on 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.360
 duel motives of the firelord 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.459
 the prince was completely unknown 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.650
 lieutenant and ragnaros gi dong 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.080
 agor helped him lure tandyr she into 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.330
 trap they attacked him before he 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.790
 able to react and even though he is a tandoor 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.130
 fought furiously like a storm he could not 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.410
 defeat firelord sulfa 1 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.260
 the legendary hammer of Ragnaros struck him 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.980
 prince of air crash 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.140
 defeated 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.630
 turning the princes clean energy 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.540
 the firelord began to devour 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.730
 that once was the son of allakir however 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.310
 Ragnaros overestimated his strength 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.750
 there was so much energy that its remains 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.959
 had to split between their 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.670
 lieutenants and gidon egor 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.739
 no one knows how long a lacquer would spend 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.140
 in seclusion and sorrow if not 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.359
 deathwing intervention having destroyed 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.790
 obstacles between the elementals space 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.310
 and by the azerotom the deathwing called all 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.079
 master of the elements to his service on 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.150
 the call responded and alagir 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.760
 the more so that the Deathwing promised him 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.820
 unlimited power on what alagir like sam 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.380
 and the weak surrenders Ellinov agreed 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.329
 There is an assumption that the alator 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.020
 entered into an alliance with deathwing to 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.360
 take revenge on Ragnaros 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.400
 the citadel appeared in this way 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.310
 allakira throne of the four winds 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.140
 from there to the land of the ancient people of Tauber 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.490
 steam descended from one of the youngest 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.460
 sons of allakir 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.460
 to carry the will of the deathwing at this time 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.010
 three other sons of rohos nazir and he walked 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.930
 guarded their father each of them 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.380
 represented one of the winds in 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.270
 according to the four sides of the world 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.550
 at first everything went according to plans most 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.070
 the tolvers went over to the side of the death-worm 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.710
 they were ready to crush 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.720
 a blow to the recalcitrant tribe frame Henov 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.270
 but all plans spoiled the sudden 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.400
 invasion of the alliance and the hordes are mighty heroes 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.190
 first traitors broke 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.880
 nefer sets and then killed siam then and in 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.950
 finally got to allakir 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.950
 thank you all for watching
