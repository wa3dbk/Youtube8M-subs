00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello to you artem I suggest 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.740
 your selection of the best topics from 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.330
 sitting last month 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.280
 the first topic in the review called m y 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.369
 ri almost does not change the appearance 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.380
 standard application icons in c 8 all 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.230
 labels remain less recognizable 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.640
 and have the same color cast 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.980
 however, icon fill has more 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 smooth shade and shower theme looks 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.330
 very easy and pleasant 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.750
 note that the author did 2 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.170
 Topics 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.820
 1 for iphone separately for ipad 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.219
 the next topic offers us flat 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.379
 icons that are very similar to icons from 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.809
 cs6 on the one hand application shortcuts 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.700
 look stylish but on the other hand 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.610
 remind us of previous versions 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.960
 apple operating system 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.309
 the next topic is changing the interface under 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.949
 name 28a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.289
 and also has flat design labels. 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.899
 in my opinion some labels in this 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.460
 subject too detailed and some 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.710
 do not talk about the essence of running 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.500
 applications in addition to icons on the desktop 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.060
 the theme table changes switching labels 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 main functions in the control panel 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.920
 system extension in with pro allows 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.350
 add round icons with displayed 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.869
 a shadow on them in my opinion of the author of this 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.600
 the themes are a bit overdone with colors also 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.880
 very ridiculous looking labels for such 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.500
 applications like photo and calendar in 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.390
 the rest can be recommended this 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.960
 theme changing interface for lovers 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.159
 round icons next design theme 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.689
 bring on our device a little 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.240
 altered in shape as well as style and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.700
 design application labels all icons 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.979
 have a monochrome substrate 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.409
 image of the application on it 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.150
 looks very stylish but icons 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.740
 applications that are not replaced can 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.869
 stand out from the general style 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.810
 and here is another topic with round icons 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.100
 and very neat design 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.560
 fidelity to all application shortcuts 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.509
 add white edging however in 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.850
 In this case , not all application colors 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.219
 match the original colors of the programs 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.950
 afraid of 7 and 8 are also some icons 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.400
 look a little ridiculous for example the label 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.410
 programs mail or pier 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.869
 the next topic is changing the interface under 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.780
 The name Yosh has two-color labels. 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.940
 applications on the main substrate in color 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.920
 applications squeezed circle in which 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.200
 the label of the program itself is displayed 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.900
 the color scheme is not out of the general 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.310
 Styles and with 8 also note 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.870
 that in this topic replaced some 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.280
 indicators in the status bar 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.220
 as well as in the standard application 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.140
 settings a distinctive feature 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.630
 the next topics are colder 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.550
 tones of clearance as well as freer 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.950
 approach to the choice of application icons 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.450
 not every label can understand what 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.270
 the application behind it is hiding 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.120
 especially if the color 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.010
 the design is different photo original theme 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.590
 play night remix interface 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.970
 It replaces not only the icons but also badges and 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.490
 also indicators in the status bar 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.140
 device shortcuts of many applications 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.300
 made in dark gray colors 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.540
 This combination will look great 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.140
 on both light is also the author of this topic 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.670
 replaced 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.640
 indicators in standard application 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.650
 settings and the last topic in today's 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.810
 Review is made in gray turquoise Komi 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.820
 as always the weak side of such topics 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.160
 clearance is poor compatibility 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.530
 with application shortcuts that are not 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.060
 replaced note that the author 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.610
 also worked on changing 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.950
 switches and statusbar device 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.050
 All topics in this review are 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.690

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.530
 pirated repositories sitting 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.330
 set interface change themes 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.180
 you will be able to jailbreak pique 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.709
 winterboard or and he does not forget 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.420
