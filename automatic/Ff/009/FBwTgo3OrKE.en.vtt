00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.170
 information that you give with your networks 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.079

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.809
 great ways to stay special and 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.969
 taking advantage as a half healthy tone goal 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.260
 in my hair I will teach you how to do 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.810
 a cake that they have been asking me 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.960
 quite seriously is the cake of 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.960
 carrot 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.430
 with half a cup of oil 4 carrots 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.070
 peeled and grated a walnut cup in 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.409
 pieces 2 cups of wheat flour 2 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.509
 teaspoons of baking powder one and 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.579
 half a cup of sugar a teaspoon of 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.380
 baking soda 2 teaspoons 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.380
 ground cinnamon and 4 eggs 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.900
 to heat your oven about 15 minutes 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.580
 before 180 degrees centigrade or if your 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.860
 oven is of numbers between 1 and 2 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.740
 in a bowl you are going to put the flour on 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.260
 baking the baking powder 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.870
 cinnamon walnut and all the carrots 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.870
 grated and you will mix them very well 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.070
 apart you're going to beat the whole eggs to 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.290
 high speed with the help of the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.540
 blender and when you see them start 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.150
 see how more stools you are going to add the 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.800
 sugar little by little and then also 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.800
 let's add the oil little by little 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.660
 and then in an enveloping way you go to 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.660
 put together the two mixtures 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.870
 you are going to grease with enough 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.030
 butter and a little flour 2 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.070
 baking molds as of 20 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.080
 centimeters approximately in diameter 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.910
 or you can even do it with three 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.480
 molds as well as I'm going to do it with 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.760
 this cake 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.099
 add the mixture to the molds and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.099
 We bake for about 30 minutes 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.220
 remember that the time they last depends 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.140
 much to the power of your oven and 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.790
 They will be ready until you set them 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.790
 fork and it comes out clean 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.330
 to decorate and fill the castell de 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.550
 carrot you need a bit of cheese 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.560
 cream and for the story I have a video 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.870
 where I explain in detail how 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.980
 do it so click on the video that 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.080

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.420
 or they also get you to end the 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.640
 information unmold and cut them the 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.640
 pancita to each bread to match the 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.300
 on a bread add stuffing if you want 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.100

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.070
 make more quantity of cheese bitumen 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.230
 cream and put on another bread comes back to 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.570
 water fill and put the other bread by 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.970
 over and covers all the bitumen cake 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.540
 without forgetting that you should leave a little 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.540
 make the carrots 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.610

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.070
 and this is optional for you to achieve 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.020
 the nicest cake the bitumen you left over 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.940
 divided into two parts and one 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.780
 mixture of orange dye and the other 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.780
 green coloring 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.680
 the orange added to a sleeve 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.920
 pastry I drove number 5 and the green to 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.140

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.040

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:35.549
 and ends with a sheet in this way 

00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:35.549
 each one 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.400
