 channel to five shows in fact captain 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.830
 evidence tells me that people 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.139
 sometimes use weapons figuring out 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.219
 relationship with each other what do we learn 10 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.870
 facts about this weapon 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.670
 item under nuclear weapons usually 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 implied missiles or bombs 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.470
 discharged aircraft however there are 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.460
 and nuclear artillery shells 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.130
 artillery-launched 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.539
 such systems have been intensively developed and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.099
 in the us and the ussr 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.019
 but after the end of the cold war 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.180
 almost all and holes on the weapon for 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.340
 artillery both sides eliminated

 device in the history of mankind 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.290
 developed by a professor of the Academy of Sciences 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.040
 USSR Kurchatov power bombs amounted to 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.899
 58 megatons 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.579
 it was enough not only for 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.469
 to scare us in the cold period 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.539
 wars but also destroy all life on

 as the name of your gun 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 known to us as parabellum first 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 firearms demanded so much 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.049
 time to reload what 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.890
 more efficient and faster was to use 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.020
 Bow and arrows 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.390
 and now the impressive myth which we 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.240
 hear movies and games the usual shot 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.710
 sounds power 140 160 decibel this is very 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.079
 so loud that sound can 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.700
 cause physical pain depending on 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.860
 silencer volume can be reduced 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.079
 several times but such a sound anyway 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.880
 stays very loud normal 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.970
 noise-canceling nozzles reduces 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.770
 total volume to 120 and 130 decibels that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.020
 approximately equal to the volume of the jackhammer 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.830
 hammer and the sound becomes less 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.000
 sharp 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.680
 among the news of science and technology 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.750

 outage of optical systems 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.010
 the enemy the gun was not lethal and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.930
 had no recoil which is very important in 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.850
 under zero gravity right now this 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.190
 gun presented a history museum
