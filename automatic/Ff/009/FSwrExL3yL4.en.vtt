00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
dumb sometimes forge pass expand he

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.960 
dumb sometimes forge pass expand he
doesn't<00:02:26.860> have<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.040> as<00:02:27.190> part<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.430> his<00:02:27.519> wall<00:02:27.760> down

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
doesn't have it as part of his wall down

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.710 
doesn't have it as part of his wall down
so<00:02:28.390> i'm<00:02:28.660> thinking<00:02:28.690> i<00:02:29.200> will<00:02:29.410> try<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:31.450> bust

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
so i'm thinking i will try to to bust

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.020 
so i'm thinking i will try to to bust
the<00:02:32.560> out<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.739> them

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.640 

we<00:02:38.630> require<00:02:39.110> more<00:02:39.590> minerals<00:02:41.110> try<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.170> walbro

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
we require more minerals try to walbro

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.680 
we require more minerals try to walbro
so<00:02:43.220> he'll<00:02:43.459> have<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.760> wall<00:02:43.910> behind<00:02:44.090> here<00:02:44.510> I

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
so he'll have the wall behind here I

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.440 
so he'll have the wall behind here I
don't<00:02:45.530> think<00:02:45.709> there's<00:02:45.890> any<00:02:46.700> time<00:02:46.910> hope<00:02:47.120> that's

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
don't think there's any time hope that's

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
try to wall it off the hook it's a

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:44.770 
try to wall it off the hook it's a
terrible<00:03:43.549> kind<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:43.849> positioning<00:03:44.420> because<00:03:44.659> I

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
terrible kind of positioning because I

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.569 
terrible kind of positioning because I
can<00:03:44.930> take<00:03:45.109> both<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.319> those<00:03:45.590> cannons<00:03:45.980> out<00:03:46.129> with

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
can take both of those cannons out with

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.000 
can take both of those cannons out with
our<00:03:46.609> paintings<00:03:47.510> like<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.290> same<00:03:48.500> for<00:03:48.739> five

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
our paintings like the same for five

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.460 
our paintings like the same for five
innings<00:03:49.599> so<00:03:50.599> I<00:03:50.629> think<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:51.019> won<00:03:51.230> this<00:03:51.379> game<00:03:51.500> I

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
innings so I think I won this game I

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.930 
innings so I think I won this game I
could<00:03:54.470> even<00:03:54.590> ignore<00:03:55.129> the<00:03:55.280> cannons<00:03:55.609> and<00:03:55.790> just

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
could even ignore the cannons and just

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:14.690 
could even ignore the cannons and just
go<00:03:56.090> around<00:03:56.269> here

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:24.710 

I<00:04:15.650> wonder<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:22.550> require<00:04:23.550> at<00:04:24.150> least<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.570> egg

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
I wonder it require at least that egg

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:50.310 
I wonder it require at least that egg
will<00:04:25.050> breathing<00:04:25.740> uh-huh

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.000 

what<00:05:31.730> was<00:05:31.850> a<00:05:31.880> build<00:05:32.150> order<00:05:32.480> for<00:05:32.720> this<00:05:32.930> it<00:05:33.650> was

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
what was a build order for this it was

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.650 
what was a build order for this it was
um<00:05:34.580> it<00:05:36.190> was<00:05:37.190> a<00:05:37.250> hatch<00:05:37.460> first<00:05:37.790> and<00:05:38.270> then<00:05:38.540> I<00:05:38.600> took

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
um it was a hatch first and then I took

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.110 
um it was a hatch first and then I took
my<00:05:38.930> gas<00:05:39.110> in<00:05:39.290> the<00:05:39.380> ninth<00:05:39.530> week<00:05:39.680> my<00:05:39.860> pool<00:05:40.120> which

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
not standard for me at least against

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.060 
not standard for me at least against
what<00:05:46.400> he<00:05:46.430> was<00:05:46.670> doing<00:05:47.200> panasonic<00:05:49.240> so<00:05:50.830> yeah<00:05:51.830> then

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
what he was doing panasonic so yeah then

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.010 
what he was doing panasonic so yeah then
he<00:05:52.550> up<00:05:52.700> his<00:05:52.850> wall<00:05:53.150> because<00:05:53.750> he<00:05:53.870> was

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
he up his wall because he was

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.230 
he up his wall because he was
missing<00:05:54.440> a<00:05:54.500> forge<00:05:54.770> from<00:05:55.070> his<00:05:55.280> wall<00:05:55.520> because<00:05:56.090> he

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
missing a forge from his wall because he

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.380 
missing a forge from his wall because he
made<00:05:56.390> the<00:05:56.510> forge<00:05:56.780> upstairs<00:05:57.320> and<00:05:57.680> so<00:05:58.640> I<00:05:59.060> knew

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
made the forge upstairs and so I knew

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.360 
made the forge upstairs and so I knew
that<00:05:59.420> he<00:05:59.750> didn't<00:06:00.200> have<00:06:00.380> enough<00:06:00.650> buildings<00:06:01.100> to

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
that he didn't have enough buildings to

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.820 
that he didn't have enough buildings to
wall<00:06:01.520> it<00:06:01.640> up<00:06:01.730> in<00:06:01.880> time<00:06:02.090> so<00:06:03.050> instead<00:06:03.410> of<00:06:03.470> making

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
wall it up in time so instead of making

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.700 
wall it up in time so instead of making
Queens<00:06:04.130> I<00:06:04.400> made<00:06:04.670> lanes<00:06:04.990> and<00:06:05.990> with<00:06:06.350> my<00:06:06.470> gas

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
Queens I made lanes and with my gas

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.230 
Queens I made lanes and with my gas
instead<00:06:07.100> of<00:06:07.160> giving<00:06:07.460> speed<00:06:07.700> I<00:06:07.730> got<00:06:07.970> a<00:06:08.000> baneling

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
instead of giving speed I got a baneling

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.140 
instead of giving speed I got a baneling
nest<00:06:08.600> and<00:06:09.320> I<00:06:09.560> made<00:06:09.740> a<00:06:09.770> hatchery<00:06:10.010> to<00:06:10.640> make<00:06:10.820> sure

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
nest and I made a hatchery to make sure

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.150 
nest and I made a hatchery to make sure
that<00:06:11.720> he<00:06:11.900> wouldn't<00:06:12.140> wall<00:06:12.410> that<00:06:12.590> off<00:06:12.710> even

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
that he wouldn't wall that off even

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.100 
that he wouldn't wall that off even
though<00:06:13.280> it<00:06:14.180> would<00:06:14.300> have<00:06:14.330> been<00:06:14.450> hard<00:06:14.510> for<00:06:14.840> him

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
though it would have been hard for him

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.940 
though it would have been hard for him
to<00:06:15.140> wall<00:06:15.380> it<00:06:15.500> off<00:06:17.350> if<00:06:18.350> I<00:06:18.470> didn't<00:06:18.710> make<00:06:18.800> the

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
to wall it off if I didn't make the

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.620 
to wall it off if I didn't make the
hatchery<00:06:19.340> I<00:06:19.520> would<00:06:19.760> have<00:06:19.880> been<00:06:20.000> able<00:06:20.240> to<00:06:20.480> get

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
hatchery I would have been able to get

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.050 
hatchery I would have been able to get
inside<00:06:20.780> with<00:06:21.170> the<00:06:21.200> links<00:06:21.620> but<00:06:22.610> I<00:06:22.670> would<00:06:22.910> not

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
inside with the links but I would not

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.610 
inside with the links but I would not
