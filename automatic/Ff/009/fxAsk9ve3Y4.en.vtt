a very easy craft but very fun we are
going<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.450> take<00:00:16.630> our<00:00:16.780> paper<00:00:16.930> and<00:00:17.260> fold<00:00:17.710> it<00:00:17.830> in

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
going to take our paper and fold it in

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.210 
going to take our paper and fold it in
half<00:00:17.980> lengthwise<00:00:19.530> make<00:00:20.530> sure<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:20.830> ends<00:00:21.130> are

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
half lengthwise make sure the ends are

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.770 
half lengthwise make sure the ends are
touching<00:00:21.690> and<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:24.090> we're<00:00:25.090> going<00:00:25.180> to<00:00:25.270> cut<00:00:25.510> a

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
touching and then we're going to cut a

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.430 
touching and then we're going to cut a
half<00:00:26.289> a<00:00:26.410> heart<00:00:27.270> basically<00:00:28.270> it's<00:00:28.539> kind<00:00:29.170> of<00:00:29.320> a

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
half a heart basically it's kind of a

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.500 
half a heart basically it's kind of a
skewed<00:00:30.369> arc<00:00:31.649> but<00:00:32.649> it<00:00:32.739> looks<00:00:32.920> something<00:00:33.190> like

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
skewed arc but it looks something like

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.239 
skewed arc but it looks something like
this<00:00:34.510> if<00:00:34.809> you'd<00:00:35.320> like<00:00:35.469> to<00:00:35.620> draw<00:00:35.800> it<00:00:35.920> out<00:00:36.010> first

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:36.249 
this if you'd like to draw it out first

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:38.489 
this if you'd like to draw it out first
you<00:00:36.489> may<00:00:36.640> I<00:00:36.940> usually<00:00:37.690> like<00:00:37.839> to<00:00:37.870> freestyle<00:00:38.409> it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499 
you may I usually like to freestyle it

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.619 
you may I usually like to freestyle it
when<00:00:38.589> I'm<00:00:38.710> cutting<00:00:38.920> all<00:00:39.699> right<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.120> then<00:00:40.420> once

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
when I'm cutting all right and then once

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:41.790 
when I'm cutting all right and then once
you've<00:00:40.749> cut<00:00:40.960> that<00:00:41.140> you're<00:00:41.379> going<00:00:41.499> to<00:00:41.530> cut

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
you've cut that you're going to cut

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.319 
you've cut that you're going to cut
another<00:00:42.249> line<00:00:42.640> along<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.559> first<00:00:44.829> line<00:00:45.329> now

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
another line along the first line now

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.939 
another line along the first line now
here<00:00:46.780> you're<00:00:46.989> not<00:00:47.140> going<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.440> cut<00:00:47.589> all<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:47.800> way

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
here you're not going to cut all the way

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.669 
here you're not going to cut all the way
you<00:00:48.069> stop<00:00:48.489> about<00:00:49.030> a<00:00:49.449> half<00:00:49.989> an<00:00:50.140> inch<00:00:50.229> from<00:00:50.559> the

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
you stop about a half an inch from the

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.819 
you stop about a half an inch from the
edge<00:00:50.829> here<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.659> then<00:00:52.659> what<00:00:52.899> I<00:00:52.929> like<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.289> do<00:00:53.559> is

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
edge here and then what I like to do is

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.959 
edge here and then what I like to do is
just<00:00:54.550> go<00:00:54.760> in<00:00:55.139> less<00:00:56.139> you<00:00:56.559> know<00:00:57.280> about<00:00:57.609> an<00:00:57.789> eighth

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
just go in less you know about an eighth

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.590 
just go in less you know about an eighth
of<00:00:58.149> an<00:00:58.269> inch<00:00:58.389> and<00:00:58.719> cut<00:00:59.440> again<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.850> reason<00:01:01.359> for

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
of an inch and cut again the reason for

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.860 
of an inch and cut again the reason for
this<00:01:01.809> is<00:01:02.429> so<00:01:03.429> that<00:01:03.460> some<00:01:04.210> of<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:04.420> paper<00:01:04.629> is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
this is so that some of the paper is

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.590 
this is so that some of the paper is
taken<00:01:05.200> away<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:06.520> have<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:06.820> gap<00:01:07.180> in<00:01:07.480> between

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
taken away and you have a gap in between

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600 
taken away and you have a gap in between
the<00:01:07.960> two<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:08.590> you'll<00:01:08.740> see<00:01:08.920> I'll<00:01:09.070> open<00:01:09.370> it<00:01:09.520> up

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
the two and you'll see I'll open it up

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.310 
the two and you'll see I'll open it up
really<00:01:09.880> quickly<00:01:10.090> but<00:01:10.780> you'll<00:01:10.900> see<00:01:11.080> there's<00:01:11.260> a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
really quickly but you'll see there's a

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.670 
really quickly but you'll see there's a
gap<00:01:11.590> in<00:01:11.890> between<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.760> two<00:01:12.910> hearts<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.680> you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
gap in between the two hearts and you

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.380 
gap in between the two hearts and you
can<00:01:14.830> even<00:01:15.040> it<00:01:15.280> out<00:01:15.370> a<00:01:15.400> little<00:01:15.670> bit<00:01:15.880> if<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:16.060> find

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
can even it out a little bit if you find

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.720 
can even it out a little bit if you find
it's<00:01:16.750> not<00:01:17.020> perfect<00:01:18.010> you<00:01:18.190> can<00:01:18.340> always<00:01:19.050> you<00:01:20.050> know

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
it's not perfect you can always you know

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.880 
it's not perfect you can always you know
kind<00:01:21.730> of<00:01:21.880> change<00:01:22.510> it<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:23.020> your<00:01:23.140> liking<00:01:23.440> and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
kind of change it to your liking and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.110 
kind of change it to your liking and
then<00:01:24.610> I'm<00:01:24.730> going<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:24.940> do<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.180> again<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:27.120> again

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
then I'm going to do it again and again

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.020 
then I'm going to do it again and again
and<00:01:28.570> as<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:29.590> can<00:01:29.740> see<00:01:29.800> all<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.340> these<00:01:30.640> hearts

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
and as you can see all of these hearts

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.570 
and as you can see all of these hearts
are<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.270> same<00:01:31.390> because<00:01:32.080> we're<00:01:32.410> cutting<00:01:32.580> two

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
are the same because we're cutting two

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.920 
are the same because we're cutting two
sides<00:01:33.850> at<00:01:34.000> once<00:01:35.400> well

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.890 

the<00:01:39.710> inner<00:01:39.920> hearts<00:01:40.250> are<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.760> same<00:01:41.600> on<00:01:41.750> both

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
the inner hearts are the same on both

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.940 
the inner hearts are the same on both
sides<00:01:42.070> they're<00:01:43.070> symmetrical<00:01:43.610> all<00:01:44.360> right<00:01:44.950> so

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
sides they're symmetrical all right so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.610 
sides they're symmetrical all right so
let's<00:01:46.640> do<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:46.970> last<00:01:47.270> little<00:01:47.540> heart<00:01:47.810> you'll

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
let's do this last little heart you'll

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.810 
let's do this last little heart you'll
know<00:01:48.710> when<00:01:49.010> you're<00:01:49.130> finished<00:01:49.430> because<00:01:49.580> you

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
know when you're finished because you

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.070 
know when you're finished because you
won't<00:01:49.910> have<00:01:50.150> much<00:01:50.330> room<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.600> do<00:01:50.780> any<00:01:50.960> more

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
won't have much room to do any more

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.060 
won't have much room to do any more
hearts<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:53.090> open<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.510> up<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.890> have<00:01:55.040> a
