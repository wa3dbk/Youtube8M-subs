00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.719 
but let's go if I've never done this rap
so<00:01:34.439> because<00:01:34.650> i'm<00:01:34.770> using<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.130> texture<00:01:35.520> pack

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
so because i'm using this texture pack

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
so because i'm using this texture pack
that<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.119> recommended<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.990> mud<00:01:37.560> or

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that is recommended with this mud or

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.780 
that is recommended with this mud or
with<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.340> actual<00:01:39.860> adventure<00:01:40.860> map<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.310> i'm

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
with this actual adventure map and i'm

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.280 
with this actual adventure map and i'm
not<00:01:41.970> quite<00:01:42.150> sure<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> Red<00:01:42.659> Lobster<00:01:43.079> I

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
not quite sure what the Red Lobster I

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.469 
not quite sure what the Red Lobster I
think<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:44.009> sticky<00:01:44.399> blocks<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.270> through

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
think some sticky blocks do go through

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.910 
think some sticky blocks do go through
this<00:01:45.570> house<00:01:45.810> section<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.320> finish<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.710> paths

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
this house section I finish that paths

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.200 
this house section I finish that paths
cross<00:01:47.159> sections<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> first<00:01:47.670> time<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.149> actually

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
cross sections the first time I actually

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.389 
cross sections the first time I actually
ever<00:01:48.540> finish<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.930> parkour<00:01:49.409> section<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:49.979> now

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
ever finish that parkour section and now

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.069 
ever finish that parkour section and now
we<00:01:50.460> jump<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.880> over<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> lattice<00:01:51.720> section

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
we jump it over to the lattice section

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.870 
we jump it over to the lattice section
climbing<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.740> ladder<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.310> fast<00:01:53.670> I

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
climbing up the ladder is very fast I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.819 
climbing up the ladder is very fast I
said<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.270> my<00:01:54.420> record<00:01:54.780> time<00:01:55.020> here<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.649> go

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
said this is my record time here we go

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.670 
said this is my record time here we go
over<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.810> terrible<00:01:58.200> try

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
over to the that was just a terrible try

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.219 
over to the that was just a terrible try
what<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.579> okay<00:02:00.570> there's<00:02:00.810> no<00:02:00.960> way<00:02:01.079> of

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
what was that okay there's no way of

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.959 
what was that okay there's no way of
retrying<00:02:01.680> thats<00:02:01.860> ok<00:02:02.219> we're<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
retrying thats ok we're going to do the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.880 
retrying thats ok we're going to do the
swim<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.509> shame<00:02:03.810> we're<00:02:04.049> gonna<00:02:04.170> zoom<00:02:04.710> all<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
swim of shame we're gonna zoom all the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.260 
swim of shame we're gonna zoom all the
way<00:02:04.979> look<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.399> time<00:02:05.640> we've<00:02:05.820> already<00:02:06.000> done

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
way look at the time we've already done

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.040 
way look at the time we've already done
one<00:02:06.509> minute<00:02:06.810> 14<00:02:07.350> and

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
one minute 14 and

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.560 
one minute 14 and
I<00:02:08.140> guess<00:02:08.650> we<00:02:08.800> can't<00:02:09.010> jump<00:02:09.310> onto<00:02:09.670> here<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.180> think

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
I guess we can't jump onto here I think

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.360 
I guess we can't jump onto here I think
there'll<00:02:10.720> be<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.930> letter<00:02:11.440> somewhere<00:02:11.920> there<00:02:12.220> we

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
there'll be a letter somewhere there we

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.770 
there'll be a letter somewhere there we
go<00:02:12.490> we<00:02:12.610> got<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.760> lot<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.000> subcontractors<00:02:13.720> and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
go we got a lot of subcontractors and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.960 
go we got a lot of subcontractors and
that<00:02:14.110> he<00:02:14.290> seems<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.740> be<00:02:14.860> some<00:02:15.040> ice<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.940> I

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
that he seems to be some ice so I

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.780 
that he seems to be some ice so I
Sparkle<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.560> slide<00:02:17.800> away<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.280> then

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
Sparkle and not to slide away and then

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.480 
Sparkle and not to slide away and then
again<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.510> we<00:02:20.020> slide<00:02:20.320> away<00:02:20.470> alright<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.370> now

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
again and we slide away alright so now

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.340 
again and we slide away alright so now
we're<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.820> jump<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.360> go<00:02:22.870> through<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
we're going to jump and go through the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.350 
we're going to jump and go through the
another<00:02:23.650> sucker<00:02:24.040> punch<00:02:24.400> wall<00:02:24.640> hopefully

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
another sucker punch wall hopefully

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.610 
another sucker punch wall hopefully
there'll<00:02:25.540> be<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.690> ladder<00:02:25.930> over<00:02:26.020> here<00:02:26.260> though

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620

gonna do this we Bend up pushed off

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.830 
gonna do this we Bend up pushed off
yesterday<00:02:39.580> we<00:02:39.700> did<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:39.910> correctly<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.660> like

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840

this<00:02:41.550> okay<00:02:42.550> some<00:02:42.850> tidal<00:02:43.300> wave<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.930> end<00:02:44.110> of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
this okay some tidal wave and the end of

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.050 
this okay some tidal wave and the end of
the<00:02:44.290> time<00:02:44.470> there<00:02:44.800> we<00:02:44.920> go<00:02:45.100> what<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:45.850> we<00:02:45.880> done

minute<00:02:50.110> 50<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.860> think<00:02:51.310> that's<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.520> pretty<00:02:51.670> good

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
minute 50 I think that's a pretty good

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.550 
minute 50 I think that's a pretty good
time<00:02:52.090> let's<00:02:52.360> go<00:02:52.450> see<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.840> records<00:02:53.260> i<00:02:53.350> think

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
time let's go see the records i think

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.950 
time let's go see the records i think
the<00:02:53.680> records<00:02:54.070> like<00:02:54.190> one<00:02:54.460> minute<00:02:54.640> 14<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.450> i'm

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
the records like one minute 14 so i'm

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.470 
the records like one minute 14 so i'm
not<00:02:56.170> too<00:02:56.410> sure<00:02:56.650> about<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.490> but<00:02:57.640> hopefully

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
not too sure about that but hopefully

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.570 
not too sure about that but hopefully
we'll<00:02:58.960> do<00:02:59.170> well<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.620> if<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.100> guys<00:03:00.280> would<00:03:00.550> like
