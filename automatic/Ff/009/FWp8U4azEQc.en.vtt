where you're gonna hold your ice so you

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.759 
where you're gonna hold your ice so you
put<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> ice<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> top<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.990> then

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
put the ice in there to the top and then

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.919 
put the ice in there to the top and then
put<00:00:26.340> your<00:00:27.150> put<00:00:27.720> your<00:00:27.779> lid<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:29.539> alright<00:00:30.539> and

put your put your lid on alright and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.840 
put your put your lid on alright and
then<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.820> have<00:00:32.820> v62<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:34.460> put<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.489> right<00:00:35.820> on

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
then you have v62 here put that right on

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.619 
then you have v62 here put that right on
top<00:00:37.550> then<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.579> take<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> filter<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:41.670> fold<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
top then you take a filter and fold the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.450 
top then you take a filter and fold the
sides<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:44.129> edges

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.420 

place<00:00:50.149> that<00:00:50.360> right<00:00:50.510> in<00:00:50.570> there<00:00:51.020> all<00:00:51.250> right<00:00:52.250> so

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
place that right in there all right so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.500 
place that right in there all right so
that<00:00:52.820> is<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.290> Redis<00:00:54.290> setup<00:00:54.710> basically<00:00:55.610> the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
that is the Redis setup basically the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.030 
that is the Redis setup basically the
fret<00:00:56.719> of<00:00:56.870> what<00:00:57.170> it<00:00:57.260> does<00:00:57.379> is<00:00:57.530> it<00:00:57.620> takes<00:00:57.800> the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
fret of what it does is it takes the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.660 
fret of what it does is it takes the
whole<00:00:58.129> v6<00:00:58.579> yeah<00:00:58.790> idea<00:00:59.720> and<00:01:00.019> just<00:01:00.340> better<00:01:01.340> suits

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
whole v6 yeah idea and just better suits

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.729 
whole v6 yeah idea and just better suits
at<00:01:01.850> pour<00:01:02.120> over<00:01:02.239> ice<00:01:02.290> you'll<00:01:03.290> sometimes<00:01:03.500> see

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
at pour over ice you'll sometimes see

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.219 
at pour over ice you'll sometimes see
people<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:05.089> may<00:01:05.210> have<00:01:05.330> tried<00:01:05.449> at<00:01:05.600> home<00:01:05.659> using

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
people you may have tried at home using

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.080 
people you may have tried at home using
a<00:01:06.290> v60<00:01:06.800> and<00:01:07.009> trying<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.400> pour<00:01:07.580> directly<00:01:07.700> over

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
a v60 and trying to pour directly over

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.270 
a v60 and trying to pour directly over
ice<00:01:08.240> which<00:01:09.080> can<00:01:09.290> turn<00:01:09.470> out<00:01:09.560> really<00:01:09.740> great<00:01:09.979> the

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
ice which can turn out really great the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.850 
ice which can turn out really great the
only<00:01:10.369> problem<00:01:10.790> is<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.300> as<00:01:11.720> your<00:01:12.140> ice<00:01:12.320> starts<00:01:12.770> to

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
only problem is is as your ice starts to

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.450 
only problem is is as your ice starts to
melt<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.140> brewed<00:01:15.380> coffee<00:01:15.619> will<00:01:15.950> drip<00:01:16.250> on

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
melt the the brewed coffee will drip on

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.499 
melt the the brewed coffee will drip on
to<00:01:16.759> some<00:01:17.270> ice<00:01:17.509> some<00:01:18.110> cold<00:01:18.759> cold<00:01:19.759> wha<00:01:19.970> cold

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
to some ice some cold cold wha cold

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.499 
to some ice some cold cold wha cold
coffee<00:01:20.750> it'll<00:01:21.649> just<00:01:21.800> kind<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:22.039> be

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
coffee it'll just kind of be

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.100 
coffee it'll just kind of be
inconsistent<00:01:23.509> throughout<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.869> brewing

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
inconsistent throughout the brewing

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.410 
inconsistent throughout the brewing
process<00:01:24.190> what<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.280> faretta<00:01:25.520> seeks<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.970> do<00:01:26.149> is

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
process what the faretta seeks to do is

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.320 
process what the faretta seeks to do is
to<00:01:26.990> keep<00:01:27.140> all<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.470> ice<00:01:27.679> above<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.910> rest<00:01:29.149> of

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
to keep all the ice above the rest of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.510 
to keep all the ice above the rest of
the<00:01:29.390> coffee<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.320> every<00:01:30.649> drip<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.070> hitting<00:01:31.310> ice

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
the coffee so every drip is hitting ice

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.200 
the coffee so every drip is hitting ice
first<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.500> also<00:01:33.500> just<00:01:33.800> bring<00:01:34.700> this<00:01:34.820> back<00:01:34.880> out

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
first and also just bring this back out

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.520 
first and also just bring this back out
again<00:01:35.470> instead<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.590> hard<00:01:37.130> drips<00:01:38.200> it's<00:01:39.200> going

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
again instead of hard drips it's going

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.120 
again instead of hard drips it's going
to<00:01:39.679> use<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> dispersion<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:41.600> kind<00:01:41.840> of<00:01:42.009> bring<00:01:43.009> the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
to use a dispersion to kind of bring the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.520 
to use a dispersion to kind of bring the
drips<00:01:43.369> of<00:01:43.490> coffee<00:01:43.700> out<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.960> let<00:01:45.170> them<00:01:45.289> fall

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
drips of coffee out and let them fall

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.740 
drips of coffee out and let them fall
gently<00:01:45.770> on<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.070> ice<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:47.240> that's<00:01:47.420> kind<00:01:47.630> of<00:01:47.659> a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
gently on the ice and that's kind of a

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.440 
gently on the ice and that's kind of a
nice<00:01:47.869> feature<00:01:48.140> as<00:01:48.319> well<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.759> 600

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
nice feature as well this is a 600

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.490 
nice feature as well this is a 600
milliliter<00:01:51.490> brewing<00:01:52.600> brewing<00:01:53.600> device<00:01:53.869> server

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
milliliter brewing brewing device server

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.649 
milliliter brewing brewing device server
so<00:01:55.189> we<00:01:55.280> recommend<00:01:55.549> using<00:01:55.850> about<00:01:56.149> 300

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
so we recommend using about 300

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.389 
so we recommend using about 300
milliliters<00:01:57.079> of<00:01:57.110> ice<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.979> you<00:01:58.040> can<00:01:58.220> weigh

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
milliliters of ice and you can weigh

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.450 
milliliters of ice and you can weigh
that<00:01:58.640> as<00:01:58.850> grams<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.479> then<00:02:00.350> 300<00:02:00.860> milliliters

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
that as grams and then 300 milliliters

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.010 
that as grams and then 300 milliliters
of<00:02:01.490> water<00:02:01.939> is<00:02:02.240> what<00:02:02.420> you'll<00:02:02.540> actually<00:02:02.689> pour

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
of water is what you'll actually pour

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
of water is what you'll actually pour
through<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.259> grog<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.579> coffee<00:02:04.820> grounds

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
through the grog the the coffee grounds

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.130 
through the grog the the coffee grounds
you<00:02:07.040> want<00:02:07.219> to<00:02:07.280> go<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.399> little<00:02:07.490> bit<00:02:08.030> finer<00:02:08.329> for

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
you want to go a little bit finer for

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.960 
you want to go a little bit finer for
iced<00:02:09.290> coffee<00:02:09.649> just<00:02:10.459> because<00:02:10.549> you're<00:02:10.850> probably

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
iced coffee just because you're probably

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.310 
iced coffee just because you're probably
going<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.299> be<00:02:11.360> pouring<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.720> little<00:02:11.900> bit<00:02:12.079> less

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
going to be pouring a little bit less

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.370 
going to be pouring a little bit less
and<00:02:12.739> you're<00:02:13.610> pouring<00:02:13.850> less<00:02:14.060> water<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.840> so

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
and you're pouring less water and so

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
and you're pouring less water and so
you're<00:02:15.560> going<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.739> want<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:15.950> hold<00:02:16.100> up<00:02:16.250> that

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
you're going to want to hold up that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.039 
you're going to want to hold up that
water<00:02:16.579> a<00:02:16.670> little<00:02:16.850> bit<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.600> extend<00:02:17.989> the

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
water a little bit and extend the

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.289 
water a little bit and extend the

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.569 
process and then you would just pours
normal<00:02:20.720> anywhere<00:02:21.110> from<00:02:21.320> two<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.190> half<00:02:22.370> to
