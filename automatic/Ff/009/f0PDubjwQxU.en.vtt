00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
between or four and it's a good way to

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.610 
between or four and it's a good way to
test<00:02:46.019> your<00:02:46.290> color<00:02:46.530> mixing<00:02:47.069> skills<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
test your color mixing skills and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.350 
test your color mixing skills and
because<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.799> don't<00:02:50.280> always<00:02:50.519> need<00:02:50.819> just<00:02:51.180> that

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
because you don't always need just that

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.880 
because you don't always need just that
bright<00:02:51.569> yellow<00:02:51.900> or<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.410> right<00:02:52.680> red

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
bright yellow or just that right red

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.740 
bright yellow or just that right red
it's<00:02:53.160> nice<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.549> have<00:02:53.730> variations<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.780> between

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
it's nice to have variations in between

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.620 
it's nice to have variations in between
so<00:02:57.750> now<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.380> see<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:59.269> what<00:03:00.269> happens

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
so now you can see just what happens

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.210 
so now you can see just what happens
when<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:00.900> mix<00:03:01.049> those<00:03:01.290> two<00:03:01.530> colors<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.069> what

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
when you mix those two colors and what

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.920 
when you mix those two colors and what
kind<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.489> variations<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.630> get<00:03:03.810> in

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
kind of variations you that you get in

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.990 
kind of variations you that you get in
between<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:05.040> we'll<00:03:05.190> just<00:03:05.400> try<00:03:05.579> one<00:03:05.790> more

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
between and we'll just try one more

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.720 
between and we'll just try one more
color<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:07.530> have<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.739> keep<00:03:08.010> your<00:03:08.190> knife<00:03:08.430> very

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
color you have to keep your knife very

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.370 
color you have to keep your knife very
clean<00:03:09.209> as<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.450> do<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:09.870> because<00:03:10.110> if<00:03:10.260> you

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
clean as you do this because if you

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.190 
clean as you do this because if you
start<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.890> get<00:03:11.040> other<00:03:11.370> colors<00:03:11.900> mixed<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.019> there

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
start to get other colors mixed in there

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.710 
start to get other colors mixed in there
then<00:03:13.379> you<00:03:13.410> won't<00:03:13.680> have<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:14.010> true<00:03:14.280> color<00:03:14.720> color

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
then you won't have the true color color

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.199 
then you won't have the true color color
mix<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.739> keep<00:03:16.920> your<00:03:17.040> knife<00:03:17.250> clean<00:03:17.640> or<00:03:18.060> if

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
mix so keep your knife clean or if

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.670 
mix so keep your knife clean or if
you're<00:03:18.360> using<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.780> brush<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.170> really<00:03:19.440> have<00:03:19.560> to

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
you're using a brush you really have to

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.030 
you're using a brush you really have to
get<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.920> very<00:03:20.069> clean<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:22.739> on<00:03:22.890> this<00:03:23.069> one<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:25.010> get<00:03:26.010> a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
get it very clean so on this one I get a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.640 
get it very clean so on this one I get a
green<00:03:26.340> there<00:03:29.569> and<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.630> want<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> lighter<00:03:31.170> much

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
green there and I want a lighter much

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.110 
green there and I want a lighter much
lighter<00:03:31.980> green<00:03:32.340> more<00:03:32.579> towards<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.000> yellow

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
lighter green more towards the yellow

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.759 
lighter green more towards the yellow
side<00:03:35.389> you<00:03:36.389> could<00:03:36.540> even<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:37.230> kind<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.560> do<00:03:37.739> a

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
side you could even just kind of do a

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.180 
side you could even just kind of do a
gradation<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.670> way

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.930 

and<00:03:44.310> have<00:03:45.000> an<00:03:45.180> an<00:03:45.390> even<00:03:45.870> line<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.490> circles

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
and have an an even line so the circles

00:03:50.940 --> 00:04:00.930 
and have an an even line so the circles
just<00:03:51.360> start<00:03:53.900> getting<00:03:54.900> darker<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.440> darker

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.880 

the<00:04:01.690> other<00:04:01.840> thing<00:04:02.080> it<00:04:02.170> shows<00:04:02.320> you<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.680> see

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
the other thing it shows you is see

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.860 
the other thing it shows you is see
there's<00:04:03.490> some<00:04:03.670> beautiful<00:04:04.060> colors<00:04:04.420> right<00:04:04.720> in

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
there's some beautiful colors right in

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.020 
there's some beautiful colors right in
there<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:05.320> that's<00:04:05.920> where<00:04:06.130> that<00:04:06.250> transparency

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
there and that's where that transparency

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.610 
there and that's where that transparency
comes<00:04:07.420> in<00:04:07.630> those<00:04:07.810> colors<00:04:08.080> are<00:04:08.320> mixing

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
comes in those colors are mixing

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.950 
comes in those colors are mixing
together<00:04:08.800> and<00:04:09.130> I<00:04:09.190> can<00:04:09.430> still<00:04:09.850> see<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.330> can<00:04:10.810> now

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
together and I can still see I can now

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.630 
together and I can still see I can now
see<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.200> tooth<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:11.830> canvas<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.520> me

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
see the tooth of the canvas and to me

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.910 
see the tooth of the canvas and to me
that's<00:04:12.820> exciting<00:04:13.000> because<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:14.620> sort<00:04:14.830> of

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
that's exciting because it's sort of

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.770 
that's exciting because it's sort of
little<00:04:15.160> different<00:04:15.580> patterns<00:04:15.970> in<00:04:16.209> there<00:04:16.480> and

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
little different patterns in there and

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.140 
little different patterns in there and
I'm<00:04:17.380> getting<00:04:17.709> mixes<00:04:18.070> some<00:04:18.310> areas<00:04:18.730> or<00:04:18.880> heavier

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
I'm getting mixes some areas or heavier

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.330 
I'm getting mixes some areas or heavier
blue<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.900> some<00:04:20.110> are<00:04:20.230> green<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.890> I<00:04:20.980> see<00:04:21.160> some

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
blue and some are green and I see some

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.090 
blue and some are green and I see some
yellows<00:04:22.020> so<00:04:23.020> that's<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.650> benefit<00:04:24.040> of

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
yellows so that's the benefit of

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.370 
yellows so that's the benefit of
transparent<00:04:24.880> paint<00:04:25.090> so<00:04:25.840> anyway<00:04:26.110> that's<00:04:26.230> just

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
transparent paint so anyway that's just

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.710 
transparent paint so anyway that's just
a<00:04:26.650> little<00:04:26.860> exercise<00:04:27.370> for<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.120> try<00:04:28.330> if<00:04:28.630> you

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
a little exercise for you to try if you

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.390 
a little exercise for you to try if you
don't<00:04:28.900> feel<00:04:29.050> like<00:04:29.080> tackling<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.800> whole<00:04:29.950> canvas

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
don't feel like tackling a whole canvas

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.130 
don't feel like tackling a whole canvas
but<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.670> want<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.880> say<00:04:31.030> oh<00:04:31.270> well<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:31.690> painted
