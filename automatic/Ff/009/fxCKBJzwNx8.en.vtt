00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.670 
okay I'm going to show you how to do an
intramuscular<00:00:01.890> injection<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.639> testosterone

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:03.680 
intramuscular injection of testosterone

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.990 
intramuscular injection of testosterone
we're<00:00:04.680> going<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.859> start<00:00:05.130> by<00:00:05.339> open<00:00:05.730> up<00:00:05.850> the

we're going to start by open up the
three<00:00:06.330> ml<00:00:06.600> syringe<00:00:06.930> okay<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:08.099> should<00:00:08.309> be

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
three ml syringe okay this should be

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.240 
three ml syringe okay this should be
sterile<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.480> when<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.870> open<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.320> up<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:11.099> want

sterile you when you open it up you want
to<00:00:11.280> keep<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.700> sterile<00:00:11.969> now<00:00:12.870> because

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
to keep it sterile now because

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.289 
to keep it sterile now because
testosterone<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.070> thick<00:00:14.340> oily<00:00:15.059> liquid

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
testosterone is a thick oily liquid

we're going to use two different needles
first<00:00:17.880> we're<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.270> use<00:00:18.420> an<00:00:18.720> 18<00:00:19.230> gauge<00:00:19.470> so

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
first we're going to use an 18 gauge so

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.349 
first we're going to use an 18 gauge so
I<00:00:19.920> peel<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.520> back<00:00:20.600> and<00:00:22.160> I<00:00:23.160> put<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> 18<00:00:24.150> gauge

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
I peel that back and I put the 18 gauge

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.339 
I peel that back and I put the 18 gauge
needle<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:25.050> there<00:00:25.350> okay<00:00:26.240> it's<00:00:27.240> got<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> cover<00:00:28.109> on

will do is you will take the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.369 
will do is you will take the
testosterone<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.480> first<00:00:40.110> you'll<00:00:40.230> open

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
testosterone and first you'll open

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.360 
testosterone and first you'll open
alcohol<00:00:41.040> swab<00:00:41.719> and<00:00:42.719> you'll<00:00:42.899> wipe<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.350> top<00:00:43.590> all

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
alcohol swab and you'll wipe the top all

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.979 
alcohol swab and you'll wipe the top all
the<00:00:44.399> time<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.879> careful<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.629> contaminate

the niel but wipe the top in a circular
motion

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
motion

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
motion
then<00:00:50.160> you'll<00:00:50.340> invert<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> testosterone<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
then you'll invert the testosterone and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.560 
then you'll invert the testosterone and
you'll<00:00:52.860> put<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> needle<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you'll put the needle right in the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.400 
you'll put the needle right in the
middle<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.649> rubber<00:00:55.860> stopper<00:00:57.079> you'll<00:00:58.079> draw

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
middle of the rubber stopper you'll draw

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.160 
middle of the rubber stopper you'll draw
back<00:00:58.680> depending<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> dose<00:01:00.020> but<00:01:01.020> I'm

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
back depending on the dose but I'm

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.640 
back depending on the dose but I'm
starting<00:01:02.629> at<00:01:04.339> 0.75<00:01:05.339> MLS<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.930> which<00:01:07.409> is

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
starting at 0.75 MLS for you which is

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
starting at 0.75 MLS for you which is
between<00:01:08.159> 0.5<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.390> 1<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> point<00:01:12.299> seven<00:01:12.600> five<00:01:12.780> is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
between 0.5 and 1 so point seven five is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.530 
between 0.5 and 1 so point seven five is
halfway<00:01:13.320> between<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.100> two<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.210> that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
halfway between the two you can see that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.649 
halfway between the two you can see that
you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.930> draw<00:01:16.140> back<00:01:16.380> more<00:01:16.830> than<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:17.790> dose<00:01:18.030> if

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you can draw back more than your dose if

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
you can draw back more than your dose if
there<00:01:18.869> are<00:01:18.930> any<00:01:19.020> air<00:01:19.259> bubbles<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.009> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
there are any air bubbles in there you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.679 
there are any air bubbles in there you
can<00:01:20.280> stick<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.790> get<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> air<00:01:21.180> bubbles<00:01:21.360> out

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
can stick it to get the air bubbles out

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.039 
can stick it to get the air bubbles out
then<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.619> push<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:23.040> slowly<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> dose

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
then you just push up slowly to the dose

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.830 
then you just push up slowly to the dose
which<00:01:25.290> again<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> 0.75<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
which again is 0.75 for you and you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.010 
which again is 0.75 for you and you
would<00:01:27.960> take<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.320> out<00:01:29.270> now<00:01:30.270> again<00:01:30.600> you're<00:01:30.930> not

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
would take it out now again you're not

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.140 
would take it out now again you're not
going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.350> use<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.740> that's<00:01:32.670> too<00:01:32.909> big<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
going to use that that's too big a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.020 
going to use that that's too big a
needle<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.780> put<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> cap<00:01:34.829> back<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.369> carefully

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
needle you put the cap back on carefully

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.310 
needle you put the cap back on carefully
and<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.170> twist<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:38.159> take<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.520> off<00:01:39.320> then

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and you just twist to take it off then

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.999 
and you just twist to take it off then
you<00:01:40.350> take<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> much<00:01:41.009> smaller<00:01:41.490> needle<00:01:43.009> which

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
you take the much smaller needle which

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.749 
you take the much smaller needle which
is<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.280> 25<00:01:44.329> gauge<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.310> that's<00:01:47.520> much

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
is a 25 gauge you can see that's much

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.170 
is a 25 gauge you can see that's much
smaller<00:01:48.350> that's<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.740> would<00:01:49.890> inject<00:01:50.220> now

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
smaller that's what you would inject now

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.850 
smaller that's what you would inject now
in<00:01:51.600> order<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.049> show<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> injection

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
in order to show you the injection

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.020 
in order to show you the injection
technique<00:01:53.250> I'm<00:01:53.399> not<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> use

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
technique I'm not going to use

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.719 
technique I'm not going to use
testosterone<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.560> Jason<00:01:56.189> my<00:01:56.340> model

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
testosterone because Jason my model

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.789 
testosterone because Jason my model
doesn't<00:01:56.969> need<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.140> am<00:01:58.320> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> use

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
doesn't need it what I am going to use

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.069 
doesn't need it what I am going to use
just<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:59.250> demonstration<00:01:59.969> purposes<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.990> a

just for demonstration purposes is a
similar<00:02:01.619> amount<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.130> b12<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:03.090> got<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> same

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
similar amount of b12 it's got the same

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.109 
similar amount of b12 it's got the same
needle<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.200> okay<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.060> to

a circular motion with an alcohol swab
and<00:02:45.140> I'll<00:02:45.470> usually<00:02:45.650> do<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.010> twice<00:02:47.650> do<00:02:48.650> that

and I'll usually do it twice do that
again

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
again

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.430 
again
circular<00:02:50.150> motion<00:02:50.540> from<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.780> inside<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.410> the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
circular motion from the inside to the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.460 
circular motion from the inside to the
out<00:02:52.209> okay<00:02:53.209> now<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.510> air<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:53.930> clean<00:02:54.260> that's

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
out okay now the air is clean that's

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.400 
out okay now the air is clean that's
alcohol<00:02:55.130> we'll<00:02:56.030> take<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.480> top<00:02:56.720> off<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:59.410> the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
alcohol we'll take the top off and the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.050 
alcohol we'll take the top off and the
whole<00:03:00.530> idea<00:03:00.709> with<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.730> want<00:03:01.940> to

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
whole idea with this is you want to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.690 
whole idea with this is you want to
completely<00:03:02.660> put<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.650> needle<00:03:03.950> at<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.190> at<00:03:04.670> a

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
completely put the needle at a at a

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.420 
completely put the needle at a at a
right<00:03:05.030> angle<00:03:05.060> into<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.140> muscle<00:03:06.500> not<00:03:06.680> like

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
right angle into the muscle not like

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.059 
right angle into the muscle not like
this<00:03:07.640> not<00:03:08.090> down<00:03:08.450> straight<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.290> so<00:03:09.830> here's<00:03:10.010> the

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
this not down straight it so here's the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.120 
this not down straight it so here's the
thickest<00:03:10.549> part<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:10.940> as<00:03:11.060> most<00:03:11.299> of<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.510> part<00:03:11.810> I

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
thickest part of as most of the part I

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.259 
thickest part of as most of the part I
cleaned<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.370> what<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.489> like<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.880> do<00:03:13.970> is<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.120> put

my wrist here so you have some type of

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.030 
my wrist here so you have some type of
fulcrum<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.959> you<00:03:18.170> just<00:03:18.380> tell<00:03:18.560> all<00:03:18.799> right<00:03:18.890> I'm

fulcrum and you just tell all right I'm

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.740 
fulcrum and you just tell all right I'm
3j<00:03:19.549> gonna<00:03:19.730> feel<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.910> little<00:03:20.000> pinch<00:03:20.269> one<00:03:20.510> two

3j gonna feel a little pinch one two

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.380 
3j gonna feel a little pinch one two
three<00:03:21.019> ouch<00:03:21.609> and<00:03:22.609> then<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.820> put<00:03:23.030> your<00:03:23.150> hands

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
up to the top here and you inject two

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.949 
up to the top here and you inject two
socks<00:03:28.790> we'll<00:03:28.970> go<00:03:29.090> slow<00:03:29.420> than<00:03:29.690> this<00:03:29.780> because

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
socks we'll go slow than this because

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.520 
socks we'll go slow than this because
it's<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.260> thick<00:03:30.470> oil<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.980> then<00:03:31.549> you<00:03:31.579> pull<00:03:31.850> out

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
it's a thick oil and then you pull out

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.930 
it's a thick oil and then you pull out
okay<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.590> hold<00:03:33.829> some<00:03:33.980> pressure<00:03:34.280> on<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.730> and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
okay you hold some pressure on it and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.150 
okay you hold some pressure on it and
then<00:03:35.810> after<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.140> just<00:03:36.350> put<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.500> bandaid<00:03:36.859> on<00:03:36.920> it

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
then after that just put a bandaid on it

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.550 
then after that just put a bandaid on it
and<00:03:37.340> that's<00:03:38.209> it<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:38.840> that's<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.170> technique

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
and that's it so that's the technique

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.530 
and that's it so that's the technique
for<00:03:39.920> drawing<00:03:40.519> up<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.910> administering

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
for drawing up and administering

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.320 
for drawing up and administering
testosterone
