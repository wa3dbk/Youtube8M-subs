00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.740 
hard so I don't know how that's going to
affect<00:03:53.900> cutting<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:54.989> might<00:03:56.540> be<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.569> little

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
affect cutting it might be a little

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.160 
affect cutting it might be a little
messy

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.720 

like<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:01.860> said<00:04:01.920> I'm<00:04:02.220> not<00:04:02.340> going<00:04:02.490> to<00:04:02.580> worry<00:04:02.700> about

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
like I said I'm not going to worry about

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.540 
like I said I'm not going to worry about
following<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.330> curve<00:04:03.540> I'm<00:04:03.780> just<00:04:03.990> going<00:04:04.170> to

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
following the curve I'm just going to

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:37.610 
following the curve I'm just going to
make<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.580> square<00:04:05.970> go<00:04:06.510> shallow<00:04:07.490> Morris<00:04:36.620> let's

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
make a square go shallow Morris let's

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.090 
make a square go shallow Morris let's
test<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.950> out<00:04:38.070> here<00:04:42.620> little<00:04:43.620> tight<00:04:43.830> on<00:04:43.980> this

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
test it out here little tight on this

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.720 
test it out here little tight on this
side<00:04:44.370> I<00:04:49.070> think<00:04:50.070> that's<00:04:50.220> going<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.400> be<00:04:50.460> good<00:04:50.640> on

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
side I think that's going to be good on

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.890 
side I think that's going to be good on
the<00:04:50.760> initial<00:04:51.210> depth<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:54.210> now<00:04:54.300> this<00:04:54.510> Forster

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
the initial depth so now this Forster

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.670 
the initial depth so now this Forster
bit<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.169> I<00:04:55.230> have<00:04:55.380> already<00:04:57.290> just<00:04:58.290> happens<00:04:58.620> to

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
bit that I have already just happens to

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:10.870 
bit that I have already just happens to
fit<00:04:59.720> right<00:05:00.720> inside<00:05:00.930> this<00:05:01.290> little<00:05:01.470> hole<00:05:01.770> here

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.670 

I've<00:05:11.880> got<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.060> VIX<00:05:12.300> bit<00:05:12.510> so<00:05:12.780> it's<00:05:13.200> going<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:13.380> it's

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
I've got a VIX bit so it's going to it's

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.230 
I've got a VIX bit so it's going to it's
a<00:05:13.770> self<00:05:14.010> centering<00:05:14.250> bit<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:14.880> that's<00:05:14.940> when<00:05:15.150> we

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
a self centering bit so that's when we

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.380 
a self centering bit so that's when we
use<00:05:15.270> them<00:05:16.280> make<00:05:17.280> sure<00:05:17.430> I<00:05:17.460> get<00:05:17.669> the<00:05:17.850> holes

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
use them make sure I get the holes

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:29.780 
use them make sure I get the holes
perfectly<00:05:18.870> same<00:05:28.130> well<00:05:29.130> I<00:05:29.160> don't<00:05:29.400> normally<00:05:29.520> do

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
perfectly same well I don't normally do

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.880 
perfectly same well I don't normally do
this<00:05:29.970> by<00:05:30.090> hand<00:05:30.330> but<00:05:30.479> I<00:05:30.900> don't<00:05:31.710> feel<00:05:31.830> like

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
this by hand but I don't feel like

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.960 
this by hand but I don't feel like
screws<00:05:32.610> are<00:05:32.729> going<00:05:32.880> along<00:05:34.790> not<00:05:35.790> really

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550
