data soft also released this game for

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.069 
data soft also released this game for
the<00:00:57.840> Atari<00:00:58.170> 800<00:00:59.059> looks<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.390> bit<00:01:00.660> nicer

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the Atari 800 looks a little bit nicer

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.390 
the Atari 800 looks a little bit nicer
but<00:01:01.520> not<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> whole<00:01:02.910> lot<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:04.070> aspect<00:01:05.070> it's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
but not a whole lot it's the aspect it's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.830 
but not a whole lot it's the aspect it's
just<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:06.030> bit<00:01:06.150> different<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> way

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
just a little bit different in the way

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.200 
just a little bit different in the way
they<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.409> Springs<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
they have it Springs then this is the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.240 
they have it Springs then this is the
one<00:01:09.420> screen<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> don't<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.380> I'm<00:01:10.710> sure<00:01:11.040> they

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
one screen I don't like I'm sure they

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.789 
one screen I don't like I'm sure they
did<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:12.119> variety<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.990> blue<00:01:13.409> cliffs

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
did it just for variety but blue cliffs

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.070 
did it just for variety but blue cliffs
I<00:01:14.159> think<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.150> would<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.390> worked<00:01:15.720> much<00:01:16.049> better

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
I think it would have worked much better

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.020 
I think it would have worked much better
if<00:01:16.560> they'd<00:01:16.740> had<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.130> left<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.670> screen

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
if they'd had just left this screen

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.850 
if they'd had just left this screen
orange<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.570> well<00:01:18.600> even<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
orange as well even if they have a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.200 
orange as well even if they have a
little<00:01:20.580> less<00:01:20.759> variety<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:22.670> then<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
little less variety and then we have the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.580 
little less variety and then we have the
third<00:01:24.420> screen<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:26.960> it's<00:01:27.960> kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> hard

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
third screen and it's it's kind of hard

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.289 
third screen and it's it's kind of hard
to<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.920> which<00:01:29.159> way<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.400> go<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.119> at<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to know which way to go up here at the

to know which way to go up here at the

of<00:01:46.049> droppings<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.979> at<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.189> same<00:01:50.399> time

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
of droppings on you but at the same time

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.200 
of droppings on you but at the same time
if<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.360> too<00:01:51.630> timid<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.229> stay<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.649> there

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
if you get too timid and stay up there

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.870 
if you get too timid and stay up there
trying<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.509> find<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.439> perfect<00:01:55.649> time<00:01:56.070> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
trying to find the perfect time that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.789 
trying to find the perfect time that
also<00:01:57.329> increases<00:01:57.930> their<00:01:58.110> chances<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.560> getting

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
also increases their chances of getting

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.249 
also increases their chances of getting
you<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.340> either<00:01:59.850> way<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.810> wrong<00:02:00.990> way

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
you so either way can be the wrong way

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.660 
you so either way can be the wrong way
to<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:04.100> cautiously<00:02:05.100> bold<00:02:05.430> I

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to go you have to be cautiously bold I

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.400 
to go you have to be cautiously bold I
reckon<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> way<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> put<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:09.410> only

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
reckon is the way to put it the only

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.430 
reckon is the way to put it the only
thing<00:02:10.879> that<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:11.910> had<00:02:12.300> mild

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
thing that I had mild

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.830 
thing that I had mild
ahead<00:02:13.800> was<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.430> game<00:02:14.730> was<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.980> little

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
ahead was that this game was a little

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.330 
ahead was that this game was a little
frustrating<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.870> play<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.800> original

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
frustrating to play with the original

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.760 
frustrating to play with the original
joysticks<00:02:21.170> having<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.320> quality

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
joysticks having a quality

joysticks having a quality
self-centering<00:02:23.610> joystick<00:02:24.740> really<00:02:25.740> makes<00:02:25.980> a

self-centering joystick really makes a

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.860 
self-centering joystick really makes a
big<00:02:26.160> difference<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.940> game<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.450> course<00:02:27.690> it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
big difference in this game of course it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.290 
big difference in this game of course it
makes<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.230> difference<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.770> any<00:02:29.520> game<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:30.270> I

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
makes a difference in any game but I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.910 
makes a difference in any game but I
think<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.660> makes<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.960> little<00:02:31.110> more<00:02:31.440> difference

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
think it makes a little more difference

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.190 
think it makes a little more difference
in<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.280> game<00:02:32.520> than<00:02:32.850> some<00:02:33.030> others<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.570> could

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
in this game than some others I could

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.320 
in this game than some others I could
play<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.980> original<00:02:35.130> joysticks<00:02:36.000> but

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
play it with the original joysticks but

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.440 
play it with the original joysticks but
it's<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.980> much<00:02:38.250> more<00:02:39.150> pleasant

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
it's it's a much more pleasant

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.110 
it's it's a much more pleasant
experience<00:02:40.010> even<00:02:41.010> more<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.550> than<00:02:41.790> some<00:02:41.940> other

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
experience even more so than some other

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.910
