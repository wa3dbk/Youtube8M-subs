I'd like to tell you about one of them

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.530 
I'd like to tell you about one of them
which<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.259> interior<00:00:14.130> builder<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:15.360> if<00:00:15.450> you

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
which is the interior builder so if you

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.090 
which is the interior builder so if you
watch<00:00:15.690> my<00:00:15.929> tech<00:00:16.139> demo<00:00:16.410> from<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.650> few<00:00:16.830> months<00:00:17.010> ago

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
watch my tech demo from a few months ago

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.029 
watch my tech demo from a few months ago
you<00:00:17.460> may<00:00:18.150> recognize<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.810> interior<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
you may recognize this interior it's the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.029 
you may recognize this interior it's the
same<00:00:20.250> room<00:00:20.460> layout<00:00:20.869> with<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> couple<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.320> key

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
same room layout with a couple of key

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.839 
same room layout with a couple of key
differences<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:24.750> first<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.670> we<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
differences the first is that we have a

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.310 
differences the first is that we have a
new<00:00:27.029> tile<00:00:27.210> set<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> little<00:00:28.080> prettier

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
new tile set so it's a little prettier

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.160 
new tile set so it's a little prettier
to<00:00:28.410> look<00:00:28.560> at<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.449> the<00:00:30.449> second<00:00:30.779> difference<00:00:30.869> is

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
to look at and the second difference is

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.500 
to look at and the second difference is
that<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> old<00:00:31.619> version<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.130> built<00:00:32.399> using<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that the old version was built using a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.470 
that the old version was built using a
text<00:00:34.050> editor<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.790> this<00:00:35.790> version<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.210> built

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
text editor and this version was built

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.450 
text editor and this version was built
using<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.960> in-game<00:00:37.260> system<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.129> let's<00:00:38.280> take<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
using the in-game system so let's take a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.880 
using the in-game system so let's take a
look<00:00:38.579> at<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:40.850> this<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.469> top<00:00:43.469> view<00:00:43.500> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
look at that this is the top view of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.340 
look at that this is the top view of
that<00:00:44.040> map<00:00:44.309> were<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.670> right<00:00:44.820> now

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
that map were in right now

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.810 
that map were in right now
editing<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> super<00:00:46.890> easy<00:00:46.920> all<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:47.579> is

click and drag and as you draw on the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
click and drag and as you draw on the
map<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.870> system<00:00:55.260> interprets<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.280> you're

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
map the system interprets what you're

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.930 
map the system interprets what you're
drawing<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.920> builds<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> geometry<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> match

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:16.609 
it filling in space is just as easy
click<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.090> drag<00:01:06.299> now<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.290> use<00:01:16.439> that

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
click and drag now you can use that

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
system just clicking and dragging to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.429 
system just clicking and dragging to
create<00:01:19.110> open<00:01:19.380> space<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:20.840> create<00:01:21.840> any<00:01:22.110> interior

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
create open space to create any interior

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.090 
create open space to create any interior
you<00:01:22.680> want<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.909> probably<00:01:24.710> most<00:01:25.710> people<00:01:25.890> are

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you want but probably most people are

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.499 
you want but probably most people are
going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> want<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:26.850> bit<00:01:26.970> more<00:01:27.180> control

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
going to want a little bit more control

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.039 
going to want a little bit more control
than<00:01:27.689> that

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
than that

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.450 
than that
so<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:29.490> also<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> ability<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:31.130> have<00:01:32.130> more

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
so we also have the ability to have more

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.149 
so we also have the ability to have more
fine-grained<00:01:33.119> control<00:01:33.479> over<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.159> what

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
fine-grained control over what what

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.560 
fine-grained control over what what
walls<00:01:35.400> you're<00:01:35.579> placing<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.299> can

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
walls you're placing in so you can

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.719 
walls you're placing in so you can
choose<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.619> put<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:37.979> an<00:01:38.070> angle<00:01:38.189> wall<00:01:39.350> or<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
choose to put in an angle wall or a

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.990 
choose to put in an angle wall or a
corner<00:01:41.729> piece<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.460> good<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.850> these

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
corner piece and this is good for these

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.630 
corner piece and this is good for these
interior<00:01:45.509> rooms<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:52.979> see<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.490> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
interior rooms so you can see that this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.399 
interior rooms so you can see that this
updates<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.509> real<00:01:54.720> time<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:59.659> the<00:02:00.659> tile<00:02:00.930> set<00:02:01.229> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
updates in real time the the tile set is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.580 
updates in real time the the tile set is
built<00:02:01.770> using<00:02:01.950> blender<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.700> exported<00:02:03.590> into

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
built using blender and exported into

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.380 
built using blender and exported into
the<00:02:04.680> game<00:02:04.860> engine<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.399> we're<00:02:06.060> gonna<00:02:06.180> release

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the game engine and we're gonna release

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.419 
the game engine and we're gonna release
the<00:02:06.659> exporter<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.979> game<00:02:08.160> will<00:02:08.280> be

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the exporter so the game will be

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.979 
the exporter so the game will be
moddable<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.119> people<00:02:09.390> will<00:02:09.569> be<00:02:09.660> able<00:02:09.780> to

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
tile set the only decoration that we

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.289 
tile set the only decoration that we
have<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.390> light<00:02:21.930> variation<00:02:22.849> so<00:02:23.849> let's

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
have is this light variation so let's

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.759
