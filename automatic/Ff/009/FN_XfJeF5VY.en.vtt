the elites you get to when you order
them<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.659> figure<00:01:40.659> what<00:01:41.560> I'll<00:01:41.649> probably<00:01:41.679> do<00:01:42.069> is

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
them I figure what I'll probably do is

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.770 
them I figure what I'll probably do is
try<00:01:42.579> just<00:01:42.850> using<00:01:43.090> one<00:01:43.119> I<00:01:43.270> know<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.539> lot<00:01:43.719> of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
try just using one I know a lot of

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.800 
try just using one I know a lot of
people<00:01:43.869> say<00:01:44.200> just<00:01:44.229> use<00:01:44.530> one<00:01:44.740> on<00:01:44.920> your<00:01:45.100> you're

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
people say just use one on your you're

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.269 
people say just use one on your you're
aiming<00:01:46.810> stick<00:01:47.049> and<00:01:47.289> I<00:01:47.619> think<00:01:47.799> that's<00:01:47.979> what<00:01:48.189> I'm

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:48.279 
aiming stick and I think that's what I'm

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:51.719 
aiming stick and I think that's what I'm
going<00:01:48.399> to<00:01:48.429> do<00:01:48.579> as<00:01:49.509> you<00:01:49.810> can<00:01:49.899> see<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.399> kind<00:01:51.639> of

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
going to do as you can see the kind of

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.749 
going to do as you can see the kind of
ridged<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.219> give<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.459> little<00:01:54.670> bit

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
ridged kind of give you a little bit

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.779 
ridged kind of give you a little bit
more<00:01:54.909> control<00:01:55.240> over<00:01:55.569> what<00:01:55.990> you're<00:01:56.139> doing<00:01:56.789> and

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
more control over what you're doing and

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.039 
more control over what you're doing and
then<00:01:58.829> basically<00:01:59.829> how<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:00.399> works<00:02:00.880> if<00:02:01.869> you

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
then basically how it works if you

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.589 
then basically how it works if you
haven't<00:02:02.349> seen<00:02:02.469> it<00:02:02.529> in<00:02:02.709> another<00:02:02.950> video<00:02:03.189> is<00:02:03.599> on

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
haven't seen it in another video is on

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.629

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
on the control stick makes it a little

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.510 
on the control stick makes it a little
bit<00:02:10.690> higher<00:02:10.990> they<00:02:11.890> say<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.100> can<00:02:12.220> play<00:02:12.340> on<00:02:12.370> a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
bit higher they say you can play on a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.510 
bit higher they say you can play on a
higher<00:02:12.670> sensitivity<00:02:13.090> with<00:02:13.540> it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
higher sensitivity with it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.400 
higher sensitivity with it
get<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> turn<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.660> know<00:02:15.780> whoever<00:02:16.020> comes

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
get the turn on you know whoever comes

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.250 
get the turn on you know whoever comes
into<00:02:16.620> your<00:02:16.740> area<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.880> what<00:02:18.450> I'll<00:02:18.570> show<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.460> is

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
into your area so what I'll show you is

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.560 
into your area so what I'll show you is
here<00:02:22.260> I've<00:02:22.380> got<00:02:22.530> my<00:02:22.970> scuf<00:02:23.970> controller<00:02:24.300> and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
here I've got my scuf controller and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.560 
here I've got my scuf controller and
basically<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.940> put<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.300> right<00:02:27.420> on

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
basically all you do is put it right on

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.170 
basically all you do is put it right on
top<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:29.490> just<00:02:29.730> snaps<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.600> their<00:02:32.180> supposed

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
top and it just snaps on their supposed

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.280 
top and it just snaps on their supposed
to<00:02:33.240> give<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.420> little<00:02:33.510> bit<00:02:33.630> more<00:02:33.780> control<00:02:34.050> and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
to give you little bit more control and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.920 
to give you little bit more control and
as<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.100> see<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.880> raises<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.480> stick<00:02:36.720> up

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
as you can see it raises the stick up

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.630 
as you can see it raises the stick up
just<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.260> little<00:02:37.410> bit<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.310> when<00:02:38.520> you're

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
just a little bit so that when you're

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.170 
just a little bit so that when you're
holding<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:40.260> can<00:02:40.440> actually<00:02:40.980> hold<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.150> a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
holding it you can actually hold it a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.940 
holding it you can actually hold it a
little<00:02:42.300> bit<00:02:42.450> more<00:02:42.540> comfortably<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.800> gives

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
little bit more comfortably and it gives

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.730 
little bit more comfortably and it gives
you<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.100> little<00:02:44.370> bit<00:02:44.490> more<00:02:44.640> sway<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.120> there

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
you a little bit more sway in there

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.530 
you a little bit more sway in there
we'll<00:02:46.740> give<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.010> few<00:02:47.160> tries<00:02:47.460> I'll<00:02:47.850> record<00:02:48.270> a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
we'll give it a few tries I'll record a

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.870 
we'll give it a few tries I'll record a
my<00:02:49.080> first<00:02:49.290> couple<00:02:49.560> game<00:02:49.710> plays<00:02:49.890> with<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.190> now

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
my first couple game plays with it now

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.700 
my first couple game plays with it now
what<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.210> heard<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.110> does<00:02:52.200> take<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.500> few

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
what I heard is that it does take a few

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.770 
what I heard is that it does take a few
gameplays<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.280> get<00:02:53.400> used<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.480> can't

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
gameplays to get used to so I can't

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.300 
gameplays to get used to so I can't
promise<00:02:54.960> they'll<00:02:55.230> be<00:02:55.320> great<00:02:55.500> game<00:02:55.680> plays<00:02:55.890> but

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
promise they'll be great game plays but

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.860 
promise they'll be great game plays but
I'll<00:02:56.430> put<00:02:56.580> them<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.850> right<00:02:57.150> after<00:02:57.300> this<00:02:57.540> and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
I'll put them on right after this and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.990 
I'll put them on right after this and
I'll<00:02:58.410> talk<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.680> little<00:02:58.950> bit<00:02:59.130> about<00:02:59.310> what<00:02:59.970> I

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
I'll talk a little bit about what I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.580 
I'll talk a little bit about what I
think<00:03:00.270> about<00:03:00.450> them<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.960> kind<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.350> how<00:03:01.440> it

hear a little bit more about the control

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.760 
hear a little bit more about the control
freaks<00:03:11.070> after<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.810> gameplay<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.260> course<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
freaks after the gameplay of course the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.890 
freaks after the gameplay of course the
unpackaging<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.490> is<00:03:14.730> wonderful<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.360> know<00:03:15.420> but

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
unpackaging is is wonderful I know but

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.280 
unpackaging is is wonderful I know but
it's<00:03:16.260> all<00:03:16.500> about<00:03:16.740> how<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.190> performs<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.290> let

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
it's all about how it performs and let

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.880 
it's all about how it performs and let
me<00:03:19.380> just<00:03:19.410> say<00:03:19.650> these<00:03:20.310> things<00:03:20.790> perform<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.860> was<00:03:22.860> a

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
me just say these things perform I was a

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.440 
me just say these things perform I was a
little<00:03:23.190> bit<00:03:23.310> skeptical<00:03:23.820> at<00:03:23.940> first<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.330> I

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
little bit skeptical at first but I

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.150 
little bit skeptical at first but I
figured<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.290> know<00:03:25.320> ten<00:03:25.650> dollars<00:03:25.950> here

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
figured you know ten dollars here

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.550 
figured you know ten dollars here
fifteen<00:03:26.550> dollars<00:03:26.820> here<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.200> helps<00:03:28.470> your

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
fifteen dollars here if it helps your

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.610 
fifteen dollars here if it helps your
gameplay<00:03:29.120> maybe<00:03:30.120> it's<00:03:30.300> worth<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.380> we<00:03:31.500> went

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
gameplay maybe it's worth it so we went

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.460 
gameplay maybe it's worth it so we went
ahead<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:31.980> got<00:03:32.130> them<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.490> all<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.900> all<00:03:34.050> these

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
ahead and got them and all in all these

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.830 
ahead and got them and all in all these
things<00:03:34.890> are<00:03:35.090> phenomenal<00:03:36.090> absolutely

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
things are phenomenal absolutely

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.430 
things are phenomenal absolutely
incredible<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:38.550> gameplay<00:03:39.390> like<00:03:39.959> some<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.380> the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
incredible the gameplay like some of the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.520 
incredible the gameplay like some of the
biggest<00:03:40.800> note<00:03:41.220> changes<00:03:41.790> I've<00:03:42.120> noticed<00:03:42.660> and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
biggest note changes I've noticed and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.730 
biggest note changes I've noticed and
just<00:03:43.740> using<00:03:44.040> them<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.730> few<00:03:44.910> games<00:03:45.180> are

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
just using them in just a few games are

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.900 
just using them in just a few games are
obviously<00:03:46.740> you<00:03:47.250> could<00:03:47.400> play<00:03:47.580> at<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.730> higher

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
obviously you could play at a higher

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.840 
obviously you could play at a higher
sensitivity<00:03:48.620> normally<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.950> would<00:03:50.340> play<00:03:50.550> at

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
sensitivity normally I would play at

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.570 
sensitivity normally I would play at
around<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.270> five<00:03:51.540> or<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.870> six<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.590> now<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.190> find

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
around a five or a six and now I find

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.550 
around a five or a six and now I find
myself<00:03:53.640> bumping<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.660> sensitivity<00:03:55.110> up<00:03:55.380> to

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
myself bumping that sensitivity up to

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.090 
myself bumping that sensitivity up to
around<00:03:55.800> a<00:03:55.980> 10<00:03:56.220> or<00:03:56.370> 11<00:03:56.850> on<00:03:57.050> black<00:03:58.050> ops<00:03:58.290> quite<00:03:59.070> a

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
around a 10 or 11 on black ops quite a

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.120 
around a 10 or 11 on black ops quite a
big<00:03:59.370> improvement<00:03:59.810> just<00:04:00.810> for<00:04:01.080> extending<00:04:02.040> that

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
big improvement just for extending that

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.720 
big improvement just for extending that
stick<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:03.000> little<00:04:03.330> bit<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:04.520> some<00:04:05.520> of<00:04:05.670> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
stick just a little bit and some of the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.120 
stick just a little bit and some of the
things<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.090> will<00:04:07.080> make<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.530> definitely

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
things that will make you definitely

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.160 
things that will make you definitely
realize<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:08.940> potential<00:04:09.360> that<00:04:09.510> they<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.900> is

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
realize the potential that they have is

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.560 
realize the potential that they have is
the<00:04:10.950> turns<00:04:11.250> obviously<00:04:12.060> once<00:04:12.239> you<00:04:12.330> get<00:04:12.450> that

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
the turns obviously once you get that

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.479 
the turns obviously once you get that
sensitivity<00:04:13.050> moved<00:04:13.500> up<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:13.950> one<00:04:14.130> guy<00:04:14.280> that

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
sensitivity moved up that one guy that

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.849 
sensitivity moved up that one guy that
just<00:04:14.580> happens<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.120> run<00:04:15.270> by<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.680> while<00:04:16.680> you're

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
just happens to run by you while you're

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.190 
just happens to run by you while you're
staring<00:04:17.760> at<00:04:17.880> somebody<00:04:18.209> else<00:04:18.419> or<00:04:18.690> something

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
staring at somebody else or something

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.510 
staring at somebody else or something
happens<00:04:19.590> when<00:04:19.709> you're<00:04:19.799> running<00:04:19.950> by<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.310> bus

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
happens when you're running by that bus

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.250 
happens when you're running by that bus
in<00:04:20.760> nuketown<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.510> guy<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.840> happens<00:04:21.989> to

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
in nuketown and that guy just happens to

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.960 
in nuketown and that guy just happens to
run<00:04:22.350> by<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.530> with<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.800> shotgun<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.820> could

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
run by you with a shotgun you could

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.310 
run by you with a shotgun you could
actually<00:04:24.180> get<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.630> turn<00:04:24.900> on<00:04:25.080> him<00:04:25.200> now

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
actually get that turn on him now

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.600 
actually get that turn on him now
because<00:04:25.470> you're<00:04:25.740> running<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.100> such<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.310> higher

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
because you're running it such a higher

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.070 
because you're running it such a higher
sense

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
sense

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.020 
sense

00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:31.939 
feeling to be able to turn on him also

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.510 
feeling to be able to turn on him also
another<00:04:32.750> great<00:04:33.050> thing<00:04:33.349> about<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.770> is<00:04:33.889> honestly

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
another great thing about it is honestly

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.270 
another great thing about it is honestly
the<00:04:34.819> far<00:04:35.240> shots<00:04:35.689> if<00:04:36.409> you're<00:04:36.590> running<00:04:36.680> an<00:04:36.949> SMG

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
the far shots if you're running an SMG

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.459 
the far shots if you're running an SMG
or<00:04:37.759> even<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:39.500> know<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.939> soul<00:04:40.939> rifle<00:04:41.389> on<00:04:41.599> a

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:42.469 
or even you know a soul rifle on a

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:46.119 
or even you know a soul rifle on a
different<00:04:43.009> map<00:04:43.479> how<00:04:44.479> longer<00:04:44.780> map<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.860> far-off

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
different map how longer map the far-off

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.179 
different map how longer map the far-off
shots<00:04:46.550> actually<00:04:47.199> come<00:04:48.199> in<00:04:48.409> better<00:04:48.740> for<00:04:49.069> me

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:49.189 
shots actually come in better for me

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.249 
shots actually come in better for me
that<00:04:49.400> they're<00:04:49.669> not<00:04:49.819> the<00:04:50.569> reticle<00:04:50.990> is<00:04:51.050> not

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
that they're not the reticle is not

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.869 
that they're not the reticle is not
bouncing<00:04:51.680> all<00:04:51.800> over<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.129> place<00:04:52.219> I<00:04:52.639> find

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:52.879 
bouncing all over the place I find

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.850 
bouncing all over the place I find
myself<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.300> lot<00:04:53.509> more<00:04:53.719> stable<00:04:54.169> with<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.620> shot

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
myself a lot more stable with the shot

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.379 
myself a lot more stable with the shot
and<00:04:55.509> that<00:04:56.509> is<00:04:56.719> to<00:04:57.229> be<00:04:57.259> a<00:04:57.409> huge<00:04:57.919> benefit<00:04:58.430> so<00:04:58.729> I've
