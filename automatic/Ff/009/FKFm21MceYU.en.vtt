from rihanna and i started reading it

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.870 
from rihanna and i started reading it
because<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.650> intended<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.100> read<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.400> november

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
because I intended to read it november

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.340 
because I intended to read it november
and<00:04:06.120> i<00:04:06.239> just<00:04:06.420> had<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.600> set<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:06.989> side<00:04:07.080> cuz

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
and i just had to set it to the side cuz

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.990 
and i just had to set it to the side cuz
i<00:04:07.410> didn't<00:04:07.620> have<00:04:07.709> time<00:04:07.890> but<00:04:08.459> i<00:04:08.519> liked<00:04:08.790> what<00:04:08.970> i

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
i didn't have time but i liked what i

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.900 
i didn't have time but i liked what i
read<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.330> far<00:04:09.360> um<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.800> was<00:04:10.950> quick<00:04:11.670> moving

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
read so far um and it was quick moving

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.400 
read so far um and it was quick moving
so<00:04:12.239> i<00:04:12.269> think<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.600> i'd<00:04:12.780> probably<00:04:13.019> tear

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
so i think that i'd probably tear

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.340 
so i think that i'd probably tear
through<00:04:13.739> this<00:04:13.860> pretty<00:04:14.040> quickly<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:15.230> i'm<00:04:16.230> gonna

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350

think the reason I haven't read any of
them<00:04:38.389> is<00:04:38.630> because<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.930> just<00:04:39.050> don't<00:04:39.470> know<00:04:39.680> which

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
them is because I just don't know which

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.930 
them is because I just don't know which
one<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:41.180> want<00:04:42.169> to<00:04:42.380> read<00:04:42.560> first<00:04:42.949> because<00:04:43.699> I<00:04:43.790> kind
