 mp she 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.170
 2 st 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.960
 like rivers 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.470
 and this is a particularly yellow metal 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.480
 so this is the most versatile this 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.890
 tons who are looking for little girls 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.710
 This is understandable because a piglet 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.450
 areas and not to be at the same time 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.220
 blue yellow 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.800
 so pathologists gathered tons very 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.630
 good and specifically death 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.719
 he does not have it well overlap 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.229
 red tula due to the fact that it is a little bit 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.469
 eat olive 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.409
 at the end of the day 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:09.319
 so 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.540
 test good i if the country became day 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.860
 delighted with this tonal i you 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.999
 down below 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.629
 let me put a reference in Bali 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.299
 I saw Andrei Schukin Kerch power 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.729
 using these tonal and there children 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.079
 Acad, he is good for us to develop 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.109
 imperfections while his coverage 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.139
 as distributed over 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.969
 skin and based on this video 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.859
 however find how good he is 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.379
 copes 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.219
 smearing coated as far as 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.539
 then the skin transforms 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.699
 wherein 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.399
 for those who have issues with disadvantages here 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:50.509
 imperfections and he wants 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.319
 come close 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.979
 completely this tonal will 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:57.539
 good stuff 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.049
 many let's go in is that it is under it first 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.149
 professional film that is 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.629
 and despite the fact that 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.349
 absolutely no they are detained 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.359
 I use it and it is clear and on 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.039
 through the eyes of the official does not cause any 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.879
 side reaction all the same it 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.749
 professional marca and i like him he i 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.069
 noticed that he is still a little bit 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.689
 to the point of dispute for me personally 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.009
 plus since my skin is never oily 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:26.779
 don't mount me torment everyone 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.829
 so for oily skin is a good option 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.499
 for comparison, my skin folds in 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:34.109
 germany law 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.979
 with chicago and no relation to active 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.499
 actions he is unian 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.069
 produced me therefore for housing 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.829
 problem skin yes good option but 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.369
 all the same not every day I every day im 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:50.369
 use and alternating parts in two 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.749
 but here to enter we have on the skin or his 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:55.669
 not planted 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.329
 therefore 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.469
 what did un like you 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.139
 over dry skin 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.639
 aggressive 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.419
 but 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.579
 if you need perfect coverage 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.159
 perfect body for some event 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.879
 to a wedding on a holiday to that 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.309
 This from Ananiev serve a good 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:15.549
 service in this regard 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.109
 300 more places 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.419
 honestly on the banks themselves nothing 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.609
 is written 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.389
 most likely here xp did not 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.349
 and about the joint here on the back 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.639
 Of course there is a side and composition 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.280
 she is so about the status of course from 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.289
 violence 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.910
 Omsk advertising but because of the earlier arm price of copper 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.809
 tapes other tonal 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:41.039
 channels reception in the very salary ingredients 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.939
 there are similar I think there is nothing like that 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:46.479
 special not so 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.419
 so yes 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.129
 evaluation of this they are for me 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.430
 how to us 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.350
 she no it's not the demise of gas to the west 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.350
 all and if so 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.690
 let's say so if china is at system 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.780
 and on certain areas I just 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.110
 passers-by with the second time then when 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.760
 his first performance as he is well 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.800
 absorbed 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.310
 having read the St. Petersburg ska 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.919
 correctly not bread 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.580
 after a while he is so 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.060
 it absorbs all skin how to be and 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.639
 the coating becomes more natural and 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.099
 more natural someone mythical 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.129
 meteorite i visited chip istanbul 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.120
 perfect skin 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.290
 so the networks will not remove but how do i 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.330
 spoke domestic 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.300
 medicine 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.680
 and there is 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.599
 side effect to them 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.869
 Yes, and about his durability than 

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:39.670
 really very persistent 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.490
 and talked about the loss that is defeat 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.159
 brilliance 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.159
 how long does not appear does not flow 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.770
 its really very useful therefore 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.740
 mother sleep and swamps 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.550
 so to remove it will have 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.759
 to work hard 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.490
 Astana 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.639
 just ordinary carpathians fall silent 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.479
 but rely with max 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.669
 I'm my own 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.090
 there was a town salmon and go to 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.790
 types that wash off very well 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.660
 also to remove the optimal 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.529
 balance twice 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:16.259
 so the city is really very 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.789
 construction sites 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.479
 the people are not quite the highways 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.270
 and then everything must be said that simple 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.559
 un fao zam cheaper two times minimum 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:29.430
 cheaper than either this farthest lynx 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.619
 and i grab the snow 

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:34.629
 so attached used deans 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:37.729
 so many 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.020
 and that was enough unian 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.020
 I was afraid all winter 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.629
 why armenia tiger to us months 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.139
 4 5 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.139
 but I don't use it often enough 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:54.469
 so 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:56.669
 but I really like one and not half a ton 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.680
 enough for the whole face 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.669
 all now said that her plane 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.409

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:04.729
 helped you 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:06.599

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:09.619
 a week 

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:10.449
 so far
