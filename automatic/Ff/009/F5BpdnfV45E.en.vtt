00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.410 
is standard it's actually a proper black
chain<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.159> looks<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> part<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
chain so it just looks the part so I

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.030 
chain so it just looks the part so I
