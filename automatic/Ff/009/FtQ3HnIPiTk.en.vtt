 mine is a good kid in this case 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.960

 they deserve that monitoring and since they do 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.339
 very very good things and surely they are going to 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.500
 get more content from fifa 16 ultimate 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.450
 team so keep repeating you have the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.920
 twitter in the description you already know that 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.840
 do not forget part of the 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.520
 creation of sweet tarts is also worth 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.710
 Tuta be repeat the description to follow 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.580
 and good we left you in another day with the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.280
 It is part of 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.540
 where we saw the violence the teams and 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.400
 Well the first thing that I bring to you today is the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.350
 club tab is where we had my 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.880
 club for our new players 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.350
 statistics of our players have 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.450
 had a thing that is leaving them worth 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.190
 which are challenges and it would be pretty good 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.170
 see them we also have saved plays 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.460
 in the team's club or when 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.690
 you score a goal and you know that you save 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.640
 the clip then this time it will take place 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.020
 directly on ultimate team and where 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.670
 we could see a part where it gets 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.500
 change remove back is dedicated not 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.080
 so we would send what becomes the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.330
 club shield and customize our 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.130
 kit or be our kit we could 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.170
 somehow edit our 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.700
 equipment and we would also have the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.900
 part of eliminating the club and changing the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.030
 club name as I said 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.310
 We have previously seen the part of the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.020
 club where we could with some form 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.640
 edit our kit and let's see 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.130
 more in detail how would it be 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.840
 we had the player here and we could 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.760
 edit for example our base vale 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.350
 first the base of our kit no 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.540
 we can do it from scratch we take a 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.130
 base is any of the kit of 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.470
 any club I do not know if we would have to 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.270
 buy one but it could not be edited 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.920
 from a base worth then we can 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.180
 edit colors import images 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.760
 like nike's 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.730
 of pumas de digas and add then some 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.769
 more things and then remove or put more 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.209
 a little bit is a bit the style we had 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.859
 to dig deeper into them I do not think 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.019
 she noticed this we could also 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.790
 avoid what comes to be the kit 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.889
 local and the visitor but hopefully yes 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.689
 because it would be once since a great 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.920
 advance as we would have your club but 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.659
 Of course your club has to have your 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.939
 equipment and that equipment would be very 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.620
 very good editing by yourself over 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.389
 new tab that this guy has added 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.459
 a ultimate team is the tab but 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.930
 where I would like to inquire 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.700
 little more to explain things not 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.409
 as you see we had our own 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.419
 virtual throne ultimate team would be something 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.040
 great brutal for me would be the greatest 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.900
 this year's advance of the ultimate team if 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.370
 come out as you can see we would have 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.319
 our own letter with our own 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.120
 player and on the right side we had a 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.549
 pair of tabs where we could see what 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.889
 that comes to be the parts in this way 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.150
 new the ultimate and we could not see the 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.159
 statistics of our player 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.500
 we could improve they improved a great 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.939
 would be more interesting than the kid and 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.769
 will do this idea no more and will teach more 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.569
 how it would be everything but really already more or 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.519
 least has done something quite well the 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.560
 online arena where we could try a 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.629
 with our friends for a little 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.530
 this player's corners how it moves and 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.840
 so try it 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.090
 more than anything but the game is not 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.860
 online we would not have the trainings 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.420
 where we will play with our friends in 5 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.060
 against 5 more or less is what I could 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.590
 translate that has put the kid and then 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.240
 you can edit our but not put in 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.250
 the face the hair with you we want 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.319
 then we would have our moves not 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.239
 our best iclei to be called 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.650
 the best plays of our player 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.600
 where we would also have saved them 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.520
 in ultimate and as for this idea to me 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.080
 I would like it that way a lot I think it's 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.000
 one of the best things that could 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.290
 have the ultimate and be able to play with 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.180
 our idols in our team 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.830
 imagine they are good at playing together 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.920
 ibarbo where to running pa'lante without 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.390
 pay or stream or playing against 15 ua 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.040
 or for example rowing playing against 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.620
 rogerio ceni not that he is a player 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.239
 favorite to see is like this would not be very thing 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.459
 very good and something that would help one 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.319
 lots to improve in terms of reality 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.000
 last team would be brutal to me the 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.890
 best idea of ​​this kid without any 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.479
 doubt the next tab that you have devised 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.669
 this kid is the transfer where 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.530
 we had few changes some that others 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.990
 but few of us would have the market of 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.180
 signings we had the list of objectives 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.770
 the list of transfers and as you see 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.540
 has added again ballast and buffers that 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.610
 are the exchange offers hopefully they are 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.650
 well because when we spend coins 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.300
 the friends pass the players would be 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.490
 something very very good hopefully they continue 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.229
 exist and come back because it's something that 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.939
 for me it is vital in our resigned 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.250
 halal they were because it would be brutal 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.509
 as for the search of players the 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.819
 truth is that the thing has improved a 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.800
 little not really in what it comes to be 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.689
 the aesthetics of the search I like more 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.189
 I like it more than the current one and one thing 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.599
 that has added are being able to choose 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.370
 example directly the letter that you 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.530
 you want to find us we already had the 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.199
 gündogan where we would have the normal life 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.210
 the hand of match is this league that I do not know 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.340
 of what it is and another and it would be brutal to look for 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.289
 this player no longer just by position 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.090
 but by means and letters our 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.219
 letters regarding the search for money 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.120
 in terms of price yes that improvement already 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.740
 you know that in career mode 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.389
 directly the little arrows where you go 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.639
 changing little by little it's worth and it's done 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.900
 much faster but instead in 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.490
 last store is not like that in the last 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.189
 time you have to go one hundred and fifty 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.930
 150 or a thousand in a thousand is a little price 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.580
 weird the truth is not just from the 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.349
 all good and good guys like I said 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.300
 previously I have to gross is a 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.270
 prepared surprise is worth in the form of 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.680
 design and from pnv a 16 I would like that 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.949
 you in the comments contribute 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.240
 'aces' your ideas your things 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.610
 anything goes you know 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.860
 a challenge of a thousand likes which would be 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.810
 incredible reach and good now 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.370
 just leave with a little music and the 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.680
 surprise that I know that many are going to 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.300
 love one is the currency form but 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.830
 a little bit of ultimen team 16 that to me 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.020
 has surprised a lot and I want that what 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.120
 You see, vale is a brutal thing worth 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.979
 you have the twitter of the creators in 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.840
 the description also mine 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.090
 subscribe to my channel if you want more 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.590
 fixed 16 also bring a like that 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.060
 you know we have the challenge of the thousands 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.979
 as I have said many times in this 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.449
 video was also the last one with the super 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.110
 if a little bit of music is already 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.470
 next 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.470
 goodbye 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.330
 but there are two bars in the microphone 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.770
 out of all the shit get the 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.409
 Spain behind the theater he stretched the 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.270
 curtain look that yesterday no longer copy flows 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.500
 he gave me the varna rapper face that 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.240
 copy that sends the rap scene 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.800
 Spanish I live on the outside I record my 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.569
 cup and they do not really hit me although it's 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.069
 easy with everything I do to catch my 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:41.860
 way to get my job are pumps to the
