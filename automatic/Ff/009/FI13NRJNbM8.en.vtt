here we are again so just for the set up

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.279 
here we are again so just for the set up
here<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.100> see<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.369> tripod<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.260> what<00:00:22.260> I

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
here you can see the tripod and what I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:31.250 
here you can see the tripod and what I
did<00:00:22.529> was<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.949> drilled<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:27.410> ring<00:00:28.410> bolt<00:00:30.260> right

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
did was I drilled in a a ring bolt right

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.590 
did was I drilled in a a ring bolt right
beneath<00:00:32.099> where<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.579> speaker<00:00:32.910> goes<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.420> have

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
beneath where the speaker goes so I have

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.090 
beneath where the speaker goes so I have
measured<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> speaker<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> actually<00:00:34.890> goes<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
measured the speaker it actually goes to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.160 
measured the speaker it actually goes to
just<00:00:35.640> about<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> couple<00:00:36.360> millimeters<00:00:37.020> above

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
just about a couple millimeters above

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.160 
just about a couple millimeters above
and<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.190> way<00:00:38.879> it'll<00:00:39.059> look<00:00:39.270> seamless<00:00:39.570> when

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and that way it'll look seamless when

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.459 
and that way it'll look seamless when
the<00:00:40.440> when<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> screen<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.320> also

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the when the screen is on it and it also

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
the when the screen is on it and it also
provides<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.129> hook<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:45.559> tying<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.739> scrim<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
provides a hook for tying the scrim to

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.250 
provides a hook for tying the scrim to
the<00:00:47.610> top<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.059> when<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.329> stretch<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.719> up<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the top so when you stretch it up to the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.580 
the top so when you stretch it up to the
top<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:51.030> goes<00:00:51.210> when<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.600> extend<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
top it it goes when you extend the the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.720 
top it it goes when you extend the the
tubes<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> scrim<00:00:54.899> itself<00:00:55.520> here<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> is

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
tubes so for the scrim itself here it is

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.180 
tubes so for the scrim itself here it is

and above the stove bolt and now we can
stretch<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.440> up<00:03:22.079> and<00:03:23.079> there<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.410> have<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.730> all

all to height actually there's I can go

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.020 
all to height actually there's I can go
a<00:03:29.110> little<00:03:29.290> bit<00:03:29.500> higher<00:03:29.650> if<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.250> wanted<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.910> make

a little bit higher if I wanted to make

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.130 
a little bit higher if I wanted to make
it<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.180> little<00:03:31.299> more<00:03:31.450> tighter<00:03:31.720> I've<00:03:31.989> got

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
it a little more tighter I've got

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.890 
it a little more tighter I've got
another<00:03:32.650> couple<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.160> bolts<00:03:33.370> or<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.209> couple

another couple of bolts or a couple
holes<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:35.230> I<00:03:35.350> can<00:03:35.500> go<00:03:35.620> through<00:03:36.239> there's<00:03:37.239> the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
holes that I can go through there's the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.240 
holes that I can go through there's the
tie<00:03:38.470> at<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.829> top<00:03:39.450> with<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:41.049> bolt<00:03:41.260> then

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
tie at the top with the the bolt then

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.460 
tie at the top with the the bolt then
you<00:03:42.430> can<00:03:42.579> just<00:03:42.760> imagine<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.239> speaker<00:03:43.720> up<00:03:44.079> on

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
you can just imagine the speaker up on

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.240 
you can just imagine the speaker up on
the<00:03:44.590> top<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:46.470> what<00:03:47.470> I'll<00:03:47.590> do<00:03:47.739> is<00:03:47.769> I'll<00:03:48.010> go

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
the top and what I'll do is I'll go

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.900 
the top and what I'll do is I'll go
outside<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.090> go<00:03:49.570> grab<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> car<00:03:50.110> lighting<00:03:50.500> and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
outside and go grab a car lighting and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.460 
outside and go grab a car lighting and
do<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.970> back<00:03:52.180> fill<00:03:52.420> with<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:52.870> just<00:03:52.989> show<00:03:53.440> you

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
do a back fill with it and just show you

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.110 
do a back fill with it and just show you
what<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.769> looks<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.100> in<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.519> dark<00:03:57.000> there<00:03:58.000> we

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
what it looks like in the dark there we

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.819 
what it looks like in the dark there we
go<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.510> can<00:03:58.540> see<00:03:58.720> I've<00:03:58.989> just<00:03:59.170> popped<00:03:59.440> up<00:03:59.590> our

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
go you can see I've just popped up our

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.580 
go you can see I've just popped up our
can<00:04:00.100> in<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.489> back<00:04:00.700> of<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> small<00:04:01.870> little<00:04:02.049> 86

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
can in the back of the small little 86

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.260 
can in the back of the small little 86
LED<00:04:03.090> park<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.390> just<00:04:04.870> set<00:04:05.079> it<00:04:05.110> on<00:04:05.320> one<00:04:05.500> setting

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
LED park and just set it on one setting

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.370 
LED park and just set it on one setting
and<00:04:06.450> put<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.810> sound<00:04:07.140> active<00:04:07.560> or<00:04:07.710> anything<00:04:08.090> but

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
and put it sound active or anything but

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.510 
and put it sound active or anything but
you<00:04:10.380> can<00:04:10.560> now<00:04:10.770> see<00:04:12.980> probably<00:04:13.980> turn<00:04:14.190> out<00:04:14.310> some

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
you can now see probably turn out some

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.500 
you can now see probably turn out some
more<00:04:14.610> lights<00:04:14.910> here<00:04:15.240> just<00:04:15.570> a<00:04:15.690> sec<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:18.090> there

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
more lights here just a sec and there

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.260 
more lights here just a sec and there
you<00:04:18.720> go<00:04:18.930> now<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.739> can<00:04:20.040> see<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:21.200> power<00:04:22.200> lit<00:04:22.440> up

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
you go now you can see the power lit up

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.490 
you go now you can see the power lit up
I'll<00:04:24.270> have<00:04:24.420> to<00:04:24.570> play<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> little<00:04:25.080> bit<00:04:25.320> with

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
I'll have to play a little bit with

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.890 
I'll have to play a little bit with
light<00:04:26.370> positioning<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.480> kind<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:27.690> threw

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
light positioning I just kind of threw

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.210 
light positioning I just kind of threw
it<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.110> there<00:04:28.290> so<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.500> haven't<00:04:28.710> really<00:04:31.220> made

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
it in there so I haven't really made

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.180 
it in there so I haven't really made
sure<00:04:32.520> it<00:04:32.550> was<00:04:32.790> set<00:04:32.970> up<00:04:33.090> correctly<00:04:33.890> but<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:35.010> can

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
sure it was set up correctly but you can

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.110 
sure it was set up correctly but you can
see<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.580> lights<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:36.120> up<00:04:36.210> quite<00:04:36.480> well<00:04:38.030> turn<00:04:39.030> the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
see it lights it up quite well turn the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.260 
see it lights it up quite well turn the
light<00:04:39.300> back<00:04:39.540> on<00:04:39.840> here<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:43.970> could<00:04:44.970> probably

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
light back on here and I could probably

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.260 
light back on here and I could probably
go<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.600> little<00:04:45.780> higher<00:04:46.050> just<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.970> take<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.000> few<00:04:48.210> of

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
go a little higher just to take a few of

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.000 
go a little higher just to take a few of
these<00:04:48.360> creases<00:04:48.720> out<00:04:49.050> I'll<00:04:49.260> probably<00:04:49.380> do<00:04:49.980> a

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
these creases out I'll probably do a

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.600 
these creases out I'll probably do a
quick<00:04:50.340> wash<00:04:50.610> of<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.150> thing<00:04:52.020> just<00:04:52.610> because

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
quick wash of the thing just because

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.980 
quick wash of the thing just because
it's<00:04:53.760> been<00:04:53.910> laying<00:04:54.060> on<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.390> floor<00:04:54.570> it's<00:04:54.960> a

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
it's been laying on the floor it's a

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.780 
it's been laying on the floor it's a
little<00:04:55.230> bit<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.530> little<00:04:55.830> bit<00:04:55.950> dirty<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.430> we'll

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
little bit a little bit dirty so we'll

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.810 
little bit a little bit dirty so we'll
get<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:57.090> fixed<00:04:57.510> up<00:04:57.860> but<00:04:58.860> other<00:04:59.010> than<00:04:59.250> that<00:04:59.340> I

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
get that fixed up but other than that I

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.600 
get that fixed up but other than that I
think<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.270> really<00:05:01.260> looks<00:05:01.560> good<00:05:01.830> yeah<00:05:02.430> the

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
think it really looks good yeah the

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.330 
think it really looks good yeah the
other<00:05:02.760> one<00:05:02.940> is<00:05:03.090> identical<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:03.950> no<00:05:04.950> sense<00:05:05.220> in

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
other one is identical so no sense in

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.470 
other one is identical so no sense in
having<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.760> set<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.300> when<00:05:06.510> I<00:05:06.600> be<00:05:06.780> there<00:05:08.360> but<00:05:09.360> I

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
having to set that when I be there but I

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.050 
having to set that when I be there but I
have<00:05:09.660> tried<00:05:09.930> it<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.290> it<00:05:10.470> looks<00:05:10.980> fits<00:05:11.700> just<00:05:11.940> the

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
have tried it and it looks fits just the

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.550 
have tried it and it looks fits just the
same<00:05:15.590> at<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.650> end<00:05:16.770> of<00:05:16.980> my<00:05:17.130> project<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:18.810> DJ

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
same at the end of my project the DJ

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560 
same at the end of my project the DJ
screams<00:05:19.950> I<00:05:20.190> may<00:05:20.370> make<00:05:20.730> a<00:05:20.760> few<00:05:20.880> more<00:05:21.240> because

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
screams I may make a few more because

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.030 
screams I may make a few more because
I've<00:05:21.720> got<00:05:21.900> a<00:05:21.930> couple<00:05:22.170> of<00:05:22.290> light<00:05:22.440> stands<00:05:22.770> and

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
I've got a couple of light stands and

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.640 
I've got a couple of light stands and
then<00:05:23.130> of<00:05:23.220> course<00:05:23.250> I've<00:05:23.580> got<00:05:23.610> my<00:05:24.500> trust<00:05:25.500> on

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
then of course I've got my trust on

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.640 
then of course I've got my trust on
order<00:05:26.070> so<00:05:26.580> it's<00:05:26.820> it's<00:05:27.420> got<00:05:27.570> two<00:05:27.750> T<00:05:27.930> bars<00:05:28.170> and<00:05:28.530> a

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
order so it's it's got two T bars and a

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.960 
order so it's it's got two T bars and a
and<00:05:29.400> just<00:05:29.640> a<00:05:29.880> I<00:05:30.360> beam<00:05:30.750> trust<00:05:31.110> that's<00:05:31.970> that's

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
and just a I beam trust that's that's

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.900 
and just a I beam trust that's that's
ten<00:05:33.330> feet<00:05:33.360> wide<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.860> I'll<00:05:34.980> probably<00:05:35.340> end<00:05:35.730> up

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
ten feet wide so I'll probably end up

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.850 
ten feet wide so I'll probably end up
making<00:05:36.120> a<00:05:36.360> couple<00:05:36.870> screams<00:05:37.260> I'm<00:05:37.470> not<00:05:37.500> sure<00:05:37.770> if
