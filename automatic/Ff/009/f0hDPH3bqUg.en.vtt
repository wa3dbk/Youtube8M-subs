the world watch I'm always the robot and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.210 
the world watch I'm always the robot and
always<00:00:28.330> I've<00:00:28.480> been<00:00:28.720> ever<00:00:28.990> since<00:00:29.290> the<00:00:29.590> arcade

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
always I've been ever since the arcade

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.369 
always I've been ever since the arcade
original<00:00:30.340> however<00:00:31.300> just<00:00:31.780> so<00:00:31.990> you<00:00:32.050> know<00:00:32.259> what

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
original however just so you know what

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.139 
original however just so you know what
this<00:00:32.590> does<00:00:33.100> differ<00:00:33.430> from<00:00:33.579> the<00:00:33.760> arcade<00:00:34.059> version

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
this does differ from the arcade version

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.150 
this does differ from the arcade version
I<00:00:34.660> personally<00:00:35.200> think<00:00:35.320> the<00:00:35.440> arcade<00:00:35.710> bow<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:35.950> the

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
I personally think the arcade bow to the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.799 
I personally think the arcade bow to the
better<00:00:36.340> game<00:00:36.610> especially<00:00:37.179> because<00:00:37.690> it's

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
better game especially because it's

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.200 
better game especially because it's
three<00:00:37.989> players<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.620> not<00:00:38.769> to<00:00:39.010> but<00:00:39.760> it's<00:00:40.059> still

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
three players and not to but it's still

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.529 
three players and not to but it's still
a<00:00:40.269> good<00:00:40.420> game<00:00:40.629> nonetheless<00:00:42.120> basically<00:00:43.120> you

blaster<00:01:26.350> webinar<00:01:26.920> with<00:01:27.070> if<00:01:27.399> you're<00:01:27.579> the<00:01:27.670> robot

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
blaster webinar with if you're the robot

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.389 
blaster webinar with if you're the robot
but<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.960> other<00:01:29.079> characters<00:01:29.259> use<00:01:29.710> blasters<00:01:29.979> to

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
but the other characters use blasters to

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.499 
but the other characters use blasters to
be<00:01:30.490> fair<00:01:30.700> anyway<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:33.549> I've<00:01:33.759> shown<00:01:33.789> that<00:01:34.450> a

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
be fair anyway as I've shown that a

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.209 
be fair anyway as I've shown that a
special<00:01:34.899> attack<00:01:35.140> basically<00:01:35.680> what<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:35.920> does

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
special attack basically what that does

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.510 
special attack basically what that does
is<00:01:36.270> each<00:01:37.270> one<00:01:37.329> differs<00:01:37.899> differs<00:01:38.500> I<00:01:38.740> am<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.340> robot

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
is each one differs differs I am a robot

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.090 
is each one differs differs I am a robot
so<00:01:39.939> I<00:01:39.969> kill<00:01:40.570> myself<00:01:40.719> it<00:01:41.409> doesn't<00:01:41.740> take<00:01:41.859> any

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
so I kill myself it doesn't take any

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.580 
so I kill myself it doesn't take any
energy<00:01:42.430> or<00:01:42.670> any<00:01:42.880> light<00:01:43.060> for<00:01:43.390> which<00:01:43.659> is<00:01:43.840> good<00:01:44.020> it

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
energy or any light for which is good it

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.160 
energy or any light for which is good it
just<00:01:44.920> takes<00:01:45.159> plasma<00:01:46.090> type<00:01:46.299> energy<00:01:46.689> which<00:01:46.990> as

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
just takes plasma type energy which as

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.779 
just takes plasma type energy which as
ice<00:01:47.320> here<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.740> can<00:01:47.859> get<00:01:47.979> refilled<00:01:48.429> so<00:01:48.729> you

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
ice here you can get refilled so you

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.090

the<00:02:59.970> one<00:03:00.269> I've<00:03:00.389> just<00:03:00.569> done<00:03:00.750> there<00:03:00.989> but<00:03:01.319> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
the one I've just done there but the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.220 
the one I've just done there but the
game<00:03:01.829> isn't<00:03:02.069> exactly<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.579> hugest<00:03:03.030> it's<00:03:03.389> more

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
game isn't exactly the hugest it's more

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.289 
game isn't exactly the hugest it's more
like<00:03:04.470> well<00:03:05.250> it's<00:03:05.370> more<00:03:05.519> like<00:03:05.549> streets<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.180> age

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
like well it's more like streets of age

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.360 
like well it's more like streets of age
completions<00:03:07.139> time<00:03:07.440> but<00:03:07.799> maybe<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.190> little

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
completions time but maybe a little

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.309 
completions time but maybe a little
shorter<00:03:08.700> somewhere<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.660> between<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.109> likes

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
shorter somewhere in between the likes

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.020 
shorter somewhere in between the likes
of<00:03:10.560> all<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.980> beasts<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.459> streets<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.880> eh

of all the beasts and streets of eh

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.509 
of all the beasts and streets of eh
debate<00:03:12.389> but<00:03:13.049> it's<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.530> good<00:03:13.739> game<00:03:13.919> and<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.250> think

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
debate but it's a good game and I think

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.430 
debate but it's a good game and I think
personally<00:03:15.239> if<00:03:15.599> you<00:03:15.750> put<00:03:15.959> did<00:03:16.139> you<00:03:16.260> buy<00:03:16.410> it

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
personally if you put did you buy it

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.860 
personally if you put did you buy it

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
time and it's basically a bit like a

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.570 
time and it's basically a bit like a
survival<00:03:55.540> board<00:03:55.780> where<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.950> have<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.400> fight

practical / board meets a couple
different<00:04:01.780> type<00:04:01.960> enemies<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:02.800> that's

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
different type enemies so that's

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.040 
different type enemies so that's
something<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:03.910> adds<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.600> little<00:04:04.690> bit<00:04:04.840> more

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
something that adds a little bit more

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.870 
life span it's also on golden axe and I
quite<00:04:07.930> enjoyed<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.380> one<00:04:08.500> on<00:04:08.590> board<00:04:08.860> lux<00:04:09.130> as

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
quite enjoyed the one on board lux as

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.880 
quite enjoyed the one on board lux as
you<00:04:10.000> can<00:04:10.090> see<00:04:10.270> that<00:04:10.300> killed<00:04:10.810> them<00:04:11.020> to<00:04:11.290> go<00:04:11.710> on<00:04:11.800> to

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
you can see that killed them to go on to

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.170 
you can see that killed them to go on to
the<00:04:12.010> next<00:04:12.190> one<00:04:13.110> so<00:04:14.250> that<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.700> lasts<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.030> few

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
the next one so that it lasts a few

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.850 
the next one so that it lasts a few
hours<00:04:16.420> you<00:04:16.630> do<00:04:16.780> tend<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.260> fight<00:04:17.530> all<00:04:17.739> the

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.940 
hours you do tend to fight all the
enemies<00:04:18.010> since<00:04:18.870> it's<00:04:19.870> as<00:04:20.110> I<00:04:20.260> say<00:04:20.410> it's<00:04:20.500> just<00:04:20.770> a

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
enemies since it's as I say it's just a

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.250 
enemies since it's as I say it's just a
little<00:04:21.190> extra<00:04:21.580> that<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:22.060> just<00:04:22.600> small<00:04:23.080> bit<00:04:23.230> of

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260

little extra that I just small bit of
life<00:04:23.500> span<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:25.530> that'll<00:04:26.530> be<00:04:26.710> pretty<00:04:26.890> cool<00:04:27.900> one

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
life span so that'll be pretty cool one

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.180 
life span so that'll be pretty cool one
of<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.050> other<00:04:29.110> cool<00:04:29.380> things<00:04:29.650> if<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:30.010> can

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
actually call onto a versus mode where

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.510 
actually call onto a versus mode where
you<00:04:32.110> can<00:04:32.320> both<00:04:32.590> be<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.860> same<00:04:32.890> character<00:04:33.460> if

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
you can both be the same character if

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.190 
you can both be the same character if
you<00:04:33.640> want<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.330> if<00:04:34.600> you've<00:04:34.750> got<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.930> fear<00:04:35.170> of

you want to so if you've got a fear of

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.190 
you want to so if you've got a fear of
it<00:04:35.380> then<00:04:35.710> that's<00:04:35.920> pretty<00:04:36.220> cold<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:37.810> don't<00:04:38.050> get

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
it then that's pretty cold you don't get

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.230 
it then that's pretty cold you don't get
doing<00:04:38.440> a<00:04:38.500> special<00:04:38.710> attack<00:04:39.100> obviously<00:04:39.580> but<00:04:39.910> you
