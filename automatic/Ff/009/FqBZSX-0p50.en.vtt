00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 the dfb president in the ZwickmÃ¼hle 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.940
 mayer aprons must be his in 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.980
 california want because probably that 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.080
 Take a trainer in protection or klinsmann 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.019
 could sail the whole wind out of it 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.340
 take many three euros for it 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.230
 if he said he does not have to 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.000
 his family at ten to germany 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.980
 he could only do it the other way around 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.119
 live here or now and then to his 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.859
 family flying over 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.090
 that would be fine as well 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.240
 everything was with me just a matter of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.480
 klinsmann is yours, he flies 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.329
 first class paid that the dfb or 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 paid for it out of his own pocket 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.190
 I heard that pays off 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.670
 to 250,000 euros 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.090
 who the klezmer flying company 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.020
 The flying of qe2 is sponsored 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.840
 lufthansa of this is true 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.190
 I 've heard of my aprons when I am 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.190
 then you can not believe it 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.160
 the biggest question asked in the area 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.750
 not that means the dfb has enough money 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.980
 they want to pay for that 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.980
 say yes said that is sponsored or 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.300
 completely confused then he really can 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.490
 at least once a week to fly over 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.810
 who is not a problem there is certainly the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.150
 Num of care is for training 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.040
 back this phase is so 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.330
 I consider tournaments a bit 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.190
 stupid for I have to be very careful 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.780
 say because the burden is different 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.160
 kind of is because if I for example 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.200
 before with gerd mÃ¼ller or franz 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.520
 beckenbauer made 3500 meters on 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.240
 that would have killed me and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.240
 I have not arrived yet 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.050
 restrained today the word is now 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.760
 for you i know some bundesliga 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.920
 Trainer calling her klinsmann 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.510
 have and have asked him the players 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.040
 to take out of this fitness test 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.170
 because they have such a high load 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.550
 your critics were satisfied with the phone 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.290
 that the other 20 have seen 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.209
 said yes yes yes and now nothing 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.100
 happened he let everyone join 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.170
 and then they go broke because of that 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.880
 Bundesliga trainer so that the work 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.410
 next game again focuses 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.820
 and not they are not fit for 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.500
 the training work but for the 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.370
 of course there is such a thing 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.959
 natural voltage ratio between 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.420
 coaches and federal trainers always 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.250
 available because the club coach at 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.190
 dearest that they do not go there 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.670
 have to 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.260
 so that they can decide on their own 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.210
 that's because it's always exciting 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.490
 There are always areas of tension that will be there 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.640
 give if if now three times 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.830
 conversations have taken place and there 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.960
 no objections to this 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.700
 brought additional workouts 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.870
 because they said we did 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.490
 Must be from an elite player 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.690
 our elite players the international 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.190
 team that you have a higher 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.770
 have the ability to withstand stress as the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.790
 normal player in the bundesliga 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.170
 played the weather then accepted 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.120
 I suppose I do not believe that anymore 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.120
 it is accepted that the need 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.970
 be satisfied but I say that is 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.710
 in such fitness you exactly in the 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.060
 has made the description of the goods 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.840
 namely the fitness 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.989
 whether this is a player overloaded 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.470
 can and now comes the last point 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.209
 also more or less a question to him 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.660
 it will unite in the individual 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.060
 so the different exercises 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.310
 market demands because those are the trainers 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.680
 I know the market very well 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.200
 sometimes twice as much by his players 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.640
 much more than others than other trainers 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.599
 They just do not have that endurance 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.840
 Workouts are also at the beginning 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.840
 the season 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.609
 I have left now 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.290
 it is just a wrong load in 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.269
 At this time, you are doing this 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.590
 no training in endurance because 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.209
 the training in the endurance area the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.070
 takes away spritzigkeit and that is that 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.600
 what I do not understand is therefore is 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.430
 you have to stick to it afterwards 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.810
 I would have agreed that the market 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.100
 of course also during the season 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:36.039
 has made a huge deal with rats 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.360
 they have to run and they have to 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.699
 then vote together and have them 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.979
 said nothing is said with now 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.349
 the question to you you want the 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.150
 satisfy conversation needs 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.030
 they are more responsible at the lake 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.009
 is that the routinely that is 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.110
 The trainer will be invited back 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.169
 and to discuss the things with 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.610
 next time i just say 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.949
 within the coaching there's also 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.479
 no unanimous opinion because the 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.000
 trainer every trainer of the 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.039
 I see different trainer 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.750
 the professor always read us 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:12.610
 behind the ancestral says so now 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.070
 is too much and now the 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.349
 muscles acidified and the like more 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.190
 because the market when he has heard something like that 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:23.530
 he just laughed not outcast 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:31.510
 mayer aprons we always move out 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:34.810
 I have a little question when you ask 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.990
 expect lara talking a 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.880
 consensus between 18 trainers and me 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.410
 just expect that to define but 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.990
 They are the law of the land 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.380
 see that one can say that again 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.590
 which obviously not before 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.450
 said 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:58.630
 and that will also take place in 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:06:00.460
 I'm sure one this year 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.200
 single bundesliga club though 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.790
 leading german bundesliga club 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.080
 very different moods 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.080
 turn up he said
