increases<00:02:24.970> range<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.540> motion<00:02:25.870> which

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
increases range of motion which

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.140 
increases range of motion which
increases<00:02:26.560> accuracy<00:02:27.220> but<00:02:27.730> let's<00:02:27.940> talk<00:02:28.090> about

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
increases accuracy but let's talk about

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.610 
increases accuracy but let's talk about
it<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.570> little<00:02:28.690> more<00:02:28.930> in<00:02:28.990> depth<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.290> did<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.500> little

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
it a little more in depth I did a little

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.290 
it a little more in depth I did a little
demonstration<00:02:29.830> myself<00:02:30.490> motion<00:02:30.880> tracks<00:02:31.120> of

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
demonstration myself motion tracks of

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.780 
demonstration myself motion tracks of
arrows<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:31.870> here<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.590> can<00:02:32.710> see<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
arrows on here so you can see the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.280 
arrows on here so you can see the
difference<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.360> know<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.630> they<00:02:34.900> say<00:02:35.140> it's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
difference you know it they say it's

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.500 
difference you know it they say it's
about<00:02:35.380> 40%<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.340> truth<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.880> it's<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.330> right

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
about 40% and the truth is it's a right

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.470 
about 40% and the truth is it's a right
about<00:02:37.750> 40%<00:02:38.410> increased<00:02:38.830> range<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.190> motion<00:02:39.480> and

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
about 40% increased range of motion and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.240 
about 40% increased range of motion and
you<00:02:41.050> know<00:02:41.140> what<00:02:41.320> does<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.440> do<00:02:41.710> for<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:42.040> like

you know what does that do for you like

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.060 
you know what does that do for you like

and I'm going to answer those questions
right<00:02:47.980> now<00:02:48.010> through<00:02:48.400> some<00:02:48.550> gameplay<00:02:48.850> in<00:02:48.910> here

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
right now through some gameplay in here

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.510 
right now through some gameplay in here
so<00:02:49.210> we<00:02:49.300> could<00:02:49.390> talk<00:02:49.920> what<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.070> does<00:02:51.190> for<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.460> is

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
so we could talk what it does for you is

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.040 
so we could talk what it does for you is
it<00:02:51.580> allows<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.030> range<00:02:52.240> raise<00:02:52.690> your

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
it allows you to range raise your

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.010 
it allows you to range raise your
sensitivity<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.760> brings<00:02:55.300> out<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.720> pluses

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
sensitivity and it brings out the pluses

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.740 
sensitivity and it brings out the pluses
and<00:02:56.260> minuses<00:02:56.470> of<00:02:57.010> both<00:02:57.480> raising<00:02:58.480> your

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and minuses of both raising your

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.320 
and minuses of both raising your
sensitivity<00:02:59.380> increases<00:02:59.670> your<00:03:00.670> ability<00:03:00.940> to

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
sensitivity increases your ability to

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.090 
sensitivity increases your ability to
turn<00:03:01.750> around<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.350> increases<00:03:02.860> your<00:03:02.980> ability

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
turn around and increases your ability

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.510 
turn around and increases your ability
to<00:03:03.460> snap<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.420> targets<00:03:04.870> quickly<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.530> correct

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
to snap to targets quickly and correct

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.610 
to snap to targets quickly and correct
quickly<00:03:07.270> right<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.600> you're<00:03:07.750> aiming<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.290> you

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
quickly right if you're aiming and you

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.830 
quickly right if you're aiming and you
aim<00:03:08.800> is<00:03:09.010> off<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.700> can<00:03:09.730> correct<00:03:10.210> more<00:03:10.480> quickly

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
aim is off you can correct more quickly

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
stick as you can see I've set up a force

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.159 
stick as you can see I've set up a force
gauge<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.289> paper<00:04:32.530> clip<00:04:32.650> on<00:04:32.979> a<00:04:33.960> thumb<00:04:34.960> grip

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
same exact test with the FPS freak you

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.420 
same exact test with the FPS freak you
pullin<00:04:56.259> it<00:04:56.380> slowly<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:56.830> get<00:04:56.949> it<00:04:57.039> to<00:04:57.099> the<00:04:57.190> last

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
pullin it slowly you get it to the last

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.400 
pullin it slowly you get it to the last
frame<00:04:57.849> exactly<00:04:58.720> where<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:58.990> comes<00:04:59.199> just

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
frame exactly where it comes just

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.550 
frame exactly where it comes just
perfectly<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.520> end<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:00.970> look<00:05:01.210> at<00:05:01.330> that<00:05:01.560> 50

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
perfectly to the end and look at that 50

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.610 
perfectly to the end and look at that 50
grams<00:05:03.130> of<00:05:03.430> force<00:05:03.759> is<00:05:03.940> all<00:05:04.449> it<00:05:04.659> took<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:05.380> move

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
grams of force is all it took to move

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.339 
grams of force is all it took to move
the<00:05:05.949> stick<00:05:06.340> to<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.090> exact<00:05:07.539> same<00:05:07.810> spot<00:05:08.139> and

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
the stick to the exact same spot and

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.040 
the stick to the exact same spot and
that's<00:05:08.500> interesting<00:05:09.280> in<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.970> in<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.599> reason

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
that's interesting in the in the reason

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.860 
that's interesting in the in the reason
that<00:05:11.349> their<00:05:11.789> flagship<00:05:12.789> product<00:05:13.330> is<00:05:13.479> the<00:05:13.720> most

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
that their flagship product is the most

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.330 
that their flagship product is the most
important<00:05:14.349> product<00:05:14.680> because<00:05:14.889> if<00:05:15.009> it<00:05:15.130> takes

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
important product because if it takes

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.779 
important product because if it takes
less<00:05:15.639> force<00:05:16.199> to<00:05:17.199> move<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.710> stick<00:05:18.009> do<00:05:18.400> you<00:05:18.550> need

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
less force to move the stick do you need

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.809 
less force to move the stick do you need
more<00:05:19.000> grip<00:05:19.449> no<00:05:20.229> you<00:05:20.289> don't<00:05:20.680> let's<00:05:21.370> talk<00:05:21.580> about

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
the ads the one you see on the home web

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.860 
the ads the one you see on the home web
page<00:05:33.159> and<00:05:33.340> everything<00:05:33.669> like<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:33.880> yes<00:05:34.659> your

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
page and everything like that yes your

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.480 
page and everything like that yes your
thumb<00:05:35.110> fits<00:05:35.320> in<00:05:35.469> there<00:05:35.620> great<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:36.070> grip<00:05:36.310> is

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
thumb fits in there great the grip is

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.760 
thumb fits in there great the grip is
phenomenal<00:05:37.300> but<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:38.259> problem<00:05:38.590> is<00:05:38.650> you<00:05:38.740> don't

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
phenomenal but the problem is you don't

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.409 
phenomenal but the problem is you don't
need<00:05:39.099> that<00:05:39.310> extra<00:05:39.460> grip<00:05:39.699> as<00:05:39.909> we<00:05:40.060> just<00:05:40.270> talked

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
need that extra grip as we just talked

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:41.580 
need that extra grip as we just talked
about<00:05:40.509> you<00:05:40.750> don't<00:05:40.900> need<00:05:41.050> that<00:05:41.169> extra<00:05:41.500> grip

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
about you don't need that extra grip

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.189 
about you don't need that extra grip
what<00:05:41.860> you<00:05:41.979> do<00:05:42.250> need<00:05:42.550> is<00:05:42.789> a<00:05:43.150> consistent<00:05:43.930> surface

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
what you do need is a consistent surface

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.270 
what you do need is a consistent surface
and<00:05:45.030> your<00:05:46.030> thumb<00:05:46.330> meets<00:05:46.810> with<00:05:46.990> that<00:05:47.139> bowl<00:05:47.440> not

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
and your thumb meets with that bowl not

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.310 
and your thumb meets with that bowl not
consistently<00:05:49.150> in<00:05:49.360> all<00:05:49.599> directions<00:05:49.810> right

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
consistently in all directions right

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.600 
consistently in all directions right
once<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:50.590> reach<00:05:50.889> full<00:05:51.159> range<00:05:51.370> of<00:05:51.460> motion

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
once you reach full range of motion

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.450 
once you reach full range of motion
which<00:05:51.940> has<00:05:52.060> been<00:05:52.210> increased<00:05:53.009> as<00:05:54.009> you<00:05:54.159> can<00:05:54.310> see

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
which has been increased as you can see

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.399 
which has been increased as you can see
here<00:05:54.669> you<00:05:54.820> lose<00:05:55.060> consistent<00:05:55.750> contact<00:05:56.169> with

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
here you lose consistent contact with

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.469 
here you lose consistent contact with
the<00:05:56.530> surface<00:05:56.740> which<00:05:57.099> means<00:05:57.340> that<00:05:57.580> you<00:05:57.699> there's

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
the surface which means that you there's

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.570 
the surface which means that you there's
not<00:05:58.599> a<00:05:58.659> consistent<00:05:59.289> feel<00:05:59.500> at<00:05:59.770> all<00:06:00.039> ranges<00:06:00.250> of

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
not a consistent feel at all ranges of

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.890 
not a consistent feel at all ranges of
motion<00:06:00.699> as<00:06:01.030> you<00:06:01.210> can<00:06:01.360> see<00:06:01.479> in<00:06:01.569> this<00:06:01.719> direction

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
motion as you can see in this direction

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.439 
motion as you can see in this direction
as<00:06:02.289> well<00:06:02.440> but<00:06:03.009> the<00:06:03.159> bigger<00:06:03.520> problem<00:06:03.819> then<00:06:04.270> that

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
as well but the bigger problem then that

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.529 
as well but the bigger problem then that
is<00:06:04.719> is<00:06:04.960> that<00:06:05.650> it<00:06:05.800> creates<00:06:05.949> a<00:06:06.430> ramp<00:06:07.120> that<00:06:07.360> your

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
is is that it creates a ramp that your

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.559 
is is that it creates a ramp that your
thumb<00:06:07.750> has<00:06:07.930> to<00:06:08.110> climb<00:06:08.580> before<00:06:09.580> it<00:06:09.699> overcomes

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:10.569 
thumb has to climb before it overcomes

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.170 
thumb has to climb before it overcomes
that<00:06:11.259> range<00:06:11.560> of<00:06:11.710> motion<00:06:11.770> right<00:06:12.400> so<00:06:12.909> when<00:06:13.060> your

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
that range of motion right so when your

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.629 
that range of motion right so when your
thumb<00:06:13.449> climbs<00:06:13.990> that<00:06:14.229> ramp<00:06:14.500> it<00:06:14.740> it<00:06:15.219> increases

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
thumb climbs that ramp it it increases

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.640 
thumb climbs that ramp it it increases
the<00:06:16.000> amount<00:06:16.210> of<00:06:16.330> force<00:06:16.599> that<00:06:16.840> you<00:06:16.990> feel<00:06:17.349> it

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
the amount of force that you feel it

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.249 
the amount of force that you feel it
takes<00:06:18.099> to<00:06:18.849> move<00:06:19.120> the<00:06:19.330> thumb<00:06:19.539> stick<00:06:19.840> and<00:06:20.020> that's

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:20.259 
takes to move the thumb stick and that's

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:22.770 
takes to move the thumb stick and that's
a<00:06:20.409> lack<00:06:20.650> of<00:06:20.830> consistency<00:06:21.370> so<00:06:21.699> now<00:06:21.909> we<00:06:21.969> have<00:06:22.300> the

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
a lack of consistency so now we have the

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.080 
a lack of consistency so now we have the
FPS<00:06:23.139> freak<00:06:23.380> sniper<00:06:23.710> and<00:06:24.039> as<00:06:24.400> you<00:06:24.520> can<00:06:24.639> see<00:06:24.699> it's

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
FPS freak sniper and as you can see it's

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.089 
FPS freak sniper and as you can see it's
just<00:06:25.180> more<00:06:25.569> fluid<00:06:26.169> it's<00:06:26.650> just<00:06:26.889> more

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
just more fluid it's just more

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:29.129 
just more fluid it's just more
consistent<00:06:27.880> across<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:28.419> surfaces<00:06:28.960> there's

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
consistent across the surfaces there's

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.350 
consistent across the surfaces there's
no<00:06:29.289> ramps<00:06:29.650> to<00:06:29.770> climb<00:06:30.039> there's<00:06:30.490> nothing<00:06:30.909> none

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
no ramps to climb there's nothing none

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.779 
no ramps to climb there's nothing none
of<00:06:31.509> those<00:06:31.599> problems<00:06:32.130> yeah<00:06:33.130> of<00:06:33.310> course<00:06:33.550> when

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
of those problems yeah of course when

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.339 
of those problems yeah of course when
you<00:06:33.880> move<00:06:34.060> to<00:06:34.270> full<00:06:34.479> range<00:06:34.719> of<00:06:34.840> motion<00:06:34.990> which

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
you move to full range of motion which

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.350 
you move to full range of motion which
is<00:06:35.500> absolutely<00:06:36.099> phenomenal<00:06:36.339> with<00:06:36.849> the<00:06:36.969> FPS

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
is absolutely phenomenal with the FPS

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.969
