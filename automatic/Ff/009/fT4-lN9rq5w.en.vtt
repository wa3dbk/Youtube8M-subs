00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 well it's him everyone if you 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.680
 you ask questions about how 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.330
 commented good gameplay is good we are 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.859
 left to discover the six tips 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.599
 most important to succeed 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.040
 tip number 1 is good for me the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.960
 more important is to find a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.730
 sentence of hanging the beginning of the video 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960
 I shook you a bit 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.240
 noticed that's why you're 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.500
 always present on this one and it's 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.180
 for that I invite you to 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 find and look for I hit myself 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.560
 evoked on the channel so sought all 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.150
 first a good hanging sentence for 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.830
 the beginning of the video and the end of the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.840
 video so that all the people you 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.949
 recognize directly on this one 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 when they will call on the button 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.350
 the eye 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.880
 tip number two for the second 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.040
 advice i will invite you to adopt 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.530
 an approachable and endearing voice yes 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.840
 it's cute not endearing in this 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.360
 meaning there but rather trying to adopt 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.129
 your own style of presentation and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.930
 so your own personality through 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.789
 videos to make it fun 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.120
 entirely to the people who 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.120
 look 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.610
 board number board number 3 as 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.989
 you've been able to notice it from 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.039
 the time I do that gestures with my 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.270
 hands and well it's called the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.920
 gesture and it must be adopted 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.750
 absolutely but not too much 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.420
 because otherwise well we'll all 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.580
 just take you for a crazy 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.020
 tip number 4 tip number 4 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.180
 for me it's the most important thing 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.580
 to have a good quality microphone as 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.500
 I have exactly the same holds good here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.090
 it's me the vineyard and well if you do not 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.770
 do not have a good microphone all 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.930
 simply to improve it by 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.509
 positioning a small foam on the one 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.130
 in order to create a pop filter and 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.409
 to improve the sound quality 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.000
 tip number 5 depending on the type of 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.400
 6 videos and more or less videos 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.260
 long 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.670
 advise you to prepare your text 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.540
 have you advance as you can see 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.160
 since just now I'm throwing 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.450
 little pots of view on this screen there everything 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.490
 just because I have small 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.050
 notes so as not to forget anything and all 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.310
 your releases so it's very 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.170
 important if you are doing small 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.270
 irl videos no need you can there 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.040
 go to the feeling if you have the courage 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.750
 but otherwise I advise you anyway 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.980
 prepare a small text on the front that 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.120
 would still be nicer for 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.550
 those who watch it and those who 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.980
 listen to it before any advice number 6 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.870
 for this last tip and yes I know 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.040
 the video is almost already finished 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.080
 well, I recommended everything 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.330
 simply to place a little music 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.520
 in the background of your video which will of course 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.350
 less than your voice in order to 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.520
 people hear you from correctly and 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.260
 it will add a little side 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.280
 professional to your video and will be 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.730
 more enjoyable to 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.220
 spectators 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.480
