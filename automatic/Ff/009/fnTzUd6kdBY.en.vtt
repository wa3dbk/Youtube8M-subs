00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.599
 Red 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.599

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.559
 let's say that way 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:10.749
 having done this once the area that interests us is colored 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:14.459

 perfect 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.620
 Now let's go and see if we have learned the external part but I think now 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:43.039
 took the outside of the beautiful picture so not inside the tooth 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.069
 so what we do in this case we go on selection 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.529
 reverse 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.979
