00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
its yeah it's like a modern Stratocaster

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.090 
its yeah it's like a modern Stratocaster
basically<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.990> where<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.259> think<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
basically and that's where I think the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.219 
basically and that's where I think the
entire<00:01:53.880> idea<00:01:54.329> about<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> guitar<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:57.079> even<00:01:58.079> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
entire idea about the guitar is even the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.749 
entire idea about the guitar is even the
body<00:01:58.409> shape<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.340> Stratocaster

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
body shape it's like a Stratocaster

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.980 
body shape it's like a Stratocaster
style<00:02:00.329> guitar<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.460> with<00:02:02.460> slight<00:02:03.060> changes<00:02:03.450> in

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
style guitar but with slight changes in

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.710 
style guitar but with slight changes in
slight<00:02:05.180> modernisations<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:08.599> think<00:02:09.599> an

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
slight modernisations and I think an

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.140 
slight modernisations and I think an
ambition<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> make<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.530> even<00:02:10.770> more

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
ambition to make it even more

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.750 
ambition to make it even more
ergonomically

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
ergonomically

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.179 
ergonomically
correct<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:14.349> where<00:02:14.650> was<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.340> neck<00:02:15.549> em<00:02:17.010> yeah

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.860 

maybe<00:02:21.189> there<00:02:21.400> wasn't<00:02:21.670> much<00:02:21.790> more<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.180> say<00:02:22.360> it's

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
maybe there wasn't much more to say it's

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.550 
maybe there wasn't much more to say it's
both<00:02:23.230> tone<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.620> course<00:02:23.860> same<00:02:25.110> attachment<00:02:26.110> as

tremolo it's actually quite good at

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:55.650 
tremolo it's actually quite good at
returning<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.500> pitch<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:51.840> yeah<00:04:54.660> there's

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
returning to pitch and yeah there's

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.180 
returning to pitch and yeah there's
nothing<00:04:55.990> wrong<00:04:56.110> with<00:04:56.169> this<00:04:56.380> guitar<00:04:56.560> yeah

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
nothing wrong with this guitar yeah

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.170 
nothing wrong with this guitar yeah
there<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.580> one<00:04:57.610> thing<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:59.169> knot<00:04:59.470> is<00:05:00.180> slightly

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
there is one thing the knot is slightly

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.080 
there is one thing the knot is slightly
too<00:05:01.900> high<00:05:02.200> and<00:05:02.820> and<00:05:04.169> this<00:05:05.169> is<00:05:05.350> not<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.560> problem

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
too high and and this is not a problem

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.580 
too high and and this is not a problem
it's<00:05:07.090> not<00:05:07.240> much<00:05:07.570> so<00:05:07.810> much<00:05:07.960> a<00:05:08.020> problem<00:05:08.290> with<00:05:08.530> the

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
it's not much so much a problem with the

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.159 
it's not much so much a problem with the
action<00:05:09.100> because<00:05:09.540> it<00:05:10.540> came<00:05:10.810> with<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:11.020> rather

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
action because it came with a rather

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.879 
action because it came with a rather
high<00:05:11.380> action<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:12.810> lower<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:14.080> bridge<00:05:14.229> a<00:05:14.290> bit<00:05:14.650> and

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
high action I lower the bridge a bit and

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.500 
high action I lower the bridge a bit and
it<00:05:15.820> was<00:05:15.940> perfect<00:05:16.389> no<00:05:16.660> busing<00:05:17.139> anyway<00:05:17.500> but<00:05:18.510> this

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
it was perfect no busing anyway but this

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.000 
it was perfect no busing anyway but this
is<00:05:19.750> too<00:05:19.900> high<00:05:20.050> and<00:05:20.260> that<00:05:20.440> affects<00:05:20.860> the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
is too high and that affects the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.090 
is too high and that affects the
intonation<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:22.060> so<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:23.050> first<00:05:23.290> like<00:05:23.919> the

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
intonation and so the first like the

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.600 
intonation and so the first like the
three<00:05:24.400> first<00:05:24.760> frets<00:05:28.140> yeah<00:05:29.140> it's<00:05:29.560> kind<00:05:29.950> of<00:05:30.070> it's

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
three first frets yeah it's kind of it's

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.060 
three first frets yeah it's kind of it's
rather<00:05:31.030> sharp<00:05:31.600> actually<00:05:32.140> because<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.620> that's

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
rather sharp actually because and that's

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:40.110 
rather sharp actually because and that's
because<00:05:33.550> of<00:05:33.760> the<00:05:33.930> not<00:05:34.930> being<00:05:35.229> too<00:05:35.350> high<00:05:39.120> so

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
because of the not being too high so

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.670 
because of the not being too high so
that's<00:05:40.300> a<00:05:40.390> minor<00:05:40.600> complaint<00:05:42.120> and<00:05:43.680> that's

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
that's a minor complaint and that's

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.610 
that's a minor complaint and that's
basically<00:05:45.190> only<00:05:45.460> only<00:05:46.210> complaint<00:05:46.660> build

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
basically only only complaint build

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.080

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
yeah it's very good it's shockingly good

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.790 
yeah it's very good it's shockingly good
I<00:06:42.749> don't<00:06:43.749> know<00:06:43.930> about<00:06:44.050> these<00:06:44.349> ones

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
I don't know about these ones

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.640 
I don't know about these ones
there<00:06:45.580> was<00:06:45.729> actually<00:06:45.939> they<00:06:46.779> keep<00:06:47.229> doing<00:06:47.559> this

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
there was actually they keep doing this

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.510 
there was actually they keep doing this
at<00:06:47.860> court<00:06:48.300> and<00:06:49.300> even<00:06:49.740> on<00:06:50.740> a<00:06:50.889> version<00:06:51.309> before

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
at court and even on a version before

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.959 
at court and even on a version before
this<00:06:51.969> one<00:06:52.240> another<00:06:52.689> tremolo<00:06:53.469> or<00:06:53.969> basically

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:54.969 
this one another tremolo or basically

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:57.179 
this one another tremolo or basically
the<00:06:55.059> same<00:06:55.389> base<00:06:55.749> for<00:06:56.229> the<00:06:56.289> tremolo<00:06:56.529> but<00:06:56.860> it<00:06:57.039> had

00:06:57.179 --> 00:06:57.189 
the same base for the tremolo but it had

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.360 
the same base for the tremolo but it had
different<00:06:57.430> cells<00:06:57.909> it<00:06:58.240> had<00:06:58.389> more<00:06:58.749> like<00:06:59.370> they

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
different cells it had more like they

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.390 
different cells it had more like they
were<00:07:00.400> costs<00:07:01.240> metal<00:07:02.020> but<00:07:02.229> they<00:07:02.559> were<00:07:02.740> supposed

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 
were costs metal but they were supposed

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.389 
were costs metal but they were supposed
to<00:07:03.550> look<00:07:03.699> like<00:07:03.759> the<00:07:04.349> steel<00:07:05.349> cells<00:07:05.710> you<00:07:05.949> find<00:07:06.219> on

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:06.399 
to look like the steel cells you find on

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:10.290 
to look like the steel cells you find on
the<00:07:06.430> for<00:07:07.180> instance<00:07:07.300> the<00:07:08.080> Americans<00:07:09.270> what<00:07:10.270> I

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
the for instance the Americans what I

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.779 
the for instance the Americans what I
call<00:07:10.629> the<00:07:10.779> American<00:07:11.229> deluxe<00:07:11.919> series<00:07:12.729> and<00:07:14.789> at

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:15.789 
call the American deluxe series and at

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:19.409 
call the American deluxe series and at
those<00:07:16.240> this<00:07:16.710> the<00:07:17.710> screws<00:07:18.069> didn't<00:07:18.639> point<00:07:19.149> out

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419 
those this the screws didn't point out

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.209 
those this the screws didn't point out
like<00:07:19.779> they<00:07:19.930> do<00:07:20.110> now<00:07:20.379> and<00:07:20.409> they<00:07:20.740> are<00:07:20.860> rather

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:21.219 
like they do now and they are rather

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:25.350 
like they do now and they are rather
sharp<00:07:21.669> so<00:07:22.770> I'm<00:07:23.770> not<00:07:24.159> a<00:07:24.189> big<00:07:24.430> fan<00:07:24.729> of<00:07:24.789> these<00:07:25.089> bent

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
sharp so I'm not a big fan of these bent

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.239 
sharp so I'm not a big fan of these bent
steel<00:07:25.719> saddles<00:07:26.020> I<00:07:26.439> like<00:07:26.770> the<00:07:26.919> other<00:07:27.009> ones

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:27.249 
steel saddles I like the other ones

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:31.409 
steel saddles I like the other ones
better<00:07:28.710> it's<00:07:29.710> a<00:07:29.770> shame<00:07:30.039> again<00:07:30.219> on<00:07:30.580> you<00:07:30.729> cord

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:31.419 
better it's a shame again on you cord

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:34.920 
better it's a shame again on you cord
making<00:07:31.930> it<00:07:32.020> even<00:07:32.169> worse<00:07:32.319> now<00:07:32.999> playability<00:07:33.999> it

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
making it even worse now playability it

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.659 
making it even worse now playability it
gets<00:07:35.139> an<00:07:35.289> eighth<00:07:37.499> electronics<00:07:38.499> yeah<00:07:39.399> we<00:07:39.550> have

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:39.669 
gets an eighth electronics yeah we have

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:42.719 
gets an eighth electronics yeah we have
a<00:07:39.699> two<00:07:39.999> single<00:07:40.419> coils<00:07:40.870> and<00:07:41.319> we<00:07:42.099> have<00:07:42.310> a

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:42.729 
a two single coils and we have a

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:48.480 
a two single coils and we have a
humbucker<00:07:44.909> fire<00:07:45.909> switch<00:07:46.330> volume<00:07:46.779> tone<00:07:47.490> output

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.490 
humbucker fire switch volume tone output

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.379 
humbucker fire switch volume tone output
jack<00:07:48.759> and<00:07:50.249> these<00:07:51.249> work<00:07:51.520> really<00:07:51.550> good<00:07:52.060> they

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:52.389 
jack and these work really good they

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.670 
jack and these work really good they
have<00:07:53.009> very<00:07:54.009> little<00:07:54.310> noise<00:07:54.639> even<00:07:55.360> the<00:07:55.689> single

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680 
have very little noise even the single

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:03.449 
have very little noise even the single
coil<00:07:56.919> pickups<00:07:57.459> and<00:07:58.709> I<00:08:01.740> mean<00:08:02.740> I<00:08:02.770> should<00:08:03.039> expect

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:03.459 
coil pickups and I mean I should expect

00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:07.699 
coil pickups and I mean I should expect
noise<00:08:03.789> or<00:08:04.569> I<00:08:05.199> don't<00:08:05.919> know<00:08:06.180> some<00:08:07.180> kind<00:08:07.209> of

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:07.709 
noise or I don't know some kind of

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:12.899 
noise or I don't know some kind of
electronic<00:08:09.419> disturbance<00:08:10.770> so<00:08:11.770> gets<00:08:12.490> a<00:08:12.639> 10

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:12.909 
electronic disturbance so gets a 10

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:15.329 
electronic disturbance so gets a 10
because<00:08:13.509> there's<00:08:14.110> nothing<00:08:14.589> wrong<00:08:14.770> with<00:08:15.219> this

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:15.339 
because there's nothing wrong with this

00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:17.520 
because there's nothing wrong with this
one
