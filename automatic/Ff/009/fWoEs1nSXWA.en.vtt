00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so the techel's are a three-point

Fitzpatrick<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.350> you're<00:01:40.470> right<00:01:40.619> i

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
Fitzpatrick but I think you're right i

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.990 
Fitzpatrick but I think you're right i
think<00:01:40.829> texas<00:01:41.369> here<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
think texas here if you get a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
think texas here if you get a
two-and-a-half-hour<00:01:42.689> three<00:01:42.899> points<00:01:43.290> looking

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
two-and-a-half-hour three points looking

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.929 
two-and-a-half-hour three points looking
like<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> pretty<00:01:44.250> good<00:01:44.430> play<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
like a pretty good play because the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.520 
like a pretty good play because the
49ers<00:01:45.540> probably<00:01:45.899> won't<00:01:46.049> play<00:01:46.200> Colin

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
49ers probably won't play Colin

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
49ers probably won't play Colin
Kaepernick<00:01:47.009> they'll<00:01:47.430> most<00:01:47.790> likely<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.299> an

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
Kaepernick they'll most likely be an

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090 
Kaepernick they'll most likely be an
evaluation<00:01:48.899> mode<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.439> most<00:01:49.710> teams<00:01:49.920> are

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
evaluation mode like most teams are

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.560 
evaluation mode like most teams are
whereas<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> Texans<00:01:50.939> seem<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.240> still<00:01:51.479> be

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
whereas the Texans seem to still be

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.910 
whereas the Texans seem to still be
trying<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.899> build<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> young<00:01:52.619> group

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
trying to build with a young group

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.609 
trying to build with a young group
without<00:01:53.130> built<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.450> O'Brien<00:01:55.079> here<00:01:55.439> in

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
without built with the O'Brien here in

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.889 
without built with the O'Brien here in
Houston<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:56.909> may<00:01:57.119> want<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.479> look<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
Houston I think they may want to look to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.420 
Houston I think they may want to look to
win<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.200> game<00:01:58.380> with<00:01:58.560> their<00:01:58.710> young<00:01:58.890> guys<00:01:59.100> came

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
win this game with their young guys came

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.649 
win this game with their young guys came
a<00:01:59.549> little<00:01:59.670> bit<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.939> momentum<00:02:00.060> heading<00:02:00.509> into

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
a little bit of momentum heading into

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.569 
a little bit of momentum heading into
the<00:02:00.869> season<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.380> thing<00:02:01.860> protects<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.369> mine

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the season so thing protects this mine

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.219 
the season so thing protects this mine
Texans<00:02:03.299> minus<00:02:03.540> three<00:02:03.750> looks<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.079> pretty

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
Texans minus three looks like a pretty

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.870 
Texans minus three looks like a pretty
good<00:02:04.380> player<00:02:04.619> all<00:02:05.070> right<00:02:05.250> that's<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.610> way<00:02:05.729> I'm

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
good player all right that's the way I'm

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.969

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.770 
feeling and also the total is 39 both
these<00:02:08.129> teams<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.580> three<00:02:08.970> over/under<00:02:09.569> up

not quite sure about the goin about this
total<00:02:34.990> here<00:02:35.110> at<00:02:35.200> 39<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> bit<00:02:36.040> seems<00:02:36.340> pretty

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
total here at 39 a bit seems pretty

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.090 
total here at 39 a bit seems pretty
solid<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.210> me<00:02:37.330> number<00:02:37.900> wise<00:02:38.050> not<00:02:38.770> quite<00:02:39.070> sure

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
solid to me number wise not quite sure

where<00:02:39.580> I'm<00:02:39.700> leaning<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.240> one<00:02:40.390> here<00:02:40.510> I

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
where I'm leaning on this one here I

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.030 
where I'm leaning on this one here I
think<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:41.050> bit<00:02:41.200> more<00:02:41.380> comfortable<00:02:41.740> just

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
think a little bit more comfortable just

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.830 
think a little bit more comfortable just
going<00:02:42.310> with<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.490> Texans<00:02:42.940> here<00:02:43.120> at<00:02:43.210> minus-3<00:02:43.570> uh

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
going with the Texans here at minus-3 uh

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.050 
going with the Texans here at minus-3 uh
not<00:02:44.440> quite<00:02:44.470> sure<00:02:44.710> what<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.190> over<00:02:45.490> wood<00:02:45.640> will
