00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
now the reason why I'm doing it is

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
world that eat protein or animal-based
protein<00:00:58.980> compared<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> ones<00:00:59.940> that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
protein compared to the ones that

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.119 
protein compared to the ones that
plant-based<00:01:00.629> protein<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.770> general

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
plant-based protein and the general

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.529 
plant-based protein and the general
consensus<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.730> those<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.359> eat

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
consensus is that those that eat

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.350 
consensus is that those that eat
plant-based<00:01:04.140> protein<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.549> much<00:01:05.909> longer

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
plant-based protein have a much longer

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.320 
plant-based protein have a much longer
and<00:01:06.619> healthier<00:01:07.619> life<00:01:08.040> span<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and healthier life span and the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.960 
and healthier life span and the
countries<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.890> animal<00:01:11.280> protein<00:01:11.460> so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
countries that do the animal protein so

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.960 
countries that do the animal protein so
the<00:01:12.180> plan<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:13.110> gonna<00:01:13.439> read<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.400> for

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the plan is I'm gonna read this and for

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.370 
the plan is I'm gonna read this and for
the<00:01:15.030> entirety<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.689> I'm<00:01:15.869> reading<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.320> book

and<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.549> big<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:18.119> gonna<00:01:18.360> become<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and it's not that big I'm gonna become a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.120 
and it's not that big I'm gonna become a
vegetarian<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> once<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.650> finished<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> I'll

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
vegetarian and once I finished it I'll
