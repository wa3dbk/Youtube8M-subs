00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920 

I<00:00:04.879> think<00:00:05.879> we've<00:00:05.970> got<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.180> wrap<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.509> thing<00:00:06.569> up

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
I think we've got to wrap this thing up

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.440 
I think we've got to wrap this thing up
by<00:00:07.109> hitting<00:00:07.379> on<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.639> handful<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.700> points<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.330> I

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
by hitting on a handful of points that I

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.720 
by hitting on a handful of points that I
think<00:00:09.480> are<00:00:09.929> extremely<00:00:10.860> important<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.639> you

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
think are extremely important and you

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.509 
think are extremely important and you
know<00:00:11.910> what<00:00:12.090> we've<00:00:12.840> got<00:00:13.080> 12<00:00:13.620> steps<00:00:14.099> along<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
know what we've got 12 steps along the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.599 
know what we've got 12 steps along the
way<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.179> for<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> most<00:00:16.410> part<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.949> think<00:00:16.980> you

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
way and for the most part I think you

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.769 
way and for the most part I think you
could<00:00:17.820> take<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.270> any<00:00:18.840> step<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.270> be<00:00:21.270> messed<00:00:21.539> up

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
could take out any step and be messed up

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.439 
could take out any step and be messed up
it's<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.220> old<00:00:23.250> chain<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.300> know

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
it's just like the old chain you know

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.779 
it's just like the old chain you know
one<00:00:24.720> link<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.250> not<00:00:26.640> going

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
one link out of it it's just not going

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.120 
one link out of it it's just not going
to<00:00:26.880> work<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.260> same<00:00:28.500> thing<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:28.949> all

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
to work that's the same thing with all

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.740 
to work that's the same thing with all
the<00:00:29.369> steps<00:00:29.640> we've<00:00:29.910> made<00:00:30.150> here<00:00:30.390> they're<00:00:30.570> all

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the steps we've made here they're all

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.450 
the steps we've made here they're all
very<00:00:31.109> important

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
very important

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.040 
very important
I<00:00:32.750> think<00:00:33.770> maybe<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.309> most<00:00:35.579> important<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.420> how

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
I think maybe the most important is how

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.830 
I think maybe the most important is how
much<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.070> talked<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:39.210> feeling<00:00:39.809> your

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
equipment feeling your lure in the water

lure all the way back to the rod tip and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.390 
lure all the way back to the rod tip and
I'll<00:01:36.270> start<00:01:36.570> doing<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.140> I'll<00:01:37.920> start<00:01:38.250> doing

and he fishes a lot he knows where some

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.470 
and he fishes a lot he knows where some
fish<00:02:20.250> are<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.700> you're<00:02:20.820> going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.000> catch<00:02:21.180> some

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480
