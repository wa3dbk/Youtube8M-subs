00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.349
 Halil watch together men what said and we play a bit today 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.089
 Konftel Thief 4 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:22.210
 this game 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.759
 APA is Sam 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.039
 Klaus Kolb the four again turn endgame 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.800
 that's a paradox that's just going to leave it that way 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.660
 because I can myself with the candle 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.230
 yes I am very happy that I am allowed to say old order I have something too 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.000
 brought 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.790
 in the backpack at least good cup 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.400
 around 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.530
 and today we will be making the time with this money profitable 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.050
 to address a different topic 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.190
 the judiciary itself was not quite so elaborate Dr made APA Roth 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.040
 Nothing 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.110
 because the spontaneous so far 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.130
 Percent buzzer all around 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.700
 but the solution to all problems 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.540
 issues 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.940
 at the 9th 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.940
 if you make something wrong it tends to go wrong 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.420
 it is 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 let's see how registered shares b 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.540
 in the celebration and in Vienna 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.440
 Invites 20,000 people and Hinwil 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.710
 quite structured schedule so for my sake 49 guests are coming 9 41 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.350
 he gives 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.320
 what the judges 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.360
 Apple juice 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.360
 at 3:42 there will be 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.450
 the turned on again radio but purely and 43 m 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.510
 then something goes wrong 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.390
 and there are a few exceptions 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 Light no argues the UEFA holds 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.890
 In the 1 2 especially the deep cracks or wrinkles currently being tested is going on 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.140
 these things 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.430
 I do not know but I mean I am now 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.820
 Like the whole time 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.900
 m time 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.210
 half a year from 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.210
 Experience has shown that if I never met him 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.480
 to say today we will address such things and I will 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.679
 formulate elaborate sentences 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.569
 Experience has shown that wrong 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.569
 and me 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.909
 slowly but surely not here 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.209
 Apel 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.519
 who once again 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.379
 managed to succeed like me 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.129
 with the right index finger 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.129
 can press a button in a rhythm 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.129
 who is not caught 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.129
 UCB Pharma dancer trade 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.299
 "But we showed that when I stuff myself 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.889
 completely in the 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.539
 make 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:55.090
 and the as I say today I'm really great at speaking sophisticated 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.559
 that will address complex matters 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:01.879
 and defend what is the funniest thing he ever does 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:04.669
 something goes wrong 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.559
 and I think that's interesting 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:08.389
 that I 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.299
 I already think about how 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.459
 no idea that's in the context but there are 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.839
 I'm not in that now 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.919
 as a player as Remy so flies thinking while playing so I mean 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:24.909
 I am 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.539
 concentrated and not peace 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:30.539
 and simultaneously or 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.389
 I think it will be here too I have to go left now April 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.389
 there is a high probability that because then come 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.049
 in addition to many game situations 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.909
 Team player right around 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.909
 rather than left around and viola around 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.610
 So that's not my thing at all and I'm at 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.779
 Not necessarily started with it 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:57.149
 From the court you see he said I want to go to court 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.929
 to give my tips how to bring percent to humanity 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:03.089
 Why 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.399
 I know that she lives 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.229
 People of you out there 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.609
 much better play this 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.159
 probably many many people there 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.279
 the this position 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:18.349
 and now sits and tricks the water 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.930
 adapt much better 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.800
 So they really in which 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
 You can give in-depth tips in most situations 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.110
 May if i have the derby now if i dont know what im me in 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.349
 thought of the moment 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.280
 interpret with Cindy the asphalt so that is simply wrong if the 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.440
 That's not a lie if I told them 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.629
 now I have thought differently and and percent 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.999
 I have no idea 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:49.569
 played for me intuition one very big role for me is easy 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.759
 feeling a very big role 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.529
 I am not the tactical games 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:57.530
 I am 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.319
 I am very defensive player 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.369
 two cars have somehow denied here then against the wall 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.939
 Try to point your finger at me 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.979
 Pledges 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.719
 Watch you know only in the corner and 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.719
 how can the rivals 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.849
 that is not mine 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.300
 Wiesent 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.059
 good stuff on Tobias 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:23.129
 around 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.610
 I mean I force you to 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.999
 if someone says so, yes 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.129
 the lenses will see them from the stage 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.990
 Steiner and my opponent were not mine anymore 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.979
 by 69 percent of companies want and that brings 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.360
 but what not? "That's what my world has to me 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.839
 I'm not around 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.860
 since less grown after the Prague 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.680
 against obesity 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.999
 only 4 5 been downed 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:53.089
 Picture he reported to the office 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.089
 i'm scared of the stage i could somehow get that 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.249
 target to this this band i see this at Scharping 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:02.379
 about these 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:04.490
 the 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.490
 Heuser climbing or degrees generally climb 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.629
 if i have my thing 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.869
 of course evil tongues would say so again I play yes 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.439
 but as soon as the light or 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:21.080
 so back so this game Orient 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.180
 around 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.180
 Percent were the first 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.120
 Why 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.809
 Second, or so 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:31.339
 stop playing it I have the four are rediscovered for me only can 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:33.939
 say minute sets pretty over the top 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:37.330
 but I did not play the game for a very long time 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.240
 the Langenfelder played little Xbox 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.589
 and around 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.389
 to come in a bit more the whole story with the stick 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.330
 with the keys and 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.210
 but earns those eternal huge problems with the sprinting because 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.319
 to press conventional with key data like this Krifteler correctly 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.319
 September in the stalled diesel engine in this world 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.460
 and then not always 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.460
 but not sprinted 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.339
 and I always died and it always got me frustrated here 

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:05.770
 not really 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.589
 I could put it that way because that fit back 

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:09.699
 around 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:11.020
 who, then? 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.020
 m the conclusion the video is around 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:15.949
 it gives 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:17.740
 spontaneity 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.169
 around is very important 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.639
 and I have 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.919
 also about the Daimler 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:26.509
 learned about 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.830
 Lord with seven wins three minutes 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.449
 occurred without somehow 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:34.569
 I have learned a lot about the matter 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:35.669
 under 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:37.180
 maybe it needs it back 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.129
 I hope I can 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:41.399
 and we'll see us Seuss
