made out of these which are Chinese turn
signal<00:00:47.780> or<00:00:47.900> Chinese<00:00:48.680> LED<00:00:49.610> arrays<00:00:50.210> they're

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
signal or Chinese LED arrays they're

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.290 
signal or Chinese LED arrays they're
like<00:00:50.990> two<00:00:51.170> bucks<00:00:51.350> apiece<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:53.590> these<00:00:54.590> Chinese

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
like two bucks apiece and these Chinese

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:11.830 
like two bucks apiece and these Chinese
LED<00:00:56.300> lights<00:00:59.080> which<00:01:00.080> are<00:01:00.230> basically<00:01:10.840> flexible

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
LED lights which are basically flexible

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:21.370 
LED lights which are basically flexible
lights<00:01:12.020> like<00:01:12.260> this<00:01:17.110> they<00:01:18.110> basically<00:01:18.410> get<00:01:20.380> back

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
lights like this they basically get back

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.170 
lights like this they basically get back
those<00:01:21.619> around<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.280> inside<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:26.090> actually

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
those around the inside and I actually

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.600 
those around the inside and I actually
remove<00:01:26.690> this<00:01:26.960> diffuser<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:30.040> place<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.400> LED

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
remove this diffuser and place the LED

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.890 
remove this diffuser and place the LED
panels<00:01:32.300> in<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:33.590> v-shape<00:01:34.300> one<00:01:35.300> here<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:35.630> mean

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
panels in a v-shape one here I mean

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.170 
panels in a v-shape one here I mean
obviously<00:01:36.020> one<00:01:36.530> here<00:01:36.770> all<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.820> way<00:01:37.940> in<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
obviously one here all the way in the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.270 
obviously one here all the way in the
back<00:01:38.390> which<00:01:39.020> gives<00:01:39.410> it<00:01:39.800> that<00:01:42.010> gives<00:01:43.010> light

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
back which gives it that gives light

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.950 
back which gives it that gives light
some<00:01:43.520> depth<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.350> it<00:01:45.350> also<00:01:45.560> allows<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.960> LED

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
some depth and it also allows the LED

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.540 
some depth and it also allows the LED
panels<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.560> reflect<00:01:48.950> off<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.160> rear

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
panels to reflect off the rear

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.960 
panels to reflect off the rear
reflectors<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:51.280> they<00:01:52.280> are<00:01:52.429> not<00:01:52.640> diffused<00:01:54.970> my

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
reflectors and they are not diffused my

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.870 
reflectors and they are not diffused my
plan<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.479> also<00:01:58.899> put<00:01:59.899> a<00:02:00.140> diode<00:02:00.560> in<00:02:00.920> there<00:02:01.130> and

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
plan is to also put a diode in there and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.650 
plan is to also put a diode in there and
supply<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.720> with<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> lower<00:02:03.320> voltage<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.880> dim

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
supply it with a lower voltage to dim

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.290 
supply it with a lower voltage to dim
those<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.229> when<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.590> front<00:02:06.970> halos<00:02:07.970> are<00:02:08.149> on

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
those so when the front halos are on

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.460 
those so when the front halos are on
just<00:02:08.840> with<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.530> regular<00:02:09.830> taillights<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
just with the regular taillights the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.130 
just with the regular taillights the
rear<00:02:12.470> two<00:02:12.680> panels<00:02:13.130> will<00:02:13.340> be<00:02:13.370> glowing<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.930> look

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
rear two panels will be glowing to look

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.870 
rear two panels will be glowing to look
like<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:16.819> retina<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.290> speak<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.760> an

this<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.870> just<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.410> mod<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.740> I<00:02:42.830> made

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
this is a just a mod that I made

this is a just a mod that I made
hopefully<00:02:45.680> get<00:02:46.640> this<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.000> road<00:02:47.120> soon<00:02:47.830> but

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
hopefully get this on the road soon but

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.410 
hopefully get this on the road soon but
I<00:02:49.070> thought<00:02:49.250> I'd<00:02:49.400> share<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.670> with<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.910> my<00:02:50.210> tail

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
I thought I'd share it with you my tail

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.890 
I thought I'd share it with you my tail

I<00:02:52.160> think<00:02:53.160> they're<00:02:53.940> coming<00:02:54.150> together<00:02:54.239> well<00:02:54.510> for

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
I think they're coming together well for

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.690 
I think they're coming together well for
what<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> twenty<00:02:56.640> dollar<00:02:56.819> mod<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.610> for<00:02:59.610> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
what a twenty dollar mod to the for the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.290 
what a twenty dollar mod to the for the
pair<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.269> don't<00:03:01.140> think<00:03:01.349> it's<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.920> bad<00:03:02.849> deal<00:03:03.090> at

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
