are<00:00:19.760> going<00:00:19.940> to<00:00:20.120> be<00:00:20.270> four<00:00:20.660> different<00:00:20.870> designs

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
are going to be four different designs

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.000 
are going to be four different designs
the<00:00:22.160> first<00:00:22.400> one<00:00:22.670> is<00:00:22.850> not<00:00:23.030> too<00:00:23.570> awesome<00:00:24.050> but<00:00:24.650> the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
the first one is not too awesome but the

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.370 
the first one is not too awesome but the
rest<00:00:25.220> of<00:00:25.370> them<00:00:25.520> I<00:00:26.060> think<00:00:26.120> I<00:00:26.510> pretty<00:00:26.930> much<00:00:27.050> like

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
rest of them I think I pretty much like

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.550 
rest of them I think I pretty much like
him<00:00:27.530> and<00:00:28.060> yeah<00:00:29.120> simply<00:00:29.570> enjoy<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:29.990> video

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
him and yeah simply enjoy the video

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.869 
him and yeah simply enjoy the video
so<00:00:31.100> the<00:00:31.460> first<00:00:31.760> design<00:00:32.180> is<00:00:32.419> quite<00:00:32.930> easy<00:00:33.350> so

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
so the first design is quite easy so

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.660 
so the first design is quite easy so
it's<00:00:34.879> basically<00:00:35.300> just<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.960> row<00:00:36.800> of<00:00:37.040> five

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
it's basically just a row of five

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
it's basically just a row of five
different<00:00:38.440> works<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:39.830> basically<00:00:40.360> two<00:00:41.360> colors

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
different works so basically two colors

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.200 
different works so basically two colors
of<00:00:41.810> wool<00:00:42.340> taking<00:00:43.340> terms<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:45.130> then<00:00:46.130> a<00:00:46.340> diagonal

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
of wool taking terms and then a diagonal

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.650 
of wool taking terms and then a diagonal
block<00:00:48.160> one<00:00:49.160> block<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.610> front<00:00:50.120> like<00:00:50.630> this

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
block one block to the front like this

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.940 
block one block to the front like this
and<00:00:51.190> then<00:00:52.190> simply<00:00:52.610> two<00:00:53.090> more<00:00:53.560> blocks

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
and then simply two more blocks

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:03.790 
and then simply two more blocks
once<00:00:55.610> again<00:00:55.760> diagonal<00:00:58.390> that<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.170> then<00:01:02.649> as<00:01:03.649> you

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
once again diagonal that and then as you

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.280 
once again diagonal that and then as you
can<00:01:03.890> see<00:01:03.950> once<00:01:04.460> again<00:01:04.610> it's<00:01:04.970> again<00:01:05.869> quite

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
can see once again it's again quite

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.270 
can see once again it's again quite
laggy<00:01:06.590> here<00:01:09.520> nice<00:01:10.520> um<00:01:11.740> anyways<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:13.249> is

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
laggy here nice um anyways that is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.539 
laggy here nice um anyways that is
pretty<00:01:13.850> much<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.090> basic<00:01:14.689> design<00:01:15.130> okay<00:01:16.130> the

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
pretty much the basic design okay the

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.669 
pretty much the basic design okay the
next<00:01:16.939> design<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.329> a<00:01:17.659> little<00:01:17.869> bit<00:01:17.990> more<00:01:18.170> complex

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
next design is a little bit more complex

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.399 
next design is a little bit more complex
first<00:01:19.069> of<00:01:19.249> all<00:01:19.369> you<00:01:19.549> want<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:19.850> make<00:01:20.139> like<00:01:21.139> an

planks and place five things like this

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.920 
planks and place five things like this
then<00:02:30.170> fences<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:32.610> stabilize<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.360> bill<00:02:33.569> here

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
then fences to stabilize the bill here

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.710 
then fences to stabilize the bill here
and<00:02:34.519> then<00:02:35.519> what<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.730> want<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.030> do<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.540> take

and then what you want to do is to take

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.680 
and then what you want to do is to take
fence<00:02:37.110> gates<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.890> place<00:02:38.850> them<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.209> top<00:02:39.239> here

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
fence gates and place them on top here

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.250 
fence gates and place them on top here
get<00:02:40.260> rid<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.500> those<00:02:40.680> blocks<00:02:41.010> here<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.260> one

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
get rid of those blocks here and one

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.500 
get rid of those blocks here and one
thing<00:02:43.470> else<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.799> could<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.670> place<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
thing else you could do is to place a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.539 
thing else you could do is to place a
few<00:02:45.870> fences<00:02:46.319> here<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.739> stabilize<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.310> thing

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
few fences here to stabilize the thing

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.699 
few fences here to stabilize the thing
in<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.760> back<00:02:47.989> but<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.380> second

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
in the back but that is the second

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.830 
in the back but that is the second
design<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.790> next<00:02:51.150> design<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.360> one<00:02:51.599> of<00:02:51.690> my

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
design this next design is one of my

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.259 
design this next design is one of my
favorites<00:02:52.370> first<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.549> all<00:02:53.730> what<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:53.970> want<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
favorites first of all what you want to

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.490 
favorites first of all what you want to
do<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.570> build<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:57.630> go<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:58.019> three<00:02:58.350> blocks

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
do to build it is to go up three blocks

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.530 
do to build it is to go up three blocks
so<00:02:58.769> you've<00:02:58.980> got<00:02:59.130> three<00:02:59.459> blocks<00:02:59.730> free<00:03:00.150> down

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
so you've got three blocks free down

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.710 
so you've got three blocks free down
here<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:02.540> then<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:03.810> always<00:03:04.079> a<00:03:05.450> shape<00:03:06.450> like

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
here and then it's always a shape like

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.069 
here and then it's always a shape like
this<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:07.650> wait<00:03:07.859> a<00:03:07.920> second<00:03:08.370> that's<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:09.570> row

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
this just wait a second that's so a row

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.870 
this just wait a second that's so a row
of<00:03:10.200> three<00:03:10.260> blocks<00:03:10.680> here<00:03:10.980> then<00:03:11.370> you've<00:03:11.519> got<00:03:11.670> two

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
of three blocks here then you've got two

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.569 
of three blocks here then you've got two
blocks<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.290> make<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.440> turn<00:03:13.680> two

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
blocks here then you make a turn two

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.670 
blocks here then you make a turn two
blocks<00:03:14.820> here<00:03:16.370> three<00:03:17.370> blocks<00:03:17.640> here<00:03:17.850> again<00:03:18.680> two

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
blocks here three blocks here again two

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.080 
blocks here three blocks here again two
blocks<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.180> side<00:03:21.450> two<00:03:21.870> blocks<00:03:22.109> as<00:03:22.260> well

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
blocks to the side two blocks as well

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.120 
blocks to the side two blocks as well
three<00:03:24.090> blocks<00:03:24.890> two<00:03:25.890> blocks<00:03:26.690> two<00:03:27.690> blocks<00:03:28.130> three

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
three blocks two blocks two blocks three

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.800 
three blocks two blocks two blocks three
block<00:03:29.340> swoops<00:03:30.150> like<00:03:30.900> this

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.440 

then<00:03:34.810> what<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.560> want<00:03:35.740> to<00:03:35.830> do<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.210> make<00:03:37.420> a

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
then what you want to do is to make a

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.400 
then what you want to do is to make a
kind<00:03:37.990> of<00:03:38.790> cube<00:03:39.790> up<00:03:40.030> here<00:03:42.210> but<00:03:43.210> only<00:03:44.020> diagonal

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
kind of cube up here but only diagonal

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.780 
kind of cube up here but only diagonal
so<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.970> end<00:03:49.380> something<00:03:50.790> like

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
so that it is in the end something like

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:00.690 
so that it is in the end something like
this<00:03:54.660> fill<00:03:55.660> in<00:03:55.810> those<00:03:56.500> gaps<00:03:56.710> here<00:03:59.430> then<00:04:00.430> add

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
this fill in those gaps here then add

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.460 
this fill in those gaps here then add
one<00:04:01.030> block<00:04:01.300> to<00:04:01.600> each<00:04:02.230> side<00:04:02.560> here<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.810> this

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
one block to each side here and this

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.030 
one block to each side here and this
last<00:04:06.450> layer<00:04:07.450> up<00:04:07.720> here<00:04:07.990> is<00:04:08.530> going<00:04:08.800> to<00:04:08.890> be<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.280> plus

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
last layer up here is going to be a plus

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.949 
last layer up here is going to be a plus
so<00:04:12.040> this<00:04:12.400> is<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.670> basic<00:04:12.970> design<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.480> now<00:04:13.630> what

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
so this is the basic design and now what

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.120 
so this is the basic design and now what
you<00:04:14.080> want<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.290> do<00:04:14.410> is<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.740> take<00:04:14.890> different

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
you want to do is to take different

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.289 
you want to do is to take different
kinds<00:04:15.459> of<00:04:15.820> colors<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:17.440> throw<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:17.859> in<00:04:18.299> example

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
kinds of colors and throw it in example

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.780 
kinds of colors and throw it in example
I'm<00:04:19.420> using<00:04:19.450> in<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.109> case<00:04:20.350> is<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.489> replace

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
I'm using in this case is to replace

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.830 
I'm using in this case is to replace
these<00:04:22.350> middle<00:04:23.350> line<00:04:23.620> blocks<00:04:24.040> with<00:04:24.490> on<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.419> the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
these middle line blocks with on the the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.390 
these middle line blocks with on the the
blue<00:04:26.140> rule<00:04:26.880> same<00:04:27.880> thing<00:04:28.090> here<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:29.100> this<00:04:30.100> plus

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
blue rule same thing here and this plus

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.450 
blue rule same thing here and this plus
shape<00:04:30.669> up<00:04:30.850> here<00:04:31.270> as<00:04:31.450> well<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:35.010> then<00:04:36.010> I<00:04:36.070> want<00:04:36.370> to

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
shape up here as well and then I want to

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.210 
shape up here as well and then I want to
take<00:04:36.750> teal<00:04:37.750> wool<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:40.710> replace<00:04:41.710> those<00:04:41.919> two

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
take teal wool and replace those two

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:50.640 
take teal wool and replace those two
blocks<00:04:42.490> on<00:04:42.730> these<00:04:42.910> edges<00:04:46.830> like<00:04:47.830> that<00:04:49.140> now<00:04:50.140> once

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
blocks on these edges like that now once

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.510 
blocks on these edges like that now once
again<00:04:51.630> fences<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.900> stabilize<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.740> build<00:04:53.950> on

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
again fences to stabilize the build on

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.940 
again fences to stabilize the build on
the<00:04:54.610> bottom<00:04:56.370> always<00:04:58.020> on<00:04:59.020> these<00:04:59.290> outer<00:04:59.590> blocks

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
the bottom always on these outer blocks

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.130 
the bottom always on these outer blocks
here<00:05:02.070> like<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:04.720> on<00:05:05.710> these<00:05:05.890> edges<00:05:06.070> I

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
here like that and on these edges I

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:16.469 
here like that and on these edges I
don't<00:05:08.140> know<00:05:10.590> screwing<00:05:11.590> up<00:05:11.740> or<00:05:14.940> and<00:05:15.940> you<00:05:16.390> do

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
don't know screwing up or and you do

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.690 
don't know screwing up or and you do
that<00:05:16.660> one<00:05:17.080> time<00:05:17.290> all<00:05:17.500> around<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:18.370> build<00:05:18.580> I

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
that one time all around the build I

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.180 
that one time all around the build I
won't<00:05:18.910> do<00:05:19.000> that<00:05:19.380> second<00:05:20.380> part<00:05:20.500> there<00:05:20.710> one

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
won't do that second part there one

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.580 
won't do that second part there one
thing<00:05:21.370> you<00:05:21.490> could<00:05:21.760> do<00:05:22.000> as<00:05:22.210> well<00:05:22.810> is<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.080> make

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
thing you could do as well is to make

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.719 
thing you could do as well is to make
like<00:05:23.830> counter<00:05:24.570> so<00:05:25.860> you'll<00:05:26.860> simply<00:05:27.310> replace

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
like counter so you'll simply replace

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.590 
like counter so you'll simply replace
this<00:05:28.030> bottom<00:05:28.690> line<00:05:28.900> with<00:05:30.030> planks<00:05:31.030> and<00:05:31.180> that

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
this bottom line with planks and that

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.200 
this bottom line with planks and that
way<00:05:31.750> you<00:05:31.810> can<00:05:32.050> put<00:05:33.010> up<00:05:33.160> something<00:05:33.610> here<00:05:33.850> for

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
way you can put up something here for

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.230 
way you can put up something here for
example<00:05:34.630> a<00:05:34.690> pie<00:05:35.050> or<00:05:35.590> I<00:05:36.070> don't<00:05:36.310> know<00:05:36.490> anywhere

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
example a pie or I don't know anywhere

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.710 
example a pie or I don't know anywhere
you<00:05:37.479> want<00:05:37.690> to<00:05:37.810> sell<00:05:38.050> there<00:05:39.150> and<00:05:40.150> now<00:05:40.390> the<00:05:40.450> last

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
you want to sell there and now the last

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.260 
you want to sell there and now the last
design<00:05:41.050> I<00:05:41.080> want<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.320> show<00:05:41.530> you<00:05:41.590> is<00:05:42.010> a<00:05:42.580> kind<00:05:43.120> of

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
design I want to show you is a kind of

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.480 
design I want to show you is a kind of
tent<00:05:43.539> I<00:05:43.690> would<00:05:43.720> I<00:05:44.080> would<00:05:44.320> like<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.740> use<00:05:44.919> this<00:05:45.160> as

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
tent I would I would like to use this as

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.779 
tent I would I would like to use this as
for<00:05:46.360> example<00:05:46.479> a<00:05:47.169> tent<00:05:47.830> for<00:05:48.070> a<00:05:48.130> fortune<00:05:48.490> teller

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
for example a tent for a fortune teller

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.210 
for example a tent for a fortune teller
or<00:05:48.940> something<00:05:49.300> like<00:05:49.450> that<00:05:49.680> so<00:05:50.680> what<00:05:50.979> you<00:05:51.070> want

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
or something like that so what you want

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.969 
or something like that so what you want
to<00:05:51.280> do<00:05:51.370> for<00:05:51.520> that<00:05:51.669> is<00:05:51.940> to<00:05:52.240> make<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:53.440> was<00:05:53.590> a<00:05:53.620> three

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
to do for that is to make it was a three

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.940 
to do for that is to make it was a three
blocks<00:05:54.280> high<00:05:54.550> wall<00:05:54.910> like<00:05:55.419> this<00:05:55.630> leave<00:05:56.380> these

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
blocks high wall like this leave these

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.060 
blocks high wall like this leave these
three<00:05:57.310> blocks<00:05:57.490> free<00:05:57.880> on<00:05:58.090> this<00:05:58.240> side<00:05:58.560> on<00:05:59.560> these

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
three blocks free on this side on these

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.310 
three blocks free on this side on these
sides<00:06:00.370> once<00:06:01.120> again<00:06:01.390> take<00:06:01.630> turns<00:06:01.990> with<00:06:02.289> the

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
sides once again take turns with the

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.920 
sides once again take turns with the
colored<00:06:02.800> rule<00:06:03.180> five<00:06:04.180> blocks<00:06:04.510> on<00:06:04.690> each<00:06:04.810> side<00:06:05.140> so

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
colored rule five blocks on each side so

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:18.659 
colored rule five blocks on each side so
look<00:06:07.930> at<00:06:08.169> this<00:06:09.599> once<00:06:10.599> again<00:06:10.750> here

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.179 

one<00:06:19.210> time<00:06:19.449> all<00:06:19.659> around<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.349> build<00:06:21.810> like<00:06:22.810> this

00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:23.189 
one time all around the build like this

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:25.890 
one time all around the build like this
then<00:06:24.189> what<00:06:24.400> you<00:06:24.490> want<00:06:24.669> to<00:06:24.729> do<00:06:24.789> is<00:06:25.060> to<00:06:25.270> continue

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
then what you want to do is to continue

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.059 
then what you want to do is to continue
using<00:06:26.499> this<00:06:26.800> car<00:06:27.099> in<00:06:27.370> these<00:06:27.610> edges<00:06:28.240> up<00:06:28.419> here

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:29.069 
using this car in these edges up here

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:36.140 
using this car in these edges up here
and<00:06:30.900> then<00:06:31.900> simply<00:06:34.020> make<00:06:35.020> a<00:06:35.259> line<00:06:35.529> once<00:06:35.889> again

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
and then simply make a line once again

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.589 
and then simply make a line once again
using<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:37.240> different<00:06:37.539> kinds<00:06:37.779> of<00:06:37.840> rule<00:06:38.830> colors

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
using the different kinds of rule colors

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:50.929 
using the different kinds of rule colors
same<00:06:40.599> thing<00:06:40.779> up<00:06:40.930> here<00:06:44.909> and<00:06:46.050> up<00:06:47.050> here<00:06:48.779> and<00:06:49.779> then

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:50.939 
same thing up here and up here and then

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:59.399 
same thing up here and up here and then
simply<00:06:51.939> go<00:06:52.110> another<00:06:53.110> block<00:06:53.229> up

00:06:59.399 --> 00:06:59.409 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:01.409 

as<00:06:59.830> you<00:07:00.069> can<00:07:00.189> see<00:07:00.369> this<00:07:00.489> is<00:07:00.669> quite<00:07:01.029> the<00:07:01.209> easy

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
as you can see this is quite the easy

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.479 
as you can see this is quite the easy
roof<00:07:01.959> design<00:07:02.559> if<00:07:02.769> you<00:07:02.800> want<00:07:02.860> to<00:07:03.099> call<00:07:03.309> it<00:07:03.429> a

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:03.489 
roof design if you want to call it a

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:09.959 
roof design if you want to call it a
roof<00:07:05.580> like<00:07:06.580> this<00:07:06.909> and<00:07:08.369> now<00:07:09.369> what<00:07:09.550> you<00:07:09.669> can<00:07:09.789> do

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:09.969 
roof like this and now what you can do

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:13.859 
roof like this and now what you can do
to<00:07:10.779> the<00:07:10.869> inside<00:07:11.439> is<00:07:11.969> to<00:07:12.969> take<00:07:13.179> first<00:07:13.599> of<00:07:13.749> all

00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:13.869 
to the inside is to take first of all

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:16.739 
to the inside is to take first of all
fences<00:07:14.259> once<00:07:14.439> again<00:07:14.969> make<00:07:15.969> those<00:07:16.119> posts<00:07:16.629> to

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:16.749 
fences once again make those posts to

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:22.259 
fences once again make those posts to
stabilize<00:07:17.199> the<00:07:18.129> built<00:07:18.369> again<00:07:18.699> and<00:07:21.029> then<00:07:22.029> what

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:22.269 
stabilize the built again and then what

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:24.329 
stabilize the built again and then what
you<00:07:22.389> could<00:07:22.569> do<00:07:22.839> is<00:07:23.139> once<00:07:23.439> again<00:07:23.529> to<00:07:23.860> use<00:07:24.069> the

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:24.339 
you could do is once again to use the

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:31.109 
you could do is once again to use the
apse<00:07:24.580> of<00:07:24.969> the<00:07:26.339> fence<00:07:27.339> gates<00:07:27.989> on<00:07:28.989> top<00:07:29.199> here<00:07:30.119> all

00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:31.119 
apse of the fence gates on top here all

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:38.790 
apse of the fence gates on top here all
those<00:07:31.509> blocks<00:07:35.669> get<00:07:36.669> rid<00:07:36.939> of<00:07:36.969> the<00:07:37.559> wolves<00:07:38.559> and

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 
those blocks get rid of the wolves and

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.079 
those blocks get rid of the wolves and
blue<00:07:39.579> red<00:07:39.819> sky<00:07:40.059> again<00:07:40.300> hello<00:07:40.749> and<00:07:41.399> then<00:07:42.399> you

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:43.089 
blue red sky again hello and then you

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:48.059 
blue red sky again hello and then you
have<00:07:43.300> this<00:07:43.659> kind<00:07:44.019> of<00:07:44.229> tent<00:07:46.379> so<00:07:47.379> that<00:07:47.409> is<00:07:47.829> pretty

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:48.069 
have this kind of tent so that is pretty

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:49.559 
have this kind of tent so that is pretty
much<00:07:48.219> it<00:07:48.339> these<00:07:48.699> are<00:07:48.879> the<00:07:48.909> four<00:07:49.179> designs<00:07:49.479> I

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:49.569 
much it these are the four designs I

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.329 
much it these are the four designs I
wanted<00:07:49.749> to<00:07:49.809> show<00:07:49.989> to<00:07:50.050> you<00:07:50.259> I<00:07:50.469> wouldn't<00:07:51.009> use<00:07:51.069> the

00:07:51.329 --> 00:07:51.339 
wanted to show to you I wouldn't use the

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.579 
wanted to show to you I wouldn't use the
first<00:07:51.610> design<00:07:52.029> well<00:07:52.539> at<00:07:52.659> least<00:07:52.869> not<00:07:53.169> too<00:07:53.349> often

00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:53.589 
first design well at least not too often

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:57.379 
first design well at least not too often
maybe<00:07:54.159> one<00:07:54.489> tent<00:07:54.999> like<00:07:55.209> this<00:07:55.239> could<00:07:55.959> be<00:07:55.989> enough

00:07:57.379 --> 00:07:57.389 
maybe one tent like this could be enough

00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:59.699 
maybe one tent like this could be enough
otherwise<00:07:58.389> I<00:07:58.449> would<00:07:58.779> use<00:07:58.959> the<00:07:59.169> other<00:07:59.379> stall

00:07:59.699 --> 00:07:59.709 
otherwise I would use the other stall

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:01.290 
otherwise I would use the other stall
designs<00:08:00.069> because<00:08:00.459> they<00:08:00.729> are<00:08:00.849> simply<00:08:01.089> more

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.300 
designs because they are simply more

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.929 
designs because they are simply more
complex<00:08:01.779> and<00:08:02.019> will<00:08:02.199> look<00:08:02.349> better<00:08:02.679> but<00:08:03.579> yeah

00:08:03.929 --> 00:08:03.939 
complex and will look better but yeah

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:06.059 
complex and will look better but yeah
