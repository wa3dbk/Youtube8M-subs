waiting for it to download DRM checks

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.200 
waiting for it to download DRM checks
I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> interval<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> checks<00:00:59.850> while

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
I think the interval of checks while

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.240 
I think the interval of checks while
it's<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.719> officially<00:01:01.440> disclosed<00:01:01.859> anywhere

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
it's not officially disclosed anywhere

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.910 
it's not officially disclosed anywhere
is<00:01:02.460> probably<00:01:03.000> close<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.480> something<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:04.470> once

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
is probably close to something like once

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.710 
is probably close to something like once
every<00:01:05.309> couple<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> days<00:01:05.790> after<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.420> initial

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
every couple of days after the initial

every couple of days after the initial
one<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.500> install<00:01:08.159> although<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> have

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
one when you install although I have

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.690 
one when you install although I have
heard<00:01:09.510> rumors<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:10.170> people<00:01:10.320> reporting<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.310> it

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
heard rumors of people reporting that it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.750 
heard rumors of people reporting that it
does<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.119> every<00:01:12.420> few<00:01:12.689> hours<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.680> maybe<00:01:14.549> you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
does it every few hours so maybe you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.940 
does it every few hours so maybe you
shouldn't<00:01:15.060> expect<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.570> play<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> plane

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
shouldn't expect to play it on a plane

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.580 
shouldn't expect to play it on a plane
ride<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.750> said<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.110> officially

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590

a<00:01:23.340> huge<00:01:23.670> deal<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> me<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> think<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
a huge deal to me but I think that it

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.260 
a huge deal to me but I think that it
could<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> deal<00:01:25.680> breaker<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
could be a deal breaker to some so you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.080 
could be a deal breaker to some so you
should<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.820> now<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.970> is

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
should know that going in now it is

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.660 
should know that going in now it is
forced<00:01:30.540> into<00:01:30.750> portrait<00:01:31.259> mode<00:01:31.290> which<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.400> quite

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
forced into portrait mode which is quite

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.330 
forced into portrait mode which is quite
a<00:01:32.700> shame<00:01:33.060> considering<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> more<00:01:33.960> comfortable

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
a shame considering the more comfortable

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.620 
a shame considering the more comfortable
landscape<00:01:35.340> view<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.880> tablets<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.479> offer

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
landscape view that tablets can offer

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.950 
landscape view that tablets can offer
however<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.400> maybe<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.390> way<00:01:39.659> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
however I think this is maybe one way of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.160 
however I think this is maybe one way of
getting<00:01:40.229> around<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.400> whole<00:01:41.899> scaling<00:01:42.899> issue

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
getting around the whole scaling issue

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.880 
getting around the whole scaling issue
that<00:01:43.829> Square<00:01:44.280> Enix<00:01:44.460> seems<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.360> also<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that Square Enix seems to have also it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.609 
that Square Enix seems to have also it
is<00:01:47.040> quite<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.610> chore<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.329> run<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.750> game<00:01:48.990> I'm

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
is quite a chore to run this game I'm

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.800 
is quite a chore to run this game I'm
using<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.399> great<00:01:50.759> tablet<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.509> it's

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
using a really great tablet and it's

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.719 
using a really great tablet and it's
slowing<00:01:52.290> down<00:01:52.470> when<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> try<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.159> make<00:01:53.399> just

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
slowing down when I try to make just

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.450 
slowing down when I try to make just
some<00:01:53.970> regular<00:01:54.210> moves<00:01:54.689> around<00:01:54.899> corners<00:01:55.619> you

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
some regular moves around corners you

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219 
some regular moves around corners you
should<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:56.969> only<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> have

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
should really only get this if you have

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.730 
should really only get this if you have
quite<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> beefy<00:01:59.219> Android<00:01:59.759> device<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.740> then

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
quite a beefy Android device and then

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.039 
quite a beefy Android device and then
last<00:02:02.130> strike<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.090> think<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> one

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
last strike but I think this is the one

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.800 
last strike but I think this is the one
that's<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.590> cement<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.189> for<00:02:05.490> most

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
that's going to cement it for most

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.540 
that's going to cement it for most

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
cloud saves this is a great feature

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.700 
cloud saves this is a great feature
because<00:03:07.980> let's<00:03:08.700> say<00:03:08.820> for<00:03:09.180> example<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:10.230> lose

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
because let's say for example you lose

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.860 
because let's say for example you lose
your<00:03:10.920> phone<00:03:11.190> or<00:03:11.670> maybe<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.390> new<00:03:12.630> phone

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
your phone or maybe you get a new phone

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.890 
your phone or maybe you get a new phone
or<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:14.010> have<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.430> do<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.550> factory<00:03:14.970> reset<00:03:15.090> for

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
or you have to do a factory reset for

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.380 
or you have to do a factory reset for
whatever<00:03:16.140> reason<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:17.580> saves<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.210> are<00:03:18.300> in

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
whatever reason the saves that are in

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.720 
whatever reason the saves that are in
the<00:03:18.540> cloud<00:03:18.750> will<00:03:19.140> still<00:03:19.500> be<00:03:19.800> there<00:03:20.010> for<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.430> so

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
the cloud will still be there for you so

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.240 
the cloud will still be there for you so
you<00:03:21.270> won't<00:03:21.300> lose<00:03:21.780> all<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.200> your<00:03:22.410> progress<00:03:22.530> if

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
you won't lose all of your progress if

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.940 
you won't lose all of your progress if
you<00:03:23.340> have<00:03:23.490> to<00:03:23.610> change<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.300> different<00:03:24.570> device

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
you have to change to a different device

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.470 
you have to change to a different device
now<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.190> puts<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.670> pretty<00:03:26.880> much<00:03:27.180> at<00:03:27.360> an

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
now this puts it pretty much at an

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.020 
now this puts it pretty much at an
equilibrium<00:03:27.960> because<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.860> think<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.550> pluses

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
equilibrium because I think the pluses

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.330 
equilibrium because I think the pluses
and<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.240> minuses<00:03:30.530> time<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.800> balance<00:03:31.980> each

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
and the minuses time to balance each

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.420 
and the minuses time to balance each
other<00:03:32.520> out<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.600> deal<00:03:33.930> with<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.500> downsides

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
other out I can deal with the downsides

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.590 
other out I can deal with the downsides
and<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:35.970> really<00:03:36.210> like<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.600> upsides<00:03:37.460> but<00:03:38.460> for<00:03:39.390> me

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
and I really like the upsides but for me

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.680 
and I really like the upsides but for me
personally<00:03:40.200> if<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.490> were<00:03:41.640> still<00:03:41.700> available<00:03:42.120> I

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
personally if it were still available I

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.630 
personally if it were still available I
would<00:03:42.990> hit<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.530> refund<00:03:43.950> button<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.400> this

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
would hit the refund button on this

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.020 
would hit the refund button on this
because<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:46.140> just<00:03:46.500> couldn't<00:03:47.010> convince<00:03:47.460> me<00:03:47.790> of

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
because it just couldn't convince me of

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.860 
because it just couldn't convince me of
its<00:03:48.330> $20<00:03:49.170> value<00:03:49.880> but<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:50.910> do<00:03:51.000> see<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.360> as<00:03:51.480> being<00:03:51.660> a

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
its $20 value but I do see it as being a

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.600 
its $20 value but I do see it as being a
great<00:03:52.170> purchase<00:03:52.500> for<00:03:53.100> some<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> more
