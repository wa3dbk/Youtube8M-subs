00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:23.960
 a clown 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.440
 left the circus 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.509
 and the traditional stages 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.130
 to introduce yourself 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.220
 in the streets 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.449
 in garages 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.699
 in the favelas 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.399
 in poor communities 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.800
 and for what 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.350
 to the pool 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.690
 and learn 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.970
 What is done? 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.230
 supportive 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.150
 it's history of our pop part of today 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.010
 richa 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
 pdt 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.180
 explain what a clown does 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.170
 in a poor community 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.250
 on the map by 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.340
 and moreover wanting 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.340
 learn 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.940
 I think the clown to enjoy 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.750
 It's the game that brings new teachings. 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.750
 those people for him 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.650
 explain parts 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
 with a game to be like this 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.100
 did I make an artistic language very close to everyday life 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.200
 the life of his son who referred 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.240
 the lives of people in difficulties 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.609
 some theories about the clown say he is a loser 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.470
 that guy who can not do anything 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.260
 the one who does not have the skills 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.320
 john's in the world 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.880
 fifty a person in juggling games 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.340
 the clown who can not play 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.990
 there what he can do even because he has shown his skill more 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.500
 full of disabilities 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230
 he surprised 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.170
 what is the future 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.020
 who does not want who's in the ring 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.200
 is the one in the audience that I must be incarnated in that first 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.369
 the clown's first job was a party 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.950
 still called street clown 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.950
 and that I after working many years on the street was positive 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.519
 ellipsoid of the treme-treme in the bar of the tijuca and he watched 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.889
 every day 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.649
 and every day he came well 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.009
 debate the show with me and say that it was not anything 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.329
 I had to change 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.979
 and I've been slowly changing 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.289
 and I understood that the circus universe in terms of staging is 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:29.880
 completely different 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.079
 in the circus universe with the language of theater 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.140
 so I was distancing myself from his theatrical look 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.309
 approaching the universe of the circus and you have a mix will be all 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:42.239
 circus 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:42.859
 hollow stick 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.829
 on the goblet 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.489
 it's new year with the house can not miss 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.760
 and when we enter the house we look at the precise garage is that it is a 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.179
 theater 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.179
 and gradually we started to transform our garage 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.659
 but it continues to be given 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.659
 then it's years they call it gran circus theater garage 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:06.149
 why, by day, in the garage 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.029
 and at night they saw the theaters 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:12.029
 to these poor communities 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:15.509
 learn from them 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.879
 and take lessons 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.939
 on the mountain is only the transformation of the world 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.939
 with her 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:27.279
 The first one we learn 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:29.529
 solidarity 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.849
 we learn 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.849
 as if passing information 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.229
 how to divide what we have 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.639
 we were scratching everything we have 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.029
 valuing years 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.269
 if not he then practiced in society and the ruling class 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:53.189
 we learn in classes 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.529
 Click here to register 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:58.179
 the bonus amount of this kind of teresina 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.289
 I usually say that is where there is shortage 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:04.000
 capital shortage is cg 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.429
 work front 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.209
 shortage of publicans 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.869
 in those segments 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:12.699
 where you already present yourself 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.149
 in rio de janeiro in all communities 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:16.749
 in all neighborhoods 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:18.219
 all communities 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:19.959
 in relation to the harvest 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.439
 now my side 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:23.569
 fr 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.860
 is to link the useful to the pleasant nor does it seem like a job 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.530
 It is something that you wear when you wear the clown and go to work 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.520
 improvement of our day 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.699
 it's very common today 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:36.960
 or their talent 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.039
 naked physical career 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.689
 in search 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.319
 does not change the world's transformation 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.819
 sooner the faster it says 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:46.979
 in a personal way 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.919
 which is an option too 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.919
 but it was not the surprise 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.360
 I was born in the new cinema 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.389
 of the backyard 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.639
 My grandfather was a gardener. 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.719
 and fell in love with the new castle where she 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.770
 married to him he was expelled 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.669
 they went to live with the theft head 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.199
 had nine children and my grandfather sustained these nine children a cineminha 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.460
 in the backyard 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.039
 in the open-air cinema 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.759
 that's when I got my name 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.520
 in 1957 there was a movie on the day I was born 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.419
 so I think this process 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.050
 He already came back. 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.909
 the character is a beer 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.879
 no the actor has been by sea 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.490
 in the movie they spent the night 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.070
 so I think this process of world vision of world transformation 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:43.150
 of transforming yourself 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.150
 no one transforms the world without becoming 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.840
 so I think you have this process 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.379
 It was born from there. 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.379
 I think the best way 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.819
 only if you have too much and have a career 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.819
 I think he needs to save himself first contract 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.770
 and there he continues to save himself from trying to save someone else 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.419
 and it may be that if someone multiplies numbers 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.520
 sometimes you have five days you have to before 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.259
 I watched 2 and 3 5 thousand 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.520
 we already introduced ourselves a little time 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.839
 a better future 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.479
 and to the idea or I think that this self is still in your mitchell embezzlement and a 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.479
 points 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.020
 very lucky 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.220
 girls with the proposal
