00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
animals in the wild all over we have

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.060 
animals in the wild all over we have
human<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.250> approach<00:00:35.550> medical<00:00:35.969> population<00:00:37.070> we

human the approach medical population we

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.670 
human the approach medical population we
are<00:00:38.510> building<00:00:39.510> more<00:00:39.750> roads<00:00:39.780> we're<00:00:40.379> building

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
are building more roads we're building

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
are building more roads we're building
more<00:00:40.829> homes<00:00:41.040> we're<00:00:41.879> utilizing<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.480> lot<00:00:42.899> more<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
more homes we're utilizing a lot more of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.810 
more homes we're utilizing a lot more of
their<00:00:43.410> environment<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.460> we're<00:00:44.610> creating

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
their environment and we're creating

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.270 
their environment and we're creating
smaller<00:00:45.329> smaller<00:00:45.750> binders<00:00:46.320> present<00:00:46.770> other

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
smaller smaller binders present other

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.630 
smaller smaller binders present other
manners<00:00:47.610> aren't<00:00:47.789> endangered<00:00:48.239> species<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.500> we

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
manners aren't endangered species so we

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.720 
manners aren't endangered species so we
so<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.670> only<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.300> 15<00:00:51.960> known<00:00:52.399> breeding<00:00:53.399> bugs

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
so we only have 15 known breeding bugs

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.049 
so we only have 15 known breeding bugs
we<00:00:54.600> build<00:00:54.870> new<00:00:55.050> pods<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.190> complex<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
we build new pods in this complex and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.529 
we build new pods in this complex and
we're<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> take<00:00:59.309> egg<00:00:59.670> masses<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
we're going to take egg masses and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.649 
we're going to take egg masses and
larvae<00:01:01.020> from<00:01:01.340> other<00:01:02.359> existing<00:01:03.359> ponds<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
larvae from other existing ponds and

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.910 
larvae from other existing ponds and
colonizing<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:06.780> new<00:01:06.990> ponds<00:01:07.290> using<00:01:07.830> these

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
colonizing these new ponds using these

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920 
colonizing these new ponds using these
larvae<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> head<00:01:09.479> starting

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
larvae so this is a head starting

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.170 
larvae so this is a head starting
project<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.250> part<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.760> overall

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
project that is part of that overall

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.710 
project that is part of that overall
tiger<00:01:12.900> salamander<00:01:13.470> project<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.670> today<00:01:15.509> we're

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
tiger salamander project so today we're

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:27.899 
tiger salamander project so today we're
going<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> release<00:01:16.200> these<00:01:16.530> guys

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.420 

and<00:01:28.450> how<00:01:28.630> old<00:01:28.840> are<00:01:28.930> these<00:01:29.140> these<00:01:30.100> are<00:01:30.310> eight

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
and how old are these these are eight

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:52.870 
and how old are these these are eight
weeks

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.289 

sure<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:54.159> Dave<00:01:55.159> came<00:01:55.670> up<00:01:55.759> with<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.970> idea<00:01:56.240> of

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
sure so Dave came up with the idea of

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.090 
sure so Dave came up with the idea of
enhancing<00:01:56.869> tiger<00:01:57.229> salamander<00:01:57.710> ponds<00:01:57.920> to

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
enhancing tiger salamander ponds to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.980 
enhancing tiger salamander ponds to
create<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.340> stronghold<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.909> Cape<00:01:59.119> May<00:01:59.330> because

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
create a stronghold in Cape May because

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.690 
create a stronghold in Cape May because
um<00:02:00.350> in<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.680> eastern<00:02:01.040> part<00:02:01.250> of<00:02:01.340> their<00:02:01.490> range

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
um in the eastern part of their range

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.660 
um in the eastern part of their range
it's<00:02:02.299> limited<00:02:02.720> they're<00:02:02.990> endangered<00:02:03.500> in<00:02:03.670> New

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
it's limited they're endangered in New

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.609 
it's limited they're endangered in New
Jersey<00:02:05.090> New<00:02:05.270> York<00:02:05.299> they're<00:02:05.720> extirpated<00:02:06.259> in<00:02:06.350> PA

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
Jersey New York they're extirpated in PA

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.949 
Jersey New York they're extirpated in PA
so<00:02:07.460> then<00:02:07.610> we<00:02:07.880> were<00:02:07.970> looking<00:02:08.060> at<00:02:08.270> sea<00:02:08.539> level

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
so then we were looking at sea level

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.260 
so then we were looking at sea level
rise<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:10.130> EPA<00:02:10.399> did<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.670> modeling<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.180> you

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
rise and the EPA did a modeling that you

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.880 
rise and the EPA did a modeling that you
could<00:02:11.390> use<00:02:11.480> with<00:02:11.569> GIS<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.590> showed<00:02:12.860> that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
could use with GIS and it showed that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.949 
could use with GIS and it showed that
the<00:02:13.340> majority<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.819> tiger<00:02:14.150> salamander<00:02:14.780> ponds

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
the majority of tiger salamander ponds

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.229 
the majority of tiger salamander ponds
were<00:02:15.230> gonna<00:02:15.319> be<00:02:15.670> threatened<00:02:16.670> with<00:02:16.700> inundation

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
were gonna be threatened with inundation

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.900 
were gonna be threatened with inundation
from<00:02:17.270> sea<00:02:17.630> water<00:02:17.980> when<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.069> sea<00:02:19.250> level<00:02:19.489> rises

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
from sea water when the sea level rises

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.180 
from sea water when the sea level rises
so<00:02:20.350> Peninsula<00:02:21.350> there<00:02:21.500> was<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.800> site<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.130> a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
so Peninsula there was this site and a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.380 
so Peninsula there was this site and a
couple<00:02:22.400> others<00:02:22.730> we're<00:02:22.940> like<00:02:23.060> oh<00:02:23.209> it'd<00:02:23.360> be

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
couple others we're like oh it'd be

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.840 
couple others we're like oh it'd be
great<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.900> create<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.440> series<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.860> ponds<00:02:25.100> to

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
great to create a series of ponds to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.850 
great to create a series of ponds to
help<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> animals<00:02:26.510> move<00:02:26.720> up<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.500> mainland

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
so when sea level does happen we're able

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.630 
so when sea level does happen we're able

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
large so the reason for that genetic

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.880 
large so the reason for that genetic
sampling<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.120> when<00:02:59.750> we<00:02:59.900> come<00:03:00.079> back<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.650> two

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890
