00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
inch crash or 16 or something like that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.630 
inch crash or 16 or something like that
and<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.440> have<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> make<00:01:32.040> choices<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:32.610> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and I have to make choices because it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.840 
and I have to make choices because it
can<00:01:32.850> only<00:01:32.970> reach<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.410> fit<00:01:35.160> so<00:01:35.340> much<00:01:35.550> stuff

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
can only reach so so I fit so much stuff

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.030 
can only reach so so I fit so much stuff
but<00:01:36.480> that's<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> basic<00:01:37.380> idea<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.800> why<00:01:38.010> I

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
but that's the basic idea of why I

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.460 
but that's the basic idea of why I
choose<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> choose<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.330> especially<00:01:40.320> with

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
choose what I choose and especially with

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.440 
choose what I choose and especially with
the<00:01:40.560> high<00:01:40.710> hats<00:01:41.010> but<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:41.670> really<00:01:41.910> sticks<00:01:42.270> out

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the high hats but it really sticks out
