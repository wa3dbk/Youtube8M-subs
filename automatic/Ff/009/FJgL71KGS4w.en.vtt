00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
a car turn the steering wheel there's no

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.780 
a car turn the steering wheel there's no
power<00:00:13.660> steering<00:00:14.019> whatsoever

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
power steering whatsoever

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.630 
power steering whatsoever
check<00:00:16.599> the<00:00:16.750> fluid<00:00:17.110> level<00:00:17.410> cooler<00:00:17.830> levels

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
check the fluid level cooler levels

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.110 
check the fluid level cooler levels
long<00:00:18.939> so

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.120 
long so

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.900 
long so
to<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.780> same<00:00:22.470> exact<00:00:22.830> thing<00:00:22.860> still<00:00:23.430> no<00:00:23.640> power

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to it same exact thing still no power

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.690 
to it same exact thing still no power
steering<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:25.110> we<00:00:25.740> lift<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.280> looked<00:00:26.520> at

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
steering so we lift it up we looked at

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.000 
steering so we lift it up we looked at
it<00:00:26.880> once<00:00:27.150> why<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.720> come<00:00:27.960> from<00:00:28.200> one<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it once why can you come from one of the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.269 
it once why can you come from one of the
the<00:00:29.100> rack<00:00:29.700> and<00:00:29.880> pinion<00:00:30.860> there<00:00:31.860> was<00:00:31.950> a<00:00:31.980> slight

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
the rack and pinion there was a slight

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.860 
the rack and pinion there was a slight
leak<00:00:32.490> coming<00:00:32.760> from<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> end<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> rack<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
leak coming from the end of the rack and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.710 
leak coming from the end of the rack and
pinion<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.740> decided<00:00:35.310> to<00:00:35.490> do<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.120> replace

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
pinion so I decided to do is to replace

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.450 
pinion so I decided to do is to replace
the<00:00:36.990> rack<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.380> pinion<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.250> power

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the rack and pinion and the power

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.350 
the rack and pinion and the power
steering<00:00:38.880> self<00:00:39.830> and<00:00:40.970> being<00:00:41.970> that<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.150> power

steering self and being that the power

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.910 
steering self and being that the power
steering<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.900> failed<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.440> no<00:00:43.710> power

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
steering that failed we have no power

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.490 
steering that failed we have no power
steering<00:00:44.340> whatsoever<00:00:45.290> we're<00:00:46.290> going<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
steering whatsoever we're going to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.869 
steering whatsoever we're going to
change<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.830> house<00:00:47.040> here<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.430> pump<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.790> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
change the house here in pump at the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.640 
change the house here in pump at the
same<00:00:48.090> time<00:00:48.330> so<00:00:48.540> we<00:00:48.629> changed<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.080> we<00:00:49.199> change<00:00:49.470> the

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
same time so we changed it we change the

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.270 
same time so we changed it we change the
pump<00:00:49.910> because<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.320> something<00:00:52.320> fluid<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
pump because it was something fluid and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.650 
pump because it was something fluid and
which<00:00:53.489> ain't<00:00:53.699> gonna<00:00:53.820> rack<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.300> pinion

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
which ain't gonna rack and pinion

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.640 
which ain't gonna rack and pinion
because<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.590> fluid<00:00:56.520> from<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> end<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
because we can fluid from the end of the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.340 
because we can fluid from the end of the
plate<00:00:58.650> by<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> time<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.460> hear<00:00:59.640> Tyler<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.809> we're

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
plate by the time I hear Tyler so we're

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.930 
plate by the time I hear Tyler so we're
going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:01.650> ahead<00:01:01.769> and<00:01:01.949> replace<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.280> vacuum

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
going to go ahead and replace the vacuum

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
going to go ahead and replace the vacuum
so<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.360> do<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.780> ahead<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.140> change<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.530> rack

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
so we do go ahead and change the rack

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.320 
so we do go ahead and change the rack
and<00:01:04.949> pinion<00:01:05.280> put<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> whole<00:01:05.940> thing<00:01:05.970> back

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and pinion put the whole thing back

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.730 
and pinion put the whole thing back
together<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:08.270> stop<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.300> bill<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.900> purge<00:01:10.470> all

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
together and stop a bill of purge all

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
together and stop a bill of purge all
the<00:01:10.890> air<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.550> fill<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.060> fluid

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the air out and fill it up with fluid

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.320 
the air out and fill it up with fluid
now<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> steering<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.070> nice<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.520> free<00:01:14.820> turns

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
now the steering is nice and free turns

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.469 
now the steering is nice and free turns
nice<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.840> creamy

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
nice and creamy

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.020 
nice and creamy
constant<00:01:17.110> buzzing<00:01:17.350> noise<00:01:17.759> whenever<00:01:18.759> you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
constant buzzing noise whenever you

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.910 
constant buzzing noise whenever you
whenever<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:20.049> turn<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.439> steering<00:01:20.500> wheel

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
whenever you turn the steering wheel

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.010 
whenever you turn the steering wheel
industry<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.880> positioning<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.479> buzzing<00:01:22.990> noise

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
industry and positioning a buzzing noise

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.029 
industry and positioning a buzzing noise
so<00:01:24.689> returning<00:01:25.689> wheelers<00:01:26.289> it<00:01:26.439> causes<00:01:26.890> like

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
so returning wheelers it causes like

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.260 
so returning wheelers it causes like
crazy

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.670 

assuming<00:01:31.930> that<00:01:31.960> we're<00:01:32.170> going<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.380> be<00:01:32.440> air

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
assuming that we're going to be air

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.460 
assuming that we're going to be air
block<00:01:32.980> so

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
block so

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.200 
block so
they're<00:01:34.740> popular<00:01:35.010> so<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.490> guess<00:01:35.760> what<00:01:35.910> we<00:01:35.970> try

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
they're popular so I guess what we try

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.630 
they're popular so I guess what we try
to<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.810> leave<00:01:37.080> it<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:38.160> didn't<00:01:38.460> seem<00:01:38.580> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
to just leave it out it didn't seem to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.520 
to just leave it out it didn't seem to
do<00:01:38.850> any<00:01:39.030> good<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:40.110> them<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> do

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
do any good so what we like them to do

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.020 
do any good so what we like them to do
is<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.830> go<00:01:40.980> ahead<00:01:41.010> and<00:01:41.310> replace<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.670> power

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
is to go ahead and replace the power

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.810 
is to go ahead and replace the power
steering<00:01:42.390> pump<00:01:42.740> because<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.950> pump<00:01:44.280> itself

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
steering pump because the pump itself

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.250 
steering pump because the pump itself
must<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.510> issue<00:01:45.900> right<00:01:46.940> no<00:01:47.940> put<00:01:48.870> it<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.080> power

palace here and works perfectly

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.800 
palace here and works perfectly
but<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.550> still<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.270> buzzing<00:02:03.660> noise

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
but we still have that buzzing noise

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.319 
but we still have that buzzing noise
I<00:02:04.840> just<00:02:05.259> want<00:02:05.469> to<00:02:05.560> show<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.060> buzzing

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
I just want to show you what the buzzing

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.529 
I just want to show you what the buzzing
noise<00:02:07.509> was<00:02:08.019> all<00:02:08.229> about<00:02:08.550> inside<00:02:09.550> top<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
noise was all about inside top of the

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.479 
noise was all about inside top of the
reservoir<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.200> buzzy<00:02:11.410> mode<00:02:11.650> as<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:12.010> find<00:02:12.280> out

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
reservoir the buzzy mode as I find out

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.759 
reservoir the buzzy mode as I find out
later<00:02:12.760> on<00:02:13.540> but<00:02:14.080> I've<00:02:14.200> never<00:02:14.379> run<00:02:14.530> in<00:02:14.650> this

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
later on but I've never run in this

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.600 
later on but I've never run in this
problem<00:02:15.010> before<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.489> might<00:02:15.730> add<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:17.610> buzzing

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
problem before I might add the buzzing

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.490 
problem before I might add the buzzing
noise<00:02:18.640> was<00:02:19.000> actually<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.390> topical<00:02:19.989> power

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
noise was actually a topical power

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.470 
noise was actually a topical power

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
steering reservoir which is mounted up

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.960 
steering reservoir which is mounted up

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.640 
reservoir itself in return the wheel
looks<00:02:33.040> like<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:33.340> Perry<00:02:33.989> they<00:02:34.989> can<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.530> know

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
looks like it's Perry they can you know

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.229 
looks like it's Perry they can you know
how<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:36.069> that<00:02:36.129> possibly<00:02:36.370> be<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.940> look

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
how can that possibly be a look

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.869 
how can that possibly be a look
beautiful<00:02:38.140> says<00:02:38.650> nothing<00:02:39.069> about<00:02:39.129> a<00:02:39.340> screen<00:02:39.849> a

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
beautiful says nothing about a screen a

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.270 
beautiful says nothing about a screen a
little<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.420> filtering<00:02:41.079> like<00:02:41.349> that<00:02:41.620> inside<00:02:42.010> yeah

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
little a filtering like that inside yeah

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.580 
little a filtering like that inside yeah
so<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.299> decided<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.720> take<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.019> reservoir<00:02:44.410> off

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
so I decided to take the reservoir off

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.920 
so I decided to take the reservoir off
the<00:02:44.739> car<00:02:44.950> take<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.640> reservoir<00:02:46.209> off<00:02:46.510> sure

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
the car take the reservoir off sure

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.660 
the car take the reservoir off sure
enough<00:02:47.079> flip<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.650> upside<00:02:47.980> down<00:02:48.010> look<00:02:48.489> down

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
enough flip it upside down look down

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.509 
enough flip it upside down look down
into<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.120> bottom<00:02:49.480> hose<00:02:49.660> which<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.079> a<00:02:50.170> good

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
into the bottom hose which is a good

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.930 
into the bottom hose which is a good
probably<00:02:51.519> 3/4<00:02:52.390> inch

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
probably 3/4 inch

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.270 
probably 3/4 inch
that<00:02:54.690> fits<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:55.080> after<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> cooler<00:02:56.100> can

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
that fits on after the cooler can

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.070 
that fits on after the cooler can
actually<00:02:56.610> blow<00:02:56.850> pretty<00:02:57.150> decent<00:02:57.570> there's<00:02:57.990> a

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
actually blow pretty decent there's a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
becoming clogged and causing me the pump

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.430 
becoming clogged and causing me the pump
to<00:03:33.160> stall<00:03:33.430> for<00:03:33.670> fuel<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.150> mean<00:03:34.420> for<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.660> fluid

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
to stall for fuel I mean for a fluid

which now after the fact makes sense to
me<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.670> pump<00:03:39.880> part<00:03:40.180> no<00:03:40.420> because<00:03:40.959> the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
me that the pump part no because the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.490 
me that the pump part no because the
screen<00:03:41.380> was<00:03:41.590> long<00:03:41.920> enough<00:03:42.450> humble<00:03:43.450> or<00:03:43.750> fluid

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500
