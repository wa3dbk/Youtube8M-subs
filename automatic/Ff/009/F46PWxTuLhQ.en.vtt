00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
mp7 now so far from what i can tell his

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.690 
mp7 now so far from what i can tell his
weapon<00:02:01.560> similar<00:02:01.860> they're<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.369> more

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
weapon similar they're going to be more

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.120 
weapon similar they're going to be more
close<00:02:03.060> quarters<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.810> medium<00:02:04.200> range<00:02:04.530> now

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
close quarters to medium range now

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.370 
close quarters to medium range now
that's<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.969> said<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:06.479> only<00:02:06.780> two<00:02:07.079> guns

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that's like I said that's only two guns

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.279 
that's like I said that's only two guns
though<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:09.060> change<00:02:09.539> throughout<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
though so it can change throughout the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.110 
though so it can change throughout the
whole<00:02:10.500> gain<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> guns<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.550> different

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
whole gain on the guns can be different

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.790 
whole gain on the guns can be different
and<00:02:12.450> plus<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.110> guys<00:02:13.290> like

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
and plus you guys like

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.370 
and plus you guys like
lots<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.700> lots<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.270> customization<00:02:15.990> going<00:02:16.260> on

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
lots and lots and customization going on

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.570 
lots and lots and customization going on
here<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.710> can<00:02:16.860> probably<00:02:17.010> make<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.400> more

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
here you can probably make it more

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.000 
here you can probably make it more
effective<00:02:17.850> at<00:02:18.180> even<00:02:18.960> longer<00:02:19.200> ranges<00:02:19.650> but<00:02:19.830> so

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
effective at even longer ranges but so

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.040 
effective at even longer ranges but so
far<00:02:20.220> his<00:02:20.400> guns<00:02:20.670> seem<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.240> more<00:02:21.540> effective

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
far his guns seem to be more effective

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.270 
far his guns seem to be more effective
at<00:02:22.650> close<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:24.660> know<00:02:24.750> medium<00:02:25.260> ranges<00:02:25.590> now

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
at close to you know medium ranges now

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.120 
at close to you know medium ranges now
he<00:02:27.000> has<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.450> fastest<00:02:27.990> movement<00:02:28.410> speed<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:28.890> all

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
he has the fastest movement speed up all

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.000 
he has the fastest movement speed up all
the<00:02:29.340> classes<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.000> far<00:02:30.030> present<00:02:30.750> no<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.620> know

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the classes so far present no I know

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.400 
the classes so far present no I know
they're<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.370> one<00:02:32.880> class<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.320> gamestop<00:02:34.320> is

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
they're just one class that gamestop is

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.080 
they're just one class that gamestop is
trying<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.770> give<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.100> while<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.430> preorder

trying to give you while you preorder

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.840 
trying to give you while you preorder
but<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.320> far<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.890> seems<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.490> is<00:02:38.550> going

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
but so far it seems like this is going

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.110 
but so far it seems like this is going
to<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.240> fastest<00:02:39.780> class<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:41.250> all<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:42.000> them

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
to be the fastest class of all of them

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.170 
to be the fastest class of all of them

pretty much what this allows you to do

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.100 
pretty much what this allows you to do
is<00:03:34.830> in<00:03:35.370> your<00:03:35.730> field<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.150> view<00:03:36.360> you're<00:03:36.870> going<00:03:37.020> to

see whether your enemies are at hiding

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.850 
see whether your enemies are at hiding
through<00:03:39.420> walls<00:03:39.660> whatever<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.440> case<00:03:40.620> maybe

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
through walls whatever the case maybe

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.890 
through walls whatever the case maybe
they're<00:03:41.250> hiding<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.640> cover<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.360> get<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.630> see

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
they're hiding in cover you get to see

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.370

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
let's have a few drawbacks like the fact

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.210 
let's have a few drawbacks like the fact
that<00:04:04.110> your<00:04:04.320> screen<00:04:04.530> because<00:04:04.800> really

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
that your screen because really

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.740

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
disoriented when you use it you don't

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.300 
disoriented when you use it you don't
have<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.080> best<00:04:07.260> view<00:04:07.440> while<00:04:07.800> you're<00:04:07.950> using<00:04:08.130> it

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
