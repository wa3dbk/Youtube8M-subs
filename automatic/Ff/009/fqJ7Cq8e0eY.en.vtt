00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi today to do a little 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.990
 video of course the wild plum 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.370
 among others, this is a small 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.230
 wild plum trees so it's a core 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.420
 that I had planted four years ago 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.730
 that and it works that never got 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.070
 no drop of water no maintenance nothing 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.390
 at all and it's a tree that's already 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.560
 very very big line because there we see 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.210
 that we are in March so he is 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.830
 filled with flowers they attract 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.869
 bees he is really very very pretty 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.060
 and in addition he's going to make a big 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.439
 amount of berries also so 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.820
 without any work just swinging 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.579
 rents on the ground we can get 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.030
 very productive trees there without anything 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.280
 else 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.719
 this one there and we see that according to one 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.059
 radio they take forms totally 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.379
 different sun a lot more in 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.480
 length much finer many 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.399
 higher than the other they go very badly 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.590
 so according to the kernels it's funny 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.960
 see a little bit of genetic diversity 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.460
 and in plum trees so when we do 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.949
 grafted trees we have only one 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.399
 genetics and his clown hopes that 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.780
 is indefinitely reproduced here we see 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.280
 So fish is like it is the core 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 of arrows that I planted directly 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.780
 and so there it will soon pass flowers 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.580
 so yes and it's in the henhouse 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.570
 in fact in this hen house and everything 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.189
 around the chicken coop I planted 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.770
 a lot of fruit tarot 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.290
 cherry trees of the first apricot trees 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.640
 of sins and I forgot full 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.140
 others and actually the goal is to 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.700
 make this henhouse the maximum autonomous 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.840
 so the fruits that will rot on the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.229
 falling trees receives the feed in 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.869
 hens 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.240
 and then the hens will maintain the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.280
 werder will say so there we see a small 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.630
 vegetable garden in the henhouse you in 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.009
 will talk a little later about this garden 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.880
 it's an experiment I did 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.740
 burned vegetable gardens here we see that I 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.070
 curl also to be first in the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.420
 chicken coop 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 in fact the idea is that when Caesar 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.009
 are going to age and are a little older 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.509
 its phase of the trunks very curved so the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.820
 bridges can climb into the army itself 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.470
 feed directly into the most 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.659
 directly and glue the fruits in 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.509
 art month without waiting for these 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.920
 fruits fall to the ground so the same is 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.140
 still an experiment that I am 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.680
 doing and I think that's okay 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.369
 to be very very interesting to be able to 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.430
 for the poles to be able to feed themselves 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.420
 directly so the technique is 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.040
 not very complicated I take some 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.990
 twine strings and small 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.369
 sardines that I dig into the ground and that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.470
 allows to maintain the combs branch and 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.690
 after two years we can remove the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.360
 the strings and the branch is maintained 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.020
 alone to land on the tree a31 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.100
 of attached last year and already the 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.230
 branch started to take this form 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.910
 other branches are divided into 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.370
 direction of the sky and we see that the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.660
 flowers are very low so what will 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.720
 to make that fruit also on 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.970
 watch very low so here is my opinion 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.400
 it's a good technique developed 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.050
 for the henhouses and in addition the fact 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.370
 to help them lie down like that 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.870
 can do a lot so 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.220
 also for hens in summer 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.690
 when it's very hot to know how to do 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.459
 people of small very low parasol 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.330
 and it keeps them on as we see it's 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.370
 really very interesting for 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.840
 hens this halimi destroying land 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.250
 really everywhere else we send another to 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.050
 side of a nozzle had put on buses 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.100
 really bored everywhere and 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.360
 maybe you'll tell you but 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.410
 since then he tells us about prunes 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.860
 and what is he going to do with all 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.350
 his proofs 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.480
 in fact here we see another one to 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.000
 our first on a hillock with 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.650
 the live garlic in parenthesis binds it's 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.820
 interesting about fruit trees that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.770
 are sick when the problems of 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.090
 cryptogamic diseases everything that is 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.010
 of the family Alliaceae on the plant 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.740
 at the foot it helps to heal the trees are 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.450
 sick so he here bah actually the 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.560
 plum trees if I have a lot of them and who 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.670
 who are not good because in fact the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.870
 plum trees as if jerseys to your 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.670
 reactions with sunrise your dreams are 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.019
 less good those who are the least good in 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.690
 does I just want to cut there 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.340
 and I was able to graft a lot of 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.480
 naro stone fruiters so either 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.709
 plum trees also care about them on the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.840
 thiess the apricot trees are 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.390
 almond trees so that's going to allow me 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.500
 to have a lot of transplants that 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.780
 will not need a drop of water 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.560
 who will not need anything at all 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.060
 So here is 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.760
 Well that's it for this little video 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.459
 on the plum trees this was just a 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.739
 little video to continue the series of 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.150
 videos and then thank you so much to 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.150
 soon for new adventures
