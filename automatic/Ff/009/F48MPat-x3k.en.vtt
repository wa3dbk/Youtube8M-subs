wanted<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> developers

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
wanted the developers

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.120

boom<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.090> supposed<00:01:15.300> to<00:01:15.360> frighten<00:01:15.510> you<00:01:16.130> which

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
boom that supposed to frighten you which

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.950 
boom that supposed to frighten you which
it<00:01:17.280> does<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.700> you're<00:01:17.790> playing<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.270> also

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
it does when you're playing it also

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.140 
it does when you're playing it also
specifically<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:19.980> it<00:01:20.430> calls<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
specifically because it calls the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.640 
specifically because it calls the
xenomorph<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.050> is<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.290> motion

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
xenomorph out so this is your motion

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.310 
xenomorph out so this is your motion
tracker<00:01:22.860> device<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:23.430> there<00:01:23.730> you<00:01:23.820> go

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
tracker device and there you go

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.810 
tracker device and there you go
fortunately<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.370> xenomorph<00:01:26.730> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
fortunately for you the xenomorph is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.750 
fortunately for you the xenomorph is
also<00:01:27.120> very<00:01:27.300> smart<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:28.100> won't<00:01:29.100> approach<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
also very smart and won't approach the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.090 
also very smart and won't approach the
fire<00:01:30.110> it'll<00:01:31.110> come<00:01:31.260> around<00:01:31.380> though<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:31.980> you

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
fire it'll come around though so you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.690 
fire it'll come around though so you
have<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> hide<00:01:32.580> like<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.000> all<00:01:33.030> times<00:01:33.480> ok<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.700> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
have to hide like at all times ok and is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.640 
have to hide like at all times ok and is
there<00:01:35.970> anything<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.570> noticed<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.440> it's

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
there anything you noticed so is it's

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.880 
there anything you noticed so is it's
mainly<00:01:38.930> atmospheric<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.230> game<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.620> say<00:01:40.800> it's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
mainly atmospheric or game you say it's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.680 
mainly atmospheric or game you say it's
a<00:01:40.920> horror<00:01:41.130> game<00:01:41.190> an<00:01:41.490> action<00:01:41.880> game<00:01:42.060> it's

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
a horror game an action game it's

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.270 
a horror game an action game it's
definitely<00:01:43.080> a<00:01:43.140> horror<00:01:43.380> survival<00:01:44.070> like

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
definitely a horror survival like

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.710 
definitely a horror survival like
survival<00:01:44.730> is<00:01:44.790> definitely<00:01:45.060> important<00:01:45.420> bit<00:01:45.540> so

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
survival is definitely important bit so

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.850 
survival is definitely important bit so
it<00:01:45.810> was<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.080> then<00:01:46.260> you<00:01:46.380> picked<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
it was just then you picked up a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.710 
it was just then you picked up a
flamethrower<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.210> believe<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.690> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
flamethrower and I believe this is a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.500

and then you can go hide which at this

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.530 
and then you can go hide which at this
point<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:01.950> was<00:02:02.040> me<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.520> would<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.910> like<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.420> a

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
based off the fact that the AI is pretty

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.800 
based off the fact that the AI is pretty
aggressive<00:02:25.709> least<00:02:26.160> like<00:02:26.550> hunting<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.209> down<00:02:27.239> I

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
shoot they'll make noise and the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.370 
shoot they'll make noise and the
xenomorph<00:02:32.310> won't<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.640> attracted<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.209> them<00:02:33.380> not

xenomorph won't be attracted to them not
all<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.709> time<00:02:34.860> but<00:02:34.890> if<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.220> make<00:02:35.459> like<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:36.150> if

all the time but if I make like like if
I<00:02:36.390> run<00:02:36.980> one<00:02:37.980> step<00:02:38.340> by<00:02:38.519> accident<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.420> xenomorph

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
I run one step by accident the xenomorph

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.590 
I run one step by accident the xenomorph
is<00:02:39.989> on<00:02:40.170> my<00:02:40.410> tail<00:02:40.650> again<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.150> an<00:02:42.269> Android

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
is on my tail again this is an Android

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.509 
is on my tail again this is an Android
and<00:02:42.959> he<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:43.860> terrifying

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
and he is terrifying

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.820 
and he is terrifying
it<00:02:45.390> took<00:02:45.540> me<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.690> while<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.080> figure<00:02:46.200> out<00:02:46.350> how<00:02:46.769> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
it took me a while to figure out how to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.729 
it took me a while to figure out how to
fight<00:02:47.190> him<00:02:47.310> off<00:02:47.459> because<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.260> tough<00:02:49.530> to

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
fight him off because it's it's tough to

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.710 
fight him off because it's it's tough to
kill<00:02:50.070> pretty<00:02:50.580> much<00:02:50.640> anything<00:02:50.910> except<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.360> human

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
kill pretty much anything except a human

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.199 
kill pretty much anything except a human
in<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.080> game<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:53.310> even<00:02:53.400> humans<00:02:53.820> it's<00:02:53.970> tough

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
in this game and even humans it's tough

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.340 
in this game and even humans it's tough
because<00:02:54.420> you're<00:02:54.840> still<00:02:55.110> constantly<00:02:55.830> at<00:02:55.980> risk

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
because you're still constantly at risk

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.470 
because you're still constantly at risk
so<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.890> hiding<00:02:59.670> from<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.060> Android

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
so this is you hiding from the Android

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.570 
so this is you hiding from the Android
which<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.870> appropriate<00:03:01.260> way<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.980> dealing

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
which is the appropriate way of dealing

which is the appropriate way of dealing
with<00:03:02.760> him<00:03:03.239> or<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.470> guess<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.160> what<00:03:05.370> your

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.470 
close and it's more obvious from his
physical<00:03:29.200> appearance<00:03:29.820> but<00:03:30.820> he's<00:03:31.030> terrifying

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
physical appearance but he's terrifying

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.900 
physical appearance but he's terrifying
and<00:03:31.690> he<00:03:31.810> will<00:03:31.960> kill<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.530> hit<00:03:32.740> but<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:33.820> you

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
sequence I think it was about like an

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.010 
sequence I think it was about like an
hour<00:03:38.710> and<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.070> half<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.580> played<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.990> whole

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
that came flying right yeah that was a

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.080 
that came flying right yeah that was a
little<00:04:21.220> different<00:04:21.520> because<00:04:21.580> you<00:04:21.820> had<00:04:21.940> the

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
little different because you had the

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.180 
little different because you had the
gamepad<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.960> Wii<00:04:23.080> U<00:04:23.200> gamepad<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.890> whatnot

gamepad the Wii U gamepad and whatnot
which<00:04:24.400> kind<00:04:24.670> of<00:04:24.730> made<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.060> more<00:04:25.210> tangible<00:04:26.100> but

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
which kind of made it more tangible but

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.640 
which kind of made it more tangible but
even<00:04:27.430> when<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.700> was<00:04:27.790> playing<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.840> wrote<00:04:29.500> up<00:04:29.590> a

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
even when I was playing I wrote up a

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.810 
even when I was playing I wrote up a
little<00:04:29.800> impressions<00:04:30.250> piece<00:04:30.400> which<00:04:30.580> will<00:04:30.730> go

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
little impressions piece which will go

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.730 
little impressions piece which will go
up<00:04:30.940> later<00:04:31.060> but<00:04:31.330> while<00:04:31.480> I<00:04:31.510> was<00:04:31.600> playing<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:32.320> was

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
up later but while I was playing I was

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.670 
up later but while I was playing I was
gripping<00:04:33.340> on<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:34.090> my<00:04:34.660> xbox<00:04:35.260> one<00:04:35.500> controller

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
gripping on to my xbox one controller

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.890 
gripping on to my xbox one controller
almost<00:04:36.490> like<00:04:36.640> it<00:04:36.790> was<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.240> motion<00:04:37.690> tracker

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
almost like it was the motion tracker

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.470 
almost like it was the motion tracker
device<00:04:38.260> so<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:39.070> is<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.250> crafted<00:04:39.730> Molotov<00:04:40.180> that

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480

surviving that you need to hide like the
when<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.400> see<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:55.000> xenomorph<00:04:55.390> you<00:04:55.510> basically

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
when you see the xenomorph you basically

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.290 
when you see the xenomorph you basically
need<00:04:56.170> to<00:04:56.290> be<00:04:56.410> hiding<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.430> I<00:04:57.490> think<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:57.970> think<00:04:58.180> I

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
need to be hiding and I think I think I

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.280 
need to be hiding and I think I think I
don't<00:04:58.450> know

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
don't know

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.590 
don't know
situations<00:05:00.250> where<00:05:00.430> like<00:05:00.790> they

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
situations where like they

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.390 
situations where like they
bait-and-switch<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.620> halfway<00:05:03.280> through

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
bait-and-switch you and halfway through

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.280 
bait-and-switch you and halfway through
the<00:05:03.670> game<00:05:03.700> you<00:05:04.060> just<00:05:04.090> end<00:05:04.390> up<00:05:04.510> shooting<00:05:05.140> a

bunch of stuff well you know what I mean
right<00:05:06.820> so<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.090> asked<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.200> creative<00:05:08.710> lead<00:05:09.400> on

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
right so I asked the creative lead on

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.390 
right so I asked the creative lead on
the<00:05:09.880> game<00:05:10.090> if<00:05:10.980> there<00:05:11.980> would<00:05:12.100> ever<00:05:12.130> be<00:05:12.280> a

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
the game if there would ever be a

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.890 
the game if there would ever be a
situation<00:05:12.640> where<00:05:13.090> you're<00:05:13.210> actually<00:05:13.360> fighting

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
situation where you're actually fighting

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.660 
situation where you're actually fighting
the<00:05:14.080> alien<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.590> he<00:05:15.040> said<00:05:15.250> that<00:05:15.370> they<00:05:15.460> never

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
the alien and he said that they never

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.310 
the alien and he said that they never
give<00:05:15.940> you<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.120> weapon<00:05:16.420> that<00:05:16.870> can<00:05:16.960> take<00:05:17.200> that

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
give you a weapon that can take that

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.630 
give you a weapon that can take that
alien<00:05:17.680> down<00:05:17.830> so<00:05:18.130> basically<00:05:18.430> that's

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
alien down so basically that's

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.460 
alien down so basically that's
translating<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.300> No

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
translating to No

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.130 
translating to No
so<00:05:20.800> at<00:05:21.520> all<00:05:21.730> points<00:05:22.060> of<00:05:22.150> time<00:05:22.300> this<00:05:22.690> is<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.900> end

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
so at all points of time this is the end

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.770 
so at all points of time this is the end
of<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.500> demo<00:05:23.830> that<00:05:24.100> I<00:05:24.820> play<00:05:25.180> it<00:05:25.330> at<00:05:25.420> all<00:05:25.540> points

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
of the demo that I play it at all points

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.360 
of the demo that I play it at all points
of<00:05:25.870> time<00:05:26.020> you're<00:05:26.260> basically<00:05:26.800> just<00:05:27.010> trying<00:05:27.280> to

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
of time you're basically just trying to

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.980 
of time you're basically just trying to
get<00:05:27.490> away<00:05:27.640> from<00:05:27.970> it<00:05:28.120> so<00:05:28.390> it's<00:05:28.510> like<00:05:28.600> resident

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
get away from it so it's like resident

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.930 
get away from it so it's like resident
evil<00:05:29.170> 3<00:05:29.200> nemesis<00:05:30.070> there<00:05:30.220> was<00:05:30.310> a<00:05:30.340> giant<00:05:30.670> thing

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
evil 3 nemesis there was a giant thing

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.250 
evil 3 nemesis there was a giant thing
that<00:05:31.090> just<00:05:31.240> kept<00:05:31.390> on<00:05:31.480> coming<00:05:31.660> out<00:05:31.900> under<00:05:32.170> you

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
that just kept on coming out under you

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.870 
that just kept on coming out under you
and<00:05:32.410> you<00:05:32.500> just<00:05:32.560> had<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:32.830> run<00:05:33.250> away<00:05:33.370> basically

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
and you just had to run away basically

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.370 
and you just had to run away basically
exactly<00:05:34.450> you<00:05:34.660> have<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:34.840> run<00:05:34.960> away<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.110> have<00:05:35.290> to

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
exactly you have to run away you have to

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.620 
exactly you have to run away you have to
hide<00:05:35.560> and<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.700> way<00:05:36.790> that<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.060> AI<00:05:37.180> worked<00:05:37.510> is

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
hide and the way that the AI worked is

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.630 
hide and the way that the AI worked is
kind<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:37.840> interesting<00:05:38.260> because<00:05:38.640> the

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
kind of interesting because the

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.730 
kind of interesting because the
xenomorph<00:05:40.390> is<00:05:40.630> like<00:05:40.960> like<00:05:41.170> knows<00:05:41.410> that<00:05:41.590> you're

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
xenomorph is like like knows that you're

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.070 
xenomorph is like like knows that you're
on<00:05:41.890> the<00:05:42.010> ship<00:05:42.070> so<00:05:42.520> it's<00:05:42.700> constantly<00:05:43.420> searching

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
on the ship so it's constantly searching

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.840 
on the ship so it's constantly searching
for<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:44.500> so<00:05:44.650> if<00:05:44.740> you<00:05:44.830> make<00:05:45.010> a<00:05:45.040> noise<00:05:45.280> or<00:05:45.760> I

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
for you so if you make a noise or I

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.090 
for you so if you make a noise or I
guess<00:05:46.360> if<00:05:46.480> it<00:05:46.570> smells<00:05:46.990> you<00:05:47.290> or<00:05:47.440> sees<00:05:47.710> you<00:05:47.950> like

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
guess if it smells you or sees you like

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.560 
guess if it smells you or sees you like
if<00:05:48.220> you're<00:05:48.340> flashing<00:05:48.730> your<00:05:49.090> flashlight

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
if you're flashing your flashlight

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.620 
if you're flashing your flashlight
around<00:05:50.430> irresponsibly<00:05:51.430> then<00:05:51.730> it'll<00:05:51.970> drop

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
around irresponsibly then it'll drop

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.840 
around irresponsibly then it'll drop
down<00:05:52.690> and<00:05:53.380> come<00:05:54.040> after<00:05:54.370> you<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.640> you<00:05:54.730> can

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
down and come after you and you can

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.220 
down and come after you and you can
avoid<00:05:55.060> it<00:05:55.210> if<00:05:55.330> you<00:05:55.420> manage<00:05:55.660> to<00:05:55.780> slip<00:05:55.930> into<00:05:56.110> a

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
avoid it if you manage to slip into a

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.640 
avoid it if you manage to slip into a
like<00:05:56.740> under<00:05:57.400> a<00:05:57.430> table<00:05:58.090> or<00:05:58.420> into<00:05:59.350> a<00:05:59.380> locker

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
like under a table or into a locker

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.250 
like under a table or into a locker
before<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.370> sees<00:06:00.610> you<00:06:00.820> but<00:06:01.570> for<00:06:01.780> the<00:06:01.840> most<00:06:01.990> part

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
before it sees you but for the most part

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.350 
before it sees you but for the most part
you<00:06:02.440> want<00:06:02.620> to<00:06:02.740> like<00:06:03.400> not<00:06:03.430> linger<00:06:03.880> around<00:06:04.150> in<00:06:04.300> a

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
you want to like not linger around in a

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.050 
you want to like not linger around in a
room<00:06:04.510> too<00:06:04.720> long<00:06:04.930> either<00:06:05.140> because<00:06:05.620> it<00:06:06.610> at<00:06:06.850> any

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
room too long either because it at any

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.670 
room too long either because it at any
point<00:06:07.330> of<00:06:07.360> time<00:06:07.420> can<00:06:07.750> just<00:06:07.930> like<00:06:08.050> drop<00:06:08.320> down<00:06:08.500> to

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
point of time can just like drop down to

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.900 
point of time can just like drop down to
be<00:06:08.740> like<00:06:08.860> oh<00:06:08.980> what's<00:06:09.100> up<00:06:09.280> what's<00:06:09.490> going<00:06:09.550> on<00:06:09.760> in

be like oh what's up what's going on in

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.610 
be like oh what's up what's going on in
here<00:06:10.000> like<00:06:10.210> even<00:06:10.390> if<00:06:10.480> it<00:06:10.540> doesn't<00:06:10.690> hear<00:06:11.020> or<00:06:11.260> see

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
here like even if it doesn't hear or see

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.530 
here like even if it doesn't hear or see
anything<00:06:12.040> it<00:06:12.310> just<00:06:12.580> wants<00:06:12.940> to<00:06:13.030> scope<00:06:13.240> out<00:06:13.360> the

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
anything it just wants to scope out the

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.090 
anything it just wants to scope out the
area<00:06:13.570> so<00:06:13.900> you<00:06:13.960> you<00:06:14.290> constantly<00:06:14.980> have<00:06:15.070> this

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
area so you you constantly have this

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.880 
area so you you constantly have this
pressure<00:06:15.370> like<00:06:15.640> this<00:06:15.820> looming<00:06:16.690> pressure<00:06:17.590> of

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
pressure like this looming pressure of

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.400 
pressure like this looming pressure of
this<00:06:18.070> alien<00:06:18.460> who<00:06:19.090> at<00:06:19.270> kind<00:06:19.840> of<00:06:19.900> at<00:06:20.020> any<00:06:20.200> point
