00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 welcome to tripolis tv 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.490
 today if you show how to join 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.720
 a nokia lumia 930 the glass change 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.280
 by the way, in a video description 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.570
 finds the spare parts and tools the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.740
 I also just use it 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:22.260
 read through so take your work since 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:23.910
 years of sound let's get started so catch 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:31.050
 Let's say the first thing we turn the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.969
 nokia from now we take normal hair dryer 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.710
 and heat the glass to about 80 degrees 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.770
 to make the glue lighter afterwards 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.329
 then triggers take a flat 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.950
 tool and starts at the top of the page 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.950
 Phones carefully remove the glass 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.289
 thus giving it a constant temperature 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.490
 from time to time who has to film the 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.439
 to hold it back 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.030
 once we have the little glassplitter all 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.590
 we can start now 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.000
 with a playing card the big ones 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.000
 to dissolve the glass parts from the glue 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.950
 should your new glass this 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.299
 Dust protection did not recommend then 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.979
 I'll take you from the old glass 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.640
 Remove and later on the new glass 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.640
 to install again 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.549
 so that we have an easier time we use 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.549
 best two playing cards 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.070
 Now do not raise the glass too abruptly 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.840
 since it is still connected to the menu buttons 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.260
 is this we now solve carefully 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.260
 a pair of tweezers 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.079
 At this point, we check if that 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.860
 display is still functional 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.569
 then you have to the display of 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.250
 free the remaining glue by placing the 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.250
 rub glue with the fingers away 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.360
 After that, we will clean the display with you 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.920
 isopropanol and a microfiber cloth of 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.750
 the grease stain and the remaining glue 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.520
 next we take the rest 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.740
 original clarification stick it around the outside 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.460
 along the frame and remove it 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.460
 the protective films 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.660
 Now we live with a tape 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.260
 the menu buttons back to the right one 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.260
 position 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.500
 then we bring the dust cover 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.540
 again after that we bring two more 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.530
 more adhesive strips at the top and bottom of the 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.300
 display edge 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.680
 so that the liquid glue later 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.680
 not flowing into the electronics 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.650
 if we have all that we leave it 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.060
 look sticker slowly and carefully in 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.780
 a bone shape on the display 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.639
 flow 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.910
 Be careful not to blow 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.910
 arise 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.379
 Now we take the new glass and 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.719
 let it down slowly and carefully 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.399
 Glide up contact with the glue please 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.699
 take care that no bubbles 

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:49.699
 arise 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.960
 then we press the glue together 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.370
 with our fingers in the corners if 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.840
 your glue is just in front of the corners 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.520
 We turn on the uv lamp 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.990
 stop that underneath and press 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.260
 Only then glue all the way to the 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.260
 corners 

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:40.219
 then for another five to ten minutes 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:41.689
 the uv lamp made herten now 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.399
 we still liberate the device with one 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:48.349
 cloth from the leaked on the edge 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:49.849
 glue last we still check whether 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.099
 we did everything right if so 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.379
 should your nokia lumia 930 again 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.149
