00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
been told the briefs and that is is

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.950 
been told the briefs and that is is
because<00:02:22.830> these<00:02:23.830> radios<00:02:24.370> don't<00:02:24.819> these<00:02:25.690> did

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
because these radios don't these did

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.580
