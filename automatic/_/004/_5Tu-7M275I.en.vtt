that<00:01:59.340> order<00:01:59.549> if<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.299> pass<00:02:00.509> our<00:02:00.719> goal<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.259> can

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that order if we pass our goal we can

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.420 
that order if we pass our goal we can
develop<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:01.890> product

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
