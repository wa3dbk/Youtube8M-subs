a<00:00:26.490> little<00:00:26.820> bit<00:00:27.029> better<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.750> i<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:27.930> do

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
a little bit better that i actually do

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.679 
a little bit better that i actually do
of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.590> LMGs<00:00:29.010> cuz<00:00:29.580> genuinely<00:00:30.060> speaking<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.630> do

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
of the LMGs cuz genuinely speaking I do

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.089 
of the LMGs cuz genuinely speaking I do
