00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
twisted that side piece to make it a

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.339 
twisted that side piece to make it a
little<00:03:21.799> easier<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.250> bobby<00:03:22.549> pin<00:03:22.790> back<00:03:24.849> okay

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
little easier to bobby pin back okay

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.930 
little easier to bobby pin back okay
side<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:27.530> now<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.010> remaining<00:03:28.250> hair<00:03:28.670> what<00:03:28.849> I'm

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
going to do is divide it into three

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.089 
going to do is divide it into three
sections<00:03:33.980> so<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:34.489> have<00:03:34.700> one<00:03:34.940> right<00:03:35.090> here<00:03:36.099> one

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
sections so I have one right here one

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.270 
sections so I have one right here one
right<00:03:37.280> here<00:03:37.549> and<00:03:37.579> then<00:03:37.819> run<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:38.989> back<00:03:39.280> I'm

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
right here and then run in the back I'm

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.500 
right here and then run in the back I'm
going<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.489> start<00:03:40.670> with<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.910> metal<00:03:41.150> section

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
going to start with the metal section

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.259 
going to start with the metal section
and<00:03:41.599> all<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.810> do<00:03:42.099> turn<00:03:43.099> this<00:03:43.190> way<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:44.450> twist

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
and all you do turn this way this twist

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.839 
and all you do turn this way this twist
into<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.720> little<00:03:47.930> circle<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.709> pin<00:03:51.519> now<00:03:52.519> I<00:03:52.549> kind

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
into a little circle and pin now I kind

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.300 
into a little circle and pin now I kind
of<00:03:52.910> like<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.209> leave<00:03:53.359> some<00:03:53.599> of<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.780> ends<00:03:54.079> out<00:03:54.310> to

here and then you're going to do this
side<00:04:03.950> also

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:36.839 

and<00:04:21.880> then<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:23.560> left<00:04:23.770> side

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.820 

and<00:04:36.999> then<00:04:37.599> you<00:04:37.689> can<00:04:37.809> kind<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.969> pull<00:04:40.259> and<00:04:41.259> pin

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.100 
and then you can kind of pull and pin
other<00:04:42.550> pieces<00:04:42.849> into<00:04:43.330> place<00:04:43.360> if<00:04:43.779> they're<00:04:43.929> kind

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
other pieces into place if they're kind

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:54.190 
other pieces into place if they're kind
of<00:04:44.169> out<00:04:44.289> of<00:04:44.319> control

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.280 

and<00:04:54.860> there<00:04:55.730> we<00:04:55.850> go<00:04:55.970> just<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:57.740> messy<00:04:58.190> a<00:04:59.290> little

updo does it look like you put a lot of
effort<00:05:03.980> into<00:05:04.130> it<00:05:04.370> because<00:05:04.490> it's<00:05:04.700> really<00:05:04.790> not

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
effort into it because it's really not

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.080
