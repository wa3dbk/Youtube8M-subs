00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
I've been playing the challenges a bunch

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.410 
I've been playing the challenges a bunch
recently<00:00:43.140> today<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> played<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.940> while

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
recently today I played it for a while

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.810 
recently today I played it for a while
I've<00:00:45.600> been<00:00:45.629> recording<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.370> them<00:00:47.520> are

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
I've been recording it some of them are

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.180 
I've been recording it some of them are
really<00:00:48.480> freaking<00:00:49.440> hard<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.920> door

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
really freaking hard so that that door

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.080 
really freaking hard so that that door
like<00:00:53.579> way<00:00:53.730> down<00:00:53.879> there<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
like way down there you have to get the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.250 
like way down there you have to get the
actually<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.149> didn't<00:00:57.449> even<00:00:57.570> try<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> jump<00:00:58.140> down

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
actually I didn't even try to jump down

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
actually I didn't even try to jump down
I<00:00:58.320> probably<00:00:58.620> should<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:58.980> tried<00:00:59.219> that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I probably should have tried that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.470 
I probably should have tried that
instead<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.699> running<00:01:00.030> away<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> think

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
instead of just running away but I think

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.950 
instead of just running away but I think
you<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> wait<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.649> come<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
you have to wait to come back with the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.590 
you have to wait to come back with the
zipline<00:01:04.040> which<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.159> might<00:01:05.309> already<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.700> maybe

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
zipline which I might already have maybe

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200 
zipline which I might already have maybe
