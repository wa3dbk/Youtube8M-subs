00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
things and sometimes when you're

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.679 
things and sometimes when you're
starting<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.670> even<00:01:47.939> know<00:01:48.210> what

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
starting this you don't even know what

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.910 
starting this you don't even know what
you<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.590> don't<00:01:49.740> know<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you don't know so you don't know the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
you don't know so you don't know the
questions<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.399> ask<00:01:50.520> absolutely<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.540> mean<00:01:51.720> part

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
questions to ask absolutely I mean part

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.319 
questions to ask absolutely I mean part
of<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.439> mean<00:01:52.670> International<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> huge

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
of it is I mean International is a huge

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
of it is I mean International is a huge
opportunity<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.829> know<00:01:55.979> which<00:01:56.130> countries

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
opportunity but you know which countries

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.740 
opportunity but you know which countries
where<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.909> start<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.360> think<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> lot<00:01:57.719> of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
where do you start I think a lot of

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.700 
where do you start I think a lot of
times<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.229> building<00:01:58.469> those

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
times it's like building those

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
times it's like building those
relationships<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:59.460> may<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.640> someone<00:02:00.630> in

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
relationships there may be someone in

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.270 
relationships there may be someone in
your<00:02:00.960> own<00:02:01.079> home<00:02:01.259> town<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.799> from<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> part<00:02:02.219> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
your own home town this from a part of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.889 
your own home town this from a part of
the<00:02:02.399> world<00:02:02.610> where<00:02:02.790> there's<00:02:03.420> family<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the world where there's family and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.789 
the world where there's family and
friends<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.530> lot<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.680> these

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
friends I think a lot of these

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.740 
friends I think a lot of these
distribution<00:02:05.460> relationships<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.329> sometimes

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
distribution relationships can sometimes

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.779 
distribution relationships can sometimes
to<00:02:06.869> start<00:02:07.140> who<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.099> Network<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
to start who is in that Network and I

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.400 
to start who is in that Network and I
think<00:02:09.179> Steve's<00:02:09.479> comment<00:02:09.929> about<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
think Steve's comment about the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.800 
think Steve's comment about the
Department<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.860> Commerce<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:12.000> gold<00:02:12.629> key

Department of Commerce the gold key

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.580 
Department of Commerce the gold key
program<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.260> actually

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
program it's actually

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.199

relatively inexpensive like for first
time<00:02:15.390> users<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.840> program<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.319> a

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
time users of the program this is a

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.140 
time users of the program this is a

three hundred fifty dollar investment
for<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.750> program<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.200> they<00:02:19.530> can<00:02:19.709> help<00:02:19.920> with

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
for the program and they can help with

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.339 
for the program and they can help with
that<00:02:20.099> matchmaking<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:21.090> distribution<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.930> you

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
that matchmaking in distribution so you

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.780 
that matchmaking in distribution so you
know<00:02:22.440> my<00:02:22.530> general<00:02:22.830> advice<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.190> sort<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.400> start

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
know my general advice is sort of start

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.640 
know my general advice is sort of start
in<00:02:24.000> your<00:02:24.180> network<00:02:24.540> who<00:02:24.780> might<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:24.989> know<00:02:25.319> but

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
in your network who might you know but

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.990 
in your network who might you know but
also<00:02:25.800> some<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.129> these<00:02:26.190> other<00:02:26.400> resources<00:02:26.790> are

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
also some of these other resources are

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.880 
also some of these other resources are
relatively<00:02:27.420> inexpensive<00:02:27.569> are<00:02:28.440> great<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
relatively inexpensive are great and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.500 
relatively inexpensive are great and
maybe<00:02:29.069> find<00:02:29.430> someone<00:02:29.879> who's<00:02:30.060> non-competitive

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
maybe find someone who's non-competitive

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
the chargeback essentially in this

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.550 
the chargeback essentially in this
situation<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> distributor<00:02:54.290> who's<00:02:55.290> getting

the<00:03:04.790> entrepreneurs<00:03:05.790> asking<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.329> question

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
the entrepreneurs asking this question

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.720 
the entrepreneurs asking this question
there's<00:03:07.200> something<00:03:07.470> deeper<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.310> going<00:03:08.610> on

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
there's something deeper that's going on

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.940 
there's something deeper that's going on
there<00:03:09.090> um<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.840> I'm<00:03:09.959> struck<00:03:10.260> by<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.769> not

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
there um that I'm struck by it's not

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.369 
there um that I'm struck by it's not
just<00:03:11.010> about<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:12.269> know<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.660> chargeback

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
just about you know the chargeback

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.690 
just about you know the chargeback
itself<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.069> he's<00:03:14.160> saying<00:03:14.310> it's<00:03:14.459> unauthorized

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
itself and he's saying it's unauthorized

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.640 
itself and he's saying it's unauthorized
but<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.209> think<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.450> gets<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> deeper<00:03:16.079> like<00:03:16.470> who

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
but I think it gets to a deeper like who

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.080 
but I think it gets to a deeper like who
is<00:03:16.680> your<00:03:16.950> distributor<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.549> think<00:03:17.700> if<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.910> have

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
is your distributor I think if you have

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.059 
is your distributor I think if you have
that<00:03:18.299> right<00:03:18.329> relationship<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.319> the

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
that right relationship with the

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.490 
that right relationship with the
distributor<00:03:20.989> because<00:03:21.989> there's<00:03:22.260> going<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.440> be

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
distributor because there's going to be

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.960 
distributor because there's going to be
things<00:03:22.680> along<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.130> way<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.489> don't<00:03:23.639> know

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
things along the way and you don't know

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.580 
things along the way and you don't know
when<00:03:24.299> you're<00:03:24.450> selling<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.780> product<00:03:24.989> why<00:03:25.350> that

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
when you're selling a product why that

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.860 
when you're selling a product why that
chargeback<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.250> happening<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:27.389> broken

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
chargeback is happening is it a broken

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.319 
chargeback is happening is it a broken
product<00:03:28.709> is<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.069> is<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:29.549> something<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.209> was

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
product is it is it's something that was

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.509 
product is it is it's something that was
defective<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.620> think<00:03:31.709> what<00:03:32.069> he's<00:03:32.340> getting

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
defective so I think what he's getting

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.979 
defective so I think what he's getting
at<00:03:32.760> there<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.180> sort<00:03:33.389> of<00:03:33.420> broader<00:03:33.720> than<00:03:33.840> just

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
at there is sort of broader than just

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.900 
at there is sort of broader than just
the<00:03:34.410> chargeback<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.190> unauthorized<00:03:35.670> charge

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
the chargeback the unauthorized charge

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.220 
the chargeback the unauthorized charge
back<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.359> kind<00:03:36.599> of<00:03:36.690> what's<00:03:36.870> going<00:03:37.019> on<00:03:37.139> with

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
back and kind of what's going on with

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.780 
back and kind of what's going on with
the<00:03:37.319> relationship<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:38.099> looks<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.400> what<00:03:38.670> it's

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the relationship it looks like what it's

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.879 
the relationship it looks like what it's
getting<00:03:38.940> down<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.540> trust<00:03:39.959> right<00:03:40.590> Steve

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
getting down to is trust right Steve

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.089 
getting down to is trust right Steve

it's interesting Steve that she says as

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.200 
it's interesting Steve that she says as
a<00:04:55.680> company<00:04:56.099> that<00:04:56.250> has<00:04:56.400> no<00:04:56.580> investors<00:04:57.000> because

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
a company that has no investors because

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.480 
a company that has no investors because
it<00:04:57.539> doesn't<00:04:57.960> necessarily<00:04:58.830> make<00:04:59.009> a<00:04:59.069> difference

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
it doesn't necessarily make a difference

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.310 
it doesn't necessarily make a difference
at<00:04:59.669> whether<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:00.120> have<00:05:00.270> investors<00:05:00.660> or<00:05:00.840> not<00:05:01.080> you

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
at whether you have investors or not you

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.719 
at whether you have investors or not you
should<00:05:01.349> be<00:05:01.740> having<00:05:02.310> milestones<00:05:03.030> for<00:05:03.120> yourself

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
should be having milestones for yourself

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.670 
should be having milestones for yourself
right<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:05.880> think<00:05:06.180> that's<00:05:06.389> right<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:07.410> one<00:05:07.560> thing

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
right I think that's right the one thing

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.439 
right I think that's right the one thing
I<00:05:07.800> would<00:05:07.949> say<00:05:07.979> about<00:05:08.160> that<00:05:08.580> though<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:08.849> growth

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
I would say about that though is growth

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.110 
I would say about that though is growth
can<00:05:09.930> often<00:05:10.320> lead<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.710> capital<00:05:11.190> need<00:05:11.370> so<00:05:11.970> when

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
can often lead to a capital need so when

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.339 
can often lead to a capital need so when
you<00:05:12.180> think<00:05:12.300> about<00:05:12.419> how<00:05:12.750> you're<00:05:12.990> going<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.169> grow

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
you think about how you're going to grow

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.110 
you think about how you're going to grow
you<00:05:13.410> got<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.710> ask<00:05:14.220> yourself<00:05:14.340> three<00:05:14.759> things

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
you got to ask yourself three things

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.350 
you got to ask yourself three things
what's<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:15.930> going<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.139> cost<00:05:16.169> me<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:17.070> to<00:05:17.820> grow<00:05:18.090> do

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
what's it going to cost me to to grow do

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.510 
what's it going to cost me to to grow do
I<00:05:18.449> need<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.750> hire<00:05:18.930> salespeople<00:05:19.380> am<00:05:19.919> I<00:05:20.310> going<00:05:20.460> to

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
go through online channels are there

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.439 
go through online channels are there
other<00:05:22.530> ways<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:22.919> do<00:05:23.070> that<00:05:23.280> so<00:05:23.789> that's<00:05:24.000> cost

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
other ways to do that so that's cost

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.230 
other ways to do that so that's cost
secondly<00:05:25.380> often<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.340> pricing<00:05:26.909> is<00:05:27.000> going<00:05:27.180> to

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
secondly often the pricing is going to

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.640 
secondly often the pricing is going to
be<00:05:27.360> different<00:05:27.599> based<00:05:27.990> on<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.319> distribution

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
be different based on the distribution

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
you go directly to a client then if you

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:34.670 
you go directly to a client then if you
work<00:05:33.840> through<00:05:34.020> a<00:05:34.080> distributor<00:05:34.229> because

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
work through a distributor because

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.170 
work through a distributor because
there's<00:05:35.009> going<00:05:35.159> to<00:05:35.220> be<00:05:35.280> a<00:05:35.340> margin<00:05:35.789> there<00:05:35.940> and

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
there's going to be a margin there and

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.719 
there's going to be a margin there and
then<00:05:36.690> lastly<00:05:37.050> if<00:05:37.229> you're<00:05:37.349> growing<00:05:37.860> there's<00:05:38.639> a

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
then lastly if you're growing there's a

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.790 
then lastly if you're growing there's a
working<00:05:39.090> capital<00:05:39.330> need<00:05:39.599> protect<00:05:39.990> potentially

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
working capital need protect potentially

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.770 
working capital need protect potentially
because<00:05:41.130> you're<00:05:41.250> going<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.430> have<00:05:41.780> receivables

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
because you're going to have receivables

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.560 
because you're going to have receivables
that<00:05:42.960> build<00:05:43.199> up<00:05:43.349> and<00:05:43.560> that<00:05:44.039> is<00:05:44.280> an<00:05:45.060> important

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
that build up and that is an important

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.570 
that build up and that is an important
area<00:05:45.750> where<00:05:45.990> investment<00:05:46.500> may<00:05:46.590> come<00:05:46.830> in<00:05:47.009> and

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
area where investment may come in and

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.760 
area where investment may come in and
and<00:05:47.940> Michael<00:05:48.539> how<00:05:48.690> do<00:05:48.750> you<00:05:48.930> think<00:05:49.199> she<00:05:49.380> creates

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
and Michael how do you think she creates

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.709 
and Michael how do you think she creates
these<00:05:50.039> milestones<00:05:50.370> or<00:05:50.820> these<00:05:51.000> goals<00:05:51.360> so<00:05:51.659> she

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
these milestones or these goals so she

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.120 
these milestones or these goals so she
can<00:05:51.930> check<00:05:52.169> them<00:05:52.289> off<00:05:52.440> or<00:05:52.650> at<00:05:52.770> least<00:05:52.919> have

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
can check them off or at least have

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.680 
can check them off or at least have
something<00:05:53.310> to<00:05:53.490> benchmark<00:05:54.030> her<00:05:54.120> cell<00:05:54.300> phone<00:05:54.449> I

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
something to benchmark her cell phone I

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.959 
something to benchmark her cell phone I
think<00:05:55.500> it's<00:05:55.590> a<00:05:55.650> great<00:05:55.740> question<00:05:55.979> i<00:05:56.250> mean<00:05:56.400> i<00:05:56.610> was

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
think it's a great question i mean i was

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.450 
think it's a great question i mean i was
also<00:05:57.120> struck<00:05:57.479> by<00:05:57.659> as<00:05:58.530> you<00:05:58.979> said<00:05:59.190> you<00:05:59.370> know

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
also struck by as you said you know

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.520 
also struck by as you said you know
she's<00:05:59.669> like<00:05:59.849> I<00:06:00.030> don't<00:06:00.060> have<00:06:00.300> investment<00:06:01.020> that

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
she's like I don't have investment that

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.870 
she's like I don't have investment that
could<00:06:01.620> be<00:06:01.740> a<00:06:01.770> great<00:06:01.949> thing<00:06:02.310> I<00:06:02.430> mean<00:06:02.580> first<00:06:02.759> of

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
could be a great thing I mean first of

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.969 
could be a great thing I mean first of
all<00:06:03.030> many<00:06:03.870> I<00:06:03.960> think<00:06:04.259> entrepreneurs<00:06:04.770> are<00:06:04.889> like

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
all many I think entrepreneurs are like

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.010 
all many I think entrepreneurs are like
hey<00:06:05.159> I<00:06:05.190> need<00:06:05.520> outside<00:06:06.090> investors<00:06:06.509> to<00:06:06.690> do<00:06:06.840> what

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
hey I need outside investors to do what

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.600 
hey I need outside investors to do what
I'm<00:06:07.110> doing<00:06:07.139> and<00:06:07.560> as<00:06:07.860> steve<00:06:08.039> says<00:06:08.159> you<00:06:08.310> may<00:06:08.460> have

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
I'm doing and as steve says you may have

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.249 
I'm doing and as steve says you may have
a<00:06:08.639> capital<00:06:08.969> need<00:06:09.090> along<00:06:09.270> the<00:06:09.389> way<00:06:09.509> but<00:06:09.570> I<00:06:09.930> think

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
a capital need along the way but I think

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:11.600 
a capital need along the way but I think
for<00:06:10.349> somebody<00:06:10.620> that<00:06:10.680> wants<00:06:10.919> to<00:06:10.979> control<00:06:11.370> their

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
for somebody that wants to control their

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.089 
for somebody that wants to control their
business<00:06:12.090> and<00:06:12.780> grow<00:06:13.349> it<00:06:13.500> it<00:06:13.620> may<00:06:13.770> be<00:06:13.830> more

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
business and grow it it may be more

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.760 
business and grow it it may be more
slowly<00:06:14.580> than<00:06:15.000> if<00:06:15.960> you<00:06:16.110> bring<00:06:16.289> in<00:06:16.409> outside

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
slowly than if you bring in outside

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.399 
slowly than if you bring in outside
capital<00:06:17.669> but<00:06:18.240> I<00:06:18.300> think<00:06:18.479> in<00:06:18.570> terms<00:06:18.690> of<00:06:18.870> building

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
capital but I think in terms of building

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.350 
capital but I think in terms of building
that<00:06:19.680> business<00:06:19.800> plan<00:06:20.009> some<00:06:20.580> of<00:06:20.669> this<00:06:20.759> is<00:06:21.030> I

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
that business plan some of this is I

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.700 
that business plan some of this is I
mean<00:06:21.419> she's<00:06:21.659> already<00:06:21.900> sort<00:06:22.199> of<00:06:22.259> probably<00:06:22.590> out
