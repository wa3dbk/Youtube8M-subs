00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
everything's Elda game but I will talk

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.729 
everything's Elda game but I will talk
about<00:02:20.030> one<00:02:20.420> really<00:02:20.989> big<00:02:21.110> history<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.709> I

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
about one really big history that I

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.890 
about one really big history that I
found<00:02:22.040> out<00:02:22.220> about<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.670> game<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.569> fact<00:02:23.840> that

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
found out about this game the fact that

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.190 
found out about this game the fact that
this<00:02:24.200> game<00:02:24.530> was<00:02:25.220> made<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:25.909> link<00:02:26.150> up<00:02:26.299> all<00:02:26.540> legend

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
this game was made to link up all legend

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.099 
this game was made to link up all legend
of<00:02:27.319> zelda<00:02:27.620> games<00:02:27.829> so<00:02:28.610> maybe<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:29.239> guess<00:02:29.870> that's

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
of zelda games so maybe I guess that's

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.740 
of zelda games so maybe I guess that's
why<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.530> zelda<00:02:31.280> terrain<00:02:31.609> inside<00:02:32.180> here<00:02:32.540> is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
why the zelda terrain inside here is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.410 
why the zelda terrain inside here is
very<00:02:33.439> similar<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.849> link<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.299> the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
very similar to that of a link to the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.069 
very similar to that of a link to the
past<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:36.099> probably<00:02:37.099> why<00:02:37.340> all<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.780> maps<00:02:38.780> are

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
past and probably why all the maps are

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.330 
past and probably why all the maps are
very<00:02:39.620> different<00:02:39.950> or<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:41.329> overworld<00:02:41.720> map<00:02:42.340> but

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
very different or the overworld map but

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.430 
very different or the overworld map but
I<00:02:43.370> think<00:02:44.209> that's<00:02:44.359> a<00:02:44.420> really<00:02:44.659> cool<00:02:44.870> thing<00:02:45.109> to<00:02:45.139> do

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
I think that's a really cool thing to do

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.670 
I think that's a really cool thing to do
linking<00:02:45.920> up<00:02:46.040> all<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.430> Zelda<00:02:47.000> games<00:02:47.379> so<00:02:48.379> I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
linking up all the Zelda games so I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.140 
linking up all the Zelda games so I
think<00:02:49.040> they<00:02:49.310> should<00:02:49.459> redo<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.879> because<00:02:50.120> i

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
think they should redo it because i

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.750 
think they should redo it because i
think<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.750> one<00:02:51.019> failed<00:02:51.349> but<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.609> was<00:02:52.700> a

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
think that one failed but that was a

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.309 
think that one failed but that was a
good<00:02:52.879> idea

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.660 

time<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.470> get<00:02:56.590> into<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.920> bad<00:02:57.069> aspects<00:02:57.549> about

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
time to get into the bad aspects about

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.360 
time to get into the bad aspects about
this<00:02:57.940> game<00:02:58.150> oh<00:02:58.390> boy<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.799> main<00:03:00.010> thing<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.220> I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
this game oh boy the main thing that I

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.460 
this game oh boy the main thing that I
really<00:03:00.580> hate<00:03:00.790> what<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:01.030> game<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.470> probably

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
really hate what this game is probably

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.820 
really hate what this game is probably
the<00:03:03.069> item<00:03:03.909> collecting<00:03:04.390> now<00:03:05.080> it's<00:03:05.379> a<00:03:05.440> legend<00:03:05.709> of

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
out items you just go to your inventory

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.880 
out items you just go to your inventory
switch<00:03:10.180> out<00:03:10.360> bombs<00:03:10.750> for<00:03:11.200> arrows<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.769> stuff

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
switch out bombs for arrows and stuff

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.100 
switch out bombs for arrows and stuff
like<00:03:12.099> that<00:03:12.159> but<00:03:12.489> no<00:03:12.700> inside<00:03:13.360> this<00:03:13.569> one<00:03:13.810> if<00:03:13.989> you

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
like that but no inside this one if you

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.350 
like that but no inside this one if you
want<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.349> switch<00:03:14.500> out<00:03:14.680> bombs<00:03:14.920> for<00:03:15.220> arrows<00:03:15.549> you

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
want to switch out bombs for arrows you

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.869 
want to switch out bombs for arrows you
pick<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.200> bombs<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:18.190> drop<00:03:18.519> the

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
pick up the bombs and you drop the

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.850 
pick up the bombs and you drop the
arrows<00:03:19.299> right<00:03:19.810> there<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.319> can<00:03:20.470> only<00:03:20.620> hold

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
arrows right there so you can only hold

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.550 
arrows right there so you can only hold
one<00:03:20.950> item<00:03:21.400> if<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:22.329> need<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.629> bombs<00:03:22.840> again<00:03:23.200> you

have to walk all the way back to where

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.119 
have to walk all the way back to where

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.640 
you drop the bombs on the floor pick
those<00:03:27.400> up<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.879> guess<00:03:28.510> what<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.840> drop<00:03:29.109> your

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
those up and guess what you drop your

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.650 
those up and guess what you drop your
arrows<00:03:30.069> and<00:03:30.220> once<00:03:30.849> you<00:03:31.000> use<00:03:31.120> your<00:03:31.299> problems

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
arrows and once you use your problems

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.880 
arrows and once you use your problems
you<00:03:31.780> find<00:03:32.019> out<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.379> you<00:03:32.470> need<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.709> use<00:03:32.859> your

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
arrows and you would expect it to legend
