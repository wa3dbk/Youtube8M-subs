00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.170
 this one maxime johnson at mobile world 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.170
 barcelona congress with hp slate 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.679
 the first hp android tablet then 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.810
 that the strategy employed by hp here and 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.199
 to have a beer that is affordable so 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.960
 with characteristics that necessarily 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.699
 him are and manage a little bit below the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.710
 average but still with a copy 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.480
 construction that like a jet 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.410
 interesting then it's not the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.750
 the thinnest cabin 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.390
 this one far from the tablet could 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.070
 already as well even a layer and I 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.629
 would say that when it does not subsist is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.390
 in the hands everyone higher 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.760
 for example to those found with the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.039
 nexus is for example so the poti in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.039
 metal throw on thomas who gives this 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.590
 quality print you or if it's 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.390
 a bit it's an intuition the soft touch 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.550
 driving we say things moved 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.440
 which gives a rubber finish theme 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.690
 of the podium the features like 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.600
 I was so close it's very disappointing 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.450
 it's to help cameras so 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.540
 you are basic in a dual processor 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 heart to nine so really legendre that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.180
 that we would have had there maybe two 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.299
 generations we have a screen with a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.909
 resolution of 600 pixels by 1024 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.920
 partial so if again below this 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.009
 of what we will normally find so 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.340
 it's like Thursday and we also forgive 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.869
 andrÃ© landry 24.1 knowledge and not 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.439
 really the most recent version we have 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.090
 some software additions is ok I 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.820
 think among others is the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.780
 ability to print and so 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.530
 native 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.440
 yes also so with radios which one 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.299
 can see it behind so all the the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.340
 sky beats audio threat that is 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.810
 interesting with this waltz its price the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.450
 tablet will be launched in April to 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.759
 $ 169 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.619
 it's little below the nexus 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.690
 who obviously has the quality of 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.580
 components is also below but 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.930
 someone who sings how low I 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.759
 wish it could be interesting 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.930
 see anyway a thing that tall me 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.539
 Sheikh in play 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.430
 I slip but must here with a hand that 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.100
 not all the time expensive as we 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.440
 can see here is not clear me to go 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.720
 far so pretends that it's been going 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.230
 corrected over time but which one 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.370
 will see then there I was just working 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.069
 to be announced following the first 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.319
 android tablet hp is that there will 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.730
 to have others on mask will have 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.620
 others more in their street wins 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.530
 maybe it remains to be seen but in 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.610
 waiting it's this one no more 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.150
 of information I'm going to consult my 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.860
 website 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.580
 maxim johnson in point as bars 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.580
 technical obliques
