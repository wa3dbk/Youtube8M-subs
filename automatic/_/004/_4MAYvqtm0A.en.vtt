 then let's see some 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.989
 here I would say to do so before 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.149
 let's take the telescope that it is 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.680

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.050

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.500
 Yes, yes 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.299
 I don't want everything completely blue 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.239
 Blue go to see the blond from 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.280
 excuse another number what what 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.869

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.580
 look keep doing it as always 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.909
 done and did n't say I'm never too much 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.920
 with lavitola been here here you listen 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.819
 only the director and to me there is no longer 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.560
 read episode I am well back 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:25.659
 in my studies 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.149
 I'll show you how to do with 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.440
 carter while on the valpadana come down 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.049
 first shadows of the evening 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.049
 who is going to start a 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:42.159
 new colossal titanic fantastic 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:44.229
 creative enterprise who anguished by the 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.560
 tremendous task that awaits him seeks 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.770
 comfort embellished exotic infusions who 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.670
 picking up distant sounds from the ether 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 listen to the voices of the world 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.950
 and he the bomber the genius 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.319
 here he is seized with a sure hand 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.030
 very thin sheets of parchment paper 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.250
 here he is sharpening his pencil with his 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.410
 half the tungsten platinum staff 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.750
 iridium here it is poured historically the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.370
 own blood in the sublime name 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.360
 of art nothing can stop it but that 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.550
 It happens 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.510
 let his dazzling be exhausted 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:36.080
 genius is not that the creative ecstasy 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:43.459
 the idea pervades it takes shape genius 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:45.019
 create and stop doing the mantle ahead 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.650
 on show us how to draw from 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.239
 carter no well then if you want the raw 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.799
 reality 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.799
 here's how things went 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.680
 I want to say right away that it's not at all 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.290
 true that to create a new character 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.299
 you must do tests on proofs and drawings 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.359
 on drawings or at least it is not true in the 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.060
 In my case, according to me, a character is born 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.590
 cast in the mind of a designer 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.320
 then it's just a matter of transferring it to the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.299
 paper in the best way 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.060
 bencaster for example I already knew which one 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.220
 it would have been the definitive physiognomy 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.870
 I had some doubts especially about 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.109
 hat a bowler hat 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.299
 no it didn't work much and then purple 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.549
 comments a hat sometimes a lot 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.920
 important for a character serves to 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.740
 get it recognized 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.540
 to better remind us of the hat of 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.920
 nick carter obviously cannot be the 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.319
 sherlock holmes or la cap 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.360
 petrosino bowler hat therefore worth the 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.020
 worth a try and try again until you do 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.020
 you find the right one 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.290
 we want to see how one was 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.290
 populated 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:13.640
 here it is, it seems to me that it works like this 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:17.560
 then go for the dome but this 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.560
 point you need only a few tweaks 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.690
 just grease the stretch a little 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.690
 give more consistency to the design 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.039
 add some shade here and there for 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.539
 increase the sense of relief e 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.539
 complete in essentials 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.949
 the hair a nice pair of mustache and the 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.030
 it's done 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.030
 here is what card
