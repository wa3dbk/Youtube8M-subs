his strength
little<00:03:59.700> notes<00:03:59.960> we<00:04:00.960> did<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.710> very<00:04:02.490> small

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
little notes we did it very small

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.450

because<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.540> don't<00:04:03.750> need<00:04:04.190> every<00:04:05.190> day<00:04:05.400> to

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
because you don't need every day to

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.540 
because you don't need every day to
change<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.240> so<00:04:06.450> it's<00:04:07.410> only<00:04:07.740> when<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.280> change

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
change it so it's only when you change

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.000 
change it so it's only when you change
strings<00:04:08.970> or<00:04:09.420> when<00:04:09.600> you<00:04:09.690> change<00:04:10.010> picking

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
technique or something else and so you

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.630 
technique or something else and so you
have<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.790> chance<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.380> perfect<00:04:17.160> volume

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:46.460 
example I I did reverb only on the high
strings<00:05:31.040> on<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.280> melody<00:05:31.580> strings

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.909 

in<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.920> base<00:05:47.130> I'll<00:05:47.580> Drive

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.969 

so<00:05:53.099> you<00:05:53.159> have<00:05:53.490> a<00:05:53.520> certain<00:05:54.560> the<00:05:55.560> base<00:05:55.770> is<00:05:55.949> very

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
so you have a certain the base is very

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.700 
so you have a certain the base is very
dry<00:05:56.490> and<00:05:56.849> in<00:05:56.939> front<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.810> melody<00:05:58.169> goes<00:05:58.439> all

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
dry and in front the melody goes all

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.980 
dry and in front the melody goes all
around

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
around

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:26.459 
around
you<00:06:01.670> possibilities

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.729 

everybody<00:06:27.469> loves<00:06:27.770> it<00:06:27.919> who<00:06:28.129> saw<00:06:28.370> out<00:06:28.490> here
