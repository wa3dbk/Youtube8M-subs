00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 you have to report is good health how 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.770
 you feel you are in good health I'm missing 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.019
 make a couple more credits but 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.820
 Obviously, I have the medical order 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.920
 when you talked about medication everything 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.480
 I said I want to tell how you state 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.420
 mission medication embroider three kilos 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.080
 you will have noticed 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.560
 everything backwards no but I'm fine and 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.170
 I'm doing things right 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.880
 and that seems to me to be good, not only 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.000
 physically but also psychically 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.580
 I was really going back to therapy 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.129
 is doing me very well that's what 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.920
 to say 60 66 or yes today when I 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.100
 they asked in 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.649
 in the previous one that went to the doctor 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.280
 he told me that I had to go there is no 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.590
 tell me because the doctor said 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.930
 some command 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.780
 and I know 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.060
 there is the possibility there is the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.830
 possibility because it is just the truth is 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.190
 that I'm not a doctor, I do not have the least 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.460
 idea but the thyroid and partisanship that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.370
 I have what happens to me that happens to me 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.250
 from a lot of heart and breathing 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.440
 but they believe that with a medication in 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.240
 a few weeks trino goes away so let's go 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.509
 because 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.820
 I do not want to count on me going to let 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.770
 tell an intimacy but the next 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.320
 rhythm is street pop that is a rhythm 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.810
 of music pretty fast 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.750
 and good nazarene asked to change the subject 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.899
 just to do it with music the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.549
 street dance street with a more rhythm 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.470
 slow also just because of this 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.789
 so that's why I asked the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.259
 producers how did you feel 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.820
 really because we wanted is also 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.799
 take care of yourself and be well no no 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.600
 clearly first I will take care of the 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.069
 mom you see 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.649
 what are the reasons there is 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.420
 gonzalito also barbie is coming 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.460
 of bernarda alba ' 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.619
 but I 'm going to take care of the mother because 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.720
 that's why I'm standing then the health 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.149
 is first but the truth is that 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.369
 doctor said it's all right I'm going 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.799
 well that with the medication that they are me 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.300
 giving I'm going well so let's trust 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.550
 leave so many the truth today we talk 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.140
 of that also obvious that the subject matter 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.180
 you can choose quietly what 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.130
 we want you to be and what and what you can 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.230

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.230
 really say one thing but good that 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.470

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.340
