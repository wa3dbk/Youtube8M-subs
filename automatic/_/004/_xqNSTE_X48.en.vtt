00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
mine right here I think I feel a little

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.090 
mine right here I think I feel a little
flap<00:04:46.240> kind<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:46.750> where<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.020> insert<00:04:47.650> our<00:04:47.830> this

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
flap kind of where the insert our this

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.360 
flap kind of where the insert our this
black<00:04:48.370> insert<00:04:48.760> right<00:04:48.910> here<00:04:50.010> it's<00:04:51.010> kind<00:04:51.250> of

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
black insert right here it's kind of

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.460 
black insert right here it's kind of
stick<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:51.940> out<00:04:52.030> just<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.510> little<00:04:52.540> bit<00:04:52.840> that's

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
stick it out just a little bit that's

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.410 
stick it out just a little bit that's
not<00:04:53.620> too<00:04:53.770> bad<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:54.220> think<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.520> cannot<00:04:54.760> fix<00:04:55.210> that

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
not too bad I think I cannot fix that

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.240 
not too bad I think I cannot fix that
maybe<00:04:55.660> by<00:04:55.810> screwing<00:04:56.470> in<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.770> screws<00:04:56.980> a<00:04:57.010> little

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
maybe by screwing in the screws a little

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.510 
maybe by screwing in the screws a little
bit<00:04:57.340> more<00:04:57.520> but<00:04:58.480> that's<00:04:58.690> just<00:04:58.870> uh<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.520> guess

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
bit more but that's just uh I guess

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.190 
bit more but that's just uh I guess
that's<00:05:00.700> just<00:05:00.760> a<00:05:01.090> little<00:05:01.690> accident<00:05:01.960> but<00:05:02.140> I

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
that's just a little accident but I

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.810 
that's just a little accident but I
don't<00:05:02.380> feel<00:05:02.530> it<00:05:02.650> that<00:05:02.770> much<00:05:02.920> I<00:05:03.160> don't<00:05:03.610> feel<00:05:03.700> at

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
don't feel it that much I don't feel at

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.160 
don't feel it that much I don't feel at
all<00:05:03.940> when<00:05:04.210> I<00:05:04.240> hope<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.540> control<00:05:04.840> it's<00:05:04.990> just

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
all when I hope the control it's just

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.710 
all when I hope the control it's just
that<00:05:05.500> little<00:05:05.770> thing<00:05:06.100> right<00:05:06.280> there<00:05:06.460> so<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.510> just
