00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.530
 also had a family but my 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.060
 question he does not see there they have to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.819
 to be in their house I'm afraid 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.190
 that we can not see them today 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:22.739

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:29.880
 chance rhinoceros jeff teague and groix 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:31.349

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.380
 what was this rhinoceros pebbles 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.530

 rhinoceros baby see of course pebble 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.900
 even very big animals have babies 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.310
 it would be hard to take in our 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.310
 arm but I find it very cute 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.880
 my pet would be fired that otter 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:05.340

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.260
 it's the same family of ours if I have 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.470

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.380

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.310

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.340

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.060

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.180
 Mom to teach him what to do 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.980

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.380

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.299

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.750
 his life that pebbles saw an otter 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.750

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.810
