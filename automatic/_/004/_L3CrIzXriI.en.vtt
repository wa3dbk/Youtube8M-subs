00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.569
 to be 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.480
 used here on the home screen is the 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.359
 device is the show application 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.269
 this app you see here in the 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:28.749
 on the last application in the 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.939
 last line to the right 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.829

 some screen clients will add that 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.510
 this video so you can 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.359
 understand how it sets up but it's okay 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.980
 intuitive the application is simple it does not have 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.060
 no mystery is something i believe 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.829
 that you will have no difficulty in 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.379
 to confirm you may note that there 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:00.280
 in the lower corner in the middle we have three 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.049
 show and death occurs or if it is a 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.780
 option and ropes and spend here the last 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.939
 videos that go to the screenshots that 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.480
 you recorded they will all be being 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.949
 displayed here you have the option to give 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.879
 play here on the inside 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:18.459
 application or save a camera roll 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.500
 also delete more are just 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.269
 information that only the questions 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.139
 frequent website twitter or facebook 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.269
 and the google plus application in some 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.159
 other information here on this page does not 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.250
 there is nothing to configure just by the 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.449
 information that you can view 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.269
 so this is what this was 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:40.599
 tutorial on how to save your screen 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.989
 device is the hides the break but the 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.879
 main intention of this channel is to show 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.750
 some attacks in the clash war of 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.780
 clans 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.729
 I thought I'd do this video first 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.699
 really because I spent hours 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:57.280
 looking for a tutorial like this 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:59.290
 and is a simple and easy to use application 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.469
 I used it, I found it cool to share 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.040
 they as initial video but the first 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:08.049
 This channel's intention is to show you 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.120
 some attacks some strategies that 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.000
 we use war 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.659
 I'm part of the pacaranÃ£ we have 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.340
 currently 88 wins in the war is one 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:21.519
 point that has enough experience but 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.449
 We've been there for almost a year playing clash. 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.000
 of clans 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.230
 We have a lot of stuff to go through. 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.410
 you 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.600
 a record of 16 consecutive wins 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.980
 we lost some victories recently 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.290
 we lost some wars 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.630
 recently we have lost that 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.320
 invincibility are only two 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.950
 consecutive victories this time 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.760
 we are in a war currently one 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.500
 war that will be quite interesting 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.470
 this is our clan we have only one 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.790
 life center 10 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.460
 another new and quite village center 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.710
 updated here we have a 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.190
 culture our corner just climbed center 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.220
 after village is fully complete're 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.590
 fire on everything in the set of life website too 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.320
 are fairly up to date already prepare 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.640
 to go to eight our enemy clan 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.000
 this war will be quite interesting 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.430
 because they have very sure of villa 92 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.230
 town center 10 but they are not well 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.610
 updated as you can see here 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.890
 village center 10 5 is the fifth of the 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.290
 village or right should be the second 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.630
 there but he is not up to date if he feels 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.240
 that typical case that you go up 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:39.430
 center and does not update the other 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:42.040
 things troops and barracks anyway and defense 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.130
 this repeats itself and 62 new village center 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.020
 which are not well updated 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.350
 some individual 8 this war will be well 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.450
 interesting but I'm going to record it here 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.070
 some attacks if you can visualize 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.650
