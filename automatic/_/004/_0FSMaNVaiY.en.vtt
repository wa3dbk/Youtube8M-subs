00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
actually think about it it's almost like

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.020 
actually think about it it's almost like
you<00:03:12.220> know<00:03:12.310> from<00:03:12.489> what<00:03:12.580> I<00:03:12.610> learned<00:03:12.670> from<00:03:12.910> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
you know from what I learned from the

cube method and and like 5x5 and just
all<00:03:17.500> these<00:03:17.680> up<00:03:17.830> an<00:03:17.950> RTS<00:03:18.400> reactive<00:03:19.269> training

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
all these up an RTS reactive training

you can kind of put all this stuff
together<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.380> kind<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.650> see<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.040> matrix<00:03:30.820> of

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
together you kind of see this matrix of

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.270 
together you kind of see this matrix of
stuff<00:03:31.330> which<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.570> kind<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.870> cool<00:03:32.049> but<00:03:32.890> again

his<00:03:38.680> stuff<00:03:38.890> on<00:03:39.040> his<00:03:39.160> training<00:03:39.400> locks<00:03:39.640> are<00:03:39.790> very

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
his stuff on his training locks are very

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.240 
his stuff on his training locks are very
low<00:03:40.299> volume<00:03:40.570> it's<00:03:40.930> not<00:03:41.140> like<00:03:41.620> he'll<00:03:41.769> do<00:03:41.920> like<00:03:42.130> I

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
low volume it's not like he'll do like I

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.400 
low volume it's not like he'll do like I
mean<00:03:42.370> they're<00:03:42.610> big<00:03:42.850> ass<00:03:43.000> numbers<00:03:43.510> like<00:03:43.750> warm

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
mean they're big ass numbers like warm

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.890 
mean they're big ass numbers like warm
up<00:03:44.560> with<00:03:44.739> 225<00:03:45.160> one<00:03:45.549> month<00:03:45.730> with<00:03:45.850> 315<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.810> then

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
up with 225 one month with 315 and then

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.770 
up with 225 one month with 315 and then
you<00:03:47.470> know<00:03:47.530> hit<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:47.769> pause<00:03:48.040> bench<00:03:48.400> for<00:03:48.910> 46<00:03:49.480> and

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
you know hit a pause bench for 46 and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.680 
you know hit a pause bench for 46 and
then<00:03:50.410> pause<00:03:50.799> bench<00:03:51.100> for<00:03:51.400> 75<00:03:51.970> for<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.239> double<00:03:52.570> you

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
then pause bench for 75 for a double you

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.020 
then pause bench for 75 for a double you
know<00:03:52.750> something<00:03:53.110> like<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.530> mean<00:03:53.830> it's

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
know something like that I mean it's

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.009 
know something like that I mean it's
kind<00:03:55.030> of<00:03:55.060> what<00:03:55.180> he<00:03:55.269> does<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.660> then<00:03:55.720> he'll<00:03:55.870> do

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
kind of what he does and then he'll do

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.539 
kind of what he does and then he'll do
it<00:03:56.110> like<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.230> back<00:03:56.470> offset<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.160> then<00:03:57.250> he's<00:03:57.370> done

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
it like a back offset and then he's done

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.220 
it like a back offset and then he's done
and<00:03:58.269> that's<00:03:58.390> what<00:03:58.540> he<00:03:58.630> puts<00:03:58.810> in<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:58.989> training

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
and that's what he puts in this training

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.680 
and that's what he puts in this training
log<00:03:59.489> and<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.610> know<00:04:00.700> same<00:04:00.880> thing<00:04:00.910> with<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.209> Tom

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
Martin if you follow him on YouTube he's

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.979 
Martin if you follow him on YouTube he's
got<00:04:03.340> some<00:04:03.519> similar<00:04:03.790> stuff<00:04:04.030> it's<00:04:04.630> just<00:04:04.870> that

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
got some similar stuff it's just that

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.440 
got some similar stuff it's just that
it's<00:04:05.170> it's<00:04:05.489> relatively<00:04:06.489> low<00:04:06.640> of<00:04:06.910> why<00:04:07.090> when<00:04:07.360> you

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
it's it's relatively low of why when you

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.000 
it's it's relatively low of why when you
read<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:08.049> looks<00:04:08.260> like<00:04:08.410> it's<00:04:08.590> low<00:04:08.739> Vaughn

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
read it it looks like it's low Vaughn

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.259 
read it it looks like it's low Vaughn
but<00:04:09.190> I'm<00:04:09.310> sure<00:04:09.489> there's<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.700> lot<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:09.940> stuff<00:04:10.120> that

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
but I'm sure there's a lot of stuff that

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.270 
but I'm sure there's a lot of stuff that
goes<00:04:10.360> into<00:04:10.600> it<00:04:11.940> okay<00:04:12.940> so<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.860> thing<00:04:15.040> is<00:04:15.070> is

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
goes into it okay so so the thing is is

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.530 
goes into it okay so so the thing is is
that<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.489> got<00:04:15.670> you<00:04:15.910> got<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.359> got<00:04:16.479> the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
that you got you got so you got the

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.909 
that you got you got so you got the
bench<00:04:16.720> day<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:17.320> got<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.500> squat<00:04:17.739> day

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
bench day and you got the squat day

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.110 
bench day and you got the squat day
you're<00:04:18.040> working<00:04:18.280> on<00:04:18.310> low<00:04:18.430> bar<00:04:18.609> back<00:04:18.790> squats

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
you're working on low bar back squats

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
low reps why low reps because you want

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
something that's very close to sorry if

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.340 
something that's very close to sorry if
I<00:04:27.820> said<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.120> wrong<00:04:28.330> but<00:04:28.540> if<00:04:29.050> something<00:04:29.290> is

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
I said that wrong but if something is

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.780 
I said that wrong but if something is
very<00:04:29.440> close<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.950> what<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.100> competition<00:04:30.670> isn't

in<00:04:30.970> powerlifting<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.540> need<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.750> let<00:04:31.990> RIF<00:04:32.170> one

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
in powerlifting you need to let RIF one

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.050 
in powerlifting you need to let RIF one
time<00:04:32.710> it's<00:04:32.980> a<00:04:33.070> one<00:04:33.220> repetition<00:04:33.400> so<00:04:33.910> you're

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
time it's a one repetition so you're

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.360 
time it's a one repetition so you're
practicing<00:04:34.270> sort<00:04:35.020> of<00:04:35.110> in<00:04:35.230> that<00:04:35.380> style<00:04:35.740> which

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
practicing sort of in that style which

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.500 
practicing sort of in that style which
means<00:04:36.610> you're<00:04:36.730> not<00:04:36.820> going<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.030> be<00:04:37.120> doing<00:04:37.270> like

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
means you're not going to be doing like

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.420

deadlifts on Monday sorry from all over

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.300 
deadlifts on Monday sorry from all over
the<00:06:04.870> place<00:06:04.990> but<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.170> idea<00:06:05.440> is<00:06:05.530> that<00:06:05.590> his

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
the place but the idea is that his

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.950 
the place but the idea is that his
program<00:06:06.610> kind<00:06:06.910> of<00:06:06.970> encompasses<00:06:07.540> all<00:06:07.720> the

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
program kind of encompasses all the

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.440 
program kind of encompasses all the
weaknesses<00:06:08.380> of<00:06:08.970> basically<00:06:09.970> the<00:06:10.030> strengths

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
weaknesses of basically the strengths

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.820 
weaknesses of basically the strengths
that<00:06:10.540> are<00:06:10.600> necessary<00:06:11.050> for<00:06:11.140> a<00:06:11.320> raw<00:06:11.500> power

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
that are necessary for a raw power

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.500 
that are necessary for a raw power
lifter<00:06:12.280> and<00:06:12.310> it<00:06:12.520> really<00:06:12.820> does<00:06:12.970> make<00:06:13.210> a<00:06:13.240> lot<00:06:13.450> of

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
lifter and it really does make a lot of

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.990 
lifter and it really does make a lot of
sense<00:06:13.750> and<00:06:13.960> I<00:06:13.990> do<00:06:14.050> like<00:06:14.320> the<00:06:14.440> program<00:06:14.910> one<00:06:15.910> of

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
sense and I do like the program one of

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.100 
sense and I do like the program one of
the<00:06:16.060> reasons<00:06:16.300> why<00:06:16.390> I<00:06:16.420> steered<00:06:16.810> away<00:06:16.900> from

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
the reasons why I steered away from

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.450 
the reasons why I steered away from
doing<00:06:17.350> it<00:06:17.440> was<00:06:17.560> because<00:06:17.710> I've<00:06:18.070> been<00:06:18.220> having

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
doing it was because I've been having

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.890 
doing it was because I've been having
trouble<00:06:18.580> with<00:06:18.730> ankle<00:06:19.060> mobility<00:06:19.150> and<00:06:19.720> I<00:06:19.750> would

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
trouble with ankle mobility and I would

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.020 
trouble with ankle mobility and I would
try<00:06:19.990> to<00:06:20.020> force<00:06:20.350> it<00:06:20.500> with<00:06:20.710> front<00:06:20.950> squats<00:06:21.220> and<00:06:21.490> it

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
try to force it with front squats and it

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.970 
try to force it with front squats and it
was<00:06:22.150> giving<00:06:22.420> me<00:06:22.510> any<00:06:22.690> knee<00:06:22.990> issues<00:06:23.020> I<00:06:23.680> hope<00:06:23.800> the

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
was giving me any knee issues I hope the

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.700 
was giving me any knee issues I hope the
truth<00:06:24.160> is<00:06:24.310> I<00:06:24.400> just<00:06:24.550> haven't<00:06:24.760> built<00:06:24.910> that<00:06:25.120> I

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
truth is I just haven't built that I

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.380 
truth is I just haven't built that I
haven't<00:06:26.710> put<00:06:26.830> enough<00:06:26.860> time<00:06:27.670> and<00:06:27.850> effort<00:06:28.240> and

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
haven't put enough time and effort and

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.480 
haven't put enough time and effort and
skill<00:06:29.140> and<00:06:29.290> ability<00:06:29.740> and<00:06:29.770> strength<00:06:30.130> and

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
skill and ability and strength and

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.250 
skill and ability and strength and
mobility<00:06:30.580> work<00:06:31.060> after<00:06:31.330> being<00:06:31.510> able<00:06:31.660> to<00:06:31.840> squat

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
mobility work after being able to squat

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.410 
mobility work after being able to squat
well<00:06:32.710> because<00:06:33.430> every<00:06:33.640> time<00:06:33.730> I<00:06:33.850> push<00:06:34.090> squat<00:06:34.390> I

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.420 
well because every time I push squat I

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.270 
well because every time I push squat I
get<00:06:34.600> hurt<00:06:34.840> so<00:06:35.110> it's<00:06:35.230> kind<00:06:35.380> of<00:06:35.410> like<00:06:35.500> you<00:06:36.160> know

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
get hurt so it's kind of like you know

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.680 
get hurt so it's kind of like you know
those<00:06:36.520> things<00:06:36.640> to<00:06:36.820> consider<00:06:37.150> so<00:06:37.360> sending<00:06:37.540> with

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
those things to consider so sending with

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.840 
those things to consider so sending with
a<00:06:37.720> front<00:06:37.930> squat<00:06:38.020> you<00:06:38.200> got<00:06:38.350> to<00:06:38.470> build<00:06:38.590> the<00:06:38.800> skill

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
a front squat you got to build the skill

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.250 
a front squat you got to build the skill
and<00:06:40.420> that's<00:06:40.570> kind<00:06:40.720> of<00:06:40.750> how<00:06:40.840> he<00:06:40.870> views<00:06:40.990> it

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
and that's kind of how he views it

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.390 
and that's kind of how he views it
you're<00:06:41.590> building<00:06:41.770> skill<00:06:42.130> and<00:06:42.310> you're

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
you're building skill and you're

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.040 
you're building skill and you're
building<00:06:42.670> strength<00:06:42.970> you<00:06:43.630> know<00:06:43.750> like<00:06:43.930> this

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
building strength you know like this

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.900 
building strength you know like this
program<00:06:44.350> that<00:06:44.740> he<00:06:44.860> has<00:06:45.070> is<00:06:45.340> not<00:06:45.460> really<00:06:45.760> for

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
program that he has is not really for

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.160 
program that he has is not really for
everyone<00:06:46.210> because<00:06:46.360> you<00:06:46.540> got<00:06:46.690> to<00:06:46.780> have<00:06:46.930> a<00:06:46.960> lot

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
everyone because you got to have a lot

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.390 
everyone because you got to have a lot
of<00:06:47.200> strength<00:06:47.590> and<00:06:47.800> you<00:06:47.860> got<00:06:47.980> to<00:06:48.100> have<00:06:48.190> a<00:06:48.220> good

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
of strength and you got to have a good

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.400 
of strength and you got to have a good
base<00:06:48.610> all<00:06:49.120> the<00:06:49.180> stuff<00:06:49.930> that<00:06:50.050> he<00:06:50.140> did<00:06:50.260> in<00:06:50.350> the

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
base all the stuff that he did in the

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.470 
base all the stuff that he did in the
past<00:06:50.590> like<00:06:50.890> Olympic<00:06:51.370> weightlifting<00:06:51.880> he<00:06:52.300> did<00:06:52.450> a

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
past like Olympic weightlifting he did a

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.700 
past like Olympic weightlifting he did a
lot<00:06:52.570> some<00:06:52.870> Olympic<00:06:53.200> weightlifting<00:06:53.560> in<00:06:53.650> the

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
lot some Olympic weightlifting in the

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.200 
lot some Olympic weightlifting in the
past<00:06:53.920> and<00:06:54.040> he<00:06:54.100> also<00:06:54.220> did<00:06:54.490> a<00:06:54.700> lot<00:06:54.940> of<00:06:55.000> body

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
past and he also did a lot of body

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.580 
past and he also did a lot of body
building<00:06:55.510> stuff<00:06:55.750> and<00:06:55.960> because<00:06:56.260> of<00:06:56.290> that<00:06:56.440> he's

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
building stuff and because of that he's

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.110 
building stuff and because of that he's
had<00:06:56.710> this<00:06:56.800> really<00:06:57.100> good<00:06:57.280> base<00:06:57.460> of<00:06:57.640> strength<00:06:57.940> so

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
had this really good base of strength so

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.460 
had this really good base of strength so
when<00:06:58.180> he<00:06:58.300> did<00:06:58.450> this<00:06:58.570> program<00:06:58.810> he's<00:06:59.140> able<00:06:59.290> to

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470 
when he did this program he's able to

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.710 
when he did this program he's able to
kind<00:06:59.650> of<00:06:59.770> encompass<00:07:00.190> everything<00:07:00.430> he<00:07:00.640> needs<00:07:00.910> so

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
kind of encompass everything he needs so

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.450 
kind of encompass everything he needs so
anyway<00:07:02.470> those<00:07:02.560> are<00:07:02.620> some<00:07:02.860> thoughts<00:07:03.010> if<00:07:03.340> you

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
anyway those are some thoughts if you

anyway those are some thoughts if you
want<00:07:03.670> to<00:07:03.790> get<00:07:03.970> that<00:07:04.150> kind<00:07:04.330> of<00:07:04.360> the<00:07:04.480> written
