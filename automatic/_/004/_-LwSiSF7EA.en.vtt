00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:19.050
 Paraguay and Argentina 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.650
 while Honduras was a poorer politician and others with problems of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.390
 injuries 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.689
 starting with david suazo his star 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.769

 we have seen the first two for chile for matías fernández and vidal 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.470
 the classification phase 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.280

 Honduran 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.800
 espinoza 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.130
 he hit it with intention but the leather hits in a defense and to the corner 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
 in the 34th comes the only goal of the game possessed 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.550
 0 to 1 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.800
 it's good 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.430
 the inner ball for island 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.580
 there we have it and the center chut ends up taking the goalkeeper and above all 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.670
 the defense 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.270
 Boselli was ahead 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.480
 to mendoza 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.480
 the defender who gets to touch the ball 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.830
 would have a couple more chances if in the first act 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.930
 I will be counterattack the villa pass paralysis 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.340
 he clipped today the eye ball shot because he hit the follow hand 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
 we see it in the repetition 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.780
 and the last of the first time that the free live there we had ramón 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.590

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.600
 Chilean 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.729
 the second half started with a possible level penalty 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.080
 the referee who did not whistle or miss 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.180
 many doubts will leave repetition 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.679
 another one for chile that dominated and from time to time it came with danger 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.200
 got alexis sanchez 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.740
 good pass from valdivia but crossed too much old trade tabares 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:18.429
 attention the paradón de valladares figure to avoid the second one of chile 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.429
 after the header to ponce's pleasure 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.739

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.189
 dominated he was looking for the second 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.189
 he tried with that shot from the front of vidal 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.619
 alexis sanchez takes it with his hand and we can both stay so much 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:40.929
 valdivia 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:44.169
 minute 75 was the last occasion 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.260
 for this match that dominated Chile beat the selection of marcelo
