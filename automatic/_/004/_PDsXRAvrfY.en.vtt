 to open the marker 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.909
 in an individual action after the evil 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.220
 damián's clearance has gone well look for that 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.799
 is the one who sends the ball to messi 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.189
 stir and despite being surrounded by 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.159
 five elche players just checking 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.119
 in the 41st minute shortly after the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.119

 shortly before rest 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.690
 the elche launched the foul without 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.879
 consequences to the goal of 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.790
 claudio bravo by the way the goalkeeper 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.610
 Chilean did not have to stop with his hands 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.040
 not a single shot of milk only intervened 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.159
 with the foots 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.299
 the barca played the whole second half with 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:52.930
 10 players and when he started dying he scored 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:56.409
 his goal the assistance is rakitic 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.540
 die the haddad and took advantage of that 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.420
 defense was advanced 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.469
 and if they go from rakitic to mark the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.469
 second goal of the night 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.560
 once again the repetition of the goal of 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.650
 unite highlighted in the preseason today 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.170
 owner even ahead of pedro that 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.720
 entered the second part this is a 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.370
 Messi's play that ends with the goal 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.379
 messi leave you room to maneuver 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.870
 and coming from the right as he 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.549
 Like just beating once again 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.500
 elche goalkeeper the pass of alves and there 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.020
 the action of months 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.660
 to find the hole until the 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.220
 finds the third arrived in the minute 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.220
 17 of the second part 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:55.159
 from that moment 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.159
 changes for example the one of pedro to unite 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.300
 die was 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.260
 playing some games with the subsidiary 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.780
 last season in second division 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.480
 but it comes practically from the juvenile 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.190
 is 18 years old this is a play 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.490
 individual of Pedro that ends as a 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.490
 threw 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.310
 what would have meant the fourth goal 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.910
 another action of attack of the barça with a 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.120
 intervention of emesis and other arrival of 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.120
 Pedro 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.740
 Barca could more broadly thrashing 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.510
 milk that could do nothing in this first 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.890
 league match at camp nou al 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:45.360
