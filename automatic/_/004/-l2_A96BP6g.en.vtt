00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.550
 hello guys welcome your former official 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.500
 as often happens for some time 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.089
 we make videos every other day 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.279
 no today is the day there is therefore vi 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.380
 peck another video go fantastic but 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.449
 the novelty is that it is not about 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.850
 battlefield 4 but of battlefield 3 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.580
 hernan I know very well I see the clips 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.650
 I am a ten-year player in 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.029
 battlefield I know the memory saga not 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.460
 say obvious things 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 I'm sorry, oh well, maybe what I don't 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.000
 he knows that he misses fitr and oh well 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.219
 anyway just study trino boys not 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.460
 I don't even say that this game is 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.920
 fucking fun was re love 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.890
 because we've already had sex beating 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.860
 on the 3rd magazine because of course 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.649
 if we were already caught in another life 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.870
 guys this game is too good though 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.329
 But there'll spit out today 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.579
 battlefield 3 versus battlefield 4 not 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.379
 I really want to do it but I'll tell you about 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.920
 the more you do it, you do it yourself 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.220
 comments 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.680
 that is, spit out those 4 5 things 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.590
 those reasons that make you say to 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.200
 this is a fps cabbage that I enjoy 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.970
 that makes me stand here nailed I think 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.189
 at 7 he called me a mother because there is the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.159
 chicken ready for dinner no I can't but I have to 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.549
 my rush on the bazaar ended and no one knows 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.400
 never 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.590
 there's the reason why guys tell me 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.150
 I tried to explain something to you 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.040
 guys when I told you about the beta 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.990
 by ar from nokia will have followed the videos 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.759
 will know what I'm talking about often ho 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.290
 made of battlefield comparisons 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.990
 hardline and battlefield 3 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.700
 but above all of bf3 bf 4 making you 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.340
 understand how the map structure 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.670
 completely different from there it can 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.460
 then come our fun 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.890
 splitting all that sure is a cool 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.590
 what is missing battlefield 4 no 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.590
 the lex but how much heck but you 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.270
 you're battlefield find ex instead vi 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.040
 I say what I missed returning to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.960
 well, meanwhile, the whole speech 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.229
 on the assists of the girls you have in 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.910
 battlefield four above 70 to 75 in 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.170
 about to assist and take the eagle too 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.330
 you from this is something that i 'm sorry 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.490
 I mean he didn't mind I didn't 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.459
 have it battlefield 3 for what the hell you do 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.380
 ss 99 and if you find yourself abf 4 to receive 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.140
 the kelly and instead no oh well they are small 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.459
 But let's say that the complete game 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.200
 play that in my opinion was really 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.780
 one generated as much as an extra guide in 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.220
 fan does not detract from anyone I want 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.940
 say add to the maximum 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.700
 another thing that is not there in bf3 is all 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.160
 the management instead of pop 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.500
 ok in battlefield 4 you can manage the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.880
 four even when you are aiming at 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.760
 substance is this is a fantastic thing 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.590
 or better if you change it it also changes 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.540
 the one i naming downside then when 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.330
 targeted in battlefield 3 this thing not 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.310
 unfortunately it does not exist and therefore exists 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.950
 change the size of what 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.380
 see why in the end the recall 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.180
 control is all a game of dimensions 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.709
 ok sensitivity let me a moment 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.100
 it has nothing to do with it 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.600
 so much so that the 80 we do 85 and 90 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.459
 even per cent of the players who played 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.590
 competitive both Italian and foreign a 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.269
 battlefield 3 did not have the resolution 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.670
 native of the motor because I assure you that 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.410
 all have full hd monitors 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.120
 the resolution climbed for a 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.630
 question of me I am better at 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.010
 check in ass at 1200 80 x 720's is 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.430
 that other one for example there is a la 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.799
 1300 and 60 77 68 was one of the sick the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.200
 first to put it so much that I don't shoot 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.549
 now as in the first part so this 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.340
 trained but also for these reasons 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.049
 because before if I played the game all for 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.090
 check perfection shoots of 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.620
 laser from afar therefore those few who 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.070
 they know my old channel where 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.130
 sometimes varial 34 games and those 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.049
 five skirmishers see not to do 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.060
 compare are good guys 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.760
 I leave you with the clips you passed me 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.950
 sanctum sanctum my famous friend 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.500
 Swedish we also played with 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.239
 battlefield 3 competitions and is doing 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.069
 verses if I will lower the clips 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.240
 in my opinion from fear that is if you leave the 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.490
 videos will now rise 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.040
 I don't know what but here you don't deserve anymore 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.750
 daisy write you do so i put it there 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.910
 some music we hope this time the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.790
 music not of life as it used to be 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.520
 no kids if you think it appropriate or 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.170
 better if you like let's say so I can 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.820
 make videos on battlefield 3 not 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.130
 I make effort admit but why me 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.320
 I also enjoy playing with it a lot 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.640
 make video tutorials maybe doing 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.590
 of comparisons considering that I made believe 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.750
 all on battlefield 4 maybe we can 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.490
 say see this thing goes well beats the 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.140
 film 4 this other noemi and federe va beh 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.060
 in short, you have understood if you go away 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.430
 I am willing to make videos also on 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.260

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.890
