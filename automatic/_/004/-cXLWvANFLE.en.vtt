00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.630
 with the number 16 onwards plus the 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.220
 goal appears the south korea flag 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.400
 in the stadium when it is zero 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.400
 because 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:27.760
 it's really not that it's okay because the 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:31.720
 girls that I heard what I said 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.890
 north was on the roof on the screen 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.890
 stadium television 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.389
 the reason is to bother 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.399
 they say they even believe that he went to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.399
 purpose 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.140
 very important here is true this 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.330
 mistake to represent these 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.259
 guys that when they return to their homeland 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.259
 hang them 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:27.500
 what is the role of the game the many but 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.500
 they are also making a pancho 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.370
 [Applause] 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.159
 from Mexico 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.270
 it is a mistake of the organizing committee and 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.270
 surely they are going to run there 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.370
 of that they leave 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:09.140
 offended players to forgive a 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:09.140
 excess of Palestinian dictatorial regime 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.980
 if he was if they were so offended 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.130
 because they left because it offers a 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.130
 night 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.820
 Of course it's a hot dog 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.970
 someone checked yes clear then to 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.970
 what 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.780
 because there are two drinks in the world too 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.190
 conflicts and efforts to serious science 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.480
 the only thing that could solve the matter 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.480
 it was foxx and it was not present 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.960
 and elongated without being an expert in is like you 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.450
 but there have been many approaches 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:19.080
 also in the last months or years not 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.080
 is that I 'm going to put another example out 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.060
 argentina the argentinas or the 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.170
 Colombians of today and the and is wrong 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.540
 has the place of the flag of 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.560
 colombia put the flag of paraguay 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.560
 I swear they do not make any problem 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:44.430
 me what I insist once the ladies 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.740
 and their dictator chiefs who are 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.480
 sending this delegation because they say 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.220
 we speak that they are parading and charging 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:58.310
 because it is a country with a dictator 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:05.110
 terrible that they offered to the dictator 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.110
 that all 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.200
 the olympic games 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.910
 they tried approaching and they will parade 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.910
 together and that did not happen 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.520
 if an offense is so serious 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:15.430
 and a great duel and people who do not 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.430
 he demonstrated in public a strong duel 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.779
 [Music] 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:29.870
 poor country please disqualify 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:33.110
 selection because someone's mistake does not 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.599
 justify so that taking or after 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.879
 many days and counters I take back that 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:42.949
 phrase of the great pÃ©triz in you are one 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:46.639
 true is something that turns out to be almost 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:49.219
 impossible to know think about it sold the 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:53.439
 widespread the ladies and their bosses 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:53.439
 with a brain in your hands 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.879
 and they decide to withdraw from the field if 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:03.369
 since he convinced them of course 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.369
 There was negotiation I mentioned this we know 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.649
 where are the people from the delegation 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.999
 Korean 

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:16.759
 and these two guys talk and talk and talk 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:18.589
 and he said not to talk about talking and I what 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.749
 I say is that it happens in these four 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:22.339
 it's also operational ebit leave for 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:24.870
 that is lent to the party we do not have to 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:33.500
 be here with you 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:33.500
 and I believe that this is the truth 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.750
 mexico its participation in the games 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.750
 olympics with football
