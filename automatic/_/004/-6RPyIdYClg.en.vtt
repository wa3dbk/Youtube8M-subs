00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 on the road of the trace between 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.140
 fort-de-france and red dull 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.280
 visitors to the balata garden are 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:16.199
 welcomed by hummingbirds creation 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.240
 from the garden started in 1982 jean philippe 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.779
 toews tells us the history of the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.369
 property these properties are completed 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.400
 that my father bought during the war 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.990
 so as to feed his family afterwards 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.900
 she was bought by the grandmother 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.649
 who left it to his mother and I 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.420
 bought to make this garden I 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.190
 flowers already doing it in the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.829
 first time and then it was the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.020
 flowers were decimated by two sites 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.940
 the man is excessive what makes that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.879
 the owner stayed ten years 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.100
 abandoned and when I put them back there 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.020
 is for my mother to sell the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.300
 land and house because nobody 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.100
 no more grenet I rediscovered the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.680
 site and I decided to make it my 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.320
 garden 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.290
 and then guides us into his kingdom 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.860
 of trees and flowers 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.200
 the sica alley 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.870
 then the bromeliads of the plants 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.980
 epiphytes that grows in the ground or 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.680
 on a support 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.410
 gold here we are in an area that is a 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.660
 young bromeliads the chick and a 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.060
 rom is bound it's for example a beautiful 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.770
 advantage of this kind of plants that is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.229
 a plant essentially to the south 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.910
 american there are cold and you are in 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.790
 African only on the three thousand 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.990
 and some varieties exist but this 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.960
 are the plans they do not need 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.680
 necessarily to live from root and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.979
 if you see well they are simply 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.360
 nailed or tied on a stand and she 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.220
 naturally develops at a 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.340
 condition is that she is in 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.070
 permanence of the water inside the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.300
 plant so to a variety that 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.460
 Martinique but which is practically 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.320
 way of disappearing in the wild the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.149
 nature we find practically more 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.310
 I was lucky to find 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.170
 a few more shots I brought here 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.940
 unfortunately she is not very 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.890
 beautiful foliage by cons at the front 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.050
 super flower not that's what's called 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.850
 the son of ficus strangler usually 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.100
 the seed of emotion and trees or on 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.110
 something else and then they develop 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.200
 small roots that then 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.030
 wholesalers are welding and in turn 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.799
 completely the tree you have to know 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 that 25 years ago were about when I 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.880
 started this garden the first roots 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.680
 of this art what you see there 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.299
 were not bigger than that and 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.500
 that one he is he haunts 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.950
 he is being english a 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.900
 coconut and coconut and center 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.190
 are not palms are effective 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.060
 as well as enough of its sicav and saw the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.620
 it is a plant that is in principle 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.860
 embryonic if I believe well of 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.840
 of asylum japan who grew here since 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.510
 a very long time that happened like all 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.040
 plants with colonizers who 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.320
 is a plant that grows is very very 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.250
 very well until unfortunately there is a 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.580
 year have this plant catch a disease 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.250
 who is the cochineal 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.180
 kerr has passed and caused damage 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.550
 considerable 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.290
 these are palm trees there is a 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.300
 forty years old I was a little 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.530
 smic had bought in miami and pebbles 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.600
 returned Martinique 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.620
 these were the first of his achievements 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.390
 arrival in Martinique 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.110
 it's a certain felix go the cheese maker 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.150
 characteristics by its spines 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.890
 the accusation the trunk but there you see 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.930
 where it is easily accessible 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.360
 there is no longer why because 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.490
 martinique the cheese maker the tree of 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.690
 wizards it's under this tree that 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.570
 come to do their hexes 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.400
 and they take the thorns that are 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.050
 there to cast lots at people then 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.390
 they take them and the hÃ©rault pic in 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.330
 the street and we went transplanting and the 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.300
 misfortune happens on the person on whom 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.880
 is meant the evil spell so it's for 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.070
 it that here there are more pine while he 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.170
 took twenty years of work and 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.580
 trips around the world for 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.020
 that jean-philippe toews can 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.750
 gather this extraordinary 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.520
 collection of plant trees and 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.209
 flowers 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.340
 here the bakoye or pandanus it's with these 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.970
 fibers that we realize the typical hat 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.260
 martiniquais then over the walk 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.790
 we arrive in the bambouseraie it 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.040
 it's an interesting bamboo because 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.720
 it was that of Andrew Calamus is this 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.410
 bigger wind worries you east 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.630
 and we come here from sri-lanka 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.750
 believe and it's a bamboo that has been 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.050
 reduced 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.090
 in Guyana by mangoes you have to know 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.910
 that when the sister bamboo like that 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.370
 there he is already fully trained under 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.270
 earth and he does that grow 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.440
 like a telescopic antenna it's 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.760
 not a wood is girl because 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.000
 that you have to know that bamboo is a 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.590
 grass that is very very thick and 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.050
 does not know his scientific name but he 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.470
 would seem to be bamboo with 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.760
 who made the rods 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:02.820
 at the time he is he is very reflexive 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.870
 very high and very hard we finish the 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.870
 visit among the flowers 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.920
 his only posture 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.960
 family that the balisiers the heliconias 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.210
 it looks like an architect and a 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.880
 little bit copied on these flowers for 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.380
 build some of these buildings 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.930
 those who live and who will see this film 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.110
 will recognize everyone is ecstatic 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.700
 in front of these extraordinary flowers but he 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.890
 be aware that what you see does not 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.600
 are not the flowers in virtually 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.880
 all the tropical flowers in 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.950
 bracts those who are they are 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.690
 but who have inside all 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.080
 small flowers that often do not 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.450
 do not notice, alas, the flower is this 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.450
 is not it nothing was done randomly 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:49.100
 here the realization of this magical place 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:55.639
 is undoubtedly the work of an artist
