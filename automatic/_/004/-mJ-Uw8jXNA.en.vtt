00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:20.270
 Next is banding but there 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.270
 First of all it is this mask that is important 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.210
 Too loose 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.210
 Don't worry too much 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.110
 Bunt processed day 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.090
 When it comes to such a subject 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.920
 If you forgive me too much 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.879
 This kind of mask 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.300
 Because you may or lose sight of the ball enters the blind spot until 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 Mask 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.220
 Always say when to throw away 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.440
 It is not necessary to throw away the false tap which has been banned 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:59.180
 Everybody is doing a mask at that time 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.100
 The front of my eyes will be blind spots 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.829
 there 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.520
 Though it is bunt processing 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:14.350
 Is it fast or slow for the runner to be in the head ? 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.210
 And it is pitcher first and 3 Lee of allies 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.710
 Defensive ability 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.240
 It is quick if people take it 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.869
 All this must be kept in mind 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.619
 And against the pitcher when bumped 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.619
 Is it Thunder? 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.540
 My people also Some poor people of the defense in the pitcher where Ikeru cut it thigh in a little forest 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.650
 From 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:47.440
 If it's a pitcher, it's a money burn but for this pitcher it's safe first 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:53.470
 Tteyuu three defensive ability to do so was the ally because you need it, such as say first 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:57.940
 Well put in your head, especially if the runner's foot is fast or slow 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.190
 This is where the Tteyuu van door and put the length of the other absolutely head 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:07.670
 So the night before the catcher 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:09.410
 These three bunts are put in the way, but how to take is the same for everyone 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.649
 there 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.870
 High 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.120
 Because is why alive 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.640
 Always mitt 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.270
 In front and behind 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.120
 I went to take with both hands 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.480
 I will not do this even if I stop and follow 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.550
 If you say why and go get it with one hand 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.819
 Since the runner is worrisome 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.999
 Because my eyes are off 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.540
 If you go with both hands will be of whether sticks Canadian woman 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:40.380
 The problem is the one who rolled over here 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.660
 Ozutsumi in this area 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.470
 It is only the band that did 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.380
 Straight position 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.659
 Butt 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.770
 Back 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:57.270
 I will be a school I do not do 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.990
 And this is also the opposite guards here 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:06.860
 Cover with both hands 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:09.160
 So for this part of the exercise just put in mind that the direction is slightly reversed 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.160
 Please give me
