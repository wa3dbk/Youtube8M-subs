00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello, a small flashlight reviewer 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:11.429
 tasman means this he goes blister here 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:15.330
 so here and so here is called 50 meters 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.859
 maximum range of 6 hours of operation 30 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.939
 lumen 05 wata white type diode 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:30.119
 brought back and or less from this side here 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.309
 so here somewhere Russian god that's forgetting 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.079
 aluminum educational building 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.399
 convenient strap itself here and all 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.399
 externally, the flashlight looks like this 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.410
 good enough notch 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.350
 here we have a reflector with a diode 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.470
 I'm going and this flashlight of the year 3 is not 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470
 less 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.510
 why are we setting the focus here 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:14.870
 You can estimate the line thickness 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.870
 than such a serious someone will find 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:25.210
 that's basically possible and so is it 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:30.390
 include like a candle shine with this 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.390
 sides we also have a button 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.450
 here so here it looks like this 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:47.679
 let's see the whole flow here 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.679
 so he goes himself tags 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:06.240
 here we see 060 well, almost all even teach 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:08.369
 somewhere here in the region but 7 that is, as it were, 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.860
 but on a normal battery yes there are 2,700 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.900
 milliamper hours have such a plan with us 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.630
 will work somewhere for a maximum of four 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:24.660
 hours then less so 6 hours is not 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.489
 quite true here well how would that be on 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.160
 maximum brightness to tus so possible 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.080
 nuances 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.080
 next let's see bitch he weighs 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.600
 so without battery 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:57.180
 46 grams sy batteries 70 grams see 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.180
 let's also how it shines 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:16.209
 so here it is shining somewhere now 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.209
 half a meter now set up focus 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.180
 taxi spot let's say now 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.180
 set up 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.840
 somewhere so here 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.750
 that is, as if slightly crooked in my 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.989
 LED is soldered and therefore there are such 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.069
 Here, for example, the nuances are also supra, which 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:49.489
 Obzorchik was next to no dushanu less 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.750
 bright compared to the Chinese other 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:57.260
 somewhere around 50 or they promised us 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:02.290
 Here is the principle of sho This one is less 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.290
 30 bright lumina somewhere I think there is 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.239
 we still have one in the set 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.299
 battery 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.790
 as if the new battery is basically so 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:17.500
 all deliveries good flashlight icons 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.030
 so strong let's say so nice shines 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.079
 I have no complaints about him 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.079
 In principle, all bye
