00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
side so it kind of looks like a rounded

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.970 
side so it kind of looks like a rounded
triangle<00:00:50.990> I'm<00:00:51.990> gonna<00:00:52.140> shoot<00:00:52.380> in<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.680> part<00:00:52.950> so

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
triangle I'm gonna shoot in this part so

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.790 
triangle I'm gonna shoot in this part so
stands<00:00:53.400> out<00:00:53.580> better<00:00:54.170> just<00:00:55.170> put<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> big

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
stands out better just put that big

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.100 
stands out better just put that big
pupil<00:00:56.220> in<00:00:56.310> there<00:00:56.520> she'll<00:00:57.450> be<00:00:57.600> looking<00:00:57.900> back

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
pupil in there she'll be looking back

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.570 
pupil in there she'll be looking back
towards<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.650> viewer<00:00:58.860> so<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.160> gonna<00:00:59.310> draw<00:00:59.520> the

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
some shading and this step for the

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.169 
some shading and this step for the
eyelashes<00:01:07.079> I'm<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.409> gonna<00:01:07.530> draw<00:01:08.149> them<00:01:09.149> like

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
eyelashes I'm just gonna draw them like

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:15.700 
eyelashes I'm just gonna draw them like
this<00:01:10.429> just<00:01:11.429> two<00:01:12.770> onto<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.310> eye<00:01:14.490> so

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
this just two onto the other eye so

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.899 
this just two onto the other eye so
again<00:01:16.710> let's<00:01:17.159> try<00:01:17.929> that<00:01:18.929> triangle<00:01:19.560> shape

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
again let's try that triangle shape

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.130 
again let's try that triangle shape
gonna<00:01:20.909> shade<00:01:21.179> in<00:01:21.329> this<00:01:21.479> part<00:01:23.659> but<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.960> see

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
gonna shade in this part but you can see

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
gonna shade in this part but you can see
this<00:01:25.409> shape<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> little<00:01:26.369> bit<00:01:26.490> more<00:01:26.640> narrow

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
this shape is a little bit more narrow

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.399 
this shape is a little bit more narrow
compared<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.170> farther

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
compared to that because it's farther

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:38.590 
compared to that because it's farther
away

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.170 

okay<00:01:39.409> now<00:01:39.650> we<00:01:39.710> have<00:01:40.010> those<00:01:40.250> little<00:01:40.490> eyelashes
