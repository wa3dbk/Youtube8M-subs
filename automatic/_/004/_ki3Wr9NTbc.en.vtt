00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
you about really whatever doesn't really

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.720 
you about really whatever doesn't really
matter<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.410> finally<00:00:26.189> figured<00:00:26.400> out<00:00:26.670> like

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
matter what I finally figured out like

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.970 
matter what I finally figured out like
how<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.180> get<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.599> perfect<00:00:28.109> not<00:00:28.439> perfect<00:00:28.680> I

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
how to get like perfect not perfect I

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980 
how to get like perfect not perfect I
mean<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.279> could<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> lot<00:00:29.670> better<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.179> um

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
mean it could be a lot better but um

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.470 
mean it could be a lot better but um
decently<00:00:31.890> perfect<00:00:32.430> enough<00:00:32.640> lighting<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.300> me

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
decently perfect enough lighting for me

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.120 
decently perfect enough lighting for me
and<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> webcam<00:00:34.590> link<00:00:34.770> if<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.920> move

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
and like the webcam link if I move

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.889 
and like the webcam link if I move
around<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.540> not<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.809> to

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
around like this like it's not going to

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.150 
around like this like it's not going to
go<00:00:36.989> out<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.290> sync<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.070> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
go out of sync like it's not going to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010 
go out of sync like it's not going to
move<00:00:38.250> around<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.059> gonna<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.480> turn<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
move around it's not gonna like turn the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.200 
move around it's not gonna like turn the
lighting<00:00:40.440> off<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> stuff<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.520> finally

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
lighting off and stuff so I finally

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970 
lighting off and stuff so I finally
found<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.660> what<00:00:42.780> works<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.260> me<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.800> zoomed

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
found out what works for me and I zoomed

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.319 
found out what works for me and I zoomed
in<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.280> bit<00:00:44.579> i<00:00:44.610> mean<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.940> could<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.210> like

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
in a little bit i mean it could be like

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.660 
in a little bit i mean it could be like
this<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:46.469> i<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.190> looks<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.489> this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this but i think when it looks like this

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.970 
this but i think when it looks like this
it<00:00:47.969> looks<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.329> bit<00:00:48.480> better<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.989> today

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
it looks a little bit better so today

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.830 
it looks a little bit better so today
i'm<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> talk<00:00:50.370> about<00:00:50.550> school<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.570> little

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
have a math teacher now if you guys
watch<00:01:02.129> my<00:01:02.309> streams<00:01:02.609> i've<00:01:02.820> ranted<00:01:03.090> about<00:01:03.270> my
