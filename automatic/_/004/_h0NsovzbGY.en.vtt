00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Good day mr. commission will come 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.350
 this is the pre-Christmas minecraft 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.200
 his community 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.240
 I am a giant of the youtube or 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.280
 or public representatives 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.590
 from the form of a community and me 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.199
 Today I hear the latest project from 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.840
 introduce the community and how 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.820
 you certainly already see I read 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.600
 just happened on the prototype 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.849
 an fcb may allow 20 servers here too 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.429
 foot make gold miners dotcom checks 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.800
 Okay, that's okay 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.739
 that we are targeting are ftp server build 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.239
 with 46 lotz what eyes reason has because on 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.730
 the other one does not change that way either 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.079
 many like us at home and that's why 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.719
 We did not think so here 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.989
 directly from the beginning on so many slots 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.210
 frame as it is but also so with 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.949
 could install as many slots as me 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.160
 it works then we would have a few anyway 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.930
 a thousand a few million 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.059
 Well, definitely not too much 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.550
 first single digit range then 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.939
 maybe at the beginning of the double digit 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.150
 scenes and then we'll see 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:12.750
 depending on how much population here 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.549
 The server is so soon as we really 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.350
 realize that it is worth it for us and so 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.960
 slow at the course, but upgrade 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.900
 until then , make yourself there already 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.729
 no guarantors good insurance to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.090
 server how long I will remain the online 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.700
 think that even if we are now 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.400
 hardly any visitors get the server 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.770
 first two months stay online because 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.740
 that is only a test place if 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.870
 the server arrives well then the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.000
 Area 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.520
 completely so either completely online 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.130
 stay because something looks so small 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.740
 ok awful information should be clear from 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.700
 because of 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:02:00.550
 Accessibility with the ftp of the fcb not 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.050
 fdp that a bit wrong fdp wulff 20 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.390
 Beck is reachable what you are 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.640
 again in four zivis can see more clearly 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.430
 as you see here now and I think 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.320
 times that should be so synonymous 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.610
 work okay so I say goodbye 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.890
 me at that time of you I guess I 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.960
 can not teach you anything else 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.700
 if you are interested here 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.100
 I subscribed to the channel or 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.920
 2 on and in other two conversion servers 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.170
 list anyway his new ndr in the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.820
 description for two servers have there 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.160
 could also see which server online 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.540
 it is a new and old well looks 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.340
 such a procedure and see you 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.340
 then again then
