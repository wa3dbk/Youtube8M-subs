what's really going on this mission is

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.979 
what's really going on this mission is
far<00:03:09.980> more<00:03:10.280> than<00:03:10.519> a<00:03:10.609> simple<00:03:10.819> shakedown<00:03:11.420> run<00:03:11.659> I

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
far more than a simple shakedown run I

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.930 
far more than a simple shakedown run I
figured<00:03:12.980> there<00:03:13.159> was<00:03:13.250> something<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.730> weren't

like this it jumped our technology

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.770 
like this it jumped our technology
forward<00:03:45.169> 200<00:03:45.709> years<00:03:45.919> but<00:03:46.819> Eden<00:03:47.150> crime<00:03:47.419> doesn't
