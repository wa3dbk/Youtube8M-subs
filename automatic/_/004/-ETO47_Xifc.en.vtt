human<00:00:58.289> uh<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.660> know<00:01:00.690> he's<00:01:00.899> got<00:01:01.050> no

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
human uh and you know he's got no

campaign<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> run<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.250> he's<00:01:02.520> not<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.239> be

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
campaign to run if he's not going to be

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.210 
campaign to run if he's not going to be
if<00:01:03.690> he's<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.350> harsh<00:01:04.589> criticism

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
if he's going to have harsh criticism

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.000

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and be insulted all the time anyway why

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.580 
and be insulted all the time anyway why
not<00:01:08.040> try<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.939> some<00:01:09.210> fun<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.350> think

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
not try to have some fun and I think

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.140 
not try to have some fun and I think
more<00:01:11.010> importantly<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.460> time<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.909> push<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
more importantly it's time to push the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.810 
more importantly it's time to push the
policies<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:13.110> need<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.189> unpopular

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
policies that we need that are unpopular

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.390 
policies that we need that are unpopular
perhaps<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.409> he<00:01:16.530> doesn't<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.280> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
perhaps and now that he doesn't have to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
perhaps and now that he doesn't have to
worry<00:01:17.580> about<00:01:17.729> elections<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.200> he<00:01:19.530> actually

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
worry about elections or is he actually

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.170 
worry about elections or is he actually
going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> worry<00:01:20.430> about<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:20.820> happens<00:01:21.090> with

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
going to worry about what happens with

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.390 
going to worry about what happens with
the<00:01:21.240> Democrats<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.170> 2016<00:01:23.100> well<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.280> think

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the Democrats in 2016 well I think

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
the Democrats in 2016 well I think
that's<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> more<00:01:24.090> salient<00:01:24.450> question<00:01:24.930> which

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that's the more salient question which

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.520 
that's the more salient question which
is<00:01:25.500> whatever<00:01:25.950> Obama<00:01:26.310> does<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.990> helping<00:01:28.350> or

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
is whatever Obama does is it helping or

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.170 
is whatever Obama does is it helping or
hurting<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.979> positioning<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.640> whoever<00:01:29.939> will

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
hurting the positioning of whoever will

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140 
hurting the positioning of whoever will
be<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> Democratic<00:01:30.570> nominee<00:01:31.070> for<00:01:32.070> 2016<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
be the Democratic nominee for 2016 and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.090 
be the Democratic nominee for 2016 and
even<00:01:33.900> though<00:01:34.020> President<00:01:34.439> Obama<00:01:34.740> does<00:01:34.950> not

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
even though President Obama does not

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.590 
even though President Obama does not
have<00:01:35.280> another<00:01:35.490> campaign<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.180> run<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.479> he

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
have another campaign to run as he

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780 
have another campaign to run as he
repeated<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> few<00:01:37.259> times<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.430> still<00:01:38.759> have

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
repeated a few times now you still have

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
repeated a few times now you still have
to<00:01:39.060> assume<00:01:39.390> he<00:01:39.659> doesn't<00:01:39.990> want<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.530> much<00:01:41.189> of

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
to assume he doesn't want to see much of

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.300 
to assume he doesn't want to see much of
his<00:01:41.549> work<00:01:41.579> undone<00:01:42.390> by<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> Republican<00:01:43.560> being

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
his work undone by a Republican being

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.950 
his work undone by a Republican being
elected<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.759> 2016<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> think

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
elected in 2016 so we have to think

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.200 
elected in 2016 so we have to think
