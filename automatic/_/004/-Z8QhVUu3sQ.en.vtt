 and he is followed by Alejandro Valverde 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 a little fabio 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.970
 but remember the world championship 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.440

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.059

 ulna tremendous explosion that 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.500
 has Rodriguez and has given the experience 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.269
 and now it is accelerating fluvià now in 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.280
 medium and now it's time in something that 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.409
 can not continue 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.400
 with what's happening in the kingdom 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.400
 and Alejandro 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.700
 also that despair 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:33.420
 for now they are four of the three or 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.420
 Fantastic four 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.520

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.750
 Alberto's land counter that does not 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.190
 wants to digest last meters 2 100 to 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.190
 come back from last metro 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.920

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.260
 loser of the stage and maybe new 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.210
 leader shout of the group so also cross 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.400
 Alberto, fourth place 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.460
 for joaquin purito rodríguez nairo 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.390
 quintana but quintana is going to be red 12 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.649
 seconds apart 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.860
 coming back to see me 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.519
 but he starts having his first duel 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.439
 who will definitely be the leader 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.769
 is esteban chávez and crosses the goal 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.900
 also and we're going to look back when 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.739
 the river arrives high if the day arrives 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.739
 reach 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.730
 It is also crossing the goal of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.730
 runners we still do not use it up 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.360
 Alberto accountant and the journalists who 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.420
 the meseguer hour is also desperate 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.280
 making notes the whole end to the moment 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.150
 of the closing has saved for the desire of 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.829
 up eighth stage that wins 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.829
