00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.310 
definitely would not put it like this if
you've<00:02:06.030> got<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.299> switch<00:02:06.570> easy<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.200> you're

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you've got the switch easy and you're

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.469 
you've got the switch easy and you're
putting<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.710> screen<00:02:08.250> forward<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.759> mean<00:02:09.360> that's

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
putting in screen forward I mean that's

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.850 
putting in screen forward I mean that's
loses<00:02:09.959> anything<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.379> bump<00:02:10.619> against

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
loses anything you bump against

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.080 
loses anything you bump against
something<00:02:11.069> that's<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.459> slide<00:02:11.730> out<00:02:11.939> and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
something that's going to slide out and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360 
something that's going to slide out and
fall<00:02:12.269> down<00:02:12.349> so<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.379> would<00:02:13.530> not<00:02:13.709> suggest<00:02:13.920> you

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
fall down so I would not suggest you

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.759 
fall down so I would not suggest you
guys<00:02:14.519> who<00:02:15.330> are<00:02:15.480> going<00:02:15.689> to<00:02:15.750> get<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.200> put<00:02:16.739> a

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
guys who are going to get this put a

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.289 
guys who are going to get this put a
switch<00:02:17.010> easy<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.489> here<00:02:17.610> put<00:02:17.849> something<00:02:18.180> in

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
switch easy in here put something in

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.360 
switch easy in here put something in

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
but if you're putting them face forward

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.970 
but if you're putting them face forward

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
and it slides like this would not

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.809 
and it slides like this would not
recommend<00:02:26.430> you're<00:02:26.580> doing<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.909> like<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:28.819> so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
let's try it with the screen facing you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.860 
let's try it with the screen facing you

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
looks and with this you can twist it up

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.800 
looks and with this you can twist it up
like<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.670> it's<00:03:11.060> not<00:03:11.240> going<00:03:11.420> anywhere<00:03:12.010> um<00:03:13.810> bom

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
like that it's not going anywhere um bom

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.550 
like that it's not going anywhere um bom
that's<00:03:15.230> what<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:15.470> looks<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:16.240> you<00:03:17.240> could<00:03:17.360> even

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
that's what it looks like you could even

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:26.830 
that's what it looks like you could even
probably<00:03:25.030> like<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.060> i<00:03:26.300> was<00:03:26.480> going<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.630> say<00:03:26.690> you

probably like a i was going to say you
probably<00:03:27.170> twist<00:03:27.800> isn't<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:30.290> need<00:03:30.740> to<00:03:30.860> put<00:03:31.190> it

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
probably twist isn't it need to put it

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.190 
probably twist isn't it need to put it
on<00:03:31.340> upside<00:03:31.670> down<00:03:31.850> it's<00:03:32.540> not<00:03:32.660> going<00:03:32.960> anywhere

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
on upside down it's not going anywhere

it's literally that solid that the clip
will<00:03:35.690> come<00:03:35.840> off<00:03:35.990> before<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.470> phone<00:03:36.650> comes<00:03:36.920> out

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
will come off before the phone comes out

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.910 
will come off before the phone comes out
when<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.280> have<00:03:37.460> the<00:03:38.170> screen<00:03:39.170> facing<00:03:39.590> outwards

forgot<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.160> mention<00:03:52.310> that<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.180> clip<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:56.270> clip

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
forgot to mention that the clip the clip

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.590 
forgot to mention that the clip the clip
does<00:03:57.050> have<00:03:57.260> spaces<00:03:57.709> right<00:03:58.550> here<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.570> right

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
does have spaces right here and right

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.920 
does have spaces right here and right
here<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.640> when<00:04:02.330> your<00:04:02.450> phone<00:04:03.250> slides<00:04:04.250> in

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
here so that when your phone slides in

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.230 
here so that when your phone slides in
you<00:04:05.930> can<00:04:06.110> easily<00:04:06.350> access<00:04:07.030> probably<00:04:08.030> not<00:04:08.150> as

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
you can easily access probably not as

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.949 
you can easily access probably not as
easily<00:04:08.420> as<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.660> division<00:04:09.140> sleep<00:04:09.800> wake<00:04:10.130> button

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
easily as you division sleep wake button

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.090 
easily as you division sleep wake button
so<00:04:11.959> if<00:04:12.200> it's<00:04:12.350> like<00:04:12.470> this<00:04:12.650> that's<00:04:12.860> probably

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
so if it's like this that's probably

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.890 
so if it's like this that's probably
