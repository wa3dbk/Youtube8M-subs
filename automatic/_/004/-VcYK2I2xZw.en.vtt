00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
something really interesting look at

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.729 
something really interesting look at
this

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
this

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.049 
this
some<00:00:54.010> of<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.250> guys<00:00:54.430> this<00:00:54.700> looks<00:00:54.940> familiar

some of you guys this looks familiar

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.299 
some of you guys this looks familiar
because<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:56.050> is<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.260> ex<00:00:56.410> of<00:00:56.559> his<00:00:56.739> seat<00:00:56.950> GUI

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
because this is the ex of his seat GUI

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.939 
because this is the ex of his seat GUI
so<00:00:57.850> absolutely<00:00:58.390> good<00:00:58.629> job<00:00:58.870> that<00:00:59.079> motion<00:00:59.620> got

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
so absolutely good job that motion got

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.150 
so absolutely good job that motion got
this<00:01:00.129> over<00:01:00.520> on<00:01:00.640> their<00:01:00.850> on<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.899> tablet<00:01:02.320> PC

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
this over on their on the tablet PC

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.820 
this over on their on the tablet PC
they're<00:01:03.910> still<00:01:04.180> paying<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.600> this<00:01:04.750> most<00:01:05.110> that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
they're still paying of this most that

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.380 
they're still paying of this most that
Windows<00:01:06.670> tablets<00:01:07.180> you<00:01:07.300> either<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.930> can

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
Windows tablets you either you can

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.540 
Windows tablets you either you can
a<00:01:08.450> second<00:01:09.110> quick<00:01:09.350> look<00:01:09.530> around

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
a second quick look around

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.790 
a second quick look around
well<00:01:11.150> I<00:01:11.390> need<00:01:11.720> to<00:01:11.840> tell<00:01:12.050> you<00:01:12.260> but<00:01:12.410> this<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.770> the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
well I need to tell you but this is the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.640 
well I need to tell you but this is the
four<00:01:13.250> point<00:01:14.410> capacitive<00:01:15.410> multi-touch<00:01:15.770> screen

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
four point capacitive multi-touch screen

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.530 
four point capacitive multi-touch screen
here's<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.370> little<00:01:18.490> stylus<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.180> we<00:01:19.300> like

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
here's the little stylus and we like

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.240 
here's the little stylus and we like
this<00:01:19.720> mechanism

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
this mechanism

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.370 
this mechanism
so<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:21.790> don't<00:01:22.000> have<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.480> squeeze<00:01:23.170> it

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
so you don't have to squeeze it

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.550 
so you don't have to squeeze it
somewhere<00:01:23.770> in<00:01:24.160> there<00:01:24.520> so<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.510> just<00:01:25.780> pops<00:01:26.260> out

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
somewhere in there so it just pops out

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.890 
somewhere in there so it just pops out
here<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:28.870> connector<00:01:29.590> over<00:01:29.830> here<00:01:30.010> so<00:01:30.190> I<00:01:30.220> guess

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
here the connector over here so I guess

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.120 
here the connector over here so I guess
that's<00:01:31.900> why<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.140> has<00:01:32.380> also<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.740> docking<00:01:33.100> station

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
that's why it has also a docking station

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.030 
that's why it has also a docking station
that<00:01:33.520> kind<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.880> makes<00:01:34.060> sense<00:01:34.330> right<00:01:34.860> from<00:01:35.860> this

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
that kind of makes sense right from this

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.270 
that kind of makes sense right from this
side<00:01:36.370> we<00:01:36.610> have<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:37.420> couple<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.410> connectors<00:01:38.979> over

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
side we have a couple of connectors over

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.750 
side we have a couple of connectors over
here<00:01:39.510> let's<00:01:40.510> see<00:01:40.750> if<00:01:40.869> I<00:01:40.960> can<00:01:41.200> open<00:01:41.320> this

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
here let's see if I can open this

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:51.140 
here let's see if I can open this
just<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.480> leave<00:01:45.900> ok<00:01:46.900> this

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.780 

just<00:01:51.870> believe<00:01:52.230> me<00:01:52.260> there's<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.770> 41<00:01:53.490> reader

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
just believe me there's a 41 reader

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.170 
just believe me there's a 41 reader
underneath<00:01:54.390> this

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.980 

that's<00:01:58.720> why<00:01:58.900> we're<00:01:59.080> recording<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.740> life

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that's why we're recording it life

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.660 
that's why we're recording it life
so<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.440> not<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.620> only<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.220> our<00:02:02.370> pants

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
so I'm not the only one with our pants

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.609 
so I'm not the only one with our pants
thank<00:02:02.940> God<00:02:03.150> oh<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.450> gotta<00:02:03.659> close<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.170> again<00:02:04.260> I'm

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
thank God oh we gotta close it again I'm

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.840 
thank God oh we gotta close it again I'm
just<00:02:04.830> kidding
