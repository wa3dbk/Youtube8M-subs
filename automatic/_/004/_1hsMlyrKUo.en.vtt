00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.310
 he 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.070
 hi greet everyone tech senate i hope 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.599
 that you're fine so here's in the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 city ​​of sand at the end of what is 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.810
 find our cave 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.220
 so here we are in the terrible 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.899
 watermelon fantomas 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.149
 Well, that's what we called this 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:30.239
 because there are many people 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:33.399
 who have heard of it 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.969
 so yes because in fact there is 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.829
 thirty plan because with that scary 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.589
 finally from there it's true that here it makes a 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.390
 little more scared so here I am you 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.999
 present a little the installation when 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.989
 it is done 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:48.280
 it's true that it takes a bit of 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.219
 work it keeps getting bigger 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.190
 still three to four hours 4 5 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.989
 hours to build all that so well 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.530
 hidden that no one knows 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.920
 coordinates and we have fun doing that there 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.580
 I continue here it continues to push 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.380
 I did not even finish the ball and the 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.120
 plans that are missing so I explain also 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.720
 that I will not do live today 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.840
 I had planned but I was overwhelmed by 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.820
 events to make this great 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.470
 and archer year and planting so the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.020
 shot as you can see these times 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.280
 really really really and it gives 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.480
 a lot of watermelons so there 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.220
 we collected recently so it grows 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.130
 not equal size but here we will put 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.090
 to harvest so I say I do not do any 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.170
 lyme either because there are some 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.050
 many others as I am channels 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.970
 who made friel of the coop team 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.140
 it's true that I do not find it advantageous 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.870
 to do it today 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.640
 especially it's the weekend and you have it 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.110

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.640
 sonatt who just added to the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.430
 list moment I register so here and 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.500
 moreover I have a headache 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.210
 so I will soon make them a 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.700
 break of which I speak a little of the city 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.320
 sand so as you could see 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.180

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.259
 emission on station of etoy that you can 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:13.069
 going to follow that will make me very happy and 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.349
 do not hesitate there is this group 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.810

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.180
 find more easily the city of 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.060
 sables on youtube 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.540
 finally and other platforms and 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.879
 broadcasts that we also do a little bit of 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.730
 blade that two sides finally here I 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.200

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.319
