00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
want to like the most it hard to get but

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.610 
want to like the most it hard to get but
once<00:03:21.579> you<00:03:21.700> get<00:03:21.819> it<00:03:22.030> feels<00:03:22.480> pretty<00:03:22.630> fun<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.139> add

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
once you get it feels pretty fun to add

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.129 
once you get it feels pretty fun to add
it<00:03:23.799> can<00:03:24.639> just<00:03:24.850> stay<00:03:25.060> get<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.569> lock<00:03:25.720> here<00:03:25.959> with

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
it can just stay get the lock here with

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.720 
it can just stay get the lock here with
that<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.530> it's<00:03:26.620> hard<00:03:26.829> to<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.400> kill<00:03:27.579> the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
that and it's hard to like to kill the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.180 
that and it's hard to like to kill the
pain<00:03:27.910> cuz<00:03:28.120> he<00:03:28.239> liked<00:03:28.389> you<00:03:28.569> on<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.810> plane<00:03:29.049> and

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
pain cuz he liked you on the plane and

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.979 
pain cuz he liked you on the plane and
so<00:03:30.190> it's<00:03:30.340> pretty<00:03:30.459> hard<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.790> kill<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.690> kill<00:03:31.870> up

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
so it's pretty hard to kill to kill up

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.449 
so it's pretty hard to kill to kill up
playing<00:03:32.230> on<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.410> clearance<00:03:32.620> or<00:03:32.980> time<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.340> kill
