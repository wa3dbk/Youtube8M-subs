00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 This bad part of going to the gym part 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.810
 good to go to the academy with the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.160

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.050

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.089

 This arouses white curiosity. 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.580
 the fat is the river 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.560
 it does not need to lose weight and 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.640
 probably the only hetero of this group 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.180
 also and generally they are right 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.220
 in the ether part and my nutritionist 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.170

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.420

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.489

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.920

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.080
 the metabolism behind the metabolism that 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.330
 it's only going to be bad for you was a doctor 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.920
 doctor I like to live something and come to 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.600
 All weekend but I can not play 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.420
 with more emphasis on the other we will leave 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.860
 taking the boat you can get the voice Miguel 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.720
 look formal work work I 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.759
 I like to drink something logical that gets in the way. 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.290
 the ford ka also called in the week that 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.240
 been successful in the iron bar in 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.150
 I can not carry a baby in China. 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.040
 when it was my size 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.810
 logic work metabolism was not 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.680
 for a week and tries to lift weight 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.479
 leg press can not stand very nervous not 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.880
 likes to see her meet her 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.100
 It was the doctor I have a theory. 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.380
 another theory that I think has 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.940
 sincere I think not that you drink in the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.670
 Ballad but it's how much you're going to 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.440
 Ballad thinking that you did the week 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.039
 Entirely everything went straight to ballad 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.340
 You have to drink like there's no 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.380
 the tomorrow that always receives as if not 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.270
 there were tomorrow mita law collection 4 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.700
 hours will not enter the body you 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.200
 power very 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.569
 I think it had to be always like this. 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.480
 which always avoids getting out of dinner 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:16.330
 so the process is good the business there and bb 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.810
 bb as if there was no tomorrow and already 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.190
 Always noticed beautiful rice 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.580
 sometimes're not eating rice one more 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.690
 Everyone film though some old 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.230
 look look at the bastard thing tim caroll 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.200

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:40.569

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:54.180

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:54.180
 I face the face or it's 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:09.140
 the man the man and the woman - so 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.480
 different than man to man the man 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.379
 more practical a practice how to do 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.379
 I am feeling bad 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:26.230
 I picked up the woman not the woman when 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:30.069
 She's going to vomit. She needs a friend who 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.069
 hold your hair, eh? 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:48.549
 Calm down, calm down, calm down. 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:11.750
 I can not stop thinking about the group and my friend. 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:16.280
 Who is Bruno the team's girlfriend in 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.919
 series b off the table because the woman she 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.239
 rescues a side of past emotion 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.270
 she wants to take advantage of that moment 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.090
 she is emotional and cause all the emotions 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.220
 ever when discussing with his wife 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.139
 she says earth a thing back there 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.880
 so apparently it was resolved 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:39.289
 but it was not a game, play on your face to 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:41.180
 I still remember it takes in good memory and I 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.860
 I understand the logic of the female vote that 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.840
 Woman thinks like that in my dress of mine. 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:51.130
 Shoe, dude, are you calm, my hair? 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.130
 she so ever logic, shit is that money
