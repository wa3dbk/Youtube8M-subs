00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
wanted to address usability so you'll

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.310 
wanted to address usability so you'll
see<00:01:12.220> that<00:01:12.520> we<00:01:12.730> do<00:01:12.910> have<00:01:12.940> our<00:01:13.420> corner<00:01:13.840> alignment

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
see that we do have our corner alignment

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.700 
see that we do have our corner alignment
and<00:01:14.410> whether<00:01:14.950> you<00:01:15.190> have<00:01:15.370> a<00:01:15.400> system<00:01:15.880> with<00:01:16.060> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and whether you have a system with a

other<00:01:19.420> extended<00:01:19.870> batteries<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.650> see<00:01:20.830> that<00:01:21.010> it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
other extended batteries you see that it

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.130 
other extended batteries you see that it
locks<00:01:21.340> into<00:01:21.610> place<00:01:21.790> so<00:01:22.570> that<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:22.870> we<00:01:22.990> have<00:01:23.110> a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
locks into place so that is we have a

you'll see the vent holes these are
designed<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.370> if<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.000> are<00:03:10.240> using<00:03:10.480> a

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.090 
designed so that if you are using a
system<00:03:11.080> we<00:03:11.170> want<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:11.410> make<00:03:11.500> sure<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.860> does

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
system we want to make sure that does

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.490 
system we want to make sure that does
get<00:03:12.310> maximum<00:03:12.850> performance<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:14.020> that<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.350> the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
get maximum performance so that is the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.110 
get maximum performance so that is the
air<00:03:14.620> exits<00:03:15.010> from<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.190> system<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.670> has<00:03:15.850> some

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
air exits from the system it has some

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.750 
air exits from the system it has some
place<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.330> go<00:03:16.690> overall<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.620> quieter<00:03:18.220> system<00:03:18.610> and

place to go overall a quieter system and
a<00:03:18.820> cooler<00:03:19.030> system<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.720> more<00:03:20.170> reliable<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.840> it

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
a cooler system is more reliable so it

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.630 
a cooler system is more reliable so it
does<00:03:23.170> appear<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.620> something<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.430> mini
