chains<00:01:52.160> going<00:01:52.370> to<00:01:52.430> do<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.550> think<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.030> issue

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
chains going to do I think a to issue

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.960 
chains going to do I think a to issue
fillin<00:01:53.600> that<00:01:53.780> deals<00:01:54.020> with<00:01:54.110> this<00:01:54.290> sort<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.970> i

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
fillin that deals with this sort of i

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.370 
fillin that deals with this sort of i
think<00:01:56.630> probably<00:01:56.900> little<00:01:57.170> tongue-in-cheek

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
think probably little tongue-in-cheek

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.260 
think probably little tongue-in-cheek
approach<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.070> pop<00:01:58.250> culture<00:01:58.580> icon<00:01:58.940> of<00:01:59.060> Wonder

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
approach the pop culture icon of Wonder

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.220 
approach the pop culture icon of Wonder
Woman<00:01:59.450> where<00:01:59.600> they<00:01:59.690> have<00:01:59.840> actually<00:02:00.020> have

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230

were<00:05:16.340> we've<00:05:17.240> been<00:05:17.360> talking<00:05:17.750> about<00:05:17.780> something

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
were we've been talking about something

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.170 
were we've been talking about something
that<00:05:18.230> we<00:05:18.350> both<00:05:18.440> agree<00:05:18.740> on<00:05:18.950> at<00:05:19.160> this<00:05:19.280> point<00:05:19.550> that

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
that we both agree on at this point that

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.730 
that we both agree on at this point that
we<00:05:20.270> want<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.540> do<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:20.810> think<00:05:20.990> will<00:05:21.080> be<00:05:21.170> good<00:05:21.200> but

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
we want to do and think will be good but

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.620 
we want to do and think will be good but
it<00:05:22.040> still<00:05:22.280> hasn't<00:05:22.580> made<00:05:22.940> its<00:05:23.090> way<00:05:23.270> all<00:05:23.480> the<00:05:23.510> way

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
it still hasn't made its way all the way

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.710 
it still hasn't made its way all the way
through<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.070> DC<00:05:25.070> ladder<00:05:25.370> so<00:05:25.970> it<00:05:26.060> could<00:05:26.270> die<00:05:26.480> at

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
through the DC ladder so it could die at

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.220 
through the DC ladder so it could die at
any<00:05:26.780> time<00:05:27.140> but<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:28.340> is<00:05:28.460> my<00:05:28.670> intent<00:05:29.090> to<00:05:29.750> if<00:05:30.020> not

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
any time but it is my intent to if not

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.350 
any time but it is my intent to if not
create<00:05:31.070> our<00:05:31.160> own<00:05:31.190> stuff<00:05:31.580> to<00:05:31.610> be<00:05:31.880> writing<00:05:32.240> and

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
create our own stuff to be writing and

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.490 
create our own stuff to be writing and
drawing<00:05:32.540> a<00:05:33.280> project<00:05:34.280> at<00:05:34.610> some<00:05:34.850> point<00:05:35.120> so<00:05:35.500> we'll

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
drawing a project at some point so we'll

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.920 
drawing a project at some point so we'll
see<00:05:36.620> how<00:05:36.650> that<00:05:36.740> goes
