you're doing the anterior piays of a
narrow<00:00:14.790> mouth<00:00:15.089> if<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.260> have<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.600> perfect

any problems it's when you have these
difficult<00:00:24.210> patients<00:00:24.840> whether<00:00:25.080> they're

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
difficult patients whether they're

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
that's where you have to do a little bit

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.400 
that's where you have to do a little bit
more<00:00:30.830> creative<00:00:31.830> x-ray<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.210> say<00:00:33.450> there's

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
more creative x-ray and as I say there's

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.280 
more creative x-ray and as I say there's
different<00:00:34.910> pieces<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.390> may<00:00:36.840> want<00:00:37.200> to

different pieces that you may want to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.799 
different pieces that you may want to
use<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.860> some<00:00:38.399> offices<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.149> always<00:00:39.510> use

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
use on some offices you can always use

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.049 
use on some offices you can always use
the<00:00:39.960> rent<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.230> some<00:00:40.440> instruments<00:00:41.190> they're

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the rent and some instruments they're

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.440 
the rent and some instruments they're
great<00:00:42.360> or<00:00:43.040> some<00:00:44.040> offices<00:00:44.489> use<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> bisecting

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
great or some offices use the bisecting

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.139 
great or some offices use the bisecting
angle<00:00:45.780> technique<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.410> think<00:00:47.100> I'll<00:00:47.309> start<00:00:47.760> with

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
angle technique I think I'll start with

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.610 
angle technique I think I'll start with
the<00:00:48.570> ring<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.510> show<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.570> how<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> do<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> few

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the ring and show you how to do a few

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.299 
the ring and show you how to do a few
interiors<00:00:53.399> now<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.840> size<00:00:55.110> film<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> size

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
interiors now the size film is a size

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
interiors now the size film is a size
two<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.730> many<00:00:57.360> times<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.170> too<00:00:58.469> large<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.329> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
two and many times it's too large for a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.979 
two and many times it's too large for a
very<00:01:00.750> very<00:01:01.100> narrow<00:01:02.100> mouth<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.449> why

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
very very narrow mouth like this and why

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.620 
very very narrow mouth like this and why
it<00:01:04.049> doesn't<00:01:04.650> fit<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.129> cannot<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.360> from

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it doesn't fit you cannot get it from

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.510 
it doesn't fit you cannot get it from
side<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> side<00:01:07.140> behind<00:01:07.830> those<00:01:08.040> front<00:01:08.310> teeth

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
side to side behind those front teeth

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.390 
side to side behind those front teeth
because<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.360> way<00:01:09.630> way<00:01:10.110> too<00:01:10.170> white<00:01:10.590> so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
because it is way way too white so

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.270 
because it is way way too white so
there's<00:01:11.760> two<00:01:11.939> options<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.650> switch<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> narrow

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
there's two options I switch to a narrow

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.120 
there's two options I switch to a narrow
size<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.880> film<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:16.259> by<00:01:16.500> chance<00:01:16.530> your

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
size one film and if by chance your

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.469 
size one film and if by chance your
office<00:01:17.430> doesn't<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.060> them

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
office doesn't have them

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.570 
office doesn't have them
the<00:01:19.020> other<00:01:19.290> option<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.369> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the other option that you can do is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.050 
the other option that you can do is
place<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.780> edge<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.619> film<00:01:23.060> farther

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
place the very edge of this film farther

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.210 
place the very edge of this film farther
back<00:01:24.479> into<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.140> mouth<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:26.009> actually

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
back into the mouth so that it actually

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.850 
back into the mouth so that it actually
fits<00:01:26.700> between<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.299> dental<00:01:27.780> arch<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:28.740> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
fits between the dental arch so if you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.450 
fits between the dental arch so if you
notice<00:01:29.250> I'm<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:30.740> directly<00:01:31.740> behind<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.220> teeth

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
notice I'm not directly behind the teeth

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.600 
notice I'm not directly behind the teeth
I've<00:01:32.700> got<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.200> film<00:01:34.530> way<00:01:35.100> back<00:01:35.369> by<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
I've got the the film way back by the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.899 
I've got the the film way back by the
molars<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:36.869> before<00:01:37.350> she<00:01:37.380> closes<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:38.790> I'm

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
molars now before she closes what I'm

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.960 
molars now before she closes what I'm
going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.689> roll<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.560> whole<00:01:40.970> unit

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
going to do is roll the whole unit

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.060 
going to do is roll the whole unit
upward<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.899> then<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.619> her<00:01:43.740> gently

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
upward and then you have her gently

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.420 
upward and then you have her gently
close<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.759> bite<00:01:44.909> close<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.930> your<00:01:46.860> goal<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.159> to

get the lower teeth right up onto the
bite<00:01:49.860> black<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:51.149> happened<00:01:51.540> sometimes<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.530> if

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
bite black what happened sometimes is if

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.639 
bite black what happened sometimes is if
you<00:01:53.009> use<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> cotton<00:01:53.579> roll<00:01:53.939> right<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:54.780> I'm

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
you use a cotton roll right now I'm

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.069 
you use a cotton roll right now I'm
going<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.890> take<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.219> she<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.780> has<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
going to take that out she really has to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.370 
going to take that out she really has to
close<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.219> reach<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.909> bite<00:02:00.299> block<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
close to reach this bite block and to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.410 
close to reach this bite block and to
make<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.710> easier<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.579> patient<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:03.360> you

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
make it easier on the patient if you

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.010 
make it easier on the patient if you
actually<00:02:04.350> put<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.310> cotton<00:02:05.880> roll<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.689> upper

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
actually put a cotton roll on the upper

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.529 
actually put a cotton roll on the upper
part<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.009> bite<00:02:08.190> block<00:02:08.399> she<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.330> able

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
part of the bite block she will be able

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.780 
part of the bite block she will be able
to<00:02:09.720> secure<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.349> whole<00:02:10.619> unit<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.220> her<00:02:11.340> mouth<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
to secure the whole unit in her mouth a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.930 
to secure the whole unit in her mouth a
little<00:02:11.970> bit<00:02:12.270> more<00:02:12.420> easy

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
little bit more easy

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.660 
little bit more easy
let<00:02:13.510> me<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.200> again<00:02:14.470> I'm<00:02:14.590> going<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.860> put<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.460> way

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
let me so again I'm going to put it way

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.690 
let me so again I'm going to put it way
back<00:02:15.910> there<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.330> fit<00:02:16.600> roll<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.650> up<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.040> then

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
back there to fit roll it up and then

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.900 
back there to fit roll it up and then
directly<00:02:19.690> put<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.200> control<00:02:20.680> up<00:02:20.800> right<00:02:21.700> under

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
directly put the control up right under

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.070 
directly put the control up right under
the<00:02:22.000> front<00:02:22.210> teeth<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.600> then<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.840> have<00:02:23.050> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
the front teeth and then you have a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.600 
the front teeth and then you have a
closed<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.620> bite<00:02:23.770> bite<00:02:25.140> okay<00:02:26.140> open<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.980> think

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
closed and bite bite okay open I think

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.880 
closed and bite bite okay open I think
she's<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.120> near<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> bite<00:02:28.570> sometimes<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.680> have

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
she's so near a bite sometimes you have

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.530 
she's so near a bite sometimes you have
to<00:02:30.040> readjust<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.670> few<00:02:30.820> times<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.240> make<00:02:31.390> it

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
to readjust it a few times and make it

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.950 
to readjust it a few times and make it
work

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
work

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.770 
work
slide<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.770> in<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.300> then<00:02:34.300> you're<00:02:34.570> going<00:02:34.720> to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
slide this in and then you're going to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.830 
slide this in and then you're going to
actually<00:02:34.990> put<00:02:35.470> your<00:02:35.620> cone<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.750> get<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
actually put your cone in and get the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.360 
actually put your cone in and get the
perfect<00:02:38.200> picture<00:02:39.270> when<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.300> say<00:02:40.630> roll<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:42.190> bar

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
perfect picture when I say roll the bar

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.340 
perfect picture when I say roll the bar
up<00:02:42.670> before<00:02:43.300> she<00:02:43.330> bites<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.260> helps<00:02:44.920> eliminate

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
up before she bites it helps eliminate

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.660 
up before she bites it helps eliminate
you<00:02:47.350> look<00:02:47.560> over<00:02:47.800> here<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:48.250> lot<00:02:48.520> of

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
you look over here a lot of

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.820 
you look over here a lot of
foreshortening<00:02:49.290> I'll<00:02:50.290> show<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.650> what

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
foreshortening I'll show you what

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.540 
foreshortening I'll show you what
happens<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:52.240> create<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.870> with<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:53.550> with

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
happens to create that with this with

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.820 
happens to create that with this with
this<00:02:54.730> piece<00:02:54.970> here<00:02:55.240> when<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:55.960> put<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.320> in<00:02:56.470> if<00:02:56.710> I

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
this piece here when you put it in if I

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.120 
this piece here when you put it in if I
did<00:02:57.040> not<00:02:57.190> roll<00:02:57.490> it<00:02:57.640> up<00:02:57.790> gently<00:02:58.540> close<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.980> can

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
did not roll it up gently close you can

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.670 
did not roll it up gently close you can
see<00:03:00.370> now<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:01.450> whole<00:03:01.480> unit<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.380> actually

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
see now the whole unit is actually

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.060 
see now the whole unit is actually
tipped<00:03:03.100> downward<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.850> by<00:03:04.300> having<00:03:04.600> an<00:03:05.070> upward

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
tipped downward and by having an upward

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.210 
tipped downward and by having an upward
direction<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.480> x-ray<00:03:07.900> cone<00:03:08.320> you're

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
direction of the x-ray cone you're

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.730 
direction of the x-ray cone you're
really<00:03:09.790> coming<00:03:10.090> from<00:03:10.240> bottom-up<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.260> it's

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
really coming from bottom-up and it's

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.430 
really coming from bottom-up and it's
actually<00:03:12.100> projecting<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:13.210> very<00:03:13.660> very<00:03:14.020> short

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
actually projecting that very very short

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.340 
actually projecting that very very short
image<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.640> rolling<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.270> up<00:03:16.390> before<00:03:16.930> she<00:03:17.140> bites

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
image so rolling it up before she bites

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.090 
image so rolling it up before she bites
will<00:03:17.830> eliminate<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.580> this<00:03:18.850> problem<00:03:19.510> here

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
will eliminate this this problem here

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.550 
will eliminate this this problem here
ideally<00:03:21.100> on<00:03:21.220> her<00:03:21.550> it<00:03:22.120> would<00:03:22.330> have<00:03:22.450> been<00:03:22.570> great

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
ideally on her it would have been great

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.740 
ideally on her it would have been great
to<00:03:23.860> have<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.220> size<00:03:24.459> one<00:03:24.820> film<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.450> I'm<00:03:25.570> going

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
to have the size one film and I'm going

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.420 
to have the size one film and I'm going
to<00:03:25.840> show<00:03:26.020> you<00:03:26.080> how<00:03:26.320> much<00:03:26.470> easier<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.070> is<00:03:27.190> to

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
to show you how much easier it is to

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.400 
to show you how much easier it is to
place<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:27.730> first<00:03:28.480> of<00:03:28.630> all<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.870> bottom<00:03:29.230> edge

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
place it first of all the bottom edge

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.560 
place it first of all the bottom edge
you<00:03:30.040> can<00:03:30.190> actually<00:03:30.459> place<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.090> little<00:03:31.450> bit

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
you can actually place a little bit

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.540 
you can actually place a little bit
closer<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.290> teeth<00:03:32.700> behind<00:03:33.700> them<00:03:34.800> so<00:03:35.800> it's

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
closer to the teeth behind them so it's

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.280 
closer to the teeth behind them so it's
she's<00:03:36.880> still<00:03:37.150> sold<00:03:37.390> Norrell<00:03:37.840> I'm<00:03:37.989> still<00:03:38.200> gonna

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
she's still sold Norrell I'm still gonna

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.970 
she's still sold Norrell I'm still gonna
have<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.470> go<00:03:38.620> quite<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.920> ways<00:03:39.640> back<00:03:40.200> but<00:03:41.200> before

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
have to go quite a ways back but before

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.390 
have to go quite a ways back but before
she<00:03:42.160> bites<00:03:42.370> roll<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.300> up<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.630> then<00:03:43.930> close<00:03:44.620> see

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
she bites roll it up and then close see

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.070 
she bites roll it up and then close see
how<00:03:45.550> that<00:03:45.820> actually<00:03:46.120> works<00:03:46.330> a<00:03:46.660> little<00:03:46.780> better

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
how that actually works a little better

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.070 
how that actually works a little better
than<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:47.590> closing<00:03:48.040> down<00:03:48.070> a<00:03:48.519> good<00:03:49.269> idea<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.900> is

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
than just closing down a good idea to is

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.860 
than just closing down a good idea to is
to<00:03:50.260> actually<00:03:50.650> explain<00:03:51.610> to<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.850> patient<00:03:52.269> what

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
to actually explain to the patient what

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.810 
to actually explain to the patient what
you<00:03:53.050> want<00:03:53.260> them<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.590> do<00:03:53.739> before<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.220> put<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.670> in

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
you want them to do before you put it in

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.600 
you want them to do before you put it in
so<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.840> would<00:03:55.959> say<00:03:56.230> toward<00:03:56.470> what<00:03:56.950> my<00:03:57.190> goal<00:03:57.459> is

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
so I would say toward what my goal is

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.360 
so I would say toward what my goal is
for<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.470> gently<00:03:59.470> bite<00:03:59.650> on<00:03:59.800> this<00:03:59.950> okay

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
for you is to gently bite on this okay

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.750 
for you is to gently bite on this okay
and<00:04:00.550> then<00:04:01.060> they<00:04:01.239> know<00:04:01.510> what<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.870> expect

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
and then they know what to expect

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.820 
and then they know what to expect
another<00:04:03.760> error<00:04:04.150> people<00:04:04.510> make<00:04:04.690> sometimes<00:04:05.500> is

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
another error people make sometimes is

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.699 
another error people make sometimes is
when<00:04:06.040> they<00:04:06.160> do<00:04:06.220> place<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:06.970> here<00:04:07.209> they<00:04:07.930> slide<00:04:08.470> it

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
when they do place it here they slide it

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.140 
when they do place it here they slide it
up<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:10.560> they<00:04:11.560> hold<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:12.070> up<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:12.459> now<00:04:12.610> when<00:04:13.030> the

she's it's difficult open its jabbing so

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.190 
she's it's difficult open its jabbing so
much<00:04:20.530> down<00:04:21.010> below<00:04:21.460> you're<00:04:22.090> not<00:04:22.300> allowing<00:04:22.720> it

makes it a little easier for you in
getting<00:05:02.789> the<00:05:02.969> correct<00:05:03.590> vertical<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.800> bangle

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
getting the correct vertical to a bangle

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.029 
getting the correct vertical to a bangle
you've<00:05:05.729> got<00:05:05.969> to<00:05:06.090> remember<00:05:06.360> now<00:05:06.719> that<00:05:07.259> the

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
you've got to remember now that the

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.430 
you've got to remember now that the
vertical<00:05:08.550> tube<00:05:08.940> angle<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.539> up-and-down<00:05:09.930> is

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
vertical tube angle the up-and-down is

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.089 
vertical tube angle the up-and-down is
going<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.860> cause<00:05:11.460> your<00:05:12.379> elongation<00:05:13.379> or<00:05:13.560> for

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
going to cause your elongation or for

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.770 
going to cause your elongation or for
shortening<00:05:14.610> of<00:05:14.759> your<00:05:14.940> images<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.569> so<00:05:15.719> you

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
shortening of your images and so you

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.920 
shortening of your images and so you
really<00:05:16.289> have<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:16.860> make<00:05:17.009> sure<00:05:17.069> that's<00:05:17.490> correct

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
really have to make sure that's correct

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.409 
really have to make sure that's correct
this<00:05:18.930> instrument<00:05:19.530> here<00:05:19.830> really<00:05:20.580> helps<00:05:21.150> guide

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
this instrument here really helps guide

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.200 
this instrument here really helps guide
your<00:05:21.870> your<00:05:22.740> cone<00:05:23.099> so<00:05:23.550> that<00:05:23.729> you<00:05:23.909> are<00:05:24.060> getting

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
your your cone so that you are getting

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.050 
your your cone so that you are getting
the<00:05:24.479> correct<00:05:24.780> angle<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.469> so<00:05:26.460> what<00:05:26.729> I'm<00:05:26.849> going

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
the correct angle and so what I'm going

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.339 
the correct angle and so what I'm going
to<00:05:27.120> do<00:05:27.360> is<00:05:27.569> we're<00:05:27.690> going<00:05:27.780> to<00:05:27.840> do<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.110> upper

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
to do is we're going to do the upper

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.170 
to do is we're going to do the upper
ones<00:05:28.530> to<00:05:28.650> start<00:05:28.889> with<00:05:29.099> and<00:05:29.310> we're<00:05:30.029> going<00:05:30.150> to

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
ones to start with and we're going to

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.540 
ones to start with and we're going to
have<00:05:30.330> our<00:05:30.449> gently<00:05:30.870> bite<00:05:31.139> down<00:05:31.529> right<00:05:31.889> here<00:05:32.370> and

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
have our gently bite down right here and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.779 
have our gently bite down right here and
if<00:05:32.969> you<00:05:33.090> notice<00:05:33.449> the<00:05:33.690> slant<00:05:34.169> of<00:05:34.529> the<00:05:34.979> the

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
if you notice the slant of the the

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.610 
if you notice the slant of the the
bottom<00:05:36.210> edge<00:05:36.419> that<00:05:36.690> she's<00:05:36.900> biting<00:05:37.289> on<00:05:37.440> the

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
bottom edge that she's biting on the

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.749 
bottom edge that she's biting on the
little<00:05:37.830> bite<00:05:37.979> tab<00:05:38.250> you're<00:05:39.000> going<00:05:39.060> to<00:05:39.360> actually

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
little bite tab you're going to actually

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.430 
little bite tab you're going to actually
vertically<00:05:41.759> set<00:05:42.060> your<00:05:42.240> tube<00:05:42.539> so<00:05:42.900> that's<00:05:43.110> in

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
vertically set your tube so that's in

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.760 
vertically set your tube so that's in
the<00:05:43.590> same<00:05:43.860> line<00:05:44.460> as<00:05:44.490> this<00:05:45.360> piece<00:05:46.229> is<00:05:46.469> actually

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
the same line as this piece is actually

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.519 
the same line as this piece is actually
directed<00:05:47.639> so<00:05:48.240> we'll<00:05:48.690> show<00:05:49.080> you<00:05:49.110> how<00:05:49.229> that

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
directed so we'll show you how that

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:51.649 
directed so we'll show you how that
works<00:05:49.800> I'm<00:05:50.490> going<00:05:50.699> to<00:05:50.789> just<00:05:50.940> place<00:05:51.210> this<00:05:51.389> in

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
works I'm going to just place this in

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.709 
works I'm going to just place this in
now<00:05:52.229> the<00:05:52.289> bottom<00:05:52.949> edge<00:05:53.190> needs<00:05:53.759> to<00:05:54.060> go<00:05:54.300> in

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
now the bottom edge needs to go in

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.619 
now the bottom edge needs to go in
enough<00:05:55.590> so<00:05:55.919> that<00:05:56.159> it<00:05:56.310> fits<00:05:56.550> between<00:05:56.789> her<00:05:57.330> lower

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:57.629 
enough so that it fits between her lower

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.689 
enough so that it fits between her lower
arch<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:58.710> don't<00:05:58.860> want<00:05:59.009> it<00:05:59.069> out<00:05:59.190> here<00:05:59.520> like

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
arch you don't want it out here like

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:00.050 
arch you don't want it out here like
this

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
this

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.230 
this
you<00:06:00.960> want<00:06:01.139> to<00:06:01.259> see<00:06:02.159> the<00:06:02.310> deep<00:06:02.580> enough<00:06:02.879> so<00:06:02.940> that

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
you want to see the deep enough so that

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.240 
you want to see the deep enough so that
it<00:06:03.360> fits<00:06:03.750> anyway<00:06:04.529> have<00:06:04.650> you<00:06:04.680> do<00:06:04.860> is<00:06:04.979> gently

it fits anyway have you do is gently

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.649 
it fits anyway have you do is gently
close<00:06:05.669> if<00:06:06.349> you<00:06:07.349> notice<00:06:07.770> now<00:06:08.039> her<00:06:08.659> anterior

close if you notice now her anterior

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:11.809 
close if you notice now her anterior
front<00:06:10.110> teeth<00:06:10.319> are<00:06:10.560> resting<00:06:11.250> just<00:06:11.430> where<00:06:11.669> you

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
front teeth are resting just where you

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.879 
front teeth are resting just where you
need<00:06:12.029> it<00:06:12.060> I'm<00:06:12.659> going<00:06:12.990> to<00:06:13.080> turn<00:06:13.409> your<00:06:13.590> head<00:06:13.740> to

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
need it I'm going to turn your head to

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.180 
need it I'm going to turn your head to
the<00:06:13.919> side<00:06:14.250> for<00:06:14.490> a<00:06:14.550> minute<00:06:14.819> if<00:06:15.590> you<00:06:16.590> can<00:06:16.770> look<00:06:17.039> at

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
the side for a minute if you can look at

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.680 
the side for a minute if you can look at
the<00:06:17.370> direction<00:06:17.699> that<00:06:18.060> this<00:06:18.300> piece<00:06:18.659> is

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
the direction that this piece is

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.559 
the direction that this piece is
actually<00:06:19.409> sitting<00:06:19.770> this<00:06:20.520> is<00:06:20.789> the<00:06:20.969> guide<00:06:21.240> that

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
actually sitting this is the guide that

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.019 
actually sitting this is the guide that
you're<00:06:22.289> going<00:06:22.469> to<00:06:22.560> use<00:06:22.830> to<00:06:22.860> set<00:06:23.370> your<00:06:23.550> vertical

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029 
you're going to use to set your vertical

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.019 
you're going to use to set your vertical
tube<00:06:24.300> angle<00:06:24.509> which<00:06:24.870> is<00:06:25.050> this<00:06:25.319> way<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:25.860> if<00:06:26.849> you

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:27.029 
tube angle which is this way and if you

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:29.209 
tube angle which is this way and if you
can<00:06:27.180> see<00:06:27.479> it's<00:06:27.960> really<00:06:28.500> turn<00:06:28.710> your<00:06:28.830> head<00:06:28.979> there

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:29.219 
can see it's really turn your head there

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:31.550 
can see it's really turn your head there
so<00:06:29.789> you<00:06:29.879> can<00:06:30.090> see<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:30.479> direction<00:06:31.020> is<00:06:31.199> kind<00:06:31.469> of

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
so you can see the direction is kind of

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.709 
so you can see the direction is kind of
slanting<00:06:32.099> it<00:06:32.279> about<00:06:32.520> a<00:06:32.550> I<00:06:32.879> don't<00:06:33.300> know<00:06:33.419> thirty

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:33.719 
slanting it about a I don't know thirty

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.610 
slanting it about a I don't know thirty
degree<00:06:34.139> I'm<00:06:34.620> actually<00:06:34.889> going<00:06:35.219> to<00:06:35.310> start

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
degree I'm actually going to start

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.710 
degree I'm actually going to start
angling<00:06:37.620> this<00:06:37.949> so<00:06:38.610> that<00:06:38.789> if<00:06:38.909> I<00:06:39.060> were<00:06:39.210> to

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
angling this so that if I were to

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.220 
angling this so that if I were to
in<00:06:39.810> you<00:06:40.070> this<00:06:41.070> line<00:06:41.460> in<00:06:41.880> the<00:06:42.570> direction<00:06:42.900> that

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
in you this line in the direction that

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.100 
in you this line in the direction that
this<00:06:43.440> is<00:06:43.680> flowing<00:06:44.160> so<00:06:44.400> you<00:06:44.490> can<00:06:44.760> see<00:06:45.120> this

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
this is flowing so you can see this

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.740 
this is flowing so you can see this
would<00:06:46.350> be<00:06:46.380> correct

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
would be correct

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.770 
would be correct
this<00:06:48.750> would<00:06:49.080> not<00:06:49.290> and<00:06:49.680> what<00:06:50.400> that<00:06:50.640> does<00:06:50.970> is<00:06:51.540> it

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
this would not and what that does is it

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.040 
this would not and what that does is it
actually<00:06:52.380> is<00:06:53.210> positioning<00:06:54.210> your<00:06:54.480> vertical

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
actually is positioning your vertical

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.500 
actually is positioning your vertical
tube<00:06:55.260> angle<00:06:55.500> to<00:06:56.310> the<00:06:56.460> position<00:06:56.940> of<00:06:57.060> the<00:06:57.210> film

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
tube angle to the position of the film

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.360 
tube angle to the position of the film
and<00:06:57.690> the<00:06:57.780> mouth<00:06:58.020> so<00:06:58.380> right<00:06:58.650> now<00:06:58.830> the<00:06:58.890> film<00:06:59.280> is

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
and the mouth so right now the film is

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.600 
and the mouth so right now the film is
like<00:06:59.670> so<00:07:00.120> and<00:07:00.420> so<00:07:01.230> the<00:07:01.440> x-ray<00:07:01.920> beam<00:07:02.160> is<00:07:02.400> being

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
like so and so the x-ray beam is being

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.000 
like so and so the x-ray beam is being
directed<00:07:03.210> almost<00:07:03.810> at<00:07:04.200> a<00:07:04.230> right<00:07:04.290> angle<00:07:04.470> to<00:07:04.770> the

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
directed almost at a right angle to the

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.460 
directed almost at a right angle to the
film<00:07:05.250> placement<00:07:05.820> so<00:07:06.170> another<00:07:07.170> thing<00:07:07.260> you

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
film placement so another thing you

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.560 
film placement so another thing you
don't<00:07:07.860> want<00:07:08.070> to<00:07:08.160> do<00:07:08.340> is<00:07:08.520> cone<00:07:08.850> cut<00:07:09.150> your<00:07:09.360> image

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
don't want to do is cone cut your image

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.260 
don't want to do is cone cut your image
meaning<00:07:10.140> not<00:07:10.350> align<00:07:10.830> the<00:07:11.100> circle<00:07:11.310> with<00:07:12.000> where

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
meaning not align the circle with where

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.940 
meaning not align the circle with where
the<00:07:12.450> position<00:07:12.930> of<00:07:13.050> the<00:07:13.140> film<00:07:13.380> is<00:07:13.500> on<00:07:13.530> the<00:07:13.770> mouth

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:13.950 
the position of the film is on the mouth

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.800 
the position of the film is on the mouth
so<00:07:14.550> you<00:07:14.580> don't<00:07:14.670> want<00:07:14.880> to<00:07:14.940> be<00:07:15.030> too<00:07:15.210> high<00:07:15.420> or<00:07:15.750> too

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
so you don't want to be too high or too

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.550 
so you don't want to be too high or too
low

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
low

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.830 
low
I<00:07:16.590> suggest<00:07:17.520> the<00:07:17.700> bottom<00:07:18.150> edge<00:07:18.270> of<00:07:18.420> the<00:07:18.510> cone

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
I suggest the bottom edge of the cone

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.820 
I suggest the bottom edge of the cone
here<00:07:19.320> is<00:07:19.470> actually<00:07:20.660> down<00:07:21.660> far<00:07:22.170> enough<00:07:22.530> so<00:07:22.800> that

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
here is actually down far enough so that

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.430 
here is actually down far enough so that
it's<00:07:23.130> including<00:07:23.760> the<00:07:24.450> base<00:07:24.690> of<00:07:24.960> this<00:07:25.140> piece

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 
it's including the base of this piece

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.000 
it's including the base of this piece
right<00:07:25.710> here<00:07:25.770> so<00:07:26.310> this<00:07:26.940> would<00:07:27.210> be<00:07:27.390> incorrect

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.010 
right here so this would be incorrect

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.700 
right here so this would be incorrect
this<00:07:29.010> is<00:07:29.280> more<00:07:29.550> correct<00:07:30.200> now<00:07:31.200> some<00:07:31.470> people

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
this is more correct now some people

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.390 
this is more correct now some people
have<00:07:32.070> a<00:07:32.130> shallow<00:07:32.990> arch<00:07:33.990> on<00:07:34.350> top<00:07:34.590> so<00:07:35.010> the<00:07:35.190> whole

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 
have a shallow arch on top so the whole

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.330 
have a shallow arch on top so the whole
film<00:07:35.790> itself<00:07:36.150> open<00:07:36.960> is<00:07:37.110> they<00:07:37.680> actually<00:07:37.800> may<00:07:38.100> be

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 
film itself open is they actually may be

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.480 
film itself open is they actually may be
sitting<00:07:38.850> like<00:07:39.030> so<00:07:39.390> instead<00:07:39.930> of<00:07:39.990> like<00:07:40.290> this<00:07:40.560> so

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.490 
sitting like so instead of like this so

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.250 
sitting like so instead of like this so
I<00:07:41.520> want<00:07:41.760> you<00:07:41.880> just<00:07:41.940> pretend<00:07:42.750> it's<00:07:42.900> like<00:07:43.080> that

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.260 
I want you just pretend it's like that

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.530 
I want you just pretend it's like that
so<00:07:43.740> if<00:07:43.980> it<00:07:44.190> were<00:07:44.310> to<00:07:44.460> be<00:07:44.640> like<00:07:44.910> this

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:45.540 
so if it were to be like this

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.870 
so if it were to be like this
now<00:07:46.050> you<00:07:46.110> can<00:07:46.440> see<00:07:46.680> that<00:07:46.890> the<00:07:47.070> vertical<00:07:47.340> tube

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 
now you can see that the vertical tube

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.120 
now you can see that the vertical tube
angle<00:07:48.060> has<00:07:48.419> to<00:07:48.600> even<00:07:48.870> be<00:07:49.020> increased<00:07:49.470> more<00:07:49.890> to

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.130 
angle has to even be increased more to

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.220 
angle has to even be increased more to
accommodate<00:07:50.610> this<00:07:50.790> type<00:07:51.060> of<00:07:51.090> mouth<00:07:51.540> if<00:07:52.080> you

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.230 
accommodate this type of mouth if you

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.560 
accommodate this type of mouth if you
