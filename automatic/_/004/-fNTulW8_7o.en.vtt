 hi there, tungsten is the first 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:19.230
 Yaroslavl video blogger today with us 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:22.920
 unusual review review on the american 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.490
 overcoat button 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.240
 most likely with such buttons to the relay 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:36.010
 american soldiers them they were on 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:39.460
 overcoats maybe this is from the officer tires 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.249
 or does not even know exactly but about me 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.210
 so I suspect that in the thirties forties 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:49.679
 the years were in Americans such overcoats 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.780
 These buttons on them and were 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:55.749
 I printed the buttons because 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:03.129
 see small details 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:08.170
 understand everything here here is not even drawn 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:11.560
 drawn written such motto loop 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.060
 breus u well what is translated from Latin 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.270
 means 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:22.480
 one of the few here started 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.810
 Vlad and holds arrows their number 13 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.590
 pieces 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.370
 because how i got up there originally 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.850
 America was created and in it in Kanev 13 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.030

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:39.820

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.060

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.990
 I don't know for sure 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.180
 I would certainly like to hear an opinion 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.180

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.050

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.990

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.140
