 today we are here again with this 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:16.230
 tv that I bet on in serbia and philips 21 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 pettenÃ¡ 467 is enough 38 that happened 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:25.699
 now i put i already know vertical already 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.699
 is in place 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.900
 now I'm going to call the council to see that the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.740
 problem persists 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.740
 I took that one out. 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:46.920
 on the first try it turns on and off 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:51.469
 the delegate 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:58.430
 Let's go on the channel now. 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.430
 Look she died but not to the party. 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:11.729
 from now on again it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.220
 Are you going to call that people again? 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.340
 without unplugging it will turn on normal 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.830
 appear 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.830
 the image off 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.469
 notes that it appears the image and 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.880
 turns off 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:39.479
 Let's see it again, I'll call again. 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.350
 there is the TV screen nobody will feel 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.350
 normal outlet 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.140
 appears more normal and turns off 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:04.250
 then this defect it in this casino 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:08.690
 time all tested horizontal the source 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:29.890
 she is also getting charged to 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:29.890
 people watch the team and let's get 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:46.800
 She's already there, she's off. 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.800
 time to put the attention that alternated 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.440
 here are the capacitor pins is from the source 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.849
 We are going to make the measurement now. 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:15.250
 Look how long to turn off by measuring 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:20.769
 the source of the voltage of 164 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:24.069
 volts does not decrease in the source the 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.650
 She is releasing her house to the 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.480
 secondary 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:34.110
 Look, it does not diminish, it can happen and if 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.110
 I hope you do not reduce voltage 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:50.440
 then this television 21 pt 9467 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:53.100
 philips appears and turns off and on 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.100
 containment
