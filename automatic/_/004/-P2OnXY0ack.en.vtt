too soon give way to just a little bit
longer<00:01:46.600> ink<00:01:46.960> was<00:01:47.170> about<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.590> drop<00:01:47.800> that

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
longer ink was about to drop that

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.770 
longer ink was about to drop that
expansion<00:01:48.370> I<00:01:48.760> had<00:01:49.000> he<00:01:49.090> done<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.330> instead<00:01:49.600> of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
expansion I had he done that instead of

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.030 
expansion I had he done that instead of
spending<00:01:49.990> all<00:01:50.170> that<00:01:50.200> money<00:01:50.290> in<00:01:50.530> our<00:01:50.770> me<00:01:50.920> when

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
spending all that money in our me when

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.130 
spending all that money in our me when
he<00:01:51.100> saw<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.310> first<00:01:51.550> coming<00:01:51.910> I<00:01:52.210> think<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:52.990> he

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
he saw the first coming I think so he

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.560 
he saw the first coming I think so he
might<00:01:53.290> have<00:01:53.410> been<00:01:53.500> able

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.810 

to<00:01:57.720> defense<00:01:58.080> looks<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.980> circus<00:01:59.490> over<00:01:59.610> here

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
to defense looks like a circus over here

higher and they both back off engaging
happily<00:06:07.070> they<00:06:07.250> could<00:06:07.430> not<00:06:07.550> engage<00:06:07.910> that<00:06:08.210> I

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
happily they could not engage that I

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.280 
happily they could not engage that I
mean<00:06:10.070> with<00:06:10.880> these<00:06:11.000> Ravens<00:06:11.450> this<00:06:11.990> one<00:06:12.140> does

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
mean with these Ravens this one does

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.540 
mean with these Ravens this one does
have<00:06:12.320> enough<00:06:12.620> to<00:06:12.770> drop<00:06:12.920> point<00:06:13.220> defense<00:06:13.460> drone

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
have enough to drop point defense drone

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.940 
have enough to drop point defense drone
so<00:06:13.880> that's<00:06:14.090> very<00:06:14.450> good<00:06:14.690> no<00:06:15.050> ever<00:06:15.260> me<00:06:15.590> is<00:06:15.770> he

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
so that's very good no ever me is he

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.230 
so that's very good no ever me is he
really<00:06:16.130> could<00:06:16.400> have<00:06:16.430> trapped<00:06:16.850> a<00:06:17.000> large

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
really could have trapped a large

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.430 
really could have trapped a large
portion<00:06:17.480> of<00:06:17.600> the<00:06:17.690> Syrian<00:06:17.960> army<00:06:18.050> yeah

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
portion of the Syrian army yeah

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.010 
portion of the Syrian army yeah
absolutely<00:06:19.030> if<00:06:20.030> it<00:06:20.210> does<00:06:20.360> not<00:06:20.390> have<00:06:20.750> that<00:06:20.840> many

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
absolutely if it does not have that many

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.260 
absolutely if it does not have that many
stalkers<00:06:21.440> though<00:06:21.620> so<00:06:21.919> I<00:06:21.950> mean<00:06:22.220> point<00:06:23.150> defense

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
stalkers though so I mean point defense

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:31.689 
stalkers though so I mean point defense
drone<00:06:23.510> is<00:06:23.750> not<00:06:23.990> going<00:06:24.169> to<00:06:24.260> affect

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.219 

 at<00:06:32.879> my<00:06:33.030> hands<00:06:33.240> drone<00:06:33.539> goes<00:06:33.750> down<00:06:33.930> way<00:06:34.169> too

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
 at my hands drone goes down way too

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.770 
 at my hands drone goes down way too
late<00:06:34.620> he<00:06:35.099> does<00:06:35.250> not<00:06:35.430> have<00:06:35.639> an<00:06:35.789> EMP<00:06:36.180> on<00:06:36.360> his<00:06:36.509> army

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
late he does not have an EMP on his army

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.230 
late he does not have an EMP on his army
at<00:06:36.900> all<00:06:37.110> taking<00:06:38.099> tons<00:06:38.370> of<00:06:38.520> storm<00:06:38.759> damage<00:06:38.819> and

at all taking tons of storm damage and

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.119 
at all taking tons of storm damage and
looks<00:06:39.389> like<00:06:39.479> this<00:06:39.599> will<00:06:39.750> probably<00:06:40.469> be<00:06:40.770> GG

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
looks like this will probably be GG

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:42.350 
looks like this will probably be GG
although<00:06:41.520> of<00:06:41.669> course<00:06:41.699> we've<00:06:42.060> missed<00:06:42.270> a
