00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
you move this back clearing these two

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.390 
you move this back clearing these two
packets<00:02:28.739> take<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.549> finger<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.720> push<00:02:31.400> right

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
packets take this finger and push right

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.170 
packets take this finger and push right
there<00:02:33.110> pushing<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.349> packet<00:02:34.709> forth<00:02:34.980> ok<00:02:35.280> so

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
