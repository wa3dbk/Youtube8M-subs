of the spoon primarily now let's put the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.450 
of the spoon primarily now let's put the
trees<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.529> I've<00:00:25.619> already<00:00:25.920> prepared<00:00:26.279> this

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
trees and I've already prepared this

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.370 
trees and I've already prepared this
I've<00:00:26.640> done<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.820> moon<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.390> some<00:00:27.539> basic<00:00:27.720> foliage

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
I've done a moon and some basic foliage

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.800 
I've done a moon and some basic foliage
in<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.590> background<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.179> basically<00:00:30.359> run

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
in the background you just basically run

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.780 
in the background you just basically run
the<00:00:30.960> spoon<00:00:31.230> down<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.980> suppor<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.610> your

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the spoon down your suppor to your

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.670 
the spoon down your suppor to your
canvas<00:00:33.030> or<00:00:33.420> your<00:00:33.540> paper<00:00:33.750> wherever<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> using

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
today I'm using a Langford block paper

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.069 
today I'm using a Langford block paper
I<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.120> block<00:00:39.329> pad<00:00:39.600> because<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.930> don't

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I like the block pad because you don't

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.139 
I like the block pad because you don't
have<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.350> pre<00:00:40.590> prepare<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.760> great<00:00:41.969> for

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
have to pre prepare it it's great for

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.000 
have to pre prepare it it's great for
acrylics<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.350> don't<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.739> stretch

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
acrylics and you don't have to stretch

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.090 
acrylics and you don't have to stretch
it<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.430> stick<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> down<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.809> any<00:00:45.960> arms<00:00:46.410> any<00:00:46.680> any

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
it or stick it down to any arms any any

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.740 
it or stick it down to any arms any any
boards<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.879> all<00:00:48.000> I've<00:00:48.149> done<00:00:48.180> basically<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
boards so all I've done basically is

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
boards so all I've done basically is
I've<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.140> created<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.800> base<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> tree

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
I've just created the base of the tree

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000 
I've just created the base of the tree
coming<00:00:50.969> down<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.510> canvas<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.860> don't

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
coming down the canvas and you don't

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.350 
coming down the canvas and you don't
have<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.219> worry<00:00:53.430> about<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.760> size<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
have to worry about the size and the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
have to worry about the size and the
shape<00:00:54.390> too<00:00:54.780> much<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.770> bring<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> down

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
shape too much really just bring it down

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.619 
shape too much really just bring it down
make<00:00:56.579> sure<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.850> bottom<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.270> little<00:00:57.420> bit

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
make sure the bottom is a little bit

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.510 
make sure the bottom is a little bit
wider<00:00:57.870> than<00:00:58.079> top<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.949> know<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.250> thicker

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
wider than top as you know it's thicker

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.610 
wider than top as you know it's thicker
at<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> base<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> tree<00:01:00.420> than<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
at the base of a tree than it is at the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.439 
at the base of a tree than it is at the
top<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> same<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.270> mean

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
come down use the edge of the spoon and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.050 
come down use the edge of the spoon and
just<00:01:07.799> generally<00:01:08.280> bring<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> page

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
you get the basic shape to start with

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.640

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
well be sure in two types of trees one

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.380 
well be sure in two types of trees one
more<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:13.979> silhouette<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.270> other

same line using the edge of the spoon to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.740 
same line using the edge of the spoon to
create<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.250> shape<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.640> your<00:01:29.820> tree<00:01:30.030> it's

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
that they actually put into the painting

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
branches in I'll also use a rigger brush

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.610 
branches in I'll also use a rigger brush
to<00:02:35.940> help<00:02:36.150> create<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.569> bit<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.930> final<00:02:37.260> detail

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
to help create a bit of final detail

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.119 
to help create a bit of final detail

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
you'll get dry bits and you'll create

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.660 
you'll get dry bits and you'll create
uncharacteristic<00:03:01.530> lines<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.160> scrapes<00:03:02.489> and

from<00:03:24.359> this<00:03:24.540> side<00:03:24.720> block<00:03:24.930> be<00:03:25.049> coming<00:03:25.319> from<00:03:25.440> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
from this side block be coming from the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.309 
from this side block be coming from the
direction<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:27.090> moon<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:28.109> do<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
direction of the moon and you do the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.440 
direction of the moon and you do the
same<00:03:28.500> thing<00:03:28.739> on<00:03:28.859> all<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.819> tree<00:03:30.030> trunks<00:03:30.329> that

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
same thing on all the tree trunks that

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.660 
same thing on all the tree trunks that
you've<00:03:30.540> done<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.139> just<00:03:31.349> basically<00:03:31.739> you're

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
you've done you just basically you're

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.039 
you've done you just basically you're
letting<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.030> paint<00:03:33.239> do<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.569> work<00:03:33.750> for<00:03:33.959> you

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
letting the paint do the work for you

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.960 
letting the paint do the work for you
it's<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.440> mixing<00:03:35.040> naturally<00:03:35.579> with<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
it's just mixing naturally with the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.309 
it's just mixing naturally with the
actual<00:03:36.389> black<00:03:36.690> paint<00:03:36.989> you've<00:03:37.170> already

actual black paint you've already
painted<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.829> tree<00:03:38.099> trunk<00:03:38.340> with<00:03:38.519> really

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
painted the tree trunk with really

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.289 
painted the tree trunk with really
simple<00:03:39.750> really<00:03:40.349> effective<00:03:41.099> and<00:03:41.700> it's<00:03:41.940> great

really enjoyed it and the works that are
produced<00:03:50.970> at<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.150> end<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.540> class<00:03:51.859> I'm<00:03:52.859> not

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
produced at the end of the class I'm not

produced at the end of the class I'm not
joking<00:03:53.250> everybody<00:03:53.849> could<00:03:54.030> get<00:03:54.359> him<00:03:54.480> framed

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
joking everybody could get him framed

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.720 
joking everybody could get him framed
and<00:03:54.959> they<00:03:55.049> could<00:03:55.200> stick<00:03:55.620> him<00:03:55.739> in<00:03:55.829> a<00:03:55.980> exhibition

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
and they could stick him in a exhibition

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.699 
and they could stick him in a exhibition
of<00:03:56.849> competition<00:03:57.329> anywhere<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:58.470> really

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
of competition anywhere it's really

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.159 
of competition anywhere it's really
quite<00:03:58.889> amazing<00:03:59.299> so<00:04:00.299> that's<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.630> basically<00:04:00.930> for

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
quite amazing so that's it basically for

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.020 
quite amazing so that's it basically for
the<00:04:01.230> trunks<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:02.280> doesn't<00:04:02.579> stand<00:04:02.760> out<00:04:03.000> that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
the trunks it doesn't stand out that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.449 
the trunks it doesn't stand out that
much<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.599> Menace<00:04:04.010> but<00:04:05.010> as<00:04:05.099> soon<00:04:05.250> as<00:04:05.340> I

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
much of the Menace but as soon as I

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.890 
much of the Menace but as soon as I
start<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.849> put<00:04:05.970> these<00:04:06.090> branches<00:04:06.569> in<00:04:06.690> at<00:04:06.810> the

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
start to put these branches in at the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.309 
start to put these branches in at the
end<00:04:07.519> it'll<00:04:08.519> make<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> big<00:04:09.030> difference<00:04:09.209> I'm<00:04:10.169> just

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
end it'll make a big difference I'm just

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.039 
end it'll make a big difference I'm just
going<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.470> use<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.739> rigger<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.840> little<00:04:12.840> bit<00:04:12.959> of

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
going to use this rigger a little bit of

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.569 
going to use this rigger a little bit of
water<00:04:13.260> because<00:04:13.709> as<00:04:13.829> you<00:04:13.980> know<00:04:14.099> what<00:04:14.250> kerlix

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
water because as you know what kerlix

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.039 
water because as you know what kerlix
dry<00:04:14.849> quick<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.329> if<00:04:15.389> you<00:04:15.510> haven't<00:04:15.630> got<00:04:15.810> water

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
dry quick and if you haven't got water

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.900 
dry quick and if you haven't got water
in<00:04:16.229> your<00:04:16.320> brush<00:04:16.560> if<00:04:16.829> it<00:04:17.039> you'll<00:04:17.250> out<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.609> dry<00:04:17.789> in

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
in your brush if it you'll out to dry in

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.729 
in your brush if it you'll out to dry in
your<00:04:18.030> brush<00:04:18.180> it'll<00:04:18.989> harden<00:04:19.320> your<00:04:19.380> brush<00:04:19.560> up

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
your brush it'll harden your brush up

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.140 
your brush it'll harden your brush up
and<00:04:19.889> then<00:04:20.039> you'll<00:04:20.250> learn<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:20.880> may<00:04:21.000> have

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
and then you'll learn you may have

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.459 
and then you'll learn you may have
problems<00:04:21.389> with<00:04:21.630> your<00:04:21.780> brush<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.289> might

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
problems with your brush and it might

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.529 
problems with your brush and it might
not<00:04:22.500> work<00:04:22.680> properly<00:04:23.070> if<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.490> don't<00:04:23.669> keep<00:04:24.360> it

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
not work properly if you don't keep it

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.850 
not work properly if you don't keep it
moist<00:04:25.020> enough<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.500> use

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
moist enough to use

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.660 
moist enough to use
I'm<00:04:25.950> just<00:04:26.159> getting<00:04:26.370> some

in<00:04:33.920> I'm<00:04:34.430> just<00:04:34.670> making<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.390> impression<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:36.170> a

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
in I'm just making the impression of a

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.920 
in I'm just making the impression of a
few<00:04:37.040> branches<00:04:37.460> coming<00:04:37.670> out<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.480> can<00:04:38.630> do

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
few branches coming out and you can do

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.300 
few branches coming out and you can do
your<00:04:39.110> branches<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.530> can<00:04:39.560> have<00:04:39.770> them<00:04:39.890> going<00:04:40.040> up

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
your branches you can have them going up

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.340 
your branches you can have them going up
you<00:04:40.490> can<00:04:40.640> have<00:04:40.760> them<00:04:40.880> coming<00:04:41.180> down<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:42.080> can<00:04:42.200> do

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
you can have them coming down you can do

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.290 
you can have them coming down you can do
made<00:04:42.620> any<00:04:42.890> shape<00:04:43.340> or<00:04:43.580> direction<00:04:44.060> any<00:04:44.150> way<00:04:44.240> you

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
made any shape or direction any way you

can<00:04:44.420> have<00:04:44.510> them<00:04:44.600> going<00:04:44.750> straight<00:04:45.110> out<00:04:45.140> depends

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
can have them going straight out depends

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.930 
can have them going straight out depends
what<00:04:45.920> type<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.220> tree<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:46.460> wanna<00:04:46.580> paint<00:04:46.790> I

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
what type of tree you wanna paint I

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.370 
what type of tree you wanna paint I
guess<00:04:47.120> but<00:04:47.510> when<00:04:47.630> you've<00:04:47.750> done<00:04:47.870> that<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.140> just

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
guess but when you've done that you just

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.780 
guess but when you've done that you just
have<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.680> basic<00:04:48.860> branches<00:04:49.400> coming<00:04:49.640> out

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
have the basic branches coming out

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.240 
have the basic branches coming out
across<00:04:50.120> across<00:04:50.840> your<00:04:51.140> support<00:04:51.470> there<00:04:52.040> you<00:04:52.100> can

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
across across your support there you can

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.910 
across across your support there you can
start<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.580> think<00:04:52.700> a<00:04:52.970> little<00:04:53.090> bit<00:04:53.270> more<00:04:53.920> about

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
start to think a little bit more about

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.780 
start to think a little bit more about
your<00:04:55.190> your<00:04:55.550> light<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.600> your<00:04:57.560> direction<00:04:58.010> all

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
your your light and your direction all

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.400 
your your light and your direction all
I'm<00:04:59.030> doing<00:04:59.330> with<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.540> rigger<00:04:59.750> is<00:05:00.080> I'm<00:05:00.380> just

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
I'm doing with the rigger is I'm just

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.170 
I'm doing with the rigger is I'm just
basically<00:05:00.890> putting<00:05:01.400> it<00:05:01.460> to<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.730> to<00:05:02.060> the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
basically putting it to the to the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.090 
basically putting it to the to the
support<00:05:02.510> I'm<00:05:03.050> just<00:05:03.290> going<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.500> wiggle<00:05:03.710> in<00:05:03.920> it

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
support I'm just going to wiggle in it

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.010 
support I'm just going to wiggle in it
letting<00:05:04.850> the<00:05:04.970> brush<00:05:05.270> in<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.480> paint<00:05:05.570> do<00:05:05.900> the

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
letting the brush in the paint do the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.410 
letting the brush in the paint do the
work<00:05:06.200> for<00:05:06.530> me<00:05:06.740> I'm<00:05:07.160> not<00:05:07.220> that<00:05:07.760> worried<00:05:08.300> about

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
work for me I'm not that worried about

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.050 
work for me I'm not that worried about
it<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:09.830> know<00:05:09.890> doesn't<00:05:10.190> really<00:05:10.370> matter<00:05:10.730> too

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
it you know doesn't really matter too

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.620 
it you know doesn't really matter too
much<00:05:11.530> it's<00:05:12.530> it's<00:05:12.830> great<00:05:13.100> to<00:05:13.400> actually<00:05:13.730> allow

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
much it's it's great to actually allow

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.290 
much it's it's great to actually allow
the<00:05:14.690> paint<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.290> allow<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.590> brush<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:17.030> do<00:05:17.150> the

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
the paint and allow the brush to do the

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.360 
the paint and allow the brush to do the
work<00:05:17.450> for<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:17.900> it's<00:05:18.280> it's<00:05:19.280> quite

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
work for you it's it's quite

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.250 
work for you it's it's quite
invigorating<00:05:19.670> really<00:05:20.330> it's<00:05:20.690> quite<00:05:20.840> good<00:05:20.930> to

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
invigorating really it's quite good to

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.590 
invigorating really it's quite good to
be<00:05:21.350> able<00:05:21.410> to<00:05:21.560> do<00:05:21.710> that<00:05:21.890> quite<00:05:22.220> freeing<00:05:23.000> okay

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
be able to do that quite freeing okay

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.840 
be able to do that quite freeing okay
I've<00:05:23.870> done<00:05:23.990> some<00:05:24.260> basic<00:05:24.500> branches<00:05:25.130> there<00:05:25.340> now

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
I've done some basic branches there now

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.610 
I've done some basic branches there now
that<00:05:26.060> know<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.330> moon<00:05:26.540> and<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:27.260> tree<00:05:27.470> that's

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
that know the moon and the tree that's

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.870 
that know the moon and the tree that's
in<00:05:27.770> front<00:05:27.980> that's<00:05:28.160> going<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.430> be<00:05:28.520> pure

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
in front that's going to be pure

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.180 
in front that's going to be pure
silhouette<00:05:29.360> because<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:30.440> lights<00:05:30.620> behind<00:05:30.830> it

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
silhouette because the lights behind it

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.700 
silhouette because the lights behind it
it's<00:05:31.610> not<00:05:31.970> coming<00:05:32.510> from<00:05:32.900> any<00:05:33.170> direction<00:05:33.380> but

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
it's not coming from any direction but

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.140 
it's not coming from any direction but
behind<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.190> so<00:05:34.520> you're<00:05:34.610> not<00:05:34.700> gonna<00:05:34.850> get<00:05:35.000> any

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
behind it so you're not gonna get any

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.150 
behind it so you're not gonna get any
highlights<00:05:35.480> on<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.660> tree<00:05:35.990> trunk<00:05:36.200> or<00:05:36.680> on<00:05:37.040> the

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
highlights on the tree trunk or on the

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.770 
highlights on the tree trunk or on the
branch<00:05:37.400> there<00:05:37.730> that's<00:05:37.970> in<00:05:38.210> front<00:05:38.600> of<00:05:38.690> the

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
branch there that's in front of the

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.870 
branch there that's in front of the
front<00:05:38.990> of<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.260> actual<00:05:39.560> moon<00:05:39.770> so<00:05:40.550> what<00:05:40.730> you've

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
front of the actual moon so what you've

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.040 
front of the actual moon so what you've
got<00:05:40.910> to<00:05:41.120> think<00:05:41.150> about<00:05:41.420> is<00:05:41.690> you've<00:05:41.810> got<00:05:41.930> to

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
got to think about is you've got to

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.710 
got to think about is you've got to
think<00:05:42.230> about<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.680> actual<00:05:43.390> think<00:05:44.390> about<00:05:44.600> the

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
think about the actual think about the

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.390 
think about the actual think about the
actual<00:05:45.050> other<00:05:45.230> trees<00:05:45.590> and<00:05:45.620> other<00:05:45.950> branches

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
actual other trees and other branches

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.790 
actual other trees and other branches
and<00:05:47.060> where<00:05:47.810> the<00:05:47.960> highlights<00:05:48.290> will<00:05:48.410> be<00:05:48.530> on<00:05:48.650> out

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
and where the highlights will be on out

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.530 
and where the highlights will be on out
so<00:05:49.010> there's<00:05:49.220> there's<00:05:50.030> a<00:05:50.120> branch<00:05:50.300> coming

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
so there's there's a branch coming

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.970 
so there's there's a branch coming
across<00:05:50.720> here<00:05:51.050> now<00:05:51.260> you<00:05:51.320> don't<00:05:51.530> want<00:05:51.650> to<00:05:51.710> put<00:05:51.890> it

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
across here now you don't want to put it

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.440 
across here now you don't want to put it
underneath<00:05:52.280> you<00:05:52.580> need<00:05:52.730> to<00:05:52.820> go<00:05:52.940> on<00:05:53.030> top<00:05:53.240> of<00:05:53.390> this

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
underneath you need to go on top of this

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.880 
underneath you need to go on top of this
branch<00:05:53.720> to<00:05:55.030> bring<00:05:56.030> out<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.390> height<00:05:57.020> of<00:05:57.590> the

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
branch to bring out the height of the

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.040 
branch to bring out the height of the
light<00:05:58.040> coming<00:05:58.220> off<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.610> moon<00:05:58.820> make<00:05:59.720> sure<00:05:59.900> the

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
light coming off the moon make sure the

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.910 
light coming off the moon make sure the
paints<00:06:00.710> in<00:06:00.890> enough<00:06:01.570> otherwise<00:06:02.570> you'll<00:06:02.990> find

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
paints in enough otherwise you'll find

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.560 
paints in enough otherwise you'll find
it<00:06:04.040> hard<00:06:04.310> so<00:06:04.970> you<00:06:05.030> gotta<00:06:05.150> come<00:06:05.300> underneath

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
it hard so you gotta come underneath

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.020 
it hard so you gotta come underneath
here<00:06:05.930> otherwise<00:06:06.590> you'll<00:06:06.800> find<00:06:06.980> it<00:06:07.130> hard<00:06:07.400> to

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
here otherwise you'll find it hard to

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.570 
here otherwise you'll find it hard to
get<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:08.300> actual<00:06:09.010> the<00:06:10.010> highlight<00:06:10.370> and

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
get the actual the highlight and

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.550 
get the actual the highlight and
contrast<00:06:11.240> on<00:06:11.510> the<00:06:11.900> branches<00:06:12.290> that<00:06:12.320> you've

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
contrast on the branches that you've

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.720 
contrast on the branches that you've
done<00:06:13.510> same<00:06:14.510> here<00:06:14.900> you<00:06:15.560> know<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:15.890> moons<00:06:16.400> over

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
done same here you know the moons over

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.420 
done same here you know the moons over
here<00:06:17.540> so<00:06:18.140> you<00:06:18.170> could<00:06:18.320> do<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:18.590> light<00:06:18.800> under<00:06:19.310> the

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
here so you could do the light under the

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.280 
here so you could do the light under the
branch<00:06:19.640> where<00:06:19.880> it's<00:06:20.000> coming<00:06:20.450> up<00:06:20.630> and<00:06:23.290> you've

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
branch where it's coming up and you've

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.570 
branch where it's coming up and you've
got<00:06:24.530> to<00:06:24.620> keep<00:06:24.710> that<00:06:24.860> in<00:06:24.920> mind<00:06:25.220> the<00:06:25.400> whole<00:06:25.520> time

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
got to keep that in mind the whole time

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.390 
got to keep that in mind the whole time
if<00:06:25.820> you<00:06:25.880> want<00:06:26.120> to<00:06:26.240> make<00:06:26.660> it<00:06:26.780> more<00:06:26.930> realistic

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
if you want to make it more realistic

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.350 
if you want to make it more realistic
make<00:06:28.400> it<00:06:28.550> stand<00:06:28.760> out<00:06:28.850> more<00:06:29.030> there's<00:06:29.240> another

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
make it stand out more there's another

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.360 
make it stand out more there's another
branch<00:06:29.570> coming<00:06:29.960> this<00:06:30.110> way<00:06:30.320> because<00:06:31.250> it's

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
branch coming this way because it's

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.710 
branch coming this way because it's
going<00:06:31.670> that<00:06:31.760> way<00:06:31.940> all<00:06:32.090> the<00:06:32.120> lights<00:06:32.420> gonna<00:06:32.630> be

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
going that way all the lights gonna be

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.770 
going that way all the lights gonna be
on<00:06:32.810> the<00:06:32.930> top<00:06:33.110> of<00:06:33.140> the<00:06:33.320> branch<00:06:33.530> and<00:06:34.570> that's<00:06:35.570> it

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
on the top of the branch and that's it

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.780 
on the top of the branch and that's it
really<00:06:36.140> it's<00:06:36.290> it's<00:06:36.890> actually<00:06:37.100> quite<00:06:37.490> simple

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
really it's it's actually quite simple

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.999
