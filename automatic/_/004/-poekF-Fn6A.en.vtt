Sam Soliman spring this is one of the
largest<00:00:06.839> freshwater<00:00:07.680> pools<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:10.349> country

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
largest freshwater pools in the country

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.480 
largest freshwater pools in the country
million<00:00:12.870> gallons<00:00:13.500> per<00:00:13.740> hour<00:00:15.470> the<00:00:16.470> 3.5<00:00:17.190> million

million gallons per hour the 3.5 million
gallons<00:00:17.940> pour<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:19.260> water<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.949> always<00:00:20.250> between

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
gallons pour the water is always between

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
gallons pour the water is always between
72<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.779> 76<00:00:22.470> degrees<00:00:23.130> year-round<00:00:23.960> because<00:00:24.960> of

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
72 and 76 degrees year-round because of

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.310 
72 and 76 degrees year-round because of
the<00:00:25.439> underground<00:00:26.010> temperature<00:00:26.630> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.380> rocks

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
the underground temperature of the rocks

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.740 
the underground temperature of the rocks
pretty<00:00:31.320> neat<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> where<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.430> comes<00:00:32.640> from

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.049 

ok<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.500> shallow<00:00:37.860> end<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.460> here<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
ok so this the shallow end right here is

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.310 
ok so this the shallow end right here is
at<00:00:39.870> four<00:00:40.350> feet<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.640> then<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> moves<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
at four feet and then it moves on and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.650 
at four feet and then it moves on and
there's<00:00:44.010> some<00:00:44.250> different<00:00:44.700> stairs<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.420> come

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
there's some different stairs that come

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.190 
there's some different stairs that come
in<00:00:45.809> at<00:00:45.960> five<00:00:46.200> feet<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.660> here<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:48.989> this

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
in at five feet and here the so this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.279 
in at five feet and here the so this
this<00:00:49.590> de<00:00:49.920> marks<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.489> shallow<00:00:50.910> end<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
this de marks the shallow end then you

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.350 
this de marks the shallow end then you
go<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.710> vast<00:00:53.809> giant<00:00:54.809> area<00:00:55.530> right<00:00:55.890> here

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
go to this vast giant area right here

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.040 
go to this vast giant area right here
which<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.629> also<00:00:58.379> still<00:00:58.829> five<00:00:59.280> feet<00:00:59.960> but<00:01:00.960> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
which is also still five feet but you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.979 
which is also still five feet but you
could<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.469> how<00:01:01.649> big<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.539> we're<00:01:03.840> not

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
could see how big it is and we're not

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.560 
could see how big it is and we're not
even<00:01:04.170> close<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.790> whole<00:01:09.030> thing<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
even close to the whole thing and
