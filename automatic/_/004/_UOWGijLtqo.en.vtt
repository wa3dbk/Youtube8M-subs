00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.410
 then guys welcome inside 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.950
 this unboxing I should lose minutes of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.509
 precious time to describe how and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.480
 chair can get to be 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.800
 considered the shit though oh well me 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.000
 I want to keep a good memory of the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.580
 video therefore toxic of the r x10 of sony 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.380
 this is my graduation present 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.880
 grandparents 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.420
 I wanted to open it before thanking thank you 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.250
 francesco because he lost us the hours a 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.170
 in short, choose a model that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.589
 could be suitable for my needs 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.640
 sony because I have always used it anyway 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.110
 sony cameras and I didn't feel like 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.610
 then abandon the brand anyway 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.769
 Francesco put his reason in it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.210
 in short he likes sony and so much 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.150
 then finally between a chat 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.920
 just these john 4 is some 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.449
 call in short we arrived at 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.080
 conclusion that this could be the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.390
 model for me then leaving it alone 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.390
 other speeches we go immediately to open it 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.670
 there's my usual boxcutter then 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.870
 a different package by sony 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:31.670
 that the player makes a bad guarantee 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:37.070
 accessories and manual entries 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.070
 and we go to shape where we find 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:48.530
 a rx 10 lace then another necklace 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:55.880
 a urlaccio then we find cable of 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:59.060
 power adapter usb in short for 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.760
 charge the usb cable itself 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.310
 micro usb 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:09.860
 the npf battery w50 series w 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:17.540
 we are from four parties we go to her on 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:21.550
 weight here it is then here here is the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.970
 room is really heavy 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.710
 here we have the lens cover now not 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.390
 I'm here to tell you about the features 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.160
 techniques both because of course not 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.810
 I remember from memory and because 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.380
 otherwise, dealing with godelli is logical 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.380
 I flash 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:46.720
 the connector for the port doors 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:52.090
 additional tiltable display here 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:57.350
 we find the audio input audio output 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.400
 micro hdmi and micro usb selector for the 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.120
 focus 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.209
 then we have a top display for 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.860
 in short, to have brought an eye 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.670
 all the various functions the selector 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.910
 of functions and to the left on the right 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.739
 we find the exposure regulator 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.450
 and then several programmable buttons go 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:22.730
 Well here turn off power is down here 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.200
 instead we have a ring for 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.850
 select and programmable 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.440
 completely different buttons too 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.500
 these programmable the key of 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.660
 video recording button menu the bio 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.250
 find you find I don't remember me 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.260
 call the oled screen anyway 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.710
 and oh well and then everything else from 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.390
 then customize here I do not think what time 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.430
 then he has another thing I saw 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.940
 very much on the internet selector 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.370
 focus that has clicks but if 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.100
 we turn off here it becomes silent for 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.740
 shoot videos without feeling precisely the 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.930
 click and then the rest in short now 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.930

 stick and cards sd place of the nfc also 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.180
 the wifi therefore in terms of connectivity 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.829
 it is quite advanced that I do not have left 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.299

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.709
