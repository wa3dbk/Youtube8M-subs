arguments for using the droid my plan

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.319 
arguments for using the droid my plan
the<00:03:05.870> iphone<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.290> good<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.799> this<00:03:07.310> yes<00:03:07.849> it<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.150> and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
the iphone is good to this yes it is and

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.940 
the iphone is good to this yes it is and
when<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.510> starts<00:03:08.810> dropping<00:03:09.019> calls<00:03:09.440> i'll<00:03:09.769> be

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
when it starts dropping calls i'll be

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.619 
when it starts dropping calls i'll be
and<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.430> think<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.879> that<00:03:10.909> might<00:03:11.180> be<00:03:11.599> the

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
and I think that that might be the

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.750 
and I think that that might be the
biggest<00:03:11.900> drawback<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.859> iphone<00:03:13.190> is<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
biggest drawback to the iphone is the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.110 
biggest drawback to the iphone is the
AT&amp;T<00:03:14.150> network<00:03:14.389> that's<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.609> main<00:03:16.609> complaint

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
AT&amp;T network that's the main complaint

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.160 
AT&amp;T network that's the main complaint
that<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.329> hear<00:03:17.359> but<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:17.989> is<00:03:18.139> a<00:03:18.170> really<00:03:18.470> big<00:03:18.620> I

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
that I hear but this is a really big I

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.470 
that I hear but this is a really big I
think<00:03:21.170> Apple<00:03:21.889> really<00:03:22.069> opened<00:03:22.639> up<00:03:22.790> themselves

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
think Apple really opened up themselves

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.619 
think Apple really opened up themselves
to<00:03:24.019> competition<00:03:24.650> not<00:03:24.829> because<00:03:25.159> of<00:03:25.190> their

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
to competition not because of their

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.859 
to competition not because of their
service<00:03:26.629> that<00:03:26.810> they<00:03:26.959> put<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:27.260> product<00:03:27.530> on
