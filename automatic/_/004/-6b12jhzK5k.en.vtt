that<00:06:05.249> engine<00:06:05.580> was<00:06:05.699> supposed<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.270> be<00:06:06.449> good

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
that engine was supposed to be good

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.459 
that engine was supposed to be good
that's<00:06:07.680> why<00:06:07.860> it<00:06:07.919> was<00:06:08.129> kept<00:06:08.990> it's<00:06:09.990> probably

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:10.469 
that's why it was kept it's probably

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:11.959 
that's why it was kept it's probably
been<00:06:10.589> in<00:06:10.710> storage<00:06:10.949> for<00:06:11.129> a<00:06:11.279> good<00:06:11.430> few<00:06:11.580> years<00:06:11.789> now

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
been in storage for a good few years now

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.309 
been in storage for a good few years now
so<00:06:11.999> it's<00:06:12.210> hard<00:06:12.479> to<00:06:12.599> know<00:06:12.719> what<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:12.930> story<00:06:13.199> is

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
so it's hard to know what the story is

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.129 
so it's hard to know what the story is
with<00:06:13.469> it<00:06:13.710> and<00:06:14.610> there<00:06:14.879> is<00:06:14.969> no<00:06:15.300> front<00:06:15.629> pulley<00:06:15.930> not

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
with it and there is no front pulley not

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:17.809 
with it and there is no front pulley not
on<00:06:16.319> these<00:06:16.439> engines<00:06:16.889> unfortunately<00:06:17.520> so<00:06:17.729> you

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
on these engines unfortunately so you

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.159 
on these engines unfortunately so you
can't<00:06:17.999> just<00:06:18.150> stick<00:06:18.300> a<00:06:18.360> socket<00:06:18.629> on<00:06:18.779> it<00:06:18.839> and<00:06:19.080> see

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
can't just stick a socket on it and see

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.920 
can't just stick a socket on it and see
what<00:06:19.319> a<00:06:19.349> turn<00:06:19.589> after<00:06:20.520> staked<00:06:20.879> starter<00:06:21.629> off<00:06:21.779> it

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
what a turn after staked starter off it

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.010 
what a turn after staked starter off it
and<00:06:22.080> turn<00:06:22.259> it<00:06:22.409> over<00:06:22.529> on<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:24.120> ring<00:06:24.569> gear<00:06:24.779> but

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
and turn it over on the ring gear but

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.629 
and turn it over on the ring gear but
hopefully<00:06:25.650> we<00:06:25.770> get<00:06:25.889> a<00:06:25.949> good<00:06:26.129> few<00:06:26.310> bits<00:06:26.490> off

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
hopefully we get a good few bits off

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.489 
hopefully we get a good few bits off
that<00:06:26.879> engine<00:06:27.180> and<00:06:27.330> this<00:06:27.870> is<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.110> other<00:06:28.229> engine

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:28.499

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:30.559 
that engine and this is the other engine
that<00:06:28.650> I<00:06:28.680> got<00:06:28.889> not<00:06:29.639> really<00:06:29.669> too<00:06:30.150> sure<00:06:30.180> what

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 
that I got not really too sure what

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.059 
that I got not really too sure what
that's<00:06:30.689> out<00:06:30.930> of<00:06:30.990> to<00:06:31.319> be<00:06:31.379> honest<00:06:31.620> I'm<00:06:31.860> just

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:33.649 
that's out of to be honest I'm just
assuming<00:06:32.339> it's<00:06:32.669> a<00:06:32.759> Morris<00:06:32.999> Minor<00:06:33.150> but<00:06:33.419> I<00:06:33.449> could

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
assuming it's a Morris Minor but I could

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.100 
assuming it's a Morris Minor but I could
be<00:06:33.779> wrong

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
be wrong

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.959 
be wrong
it<00:06:34.469> is<00:06:34.589> a<00:06:34.620> Morris<00:06:34.979> engine<00:06:35.339> and<00:06:35.550> it's<00:06:35.699> from<00:06:35.879> a

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
it is a Morris engine and it's from a

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.540 
it is a Morris engine and it's from a
rear-wheel<00:06:36.300> drive<00:06:36.330> car<00:06:36.889> now<00:06:37.889> I<00:06:37.919> didn't<00:06:38.219> expect

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
rear-wheel drive car now I didn't expect

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.920 
rear-wheel drive car now I didn't expect
to<00:06:38.580> get<00:06:38.759> this<00:06:38.819> engine<00:06:39.330> but<00:06:39.449> again<00:06:39.689> it<00:06:39.810> was<00:06:39.899> in

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
to get this engine but again it was in

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.189 
to get this engine but again it was in
storage<00:06:40.199> and<00:06:41.509> actually<00:06:42.509> got<00:06:42.629> to<00:06:42.719> prefer<00:06:42.990> a<00:06:43.020> the

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
storage and actually got to prefer a the

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.269 
storage and actually got to prefer a the
guy<00:06:43.289> didn't<00:06:43.589> want<00:06:43.620> it<00:06:43.830> at<00:06:43.919> all

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
guy didn't want it at all

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:48.249 
guy didn't want it at all
so<00:06:44.819> I<00:06:45.289> seems<00:06:46.289> to<00:06:46.379> be<00:06:46.559> a<00:06:46.589> few<00:06:46.889> things<00:06:46.919> honest

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
so I seems to be a few things honest

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:50.209 
so I seems to be a few things honest
distributor<00:06:49.259> is<00:06:49.379> down<00:06:49.529> here<00:06:49.800> on<00:06:49.919> the<00:06:50.009> side<00:06:50.189> of

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219 
distributor is down here on the side of

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:54.950 
distributor is down here on the side of
the<00:06:50.399> engine<00:06:52.939> maybe<00:06:53.939> you<00:06:54.180> might<00:06:54.330> know<00:06:54.479> exactly

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
the engine maybe you might know exactly

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.629 
the engine maybe you might know exactly
what<00:06:55.199> this<00:06:55.349> is<00:06:55.529> out<00:06:55.680> of<00:06:55.860> android<00:06:56.189> let<00:06:56.370> me<00:06:56.520> know

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
what this is out of android let me know

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.239 
what this is out of android let me know
but<00:06:57.599> I<00:06:57.659> really<00:06:58.289> am<00:06:58.379> thinking<00:06:58.740> Morris<00:06:58.979> Minor

00:06:59.239 --> 00:06:59.249 
but I really am thinking Morris Minor

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:01.790 
but I really am thinking Morris Minor
that's<00:07:00.089> also<00:07:00.419> it's<00:07:00.569> not<00:07:00.719> seized<00:07:01.020> up<00:07:01.229> which<00:07:01.649> is

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
that's also it's not seized up which is

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.519 
that's also it's not seized up which is
nice<00:07:01.979> although<00:07:02.339> it<00:07:03.330> does<00:07:03.479> turn<00:07:03.749> very<00:07:04.229> very

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:04.529 
nice although it does turn very very

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:06.709 
nice although it does turn very very
easily
