00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.860
 Explain 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.840
 I was in a plane and the plane there 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.150
 crashed you swear he had the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.920
 baraka imagine that for example 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.480
 this sheet of paper there that thing ok here 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.850
 it is the plane of agreement at a slight decline 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.609
 for you see well here's the plane he has 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.320
 Chobo done like this and like that the bin 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.300
 sheet of paper bob will blow him up 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.090
 like that I tell you the bwiti like that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.480
 it's so beautiful that it exploded 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.190
 it was just incredible unbelievable 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 short now I find myself on this 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.790
 small desert island I had to leave in 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.739
 reporting to brazil to make a small 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.320
 reporting too much sexuality in the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.879
 south american south country unfortunately 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.420
 and well I'm here I do not know 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.129
 too much to do 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.840
 ultimately use this camera 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.550
 to film my days because if a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.320
 day someone we find this camera 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.879
 and that I would be dead maybe I 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 will be in the history books that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.610
 may know that I would become 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.449
 someone interesting and all that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.059
 would be nice 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.949
 so here I am told that I was going 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.809
 introduce you to my life on this island 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.489
 desert and just waiting for I 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.600
 makes me a little shit and I'm going 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.180
 start right now in you 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.560
 presenting the little corner of paradise in 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.409
 which I am currently housing 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.069
 that him 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.719
 day number one and here I am going to 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.780
 present can present you the 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.340
 the place that serves me as housing 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.899
 currently he works and that I 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.409
 just arrived on this island 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.539
 it's a pretty heavenly place 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.609
 quite high enough we will be able 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.380
 we can say it simply 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.909
 because just suspects that there are others 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.950
 people who survived this crash 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.630
 plane and it allows me to have a small 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.549
 sense of security given that 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.250
 the enemy will then have to climb that 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.020
 big hill and I'll have time for the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.270
 simulate and destroy it before he 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.489
 does not reach my little dwelling which is this 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.000
 if a house with a very beautiful design 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:55.890
 that I designed myself 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.689
 so it's a house that has two 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.590
 benefits of 1 she is very beautiful because 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.170
 that it's me who did it 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.299
 and two she is incredibly 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.189
 kouyou like to say why well 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.569
 I will explain the borders 17 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.450
 houses are built with the 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.609
 stone of volcanoes and yes just that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.930
 so the stone of volcanoes it's insinu 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.519
 that I had to go to a volcano and that 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.019
 I say to the risky my life to go 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.299
 look for this stone so the guy who 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.639
 wants to come here he'll say but hey 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.739
 dude has masset-depasse balls that 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.840
 the ace of volcano stones you come out of 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.280
 house border and I say yeah 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.109
 I have massive balls 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.060
 finally no I'm going to type before because 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.349
 it's a year and a half but I would not have 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.700
 not even need to hit hard and that 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.530
 this person who will zy role to 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.840
 massive cuts and ben he goes 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.130
 certainly jumped to run away 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.340
 and at the same time make someone in 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.260
 his pants and moreover this wood that has 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.760
 its beautiful by the way is a beautiful 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.069
 constituted of cana heavens you email 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.290
 what the fuck you can not even imagine the 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.760
 Ton of sugar cane you need 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.280
 to produce a wood of this 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.799
 excellence in my opinion you need at least 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.000
 the equivalent of a whale take by 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.030
 example the blue whale the whale 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.629
 blue weighs I believe one hundred and seventy 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.480
 tons 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.620
 so I think it takes at least 170 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.810
 tons of sugar cane 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.610
 if my information is good for 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.870
 produce this house and you think 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.069
 I really have to fuck 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.629
 produce the equivalent of a whale 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.220
 blue sugar cane 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.170
 No, I do not care about this 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.260
 all I think about survival first 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.440
 so I explored my little corner of 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.810
 paradise and I found it tribe a 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.030
 tribe of living people yes people 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.159
 who live there and their 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.049
 houses are entirely made up of this 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.790
 wood what did they have to spend 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.170
 centuries and centuries to produce 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.590
 sugar cane to build their 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.590
 House 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.810
 these people said they're so massive 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.090
 me and me like I do not have that to football 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.680
 I offered them to negotiate and so 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.329
 I managed to get some wood 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.040
 negotiations went very well 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.440
 past 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.630
 Hello 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.680
 I would like to negotiate to get a little 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:04:01.800
 of your wood this one 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:04.290
 so I want wood and ain ok ok I 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.790
 we will continue here so come 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.440
 to say sam what are you planting 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.750
 plants of the beuh no I do not plant 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.310
 of toil I do not plant the weed I 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.020
 plant carrots people because 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.570
 carrots are an incredible source 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.100
 force to eat a carrot a day you 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.709
 will allow by forty fifty 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.420
 to get the popeye force what is 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.700
 quite impressive besides I 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.320
 find it's been thirteen years since I 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.080
 eat a carrot a day from here 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.940
 a few years I'll be there so I 'll be there 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.110
 that's about where I 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.640
 I 'm making but I have a 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.140
 last surprise for you are going to me 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.030
 say that then you talked to us 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.510
 of exploration yes I explored a little 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.220
 my world 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.490
 you will say but how did you do 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:46.080
 well people I built a 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.030
 racing car of category has more it seems to me 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.770
 well according to my evaluations that you 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.450
 present you are going to see that a mass 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.660
 quite a lot of cenves flock into 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.849
 your penis is in the world I people 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.439
 I was going to show you 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.330
 this small racing car I just 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.559
 build but in the meantime I got 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.729
 made attack by a tribe of this 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.259
 that she is rather particular 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.939
 luckily I had time to 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.330
 make a spear and I 'm going for 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:11.699
 attack them a parent to attack this 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.509
 flying boat and yes it's the racing 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.159
 I told you about 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.199
 do you have the rod now 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.309
 yes I am convinced and yes I plan 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.209
 sugar cane because I believed 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.679
 that I was going to succeed in doing this 

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:22.800
 home and that can I knew that I had 

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:24.270
 but no it was not enough yes and 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.139
 as I wanted to say I do not have that 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.490
 to fuck planting sugar cane 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:32.490
 so I stopped this racing car 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.339
 the sb 54 1927 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.409
 a race car just incredible 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.999
 designed two my little cares and he got me 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.279
 taken at least three days to 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:42.929
 to make it's just beautiful game 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.909
 you 'll have a little ride think that 

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:46.439
 you certainly have a lot of blood 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.599
 who flock to your penis but in 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.429
 anyway here we are going to be very 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.479
 soon I think for a new day 

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:55.830
 a new adventure and maybe a 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.429
 new discovery in this world 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.529
 unbelievable 

00:05:56.429 --> 00:06:00.269
 and so that's the end of my 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:01.289
 first adventures I hope anyway 

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:03.539
 that you will have liked 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.889
 we will certainly discover others 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.789
 things together you'll see it's going 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.839
 to be fantastic 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.839
 in the meantime I want
