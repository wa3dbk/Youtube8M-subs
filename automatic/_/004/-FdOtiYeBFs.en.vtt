00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:03.320 
okay for bag routing we're going to

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.740 
okay for bag routing we're going to
start<00:00:03.649> with<00:00:03.919> our<00:00:04.130> cuttings<00:00:04.730> as<00:00:05.240> you<00:00:05.360> can<00:00:05.510> see

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
start with our cuttings as you can see

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.960 
start with our cuttings as you can see
they<00:00:05.930> already<00:00:06.170> have<00:00:06.470> a<00:00:06.700> rooting<00:00:07.700> hormone

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
they already have a rooting hormone

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.499 
they already have a rooting hormone
powder<00:00:08.570> on<00:00:08.870> the<00:00:08.990> end<00:00:09.309> and<00:00:10.309> then<00:00:10.519> we<00:00:10.700> I<00:00:11.209> use

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
powder on the end and then we I use

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.720 
powder on the end and then we I use
pleated<00:00:12.019> sandwich<00:00:12.650> bags<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.309> cheap<00:00:13.549> little

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
pleated sandwich bags the cheap little

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.360 
pleated sandwich bags the cheap little
thin<00:00:14.059> ones<00:00:14.299> a<00:00:15.019> lot<00:00:15.440> of<00:00:15.589> people<00:00:15.829> think<00:00:16.100> that<00:00:16.219> the

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:16.370 
thin ones a lot of people think that the

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.610 
thin ones a lot of people think that the
zip<00:00:16.580> locks<00:00:16.820> are<00:00:17.060> too<00:00:17.270> thick<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:17.960> plastics<00:00:18.470> too

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:18.620 
zip locks are too thick the plastics too

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.980 
zip locks are too thick the plastics too
thick<00:00:18.890> and<00:00:19.070> it<00:00:19.640> sticks<00:00:20.090> to<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:20.360> roots<00:00:20.720> and

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
thick and it sticks to the roots and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.830 
thick and it sticks to the roots and
breaks<00:00:21.830> them<00:00:22.010> off<00:00:22.190> I<00:00:22.820> think<00:00:23.420> I've<00:00:23.690> had<00:00:23.810> a

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
breaks them off I think I've had a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.480 
breaks them off I think I've had a
little<00:00:23.990> more<00:00:24.170> success<00:00:24.650> with<00:00:24.860> this<00:00:25.100> than<00:00:25.340> with

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
little more success with this than with

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.970 
little more success with this than with
the<00:00:25.670> zip<00:00:25.850> locks<00:00:26.120> and<00:00:26.390> they're<00:00:26.600> cheaper<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:27.110> use

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
the zip locks and they're cheaper I use

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.060 
the zip locks and they're cheaper I use
a<00:00:28.010> size<00:00:28.340> 32<00:00:28.790> rubber<00:00:29.180> band<00:00:29.800> I've<00:00:30.800> got<00:00:30.980> the

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
a size 32 rubber band I've got the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.700 
a size 32 rubber band I've got the
little<00:00:31.310> pin<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:32.840> we<00:00:32.930> can<00:00:33.079> write<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.350> date<00:00:33.560> on

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
little pin so we can write the date on

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.760 
little pin so we can write the date on
it<00:00:33.740> then<00:00:34.550> I<00:00:34.640> use<00:00:34.820> a<00:00:34.850> coconut<00:00:35.270> core<00:00:35.750> as<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.530> main

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
it then I use a coconut core as the main

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.040 
it then I use a coconut core as the main
rooting<00:00:37.220> medium<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:37.730> then<00:00:38.510> I<00:00:38.540> put<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:38.900> little

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
rooting medium and then I put a little

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.520 
rooting medium and then I put a little
hummus<00:00:39.790> inside<00:00:40.790> of<00:00:40.910> it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
hummus inside of it

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.830 
hummus inside of it
okay<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.040> basically<00:00:43.579> we<00:00:43.970> start<00:00:44.300> with<00:00:44.570> the

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
okay so basically we start with the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.090 
okay so basically we start with the
sandwich<00:00:45.470> bag<00:00:45.680> I'm<00:00:46.239> going<00:00:47.239> to<00:00:47.329> write<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:48.829> date

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
sandwich bag I'm going to write the date

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.160 
sandwich bag I'm going to write the date
on<00:00:49.340> it<00:00:51.700> so<00:00:52.700> that<00:00:52.970> I<00:00:53.000> know<00:00:53.120> how<00:00:53.570> long<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:53.930> takes

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
on it so that I know how long it takes

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.430 
on it so that I know how long it takes
to<00:00:54.290> root<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:56.059> I'm<00:00:56.180> going<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:56.360> take<00:00:56.540> it<00:00:56.720> and<00:00:57.320> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
to root and I'm going to take it and the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.229 
to root and I'm going to take it and the
coconut<00:00:57.829> core<00:00:58.070> is<00:00:58.219> just<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.489> little<00:00:58.730> damp<00:00:58.910> it's

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
coconut core is just a little damp it's

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.150 
coconut core is just a little damp it's
got<00:00:59.420> it's<00:00:59.719> a<00:00:59.809> little<00:01:00.260> wetness<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:00.620> it<00:01:00.860> it's<00:01:00.980> not

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
got it's a little wetness to it it's not

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
grab it backwards like this it's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.090 
grab it backwards like this it's
important<00:01:38.810> at<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.020> point<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.560> try<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:39.950> get

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
important at this point to try and get

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.160 
important at this point to try and get
this<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.310> inflate<00:01:41.560> so<00:01:42.560> it's<00:01:42.710> full<00:01:42.979> of<00:01:43.009> air<00:01:43.280> and

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
this to inflate so it's full of air and

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.789 
this to inflate so it's full of air and
take<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.290> rubber<00:01:45.500> band<00:01:45.590> put<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:46.580> around<00:01:46.939> it

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
take the rubber band put it around it

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.969 
take the rubber band put it around it
just<00:01:48.799> keep<00:01:48.979> going<00:01:49.250> around<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:50.000> around<00:01:50.979> with

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
just keep going around and around with

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.840 
just keep going around and around with
it<00:01:53.259> you've<00:01:54.259> got<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.409> nice<00:01:54.680> seal<00:01:55.040> as<00:01:55.340> with<00:01:55.580> any<00:01:55.759> of

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
it you've got a nice seal as with any of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.190 
it you've got a nice seal as with any of
the<00:01:55.909> moisture<00:01:56.180> out<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:58.450> that's<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.689> no

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
the moisture out and that's it no

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.650 
the moisture out and that's it no
problem
