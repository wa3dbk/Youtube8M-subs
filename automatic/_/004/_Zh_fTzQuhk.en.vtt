00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
somewhere all right we don't want these

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.900 
somewhere all right we don't want these
two<00:03:31.170> cards<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.620> start<00:03:31.800> off<00:03:32.040> with<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.670> then<00:03:32.700> we

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
two cards to start off with and then we

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.800 
two cards to start off with and then we
want<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.150> play<00:03:33.330> this<00:03:33.510> again<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:34.050> start<00:03:34.380> here<00:03:38.810> if

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
want to play this again to start here if

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.600 
want to play this again to start here if
we<00:03:39.930> can<00:03:40.080> hit<00:03:40.200> him<00:03:40.260> at<00:03:40.500> least<00:03:40.680> once<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.520> we<00:03:41.580> can

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
we can hit him at least once and we can

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.580 
we can hit him at least once and we can
take<00:03:41.820> them<00:03:41.970> out<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.330> worm<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.440> let's

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
take them out with the worm so let's

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.390 
take them out with the worm so let's
hope<00:03:43.740> it<00:03:43.860> does

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
hope it does

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.040 
hope it does
all<00:03:44.790> right<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:45.150> kills<00:03:45.330> them<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:45.840> trade

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
all right it kills them so that trade

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.770 
all right it kills them so that trade
one<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:46.320> one<00:03:46.730> which<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:47.910> optimal<00:03:48.390> trading

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
one for one which is optimal trading

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.540 
one for one which is optimal trading
efficiency<00:03:49.260> then<00:03:49.440> we<00:03:49.530> get<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.860> damage<00:03:50.160> on<00:03:50.310> him

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
efficiency then we get to damage on him

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.340 
efficiency then we get to damage on him
which<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.150> perfect<00:03:51.600> now<00:03:51.840> we<00:03:51.870> can<00:03:52.110> continue

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
which is perfect now we can continue

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.380 
which is perfect now we can continue
with<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.740> I<00:03:53.250> don't<00:03:53.580> think<00:03:53.730> we've<00:03:53.850> got<00:03:54.000> anyone

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
with this I don't think we've got anyone

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.040 
with this I don't think we've got anyone
