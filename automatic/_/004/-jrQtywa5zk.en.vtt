00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.620 

with<00:00:10.200> my<00:00:10.380> dad<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> used<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.190> go

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
with my dad I used to go

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.840 
with my dad I used to go
and<00:00:13.080> he<00:00:13.440> would<00:00:13.590> teach<00:00:13.770> me<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.130> trees<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.760> the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
and he would teach me the trees and the

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.670 
and he would teach me the trees and the
plants<00:00:14.970> and<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.660> mushrooms<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.410> things<00:00:16.560> like

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
plants and the mushrooms and things like

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
plants and the mushrooms and things like
that<00:00:16.860> and<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.930> guess<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.800> just<00:00:19.830> enjoy<00:00:20.460> doing

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
that and so I guess I just enjoy doing

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.980 
that and so I guess I just enjoy doing
that<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.600> later<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.510> like<00:00:24.510> learning<00:00:24.720> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
that and later on I like learning a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.420 
that and later on I like learning a
little<00:00:25.140> bit<00:00:25.230> about<00:00:25.410> plants<00:00:25.950> and<00:00:26.070> things<00:00:26.250> like

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
little bit about plants and things like

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.940 
little bit about plants and things like
that<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.000> finally<00:00:27.990> when<00:00:28.290> they<00:00:28.439> came<00:00:28.650> time<00:00:28.919> to

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
that so finally when they came time to

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.110 
that so finally when they came time to
go<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.630> university<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> decided<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:32.120> biology

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
go to university I decided that biology

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.290 
go to university I decided that biology
would<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> neat<00:00:33.780> thing<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.910> got

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
would be a neat thing to do so I got

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.830 
would be a neat thing to do so I got
into<00:00:36.660> biology<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:38.489> once<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.660> biology

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
into biology and once I was in biology

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.440 
into biology and once I was in biology
then<00:00:40.380> I<00:00:40.620> couldn't<00:00:41.220> decide<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.880> like<00:00:41.910> plants

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
then I couldn't decide if I like plants

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.520 
then I couldn't decide if I like plants
or<00:00:42.570> animals<00:00:43.020> better<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:45.240> had<00:00:45.840> friends<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.380> had

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
or animals better so I had friends I had

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
or animals better so I had friends I had
they<00:00:46.650> already<00:00:46.890> chosen<00:00:47.250> birds<00:00:47.700> or<00:00:47.940> plants<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
they already chosen birds or plants and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.540 
they already chosen birds or plants and
they<00:00:48.570> were<00:00:48.630> already<00:00:49.290> fanatics<00:00:50.070> about<00:00:50.340> these

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
they were already fanatics about these

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.340 
they were already fanatics about these
things<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:50.970> I<00:00:51.030> could<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> couldn't<00:00:51.780> decide<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
things but I could I couldn't decide and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.040 
things but I could I couldn't decide and
then<00:00:53.220> as<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.760> went<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.480> studies<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
then as I went on with my studies I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.960 
then as I went on with my studies I
figured<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.470> what<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.400> like<00:00:56.580> is<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
figured out what I really like is the

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.260 
figured out what I really like is the
interactions<00:00:57.810> between<00:00:58.820> different<00:00:59.820> animals

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
interactions between different animals

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.970 
interactions between different animals
or<00:01:00.480> different<00:01:00.780> plants<00:01:00.990> or<00:01:01.440> animals<00:01:01.860> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
or different plants or animals and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.969 
or different plants or animals and
plants<00:01:02.490> or<00:01:03.019> interactions<00:01:04.019> between<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
plants or interactions between the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.149 
plants or interactions between the
environment<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.689> organisms<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.979> that's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
environment and the organisms so that's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700 
environment and the organisms so that's
how<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.369> became<00:01:08.880> an<00:01:09.030> ecologist<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:10.439> study

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
how I became an ecologist to study

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
how I became an ecologist to study
interactions<00:01:11.460> between<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.509> food<00:01:12.720> webs

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
interactions between in the food webs

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.819 
interactions between in the food webs
and<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.700> influence<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.960> animals<00:01:16.649> and

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
and the influence of the animals and

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.800 
and the influence of the animals and
plants<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> environment<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
plants on the environment and the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539 
plants on the environment and the
influence<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> environment<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
influence of the environment on the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.639 
influence of the environment on the
animals<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.060> plants<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.079> then<00:01:22.289> I<00:01:22.350> don't<00:01:22.530> have

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
animals and plants so then I don't have

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.590 
animals and plants so then I don't have
to<00:01:22.770> choose<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.429> want<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.880> more<00:01:24.090> animals

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to choose if I want to do more animals

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.440 
to choose if I want to do more animals
or<00:01:24.749> more<00:01:24.929> plants<00:01:25.429> but<00:01:26.429> over<00:01:26.850> time<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.149> also

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
or more plants but over time I also

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.749 
or more plants but over time I also
figured<00:01:27.929> out<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> liked<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.710> lot<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
figured out I liked a lot the the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.620 
figured out I liked a lot the the
mysteries<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.499> lives<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.340> water<00:01:32.630> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
mysteries of what lives in the water the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.539 
mysteries of what lives in the water the
water<00:01:33.810> looks<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.829> all<00:01:35.069> the<00:01:35.310> same

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
water looks like it's all the same

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
water looks like it's all the same
everywhere<00:01:35.969> it's<00:01:36.359> very<00:01:36.600> flat<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.200> it's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
everywhere it's very flat and it's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
everywhere it's very flat and it's
transparent<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.700> seems<00:01:38.999> like

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
transparent and it seems like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.020 
transparent and it seems like
everything's<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> same<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.259> once<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.560> look

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
everything's the same but once you look

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.160 
everything's the same but once you look
under<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.179> water<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
under the water and you see the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.739 
under the water and you see the
creatures<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:44.009> I've<00:01:44.280> got<00:01:44.609> very<00:01:45.270> interested

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:45.749 
creatures and I've got very interested

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:47.330 
creatures and I've got very interested
in<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.959> so<00:01:46.259> then<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.499> became<00:01:46.679> an<00:01:47.039> aquatic

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
in that so then I became an aquatic

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.429 
in that so then I became an aquatic
ecologist<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:50.119> so<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> worked<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.959> a<00:01:52.079> quadric

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
ecologist so so I worked in a quadric

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.050 
ecologist so so I worked in a quadric
ecology<00:01:52.889> for<00:01:53.039> a<00:01:53.069> little<00:01:53.280> bit<00:01:53.429> and<00:01:53.639> then<00:01:53.789> I<00:01:53.819> was

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
ecology for a little bit and then I was

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.449 
ecology for a little bit and then I was
hired<00:01:54.270> by<00:01:54.479> Parks<00:01:54.780> Canada<00:01:54.929> and<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:56.159> I'm<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
hired by Parks Canada and now I'm a

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.149 
hired by Parks Canada and now I'm a
northern<00:01:56.729> ecologist<00:01:57.569> and<00:01:57.810> they<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.289> a<00:01:58.469> lot<00:01:59.009> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
northern ecologist and they do a lot of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.830 
northern ecologist and they do a lot of
different<00:01:59.490> things<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.999> very<00:02:00.029> little<00:02:00.420> aquatic

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
different things and very little aquatic

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.309 
different things and very little aquatic
ecology<00:02:01.529> now<00:02:01.709> I<00:02:01.950> learn<00:02:02.520> about<00:02:02.850> permafrost<00:02:03.359> sea

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
ecology now I learn about permafrost sea

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:10.249 
ecology now I learn about permafrost sea
ice<00:02:05.810> tundra<00:02:06.810> plants<00:02:07.310> remote<00:02:08.310> sensing<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
ice tundra plants remote sensing but the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.410 
ice tundra plants remote sensing but the
I've<00:02:10.740> done<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.400> tiny<00:02:11.580> bit<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.000> aquatic
