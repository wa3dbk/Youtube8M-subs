00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
our party in sections and I'll come each

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.580 
our party in sections and I'll come each
section<00:03:01.780> but<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:02.830> started<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.370> back<00:03:04.590> versus

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
section but I started the back versus

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.500 
section but I started the back versus
the<00:03:05.769> front<00:03:06.160> because<00:03:06.400> it's<00:03:06.700> easier<00:03:07.209> for<00:03:07.269> me

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
the front because it's easier for me

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.430 
the front because it's easier for me
that<00:03:07.660> way<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:13.569> combing<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.019> out<00:03:14.170> in<00:03:14.350> the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
that way and combing it out in the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.000 
that way and combing it out in the
shower<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:15.069> so<00:03:15.370> much<00:03:15.640> better<00:03:15.940> than<00:03:16.930> on<00:03:17.380> because

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
shower is so much better than on because

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.250 
shower is so much better than on because
when<00:03:18.340> it's<00:03:18.489> like<00:03:18.700> really<00:03:19.090> really<00:03:19.390> wet<00:03:19.780> it's

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
when it's like really really wet it's

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.229 
when it's like really really wet it's
real<00:03:20.650> good<00:03:20.890> for<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.519> calm<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.880> out<00:03:22.000> that

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
real good for you to calm it out that

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:29.039 
real good for you to calm it out that
way<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:26.790> can<00:03:27.790> get<00:03:27.940> through<00:03:28.209> those<00:03:28.330> tangles

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
way I can get through those tangles

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.490 
way I can get through those tangles
better<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:31.420> whether<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.900> is<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.739> better<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.069> is

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
better so whether it is the better it is

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.039 
better so whether it is the better it is
and<00:03:35.500> then<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.760> know<00:03:36.910> as<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.269> comb<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.690> out<00:03:37.810> I

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
and then you know as I comb it out I

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.250 
and then you know as I comb it out I
start<00:03:38.410> from<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.830> at<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.580> bottom<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.260> I

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
start from the at the bottom and I

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.650 
start from the at the bottom and I
worked<00:03:41.530> my<00:03:41.680> way<00:03:41.709> up<00:03:42.130> calming<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.030> tangles<00:03:43.480> out

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
worked my way up calming the tangles out

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.860 
worked my way up calming the tangles out
and<00:03:44.440> you'll<00:03:45.160> notice<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.640> I'm<00:03:46.120> not<00:03:46.390> pulling

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
the calm down forcing that tangle out I

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.660 
the calm down forcing that tangle out I
keep<00:03:51.010> picking<00:03:51.519> it<00:03:51.609> until<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:53.440> on<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:54.250> tangle

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
keep picking it until it on the tangle

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.979 
keep picking it until it on the tangle
comes<00:03:54.880> out<00:03:56.880> I'll<00:03:57.880> do<00:03:58.000> that<00:03:58.209> all<00:03:58.510> over<00:04:00.540> until<00:04:01.540> my

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.589 
it out in cold water I try to do it as
cold<00:04:54.810> as<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.110> can<00:04:55.289> stand<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.860> sometimes<00:04:56.849> a<00:04:57.240> bit

reason why you're going to rinse it in
cold<00:05:02.400> water<00:05:02.849> is<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:04.680> cold<00:05:04.979> water<00:05:05.310> actually

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
cold water is the cold water actually

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.420 
cold water is the cold water actually
actually<00:05:07.880> shuts<00:05:08.880> your<00:05:09.660> cuticle<00:05:10.229> so<00:05:10.979> they<00:05:11.099> can

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
actually shuts your cuticle so they can

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.170 
actually shuts your cuticle so they can
trap<00:05:11.820> that<00:05:11.849> moisture<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.810> answer<00:05:13.169> your<00:05:13.289> hair

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
but you're not rinsing all of it your

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.890 
but you're not rinsing all of it your
length<00:05:19.590> you're<00:05:19.949> actually<00:05:20.669> trapping<00:05:21.330> some<00:05:21.690> of

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
length you're actually trapping some of

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.680 
length you're actually trapping some of
it<00:05:22.080> within<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.860> hair<00:05:23.099> strand<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:24.210> it<00:05:24.389> allows

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
it within the hair strand and it allows

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.610 
it within the hair strand and it allows
that<00:05:24.960> moisture<00:05:25.470> to<00:05:25.680> stay<00:05:25.889> in<00:05:27.139> and<00:05:28.139> you<00:05:28.409> just
