00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.940
 well first of all might be 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.960
 Asking Hypnosis for the Paok 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.640
 backyard 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.350
 we realize that you like it very much 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.910
 the opening of the bread in the pot 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.560
 Thinking about it, we're going to take the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.539
 opening the trading session choose to create a 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.439
 a new frame that will 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.119
 have animations 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.220
 We still do not know if you want to 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.840
 It's going to be weekly but let's start 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.850
 work on it then why could I 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.980
 without opening and you will gain a 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.149
 new frame focused on the animation was then 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.590
 Let's learn the pop 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.300
 first is great news on 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.399
 simpsons the family is one thing I 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 I never imagined it would happen will 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.660
 happen a simple will find 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.309
 family and the episode is 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.410
 within the family series will be called 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.850
 the simpsons funny guy watch this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.800
 happen because you even had an event not 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.870
 is flex showing the reality of 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 I voted for those who do not 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.770
 colligem simple test and vice versa 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.629
 I think I should have this episode 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.190
 I do not know how to do the movie. 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.750
 customers did not make a movie where 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.070
 they found the jacksons 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.110
 anyway this will still take a while 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.479
 to be released will only be 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.400
 there around September of the year 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.380
 that comes later, let's talk about a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.600
 news about comicon people do not have 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.700
 table is in the club attends news 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.439
 popping up in one of these news the new 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.350
 x-men movie under the direction of 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.210
 varzinha that is based on that hq the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.890
 x-men called the forgotten future day 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.240
 that the first image of the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.710
 sentinels for those who do not know the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.960
 sentinels are those giant robots 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.450
 that stripped the sex or the look of the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.700
 seven years I respect the look of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.579
 some comics written from those they 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.610
 a little color the nÃ© that the sentinels have 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.960
 and something design like that but chose 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.759
 a glass tube in europe 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.680
 especially in my pocket now I 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.990
 I do not confirm to comment on this. I think 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.090
 that you will see involvement with power 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.630
 make a more elaborate critique for 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.540
 while I know there as soon as this movie 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.579
 is that they release photos showing the visual 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.670
 of the x-men in this movie between the photos 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.689
 the bishop is the character bishop and the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.969
 Greek government 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.009
 I was far away what would happen mba 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.850
 with due to the photos that released seven 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.590
 technical 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.990
 we got to no mobileme photo 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.000
 old and finally use a vehicle 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.590
 that type that the white hair and that 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.150
 appears on the sides that I only see the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.710
 comics does not fit the real world 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.420
 still within this universe of super 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.090
 heroes of the cinema games also first 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.980
 teaser of the spectacular spider man 2 no 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.690
 performer shows a lot but presents 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.640
 The tram I already told you what I found 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.070
 the electrons I know it is based on 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.620
 recently there has been a much shorter 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.690
 this reflex team taking a lot of 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.660
 I did a time of at least 11 denials 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.180
 in the 1997 batman robin film and only 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.330
 remember this 97 bomb just about me do 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.380
 remember that failure since it no longer 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.060
 inspires confidence 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.190

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.880
