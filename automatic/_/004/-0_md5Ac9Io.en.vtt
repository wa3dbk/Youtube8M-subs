00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.760 
hey guys today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.310> draw<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.790> diamond<00:00:03.300> as<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.259> can<00:00:04.440> see<00:00:04.740> I

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
to draw a diamond as you can see I

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.639 
to draw a diamond as you can see I
really<00:00:05.160> drew<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.240> outline<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.750> my<00:00:06.990> diamond

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
really drew the outline of my diamond

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.589 
really drew the outline of my diamond
because<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.220> wanted<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.519> make<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.849> video<00:00:09.059> fast

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
because I wanted to make this video fast

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.009 
because I wanted to make this video fast
and<00:00:10.080> easy<00:00:10.500> for<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.920> guys<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.219> understand<00:00:12.030> so

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
and easy for you guys to understand so

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.900 
and easy for you guys to understand so
let's<00:00:13.230> get<00:00:13.469> started<00:00:14.960> the<00:00:15.960> first<00:00:15.990> thing<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.910> do

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
let's get started the first thing to do

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.580 
let's get started the first thing to do
to<00:00:18.180> draw<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> diamond<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:19.020> least<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:19.410> me<00:00:19.560> I

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
to draw a diamond at least for me I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.189 
to draw a diamond at least for me I
start<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> top<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> diamond<00:00:21.270> all

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
start from the top of the diamond all

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.769 
start from the top of the diamond all
you<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.590> make<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.830> straight<00:00:23.279> line<00:00:25.130> like<00:00:26.130> that

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
you do is make a straight line like that

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.540 
you do is make a straight line like that
then<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.960> make<00:00:28.109> two<00:00:28.410> lines<00:00:28.619> going<00:00:29.130> outward

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
then you make two lines going outward

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.950 
then you make two lines going outward
like<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:31.250> as<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.850> I'm<00:00:33.510> repeating

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
like this as you can see I'm repeating

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.810 
like this as you can see I'm repeating
the<00:00:34.170> same<00:00:34.710> step<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.399> side<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the same step to this side of the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.910 
the same step to this side of the
diamond<00:00:36.980> like<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.780> then<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.960> make<00:00:40.620> two

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
diamond like that then you make two

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.060 
diamond like that then you make two
lines<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.340> inward<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:45.950> then<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
lines going inward like this then you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.670 
lines going inward like this then you
make<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> straight<00:00:47.670> line<00:00:50.239> like<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.530> then<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
make a straight line like that then you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.590 
make a straight line like that then you
make<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> line<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.610> basically<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> same

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
make the line you basically do the same

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.060 
make the line you basically do the same
thing<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.079> side<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> connect<00:00:55.649> these<00:00:55.829> two

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
thing to this side and connect these two

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.069 
thing to this side and connect these two
lines<00:00:57.230> like<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:59.300> then<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> make<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.809> line

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
lines like that then you make a line

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.380 
lines like that then you make a line
going<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.620> water<00:01:03.830> like<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.150> then<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.240> make

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
going out water like that then you make

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.880 
going out water like that then you make
the<00:01:06.510> line<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.900> inward<00:01:08.210> like<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.770> then<00:01:10.770> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the line going inward like this then you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.149 
the line going inward like this then you
connect<00:01:11.159> those<00:01:11.430> these<00:01:12.299> two<00:01:12.570> lines

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.969 

then<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.210> repeat<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.630> same<00:01:16.780> step<00:01:17.079> to<00:01:17.829> this

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
then you repeat the same step to this

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:28.169 
then you repeat the same step to this
side<00:01:18.189> of<00:01:18.219> the<00:01:18.340> dam<00:01:21.929> got<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:27.939> can<00:01:28.090> at

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
side of the dam got this then you can at

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.959 
side of the dam got this then you can at
least<00:01:28.359> remove<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.459> can<00:01:30.579> see<00:01:30.729> it's<00:01:30.850> not

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
least remove as you can see it's not

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.929 
least remove as you can see it's not
that<00:01:31.179> hard<00:01:31.450> it's<00:01:31.689> just<00:01:32.280> different<00:01:33.280> steps<00:01:33.640> and

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
that hard it's just different steps and

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.830 
that hard it's just different steps and
you'll<00:01:34.689> be<00:01:34.929> able<00:01:35.049> to<00:01:35.229> do<00:01:35.380> this<00:01:35.530> then<00:01:35.890> connect

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you'll be able to do this then connect

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.249 
you'll be able to do this then connect
the<00:01:37.840> middle<00:01:38.020> line<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:41.020> that's

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
the middle line to this and that's

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.770 
the middle line to this and that's
basically<00:01:42.069> the<00:01:42.280> top<00:01:42.459> of<00:01:42.670> your<00:01:42.819> diamond<00:01:43.149> now

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
basically the top of your diamond now

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.719 
basically the top of your diamond now
you<00:01:43.840> do<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.140> bottom<00:01:44.469> of<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.709> of<00:01:45.069> your<00:01:45.250> diamond

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
you do the bottom of the of your diamond

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.839 
you do the bottom of the of your diamond
which<00:01:46.000> is<00:01:46.030> basically<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.750> triangle<00:01:49.439> so

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
which is basically a triangle so

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:53.539 
which is basically a triangle so
understaffing<00:01:51.849> the<00:01:52.060> bottom<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.659> my<00:01:52.689> paper

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
understaffing the bottom of my paper

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:06.300 
understaffing the bottom of my paper
then<00:01:54.549> when<00:01:54.759> we<00:01:54.849> saw

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:15.570 

like<00:02:06.909> that<00:02:07.860> finish<00:02:08.860> out<00:02:09.039> from<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.280> pile

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.730 

that<00:02:16.570> in

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.990 

like<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.930> basically<00:02:25.620> how<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.640> draw

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
like that this is basically how you draw

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.870 
like that this is basically how you draw
a<00:02:27.060> diamond<00:02:27.890> here's<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.010> close-up<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
a diamond here's a close-up of the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.250 
a diamond here's a close-up of the
diamond<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.840> drew<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:35.570> hope<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.750> guys<00:02:36.870> like
