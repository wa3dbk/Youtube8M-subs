the game and get back to a point similar
to<00:00:27.330> where<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.480> had<00:00:27.660> gotten<00:00:27.840> before<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.800> there

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
to where I had gotten before and there

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
to where I had gotten before and there
was<00:00:29.910> another<00:00:30.090> glitch<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.689> encountered<00:00:31.289> in

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
was another glitch that I encountered in

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.920 
was another glitch that I encountered in
which<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.579> game<00:00:32.759> wouldn't<00:00:33.090> recognize<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.870> I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
which the game wouldn't recognize that I

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.220 
which the game wouldn't recognize that I
had<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.469> my<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.760> those<00:00:36.300> people<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
had all of my all those people the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.520 
had all of my all those people the
collars<00:00:37.680> at<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.940> fountain<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:40.170> would<00:00:40.379> not

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
collars at the fountain it would not

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.310 
collars at the fountain it would not
recognize<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.790> from<00:00:42.660> what<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> had<00:00:43.079> tried

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
recognize that and from what I had tried

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.869 
recognize that and from what I had tried
to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.530> there<00:00:43.739> was<00:00:43.860> no<00:00:44.070> way<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> could<00:00:44.489> get<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
to do there was no way I could get it to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.639 
to do there was no way I could get it to
do<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.300> dog<00:00:45.870> had<00:00:46.140> somehow<00:00:46.379> become

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
do it because dog had somehow become

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.360 
do it because dog had somehow become
glitched

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
glitched

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.670 
glitched
so<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.760> had<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> go<00:00:48.600> back<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.960> an<00:00:49.079> older<00:00:49.410> save

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so I had to go back to an older save

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.950 
so I had to go back to an older save
state<00:00:50.219> I'm<00:00:50.789> calling<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.420> same<00:00:51.600> state<00:00:51.809> I've

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
state I'm calling the same state I've

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.290 
state I'm calling the same state I've
had<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.500> back<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> an<00:00:52.860> older<00:00:53.100> save<00:00:53.370> now<00:00:54.270> I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
had to go back to an older save now I

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
had to go back to an older save now I
have<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> go<00:00:54.660> back<00:00:54.960> into<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> place<00:00:55.590> go

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
have to go back into the place go

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.849 
have to go back into the place go
through<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> whole<00:00:57.059> motion<00:00:57.329> again<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.050> try

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
through the whole motion again and try

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
through the whole motion again and try
and<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.129> back<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.930> approximately<00:01:00.930> where<00:01:01.079> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and get back to approximately where I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.740 
and get back to approximately where I
was<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.030> frustrated<00:01:03.359> with

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
was so I'm a little bit frustrated with

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
was so I'm a little bit frustrated with
this<00:01:04.019> game<00:01:04.229> again<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
this game again because this is the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.899 
this game again because this is the
second<00:01:06.060> time<00:01:06.299> I've<00:01:07.170> had<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> I've<00:01:08.400> had<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> do

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
second time I've had to I've had to do

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.870 
second time I've had to I've had to do
something<00:01:09.299> similar<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.700> whenever<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
something similar to this so whenever I

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.399 
something similar to this so whenever I
get<00:01:12.000> back<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.600> I'll<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:13.020> back<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.200> making

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
