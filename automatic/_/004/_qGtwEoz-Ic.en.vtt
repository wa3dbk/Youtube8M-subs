you are so right now it says beach

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.480 
you are so right now it says beach
because<00:01:51.840> I'm<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> beach<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.189> was<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
because I'm on the beach so if I was to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.039 
because I'm on the beach so if I was to
go<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.909> believe<00:01:54.210> her<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.720> were<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.899> go<00:01:55.020> over

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
go I believe her if I were to go over

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.859 
go I believe her if I were to go over
into<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.710> grassland<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:57.299> right<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
into the grassland like right here I

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.929 
into the grassland like right here I
think<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.350> would<00:01:58.380> say<00:01:58.710> force<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.610> now<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.909> says

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
think it would say force so now it says

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.429 
think it would say force so now it says
for<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.509> that's<00:02:00.659> pretty<00:02:00.810> cool<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.170> whatever

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
islands so we can kind get a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.199 
islands so we can kind get a
demonstration<00:02:23.379> doesn't<00:02:24.159> matter<00:02:24.310> how<00:02:24.879> long

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
demonstration doesn't matter how long

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.270 
demonstration doesn't matter how long
the<00:02:25.420> range<00:02:25.629> is<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.959> can<00:02:26.080> go<00:02:26.230> across<00:02:26.860> like<00:02:26.980> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
the range is it can go across like the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.500 
the range is it can go across like the
freaking<00:02:27.610> world<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:27.970> don't<00:02:28.030> think<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:28.360> really

cool and then we'll go back and we can
pick<00:03:08.260> our<00:03:08.500> current<00:03:08.829> location<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.400> let's<00:03:09.430> say

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
pick our current location so let's say

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.339 
pick our current location so let's say
we<00:03:09.819> want<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:09.970> pick<00:03:10.060> our<00:03:10.209> kernel<00:03:10.480> location<00:03:10.840> then

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
we want to pick our kernel location then

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.039 
we want to pick our kernel location then
it<00:03:11.530> will<00:03:11.620> just<00:03:11.829> hop<00:03:12.040> us<00:03:12.220> off<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.700> patch<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.480> now

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
it will just hop us off the patch so now

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.119 
it will just hop us off the patch so now
you're<00:03:14.170> probably<00:03:14.319> wondering<00:03:14.650> well<00:03:14.799> is<00:03:15.010> that

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
you're probably wondering well is that

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.220 
you're probably wondering well is that
it<00:03:15.430> that's<00:03:15.819> all<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.000> can<00:03:16.269> do<00:03:16.450> well<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:17.049> is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
it that's all you can do well this is

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.509 
it that's all you can do well this is
probably<00:03:17.440> going<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.829> be<00:03:17.919> the<00:03:18.069> best<00:03:18.220> part<00:03:18.459> of

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
probably going to be the best part of

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.620 
probably going to be the best part of
the<00:03:18.609> mod<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.239> can<00:03:19.450> teleport<00:03:20.049> through

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
the mod you can teleport through

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.789 
the mod you can teleport through
multi-dimension<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:22.989> that's<00:03:23.470> why<00:03:23.590> we<00:03:23.709> have

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
multi-dimension so that's why we have

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.319 
multi-dimension so that's why we have
another<00:03:24.010> portal<00:03:24.400> in<00:03:24.489> front<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.790> us<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.030> if<00:03:25.150> we

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
another portal in front of us so if we

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.270 
another portal in front of us so if we
were<00:03:25.419> to<00:03:25.569> hop<00:03:25.810> into<00:03:26.109> this<00:03:26.230> now<00:03:26.410> nether<00:03:26.889> portal

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
were to hop into this now nether portal

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.849 
were to hop into this now nether portal
wait<00:03:27.639> for<00:03:27.849> it<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:28.030> download<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:29.200> terrain<00:03:29.590> and

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
wait for it to download the terrain and

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.699 
wait for it to download the terrain and
now<00:03:30.220> we<00:03:30.280> are<00:03:30.549> in<00:03:30.579> the<00:03:30.940> nether<00:03:31.269> so<00:03:31.780> let's<00:03:32.169> say<00:03:32.410> we

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
now we are in the nether so let's say we

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.789 
now we are in the nether so let's say we
want<00:03:32.919> to<00:03:32.980> put<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:33.549> portal<00:03:34.180> right<00:03:34.720> here<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.440> then

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
want to put a portal right here and then

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.199 
want to put a portal right here and then
we<00:03:35.980> want<00:03:36.129> to<00:03:36.250> name<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.459> out<00:03:36.669> let's<00:03:36.879> not<00:03:37.000> name<00:03:37.180> it

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.909 
go in and let's say we want to go back
to<00:03:55.359> Sand<00:03:55.599> Island<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:56.109> we<00:03:56.139> can<00:03:56.319> click<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.650> and

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
to Sand Island so we can click that and

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.589 
to Sand Island so we can click that and
we<00:03:57.190> will<00:03:57.340> come<00:03:57.549> all<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.090> way<00:03:58.120> back<00:03:58.209> here<00:03:58.540> to

we will come all the way back here to
Sand<00:03:59.199> Island<00:03:59.440> and<00:04:00.040> then<00:04:00.160> obviously<00:04:00.340> our

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669

YouTube teleportation thing will be over

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.250 
YouTube teleportation thing will be over
there<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.400> can<00:04:03.549> have<00:04:03.730> as<00:04:03.940> many<00:04:04.690> as<00:04:04.840> you

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
there so you can have as many as you

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.470 
there so you can have as many as you
want<00:04:05.290> basically<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.549> don't<00:04:06.879> know<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.209> can<00:04:07.329> just

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
want basically I don't know you can just

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.270 
want basically I don't know you can just
have<00:04:07.660> like<00:04:07.690> tons<00:04:08.169> of<00:04:08.319> them<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.530> guess<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.010> if<00:04:09.160> we

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
have like tons of them I guess so if we

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.849 
have like tons of them I guess so if we
were<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.430> put<00:04:09.609> like<00:04:09.790> 4<00:04:10.569> out<00:04:10.780> here<00:04:11.169> I<00:04:11.319> guess<00:04:11.590> and

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
were to put like 4 out here I guess and

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.920 
were to put like 4 out here I guess and
then<00:04:12.040> let's<00:04:12.370> go<00:04:12.549> ahead<00:04:12.819> and<00:04:13.030> hop<00:04:13.239> in<00:04:13.449> just<00:04:13.720> one

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
then let's go ahead and hop in just one

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.059 
then let's go ahead and hop in just one
of<00:04:14.049> them<00:04:14.139> and<00:04:14.290> let's<00:04:14.440> see<00:04:14.590> if<00:04:14.680> we<00:04:14.769> can<00:04:14.889> have

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
of them and let's see if we can have

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.120 
of them and let's see if we can have
like<00:04:15.250> 4<00:04:15.669> other<00:04:16.000> Beach<00:04:16.419> locations<00:04:17.229> so<00:04:17.590> let's

can<00:04:24.780> either<00:04:24.930> hit<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.140> X<00:04:25.380> button<00:04:25.500> or<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.920> can

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
can either hit the X button or you can

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.470 
can either hit the X button or you can
just<00:04:26.190> hit<00:04:26.250> current<00:04:26.580> location<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.150> hop<00:04:27.300> out

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
just hit current location just hop out

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.000 
just hit current location just hop out
of<00:04:27.540> it<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:28.110> we<00:04:28.230> want<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.470> go<00:04:28.530> ahead<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.710> destroy

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
of it so we want to go ahead and destroy

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.440 
of it so we want to go ahead and destroy
those<00:04:29.220> so<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:29.520> can<00:04:29.610> have<00:04:29.850> as<00:04:29.970> many<00:04:30.120> as<00:04:30.300> you

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
those so you can have as many as you

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.210 
those so you can have as many as you
want<00:04:30.480> so<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:30.810> think<00:04:30.900> it's<00:04:31.140> really<00:04:31.410> useful<00:04:31.770> if

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
want so I think it's really useful if

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.940 
want so I think it's really useful if
for<00:04:32.280> example<00:04:32.850> at<00:04:33.450> your<00:04:33.660> house<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.560> only<00:04:34.710> had

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
for example at your house you only had

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.950 
for example at your house you only had
one<00:04:34.980> of<00:04:35.280> these<00:04:35.430> telly<00:04:35.730> pads<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.300> then<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.810> go

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
one of these telly pads and then to go

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.360 
one of these telly pads and then to go
out<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.230> other<00:04:37.380> places<00:04:37.680> like<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.130> would<00:04:38.250> have

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
out to other places like you would have

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.220

one<00:04:38.760> for<00:04:39.030> mining<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.540> would<00:04:39.630> have<00:04:39.750> one<00:04:39.990> for

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
one for mining you would have one for

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.680 
one for mining you would have one for
nether<00:04:40.470> mine<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:41.010> would<00:04:41.130> have<00:04:41.280> one<00:04:41.580> for<00:04:41.970> your

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
nether mine you would have one for your

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.720 
nether mine you would have one for your
tree<00:04:42.960> harvest<00:04:43.380> farm<00:04:43.650> your<00:04:43.920> animal<00:04:44.310> farm<00:04:44.580> you
