designs you see for younger people to
play<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.520> probably<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.630> bit<00:00:33.809> less

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
play with probably a little bit less

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.780 
play with probably a little bit less
strengthen<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> lot<00:00:34.800> more<00:00:34.920> fun<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.430> involved

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
strengthen a lot more fun is involved

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.400 
strengthen a lot more fun is involved
because<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.600> three<00:00:36.809> people<00:00:37.260> join

less<00:00:43.590> advanced<00:00:43.950> once<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:44.579> yeah<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.239> once<00:00:45.450> on

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
less advanced once then yeah so once on

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.049 
less advanced once then yeah so once on
there<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.020> what's<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.649> right<00:00:47.489> okay<00:00:47.850> here

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
there and what's on here right okay here

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.400 
there and what's on here right okay here
we<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:53.660> triple<00:00:54.660> bounce<00:00:54.870> i<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.289> there's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
we go triple bounce i think there's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.630 
we go triple bounce i think there's
slightly<00:00:55.620> different<00:00:55.980> racket<00:00:56.129> certainly

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
slightly different racket certainly

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.549 
slightly different racket certainly
there's<00:00:56.820> much<00:00:57.000> bigger<00:00:57.329> than<00:00:57.420> squash<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
there's much bigger than squash so it

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:11.240 
there's much bigger than squash so it
makes<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.920> easier<00:01:06.619> she<00:01:07.619> says<00:01:08.930> yes<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
makes it easier she says yes but you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.980 
makes it easier she says yes but you
carry<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.640> playing<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.840> let's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
