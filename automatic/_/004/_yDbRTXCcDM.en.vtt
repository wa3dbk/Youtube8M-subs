00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.240
 so hello and welcome to this 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.020
 little presentation of my 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:26.000
 rubik's cube's personal collection 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.189
 currently we start we start 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.259
 by the most standard ie this 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.190
 that you find in store the small 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:37.010
 rubicube two by two without being 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.960
 naughty it's all shit 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.750
 simply igjs badly he's fighting a little 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.100
 little and more if you ever have the 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:54.350
 woe to turn like this 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:57.500
 he dismounted here see do not hold 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.010
 it is in addition to the inside there are huge 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.870
 pieces that's it so I'm the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.370
 advises against people who 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.990
 would like to buy 1 2 by 2 I 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.200
 advise against the official mark 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.410
 Rubicube is really big 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.850
 stew so apart that you have 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.229
 always official mark that you 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.150
 find songs in the Kora or 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.280
 usual rubik's cube in general 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.350
 you always start by buying 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.450
 that kind of stuff 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 so you have to know it's a rubik's 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.030
 cube that rotates very very very bad it 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.970
 do no trouble if you ever 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.970
 want for example if you ever are 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.829
 in this slightly shifted position 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:46.430
 wanted to turn it turns very very 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.149
 very bad it happens it does not slip 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.280
 not fluid 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.110
 if you want to try spic 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.030
 united speed qu bling and that is to say 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.619
 in fact speed 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.369
 it's not even worth trying in 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.150
 these cases use instead marks 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:12.020
 less known in France but yet 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:15.660
 official kind dyan simply 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:20.160
 it's him it 's impeccable fluid 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.310
 see I put cats and it goes all 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.310
 only 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.650
 here is more flop is not flop 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.420
 that's what happened on the two by 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.690
 two actually it's you do that help 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.420
 for all so goes up in addition to 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.390
 inside the dai hành when you 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.810
 want to disassemble it you have a 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.720
 but a little here you have this little 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.310
 object there this little notch that has an anti 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.850
 flop simply 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.260
 keith incarcerated between the in between 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.140
 corners and that just makes it not 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.510
 to make pop is an anti pop not sorry 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.060
 flop an anti pop so as not to do 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.040
 pop and the cube 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.630
 when you go when you do is 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.239
 remembered that you are doing speed 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.790
 with we see the mark dyan who is 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.329
 recognized anyway during the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.940
 speed contest 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.790
 you also have the brand lived ben me 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.049
 I have a lived bull that is the same 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.799
 frankly I find it more fluid 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:32.430
 that the dai hành so the moisséens days 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.250
 and she but I find it so much 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.459
 this one is a great anti pop and 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.980
 more look at that when you 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.000
 cards and that's they do not dismount 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.750
 to pass is really heavy 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.239
 perfect this one slides even better and 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:57.359
 same if you turn it you see there 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:58.850
 I put on your lightly and come back to 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:03.220
 its starting point 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.660
 no problem trying to do that with 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.990
 with the brand rubik's cube you do not 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:13.310
 will never arrive so it's super like that 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.540
 shows himself alone against you there 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.480
 do not have the anti flop yet 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.570
 holding hip hop that's why 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.709
 he is more likely to disassemble himself but 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.020
 honestly I have never had any 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:31.700
 problem with then that's so yes it's 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.230
 a gamecube version version 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.320
 mark rubik's cube actually I took a 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.090
 rubik's normal cube and I changed 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:44.780
 all the labels and I made myself 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:46.970
 in fact a theme more like that here I am 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.810
 found that I found the principle 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.580
 nice after that it's just a 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:58.070
 bead cube that I made myself 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:00.890
 like that something else then a cube in 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.680
 flower shape so here it's the same 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.190
 movements are impressive really 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.400
 very very impressive accurate game 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.640
 that's where you actually have winged them 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.860
 sides moving in the direction there and that 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.159
 it is 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.949
 it's the same so washed from the yen the lady 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:27.219
 there is some matter to do in there 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.669
 it's really cult worship 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:33.729
 pump is here too 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:38.729
 frankly I'm here I love them and 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:43.870
 finally a little last in cubes pyramid 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:49.930
 that moves very easily for the 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:53.529
 to dismount is the same they dismount 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.919
 really like a nothing need not 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:58.180
 big thing make it grow slightly 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.580
 no I do not know in which way 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.259
 that I believe 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.870
 yeah again 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.360
 and that's how in fact the interior 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.389
 quite simply 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:15.279
 so you have little holes and on 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:19.870
 the sides are shaped like 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:21.490
 1000 votes are little balls here 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.940
 it's the sound we actually hear 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:30.339
 when you do it read it it's 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:33.400
 that's really it's really 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:34.960
 good this firth and if you want you 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.569
 have fun in trains in stuff 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.569
 like that it's the ideal 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:48.389
 the principle is the principle is perfect 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.839
 and you'd think it's simple to do 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:53.439
 but frankly not as much as 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:57.600
 could believe 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:07:02.700
 so that was the presentation 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.560
 May 2 cubes of my rubik's cube and if I 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.060
 had to give people advice for 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.980
 to buy it does not start and especially not 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.830
 so with the official brand rubicube 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:14.820
 which costs 15 18 euros bought 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:18.270
 directly either a vehicle or a die 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.280
 and then she where there are different kinds 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.770
 of die and then she is in version 2 5 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.200
 currently 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.280
 you will have the same price as rugby q 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.890
 it costs the same 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.220
 and in addition the quality is really 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.910
 better there's no picture on it so 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.410
 here 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:40.050
 leave to pay 15 or 18 euros HT 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:42.150
 cetc kubla rather than one rather than a street 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.580
 a so-called official cube of 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:47.220
 mark rubik's cube which is really of 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.210
 shit here it will be all for the 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.100
 short presentation 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:53.780
 thank you go now 

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.780
