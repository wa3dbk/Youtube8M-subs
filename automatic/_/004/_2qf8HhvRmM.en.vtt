00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
very ash and very brass free but I think

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.600 
very ash and very brass free but I think
it's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.720> very<00:01:51.899> very<00:01:52.500> good<00:01:52.799> result<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.340> done

wonders<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.570> my<00:01:54.810> hair<00:01:55.049> lifted<00:01:55.829> my<00:01:55.979> roots<00:01:56.340> up

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
wonders for my hair lifted my roots up

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.870 
wonders for my hair lifted my roots up
and<00:01:57.119> pretty<00:01:57.990> much<00:01:58.140> knocked<00:01:58.469> out<00:01:58.759> majority<00:01:59.759> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and pretty much knocked out majority of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.550 
and pretty much knocked out majority of
the<00:01:59.939> brass<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.630> there's<00:02:00.960> still<00:02:01.110> some<00:02:01.320> brass

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
the brass and there's still some brass

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.459 
the brass and there's still some brass
but<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:02.130> not<00:02:02.820> fast<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.479> overall<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> think

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
but I'm not fast and overall I think

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.460 
but I'm not fast and overall I think
it's<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.340> good<00:02:05.670> hair<00:02:06.210> dye

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470
