00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.320 

ok<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.659> area<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.170> shaded<00:01:46.650> in<00:01:47.120> this<00:01:48.120> is<00:01:48.300> a

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
ok so the area just shaded in this is a

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.390 
ok so the area just shaded in this is a
perfect<00:01:48.810> diamond<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.620> so<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.740> idea<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.130> is

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
perfect diamond and so the idea here is

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.310 
perfect diamond and so the idea here is
that<00:01:57.200> that's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.350> very<00:01:58.560> strange<00:01:58.950> hole<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that that's a very strange hole to be a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.670 
that that's a very strange hole to be a
glitch<00:02:01.970> not<00:02:02.970> perfect<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:04.490> so
