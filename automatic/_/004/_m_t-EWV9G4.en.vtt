reasons<00:01:49.610> first<00:01:49.940> off<00:01:50.119> maybe<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.840> form<00:01:51.050> factor

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
reasons first off maybe the form factor

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.149 
reasons first off maybe the form factor
is<00:01:51.410> very<00:01:51.680> nice

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
is very nice

the<00:01:58.110> sensor<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.009> user<00:01:59.219> upgradeable<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.119> it's

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the sensor is user upgradeable and it's

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.910 
the sensor is user upgradeable and it's
a<00:02:00.329> module<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.750> pop<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.320> off<00:02:01.409> that's<00:02:01.680> quite

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
a module to pop in and off that's quite

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
a module to pop in and off that's quite
amazing<00:02:02.390> that's<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.570> want<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
amazing that's what we want to do in the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.120 
amazing that's what we want to do in the
beginning<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.649> think<00:02:04.829> they<00:02:04.890> kind<00:02:05.009> of

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
beginning but I think they kind of

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.400 
beginning but I think they kind of
strayed<00:02:05.369> from<00:02:05.520> that

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.640 

in<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.890> court<00:02:09.160> draw<00:02:09.370> that<00:02:10.440> captures<00:02:11.440> great

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
in the court draw that captures great

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.990 
in the court draw that captures great
pork<00:02:11.950> anyway<00:02:12.280> so<00:02:12.520> many<00:02:12.670> good<00:02:12.790> things<00:02:12.820> about

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
pork anyway so many good things about

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.250 
pork anyway so many good things about
the<00:02:13.210> year<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.540> reason<00:02:13.840> why<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:13.930> hadn't<00:02:14.140> pull

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
the year so the reason why I hadn't pull

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.810 
the year so the reason why I hadn't pull
the<00:02:14.320> trigger<00:02:14.530> yet<00:02:14.710> cuz<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.070> my<00:02:15.280> rent<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.640> still

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
the trigger yet cuz a my rent is still

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.860 
the trigger yet cuz a my rent is still
very<00:02:15.940> relevant<00:02:16.120> but<00:02:17.110> also<00:02:17.380> because<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.490> earth

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
very relevant but also because the earth

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.500 
very relevant but also because the earth
was<00:02:19.870> playing<00:02:20.350> ketchup<00:02:20.710> still<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.330> think<00:02:22.330> we're

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
was playing ketchup still I think we're

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.420 
was playing ketchup still I think we're
about<00:02:22.690> on<00:02:22.750> par<00:02:23.050> now<00:02:23.230> between<00:02:23.530> what<00:02:23.650> my<00:02:23.980> my

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
about on par now between what my my

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.940 
about on par now between what my my
startup<00:02:24.790> can<00:02:24.970> do<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.240> what<00:02:25.330> they're<00:02:25.480> offering

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
startup can do and what they're offering

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.250 
startup can do and what they're offering
so<00:02:27.510> that's<00:02:28.510> something<00:02:28.720> I'm<00:02:28.930> quite<00:02:29.080> excited

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
so that's something I'm quite excited

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.900 
so that's something I'm quite excited
about<00:02:29.500> no<00:02:29.680> reason<00:02:29.890> what<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.040> want<00:02:30.550> one<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
about no reason what I want one of the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.270 
about no reason what I want one of the
downsides<00:02:31.210> about<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.840> main<00:02:32.680> camera<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.130> it

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
downsides about the main camera is it

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.660 
downsides about the main camera is it
still<00:02:33.520> shoots<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.180> big<00:02:34.420> at<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.780> camera<00:02:35.670> besides

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
still shoots a big at the camera besides

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.500 
still shoots a big at the camera besides
the<00:02:36.760> fact<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.150> takes<00:02:37.330> all<00:02:37.480> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the fact that it takes all the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.030 
the fact that it takes all the
mainstream<00:02:37.840> batteries<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.710> has<00:02:38.740> all<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
mainstream batteries and has all the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.220 
mainstream batteries and has all the
stuff<00:02:39.190> goes<00:02:39.400> into<00:02:39.670> what<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.970> q10<00:02:40.810> extreme

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
stuff goes into what the q10 extreme

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.660 
stuff goes into what the q10 extreme
looks<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.470> little<00:02:41.560> overkill<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.100> think<00:02:42.340> but<00:02:42.550> it's

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
looks a little overkill I think but it's

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.450 
looks a little overkill I think but it's
so<00:02:42.760> convenient<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.410> big<00:02:44.710> camera<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.370> it

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
so convenient it's a big camera and it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.680 
so convenient it's a big camera and it
wouldn't<00:02:45.700> fit<00:02:45.820> into<00:02:46.030> my<00:02:46.180> current

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
wouldn't fit into my current

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.800 
wouldn't fit into my current
infrastructure<00:02:47.080> what<00:02:47.410> my<00:02:47.770> jibs<00:02:48.100> or<00:02:48.310> my<00:02:48.810> Ronin

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
infrastructure what my jibs or my Ronin

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.810 
infrastructure what my jibs or my Ronin
or<00:02:49.960> other<00:02:50.080> kind<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.470> support<00:02:50.890> systems<00:02:51.250> tripod

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
or other kind of support systems tripod

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.090 
or other kind of support systems tripod
to<00:02:51.910> be<00:02:52.030> fine<00:02:52.270> but<00:02:52.900> I've<00:02:53.020> invested<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.710> lot<00:02:53.860> in

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
to be fine but I've invested a lot in

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.160 
to be fine but I've invested a lot in
all<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:54.400> other<00:02:54.580> kind<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.180> support<00:02:55.540> here<00:02:55.780> that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
all this other kind of support here that

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.370 
all this other kind of support here that
would<00:02:56.800> be<00:02:56.980> now<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:58.570> red<00:02:58.750> was<00:02:58.900> just<00:02:59.170> about

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
would be now to the red was just about

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.110 
would be now to the red was just about
where<00:02:59.590> either<00:02:59.890> be<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.310> now<00:03:00.400> there<00:03:00.550> is<00:03:00.580> too<00:03:00.940> big

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
where either be and now there is too big

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.240 
where either be and now there is too big
so<00:03:02.110> there<00:03:02.260> are<00:03:02.350> some<00:03:02.470> anyway<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.860> be<00:03:03.010> very

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
so there are some anyway to be very

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.880 
so there are some anyway to be very
excited<00:03:03.640> because<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:05.170> comes<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.620> at<00:03:05.830> a

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
run my Canon lenses but it reversed

you'd<00:05:01.669> buy<00:05:01.850> one<00:05:01.880> lens<00:05:02.390> mount<00:05:02.690> on<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.080> body<00:05:03.290> and

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
you'd buy one lens mount on the body and

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.700 
you'd buy one lens mount on the body and
that's<00:05:03.680> what<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:03.950> do<00:05:04.100> I<00:05:04.669> know<00:05:05.090> there's<00:05:05.450> a<00:05:05.710> big

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
that's what you do I know there's a big

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.990 
that's what you do I know there's a big
camera<00:05:06.980> you<00:05:07.190> can<00:05:07.370> swap<00:05:07.640> them<00:05:07.730> out<00:05:07.820> at<00:05:07.910> the

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
camera you can swap them out at the

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.120 
camera you can swap them out at the
brain<00:05:08.240> and<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:09.140> mount<00:05:09.530> all<00:05:09.740> at<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.919> same<00:05:10.070> time

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
brain and the mount all at the same time

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.610 
brain and the mount all at the same time
and<00:05:10.669> but<00:05:11.300> that's<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.810> little<00:05:11.930> overkill<00:05:12.230> I<00:05:12.380> think

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
and but that's a little overkill I think
