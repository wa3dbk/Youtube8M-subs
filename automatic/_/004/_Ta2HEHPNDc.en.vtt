00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
what the solution is to the problem here

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.140 
what the solution is to the problem here
well<00:00:10.299> the<00:00:10.389> cabinet's<00:00:10.870> came<00:00:11.110> in<00:00:11.320> they<00:00:11.559> had<00:00:11.680> been

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
well the cabinet's came in they had been

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.510 
well the cabinet's came in they had been
stained<00:00:13.150> and<00:00:13.510> then<00:00:14.080> had<00:00:14.289> one<00:00:14.559> coat<00:00:14.830> of<00:00:15.010> a<00:00:15.129> satin

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
stained and then had one coat of a satin

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.150 
stained and then had one coat of a satin
polyurethane<00:00:15.670> put<00:00:16.510> on<00:00:16.630> and<00:00:16.990> the<00:00:17.560> customer<00:00:18.010> was

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
polyurethane put on and the customer was

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.100 
polyurethane put on and the customer was
afraid<00:00:18.460> that<00:00:18.490> the<00:00:18.789> satin<00:00:19.090> polyurethane<00:00:19.240> was

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
afraid that the satin polyurethane was

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.950 
afraid that the satin polyurethane was
what's<00:00:20.890> bad<00:00:21.130> because<00:00:21.640> it<00:00:21.790> was<00:00:21.910> drawing<00:00:22.270> real

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
what's bad because it was drawing real

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.560 
what's bad because it was drawing real
uneven<00:00:23.470> as<00:00:23.620> far<00:00:23.860> as<00:00:24.010> Sheen<00:00:24.280> and<00:00:24.610> had<00:00:25.180> sometimes

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
uneven as far as Sheen and had sometimes

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.900 
uneven as far as Sheen and had sometimes
a<00:00:26.020> little<00:00:26.260> bit<00:00:26.410> of<00:00:26.500> a<00:00:26.650> whitish<00:00:27.100> cast<00:00:27.370> well<00:00:27.850> I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
a little bit of a whitish cast well I

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.940 
a little bit of a whitish cast well I
mean<00:00:28.060> it<00:00:28.150> looks<00:00:28.300> terrible<00:00:28.660> I<00:00:29.230> mean<00:00:29.590> it<00:00:29.800> looks

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
mean it looks terrible I mean it looks

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.819 
mean it looks terrible I mean it looks
awful<00:00:30.520> and<00:00:30.820> that's<00:00:31.720> actually<00:00:32.469> a<00:00:32.500> fairly

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
awful and that's actually a fairly

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.790 
awful and that's actually a fairly
normal<00:00:33.430> thing<00:00:33.700> to<00:00:33.730> happen<00:00:34.090> on<00:00:34.539> a<00:00:34.930> dark<00:00:35.589> color

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
normal thing to happen on a dark color

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.739 
normal thing to happen on a dark color
like<00:00:36.070> this<00:00:36.309> because<00:00:36.820> there's<00:00:37.179> still<00:00:37.539> some

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:37.749 
like this because there's still some

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:39.360 
like this because there's still some
areas<00:00:38.050> of<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.289> wood<00:00:38.469> that<00:00:38.679> are<00:00:38.739> absorbing

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
areas of the wood that are absorbing

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.180 
areas of the wood that are absorbing
product<00:00:40.089> in<00:00:40.239> some<00:00:40.449> areas<00:00:40.780> that<00:00:40.899> are<00:00:41.019> not<00:00:41.199> so

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
product in some areas that are not so

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.340 
product in some areas that are not so
the<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.760> solution<00:00:43.269> is<00:00:43.449> to<00:00:43.480> smooth<00:00:43.899> it<00:00:44.019> out<00:00:44.140> as

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
the the solution is to smooth it out as

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.500 
the the solution is to smooth it out as
best<00:00:44.499> possible<00:00:44.769> without<00:00:45.309> removing<00:00:45.819> stain

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
best possible without removing stain

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.040 
best possible without removing stain
color<00:00:46.899> and<00:00:48.089> apply<00:00:49.089> a<00:00:49.120> couple<00:00:49.510> more<00:00:49.629> coats<00:00:49.809> of

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
color and apply a couple more coats of

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.020 
color and apply a couple more coats of
finish<00:00:50.199> which<00:00:50.800> you've<00:00:51.010> done<00:00:51.280> down<00:00:51.550> below<00:00:51.850> here

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
finish which you've done down below here

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.360 
finish which you've done down below here
down<00:00:52.179> down<00:00:52.600> on<00:00:52.749> the<00:00:52.870> bottom<00:00:53.229> one<00:00:53.409> here<00:00:53.710> it's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
down down on the bottom one here it's

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.040 
down down on the bottom one here it's
nice<00:00:54.639> and<00:00:54.879> feels<00:00:55.120> nice<00:00:55.359> and<00:00:55.389> smooth<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.989> the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
nice and feels nice and smooth to the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.729 
nice and feels nice and smooth to the
touch

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
touch

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.919 
touch
you've<00:00:56.979> got<00:00:57.159> a<00:00:57.190> coat<00:00:57.489> of<00:00:57.639> gloss<00:00:57.879> after<00:00:58.449> sanding

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
you've got a coat of gloss after sanding

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.899 
you've got a coat of gloss after sanding
and<00:00:59.139> then<00:00:59.769> when<00:00:59.920> that<00:01:00.100> was<00:01:00.249> dry<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.519> light

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
and then when that was dry a light

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.209 
and then when that was dry a light
sanding<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:01.629> then<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:01.899> coat<00:01:02.229> of<00:01:02.379> next<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:02.949> then

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
sanding and then a coat of next and then

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.550 
sanding and then a coat of next and then
so<00:01:03.639> you<00:01:03.969> put<00:01:04.239> one<00:01:04.479> coat<00:01:04.690> of<00:01:04.900> a<00:01:05.049> gloss<00:01:05.530> finish

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
so you put one coat of a gloss finish

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.250 
so you put one coat of a gloss finish
and<00:01:06.310> then<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.430> top<00:01:06.760> coat<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.150> satin<00:01:07.390> yeah<00:01:07.960> and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
and then a top coat of satin yeah and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.860 
and then a top coat of satin yeah and
why<00:01:08.500> do<00:01:08.560> you<00:01:08.680> do<00:01:08.800> that<00:01:08.980> I<00:01:09.400> like<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.420> use<00:01:10.450> the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
why do you do that I like to use the

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.140 
why do you do that I like to use the
gloss<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.440> do<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.620> buildup<00:01:12.130> on<00:01:12.370> dark<00:01:12.760> colors

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
gloss to do a buildup on dark colors

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.460 
gloss to do a buildup on dark colors
because<00:01:13.180> then<00:01:13.660> you're<00:01:13.810> not<00:01:13.900> looking<00:01:14.110> through

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
because then you're not looking through

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.260 
because then you're not looking through
the<00:01:14.650> flattening<00:01:15.070> agents<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:15.640> it's<00:01:15.820> not<00:01:16.000> as

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
the flattening agents so it's not as

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.630 
the flattening agents so it's not as
cloudy<00:01:16.810> if<00:01:17.230> I'm<00:01:17.500> having<00:01:17.620> on<00:01:17.830> multiple<00:01:18.400> coats

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
cloudy if I'm having on multiple coats

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.480 
cloudy if I'm having on multiple coats
of<00:01:18.850> lower<00:01:19.810> same<00:01:20.170> product<00:01:20.620> over<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.890> dark<00:01:21.220> color

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
of lower same product over a dark color

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.610 
of lower same product over a dark color
sometimes<00:01:21.940> you<00:01:22.330> can<00:01:22.480> actually<00:01:22.690> get<00:01:23.080> a<00:01:23.320> little

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
sometimes you can actually get a little

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.500 
sometimes you can actually get a little
too<00:01:23.800> much<00:01:23.980> flattening<00:01:24.460> agent<00:01:24.850> on<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.090> surface

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
too much flattening agent on the surface

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.330 
too much flattening agent on the surface
yeah<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.250> so<00:01:28.120> this<00:01:28.630> cabinet<00:01:29.020> maker<00:01:29.200> needs<00:01:29.920> to

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
yeah so so this cabinet maker needs to

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.390 
yeah so so this cabinet maker needs to
sand<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.360> with<00:01:31.600> lightly<00:01:32.530> sanding<00:01:32.920> with<00:01:33.070> 220

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
sand it with lightly sanding with 220

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.880 
sand it with lightly sanding with 220
being<00:01:34.060> very<00:01:34.450> careful<00:01:34.780> not<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.230> go<00:01:35.350> through<00:01:35.620> on

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
being very careful not to go through on

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.270 
being very careful not to go through on
the<00:01:36.040> edges<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:38.380> take<00:01:38.590> out<00:01:38.770> not<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.100> take

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
the edges and to take out not to take

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.570 
the edges and to take out not to take
off<00:01:39.460> any<00:01:39.580> color<00:01:40.050> dust<00:01:41.050> it<00:01:41.230> off<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.680> coat<00:01:42.550> of

off any color dust it off a coat of
gloss<00:01:42.910> allow<00:01:43.900> that<00:01:43.960> to<00:01:44.290> dry<00:01:44.320> for<00:01:44.740> at<00:01:44.830> least<00:01:45.070> a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
finer grit sandpaper possibly even using

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.260 
finer grit sandpaper possibly even using
a<00:01:50.560> scotch<00:01:50.830> brite<00:01:51.130> pad<00:01:51.160> to<00:01:51.580> just<00:01:51.790> smooth<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.180> out

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
a scotch brite pad to just smooth it out

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.380 

what<00:02:00.140> was<00:02:00.289> rough<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:01.520> surface<00:02:01.549> I<00:02:02.030> don't<00:02:02.179> think

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
what was rough the surface I don't think

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.910

that<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.659> wood<00:02:02.869> was<00:02:02.899> actually<00:02:03.439> properly

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
that the wood was actually properly

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.580

the<00:02:11.000> staining<00:02:11.269> caused<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.840> wood<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.140> swell<00:02:12.290> up

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
the staining caused the wood to swell up

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.410 
the staining caused the wood to swell up
a<00:02:12.650> little<00:02:12.890> bit<00:02:13.040> maybe<00:02:13.310> even<00:02:13.700> rougher<00:02:13.879> and<00:02:14.269> then
