00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hey that 's probably already heard 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.400
 Microsoft bought minecraft for 25 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.319
 billion dollars 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.940
 yes blatant thing it was already 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.040
 rumors circulating that too ever 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.660
 but really believe yourself 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.790
 I could not myself all 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.920
 really because I mean the indie game 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.630
 or you let the company mojang 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.140
 on from the internet monopolist 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.820
 to buy 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.070
 that sounds a bit like 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.510
 would you give me any sharp weapons? 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.920
 independently act the dearest 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.689
 in the middle of the war zone 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.730
 We're serious about that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.460
 after a moment 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.969
 Well, but I think you know what I mean 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.649
 my 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.510
 I just found Mojang at all 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.250
 minecraft was with the laxen handling 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.540
 with crack players or theirs 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.879
 open coding that everyone something 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.100
 could contribute and so what he im 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 contrary to the normal game companies 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.940
 and so the market dominate 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 yes and why are you doing that now? 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.059
 say minecraft is easy 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.500
 got too big and we can handle it 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.000
 Now that was about it was actually 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.649
 not so big project planned and so 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.149
 It is better if this is now in 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.469
 great harmony listen for my sake too 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.469
 further leads the can thus much better 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.699
 deal and also mean yourself too 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.460
 something all over the head grown 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.110
 even with the changes actually has 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.549
 he retired since 2011 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.010
 and wants to minecraft longer so much 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.780
 but have to do so with the changes 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.189
 many people personally own him 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.810
 hey says what does he do? 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.180
 for a fuck though he himself 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.880
 is not involved he told nee 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 he founded so do not want to give 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.650
 sold more but what honestly you 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.810
 may also be from the company more 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.159
 withdraw without going to microsoft or 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 to sell somewhere else 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.670
 I mean he will still be 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.930
 Continue to be the minecraft developer 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.409
 I will not think much about that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.939
 to change 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.680
 and if he is complete for me 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.790
 then withdraw from the company wants 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.590
 is there still the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.390
 possibility of having one's own 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.280
 all the shares to the people in the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.140
 company works on sharing my open 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.520
 source makes and so on there is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.020
 really other alternatives than 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.619
 Just play it on microsoft 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.409
 Selling 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.259
 and I mean , he offered himself 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.640
 said has sold at microsoft 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.930
 We will not do that anymore 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.119
 do not make any more minecraft version for 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.520
 The organ meets because I do not like it 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.009
 that facebook opel has bought on 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.250
 yes, and he sells it himself 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.720
 own game a microsoft i mean 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.790
 all this ramblings comes to mind 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.890
 a little bit like any iphone 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.630
 6 trailer of 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.610
 We take two minutes at the beginning 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.990
 explains what a great display 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.550
 that is actually without me 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.200
 really to call any features 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.459
 what better this product for me now 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.410
 do not do any function with it 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.030
 can expect that the particles from ne 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.230
 Super 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.910
 Well , let's be honest 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.530
 actually it shows up again 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.350
 how much does money actually have 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.030
 nevertheless , 70 of the minecraft keeps itself 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.190
 stocks or mojang shares therefore 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.750
 Can he decide that when? 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.450
 who it is sold and so on 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.250
 and he gets a 175 billion euro 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.630
 or dollars of which half only from 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.200
 stay one billion dollars 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.450
 approximately 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.750
 and honestly, if he is already here 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.280
 honesty, etc. then appeals 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.230
 he should at least write at least 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.519
 that he could say yes there is good 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.260
 still other possibilities 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.300
 but on this way I have one 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.350
 billion more on my account and 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.570
 I can do that in my life 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.920
 a lot more on the shit hew what so 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.260
 I also think that's a legitimate reason 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.660
 I have to say yes and what happens 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.519
 because now with minecraft in the future well 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.720
 Mojang himself says we know 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.220
 not what specific plans 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.890
 actually for minecraft suppression 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.630
 yes super idea then the game 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.950
 easy to sell to microsoft 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.470
 without knowing what she's doing with it 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.420
 want to do or want us here 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.980
 just whiten because I have to tell myself 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.720
 I honestly do not have to 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.030
 Imagine that about something like that 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.440
 stark sale is not spoken of 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.209
 microsoft itself promises itself then 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.010
 of course more sales for the xbox 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.690
 because that was not yours elsewhere 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.060
 Not at all last year 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.340
 38 percent of minecraft's sales 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.290
 for pc so the profit the good sales 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.750
 have done with it and already 30 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.160
 for xbox and playstation that's so high 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.630
 as on the consoles I would not have 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.480
 thought that such a popularity there 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.340
 has and yes I mean my xbox is already 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.690
 from microsoft we are watching 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.709
 Just look at what's up there 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.510
 features are the xbox version 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.489
 Maybe then someday will eventually 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.260
 the pc version also something like that 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.239
 yes we can, of course, everyone is playing 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.950
 buy on the official page and 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.540
 even more will that be of course 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.000
 We do not usually have a good one there 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.030
 What do we have here 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.890
 8.1 king package for 189 you can get one 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.480
 few skins buy the super price 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.310
 or for those weird skins we give 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.539
 Yes, of course 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.400
 also free downloads for 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.200
 any test versions one times 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.120
 look what else is there 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.000
 halo mashup that sounds good too 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.420
 a texter playbook this to you and that 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.580
 text 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.220
 0 43 EUR 79 because they have to but equal 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.230
 slam or well I believe you 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.090
 See what I want out but 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.600
 mojang himself say the same 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.300
 Naturally 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.650
 oh no matter what comes naturally that will 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.510
 everything is still amazing 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.610
 but we are fully interested in it 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.990
 Everything gets much better and I have to 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.390
 say that sounds a bit like apple 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.310
 advertising or well and they write 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.020
 even they do not want any 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.300
 other people stop cool stuff for 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.410
 Minecraft but I think so 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.240
 they do not need to stop themselves 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.770
 because I think that's what 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.350
 will happen by itself 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.150
 because just these many people in the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.160
 mods for minecraft had that on 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.140
 budget seen budget will be yours now 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.880
 also taken from minecraft that is 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.410
 what the servers are running on and there 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.780
 then whole people always have the bucket 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.100
 Free of charge as your disposal around 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.840
 have your workforce and so on 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.490
 said good, do not do well anymore 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.230
 further for a few other things 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.700
 but there are many jumped off and 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.470
 I think that will be in many too 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.810
 other areas happen in watts in 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.220
 the text apax and so on many 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.200
 from the people who do such things 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.820
 are a bit programmers themselves 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.160
 and in this programmed and 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.110
 at all in the network teeth are great 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.680
 providers like google microsoft facebook 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.900
 etc 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.800
 not so popular now when I do that 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.770
 wants to express that way 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.450
 and I think the people who made that 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.890
 Of course, they also have that earlier 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.020
 we had an incentive for that 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.820
 indie game for the independent game that 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.320
 something different than the normal games all 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.350
 those are not the money out of pocket 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.940
 and so a little bit 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.020
 moral moral thought think 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.850
 I was also there that one his 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.260
 worker just for free 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.280
 provision adjusts for a plug-in 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.130
 program and a mod too 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.960
 program and I think exactly that 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.880
 is just now no longer be so because 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.380
 then people hey why lower themselves 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.060
 I charge my free labor 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.920
 Provide for a microsoft 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.890
 company can not do that 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.290
 be and I think there will be a lot 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.080
 do and it is the question if now after 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.240
 four years minecraft since 2010 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.830
 whether that is now slowly sucked out 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.330
 and maybe something else 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.200
 is coming and that is the first step 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.810
 or 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.550
 one of the first steps so now 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.140
 it's your turn and really with that 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.790
 topic really interested what the 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.500
 community of it keeps that means like her 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.760
 the majority is therefore 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.560
 I have made such a vote here 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.730
 which is linked in the description 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.750
 on my facebook page and one 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.820
 poll 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.170
 and here simply a cross and 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.390
 that find a disadvantage or one 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.980
 Advantage with the takeover can be a 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.880
 quite different opinion of his I can you 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.980
 also like to write in the comments 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.510
 if you want and yes good again 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.440
 then you also see the resolute others 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.490
 or if you should click on it and 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.640
 can think about who is already there 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.960
 waiting has no otherwise you can 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.160
 share with little friends again 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.870
 if you do not have that yet 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.770
 Hated to ask you what you ask 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.720
 to think of 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.970

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.300
 as yours and otherwise until the 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.300
