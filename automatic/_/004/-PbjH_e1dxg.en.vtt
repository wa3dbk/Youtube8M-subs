I had made a note of with 7.5 inches and
it's<00:01:14.030> now<00:01:14.360> 19<00:01:14.960> inches<00:01:15.640> high<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:18.640> don't<00:01:19.640> have<00:01:19.850> a

it's now 19 inches high I don't have a
TDS<00:01:21.649> meter<00:01:22.300> but<00:01:23.300> I<00:01:23.330> have<00:01:23.570> one<00:01:23.750> on<00:01:23.869> order<00:01:24.259> of

about<00:01:25.100> a<00:01:25.280> cheap<00:01:25.610> one<00:01:26.560> through<00:01:27.560> ebay<00:01:28.869> so<00:01:29.869> once<00:01:30.110> i

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
about a cheap one through ebay so once i

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.080 
about a cheap one through ebay so once i
get<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:30.710> i'm<00:01:30.920> going<00:01:31.399> to<00:01:31.460> go<00:01:31.580> ahead<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.910> check

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
get that i'm going to go ahead and check

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.830 
get that i'm going to go ahead and check
it<00:01:32.300> but<00:01:32.570> some<00:01:33.020> basically<00:01:33.710> about<00:01:34.420> nine<00:01:35.420> days

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
it but some basically about nine days

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.560 
it but some basically about nine days
into<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:36.979> into<00:01:37.910> this<00:01:38.530> operation<00:01:39.530> and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.920 

I<00:01:43.690> managed<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.530> OD<00:01:45.010> a<00:01:45.040> little<00:01:45.430> bit<00:01:45.580> on<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:46.060> on

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
I managed to OD a little bit on the on

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.620 
I managed to OD a little bit on the on
the<00:01:46.990> muriatic<00:01:47.560> acid<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:48.670> added<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:51.630> ended

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
the muriatic acid that I added it ended

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.480 
the muriatic acid that I added it ended
up<00:01:53.280> my<00:01:54.280> ph<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.910> down<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.540> little<00:01:55.870> above<00:01:56.110> 40<00:01:56.890> right

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
up my ph is down a little above 40 right

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.420 
up my ph is down a little above 40 right
now<00:01:58.050> kind<00:01:59.050> of<00:01:59.110> waiting<00:01:59.530> for<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.010> just<00:02:00.070> come

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
now kind of waiting for it to just come

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.770 
now kind of waiting for it to just come
back<00:02:00.610> up

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.930 

like<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.930> go<00:02:08.050> over<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.680> chemistry<00:02:09.670> here<00:02:09.880> a

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
like to go over the chemistry here a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.820 
like to go over the chemistry here a
little<00:02:10.119> bit<00:02:10.330> I<00:02:10.600> was<00:02:10.900> talking<00:02:11.050> about<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.500> pH

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
little bit I was talking about the pH

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.980 
little bit I was talking about the pH
I'm<00:02:12.280> really<00:02:12.580> trying<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.860> maintain<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.160> ph<00:02:15.610> of

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
I'm really trying to maintain a ph of

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.810 
I'm really trying to maintain a ph of
around<00:02:16.990> 60<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.440> stated<00:02:20.680> before<00:02:20.860> i'm<00:02:21.460> using

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
around 60 as I stated before i'm using

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.940 
around 60 as I stated before i'm using
muriatic<00:02:22.390> acid<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.990> is<00:02:25.350> around<00:02:26.350> thirty-five

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
muriatic acid this is around thirty-five

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.730 
muriatic acid this is around thirty-five
percent<00:02:27.360> hydrochloric<00:02:28.360> acid<00:02:28.780> well<00:02:29.650> actually

percent hydrochloric acid well actually
it's<00:02:30.130> thirty<00:02:30.340> two<00:02:30.580> percent<00:02:31.560> anyway<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:32.950> very

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
it's thirty two percent anyway it's very

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.420 
it's thirty two percent anyway it's very
caustic<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.200> something<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.350> be<00:02:35.650> careful<00:02:36.220> with

caustic and something to be careful with

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.970 
caustic and something to be careful with
and<00:02:36.880> as<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.360> mentioned<00:02:37.690> before<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.920> another

I<00:03:18.920> haven't<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.430> because<00:03:19.460> I<00:03:19.910> haven't<00:03:20.120> really

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
I haven't is because I haven't really

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.720 
I haven't is because I haven't really
noticed<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:24.350> water<00:03:24.590> level<00:03:24.980> going<00:03:25.310> down<00:03:25.490> too

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
noticed the water level going down too

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.140 
noticed the water level going down too
much<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.330> that's<00:03:26.450> one<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.900> things<00:03:27.020> that<00:03:27.410> I

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
much and that's one of the things that I

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.090 
much and that's one of the things that I
failed<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:31.180> monitor<00:03:32.180> correctly<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.410> i<00:03:33.860> would

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
failed to monitor correctly and i would

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.040 
failed to monitor correctly and i would
suggest<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.850> if<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.210> build<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.630> container

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
suggest and if you build a container

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.340 
suggest and if you build a container
that<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:36.560> go<00:03:36.830> ahead<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.310> put<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.900> ruler<00:03:38.900> or

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
that you go ahead and put a ruler or

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.400 
that you go ahead and put a ruler or
something<00:03:39.920> inside<00:03:40.370> or<00:03:40.730> make<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.120> some<00:03:41.410> some

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
something inside or make you some some

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.640 
something inside or make you some some
marks<00:03:42.800> with<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.040> permanent<00:03:43.340> marker<00:03:44.590> now<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
marks with a permanent marker now the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.210

bloom<00:03:46.070> is<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:47.710> something<00:03:48.710> that's<00:03:48.890> supposed<00:03:49.010> to

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
bloom is a something that's supposed to

bloom is a something that's supposed to
be<00:03:49.280> added<00:03:49.700> later<00:03:49.730> on<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.600> again<00:03:50.990> all<00:03:51.470> these

amounts i got off of the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.150 
amounts i got off of the
future<00:03:57.310> garden<00:03:57.760> site<00:03:58.750> they<00:03:59.470> have<00:03:59.590> an<00:03:59.680> excel

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
haven't done this yet but because my

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.949 
haven't done this yet but because my

percent hydrogen peroxide and I plan to

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.640 
percent hydrogen peroxide and I plan to
that<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:31.010> try<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.310> prevent<00:04:32.530> actually<00:04:33.530> the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
so contrary to some things that are bred

so contrary to some things that are bred
and<00:04:53.110> watched<00:04:53.710> on<00:04:53.979> YouTube<00:04:54.430> about<00:04:56.430> the

and watched on YouTube about the

frequency that you need to replenish
your

your water and nutrients since I don't
have<00:05:06.919> a<00:05:07.069> ppm<00:05:07.819> meter<00:05:08.710> right<00:05:09.710> now<00:05:10.060> I'm<00:05:11.060> i<00:05:11.660> choose

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
have a ppm meter right now I'm i choose

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.869 
have a ppm meter right now I'm i choose
to<00:05:12.199> do<00:05:12.349> nothing

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:15.879 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.909

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
in my nutrient container doesn't seem to

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:31.130 
in my nutrient container doesn't seem to
be<00:05:25.650> going<00:05:26.650> down<00:05:26.980> too<00:05:27.280> much<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:29.100> right<00:05:30.100> now

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
be going down too much so right now

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.570 
be going down too much so right now
that's<00:05:32.140> pretty<00:05:32.680> much<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.920> way<00:05:33.220> it's<00:05:33.400> going<00:05:33.520> to

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
that's pretty much the way it's going to

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.330 
that's pretty much the way it's going to
be<00:05:33.790> I<00:05:34.150> should<00:05:34.390> get<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:34.870> meter<00:05:35.110> before<00:05:36.100> next

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
be I should get the meter before next

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.660 
be I should get the meter before next
weekend

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
weekend

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.520 
weekend
that<00:05:38.300> I'll<00:05:39.260> try<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.500> make<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:40.210> more<00:05:41.210> accurate

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
that I'll try to make a more accurate

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.200 
that I'll try to make a more accurate
assessment<00:05:42.530> of<00:05:42.650> what<00:05:43.370> really<00:05:43.670> needs<00:05:43.700> to<00:05:44.000> be

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
assessment of what really needs to be

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.660 
assessment of what really needs to be
done<00:05:44.420> to<00:05:44.900> optimize<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:47.810> growth<00:05:48.080> of<00:05:48.670> these

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
done to optimize the growth of these
