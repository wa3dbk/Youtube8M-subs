00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.630
 we are here today in one 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.869
 beautiful orchestra recording studio in 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.480
 berlin and today are a dictate of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.630
 record a new digital piano 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.040
 and an acoustic wing 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.920
 let's see what comes out that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.050
 Tadic Studios is the largest private studio 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.239
 probably also in Germany 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.699
 Europe and all at 450 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.940
 square meters high of about 80 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.940
 meter 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.390
 I think everyone is for 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.040
 like playing piano 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.870
 actually a concert grand at home 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.820
 I think that is the dream of 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.650
 great dream a concert wing of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.390
 of course needs the acoustics 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.400
 ideally a large concert hall 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.610
 and one usually has it at home 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.970
 rare and there is of course takano very much 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.240
 Good alternative we have the theme 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.369
 correct the acoustic microphone because of her 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.840
 We also have the right housing 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.840
 also goes with a closed lid 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.270
 the acoustics children are not 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.400
 just what an acoustic wing is 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 actually conceived of course right now 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.540
 going a great concert for wings 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
 he is an audience and a digital planning 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.830
 usually fulfill something else 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.310
 namely the best sounded that 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.810
 player who sits on the piano himself when 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.540
 it was as far as could soundcheck times 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:22.470
 it is best to do this first 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:24.360
 casio whole three times short my concept 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.230
 is of course something completely different than in 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.480
 the stars 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.820
 that's clear but it's not about it 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.070
 prove that we are titled now 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.650
 really equal are acoustic 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:39.750
 concerts but residents sell 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.650
 where are they close and will be one 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.299
 exciting experiment 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.299
 you know, too, is still running now
