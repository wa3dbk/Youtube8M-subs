00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
thought

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.110 
thought
yeah<00:02:46.280> frame<00:02:47.030> like<00:02:47.239> so<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.200> causes<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.850> video

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
yeah frame like so that causes the video

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.000 
yeah frame like so that causes the video
when<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.480> edit<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.900> because<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.739> frame

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
when I edit it because it's frame

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.380 
when I edit it because it's frame
lagging<00:02:52.370> because<00:02:52.640> I'm<00:02:52.760> recording<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.330> my

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
lagging because I'm recording and my

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.670 
lagging because I'm recording and my
computer<00:02:53.420> just<00:02:53.780> can't<00:02:54.140> handle<00:02:54.380> it

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
computer just can't handle it

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.530 
computer just can't handle it
it's<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:56.800> when<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.830> record<00:02:58.310> for<00:02:58.489> 15<00:02:58.910> minutes<00:02:59.300> with

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
it's a when I record for 15 minutes with

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.060 
it's a when I record for 15 minutes with
that<00:02:59.570> frame<00:03:00.019> lag<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.410> ends<00:03:00.590> up<00:03:00.650> being<00:03:00.860> like

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
that frame lag it ends up being like

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.070 
that frame lag it ends up being like
eight<00:03:01.370> minutes<00:03:01.820> of<00:03:01.940> video<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.510> then<00:03:03.260> about<00:03:03.530> I

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
eight minutes of video and then about I

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.550 
eight minutes of video and then about I
think<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.290> was<00:03:06.410> like<00:03:06.800> 10<00:03:07.190> minutes<00:03:07.760> no<00:03:08.630> eight

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
think it was like 10 minutes no eight

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.740 
think it was like 10 minutes no eight
minutes<00:03:09.890> eight<00:03:10.220> minutes<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.820> video<00:03:11.120> like

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750
