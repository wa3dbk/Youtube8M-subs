or<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> fixed<00:01:04.379> gear<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.339> really

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
or a fixed gear but it's really

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.030 
or a fixed gear but it's really
versatile<00:01:06.090> i<00:01:06.420> use<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.260> bike<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.710> every<00:01:07.920> day

commuting<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.640> i<00:01:08.820> also<00:01:09.000> trick<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.570> it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
commuting and i also trick on it

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.030 
commuting and i also trick on it
well<00:01:10.780> I<00:01:10.930> think<00:01:11.050> there's<00:01:11.410> definitely<00:01:11.470> like<00:01:11.950> an

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
well I think there's definitely like an

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.830 
well I think there's definitely like an
added<00:01:12.370> level<00:01:12.490> of<00:01:12.670> difficulty<00:01:13.090> with<00:01:13.450> fixed

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
added level of difficulty with fixed

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.780 
added level of difficulty with fixed
gear<00:01:13.990> not<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.800> say<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:14.950> it's<00:01:15.220> harder<00:01:15.550> but

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
gear not to say that it's harder but

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.970 
gear not to say that it's harder but
it's<00:01:15.940> just<00:01:16.180> there's<00:01:16.840> like<00:01:17.020> an<00:01:17.170> extra<00:01:17.530> timing

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
it's just there's like an extra timing

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.110 
it's just there's like an extra timing
layer<00:01:18.160> that<00:01:18.400> you<00:01:18.520> just<00:01:18.700> have<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:19.000> be

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
layer that you just have to be

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.210 
layer that you just have to be
constantly<00:01:19.540> aware<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.290> then<00:01:20.590> on<00:01:20.800> ramps

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
constantly aware of and then on ramps

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.250 
constantly aware of and then on ramps
it's<00:01:21.370> just<00:01:21.580> like<00:01:21.790> kind<00:01:22.660> of<00:01:22.720> a<00:01:22.840> nightmare<00:01:23.050> to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
it's just like kind of a nightmare to

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.200 
it's just like kind of a nightmare to
learn<00:01:23.650> because<00:01:23.920> once<00:01:24.490> again<00:01:24.610> your<00:01:24.940> pedal

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
learn because once again your pedal

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.940 
learn because once again your pedal
setting<00:01:25.510> like<00:01:25.660> potentially<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.410> help<00:01:26.620> a<00:01:26.710> ramp

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
setting like potentially you help a ramp

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.330 
setting like potentially you help a ramp
for<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.280> bank<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:29.440> know<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.800> just<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.130> takes

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
for a bank and you know it just it takes

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.930 
for a bank and you know it just it takes
a<00:01:30.430> lot<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.670> practice<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:33.130> bicycle<00:01:33.550> seen<00:01:33.760> in

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
a lot of practice the bicycle seen in

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.690 
a lot of practice the bicycle seen in
Chicago<00:01:34.510> has<00:01:35.350> definitely<00:01:35.710> gone<00:01:36.100> up<00:01:36.340> with<00:01:36.580> in

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
Chicago has definitely gone up with in

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.219 
Chicago has definitely gone up with in
the<00:01:36.790> past<00:01:36.940> years<00:01:37.330> especially<00:01:37.600> with<00:01:37.869> fixed

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
the past years especially with fixed

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.800 
the past years especially with fixed
gears<00:01:38.440> it's<00:01:39.040> just<00:01:39.250> about<00:01:39.610> really<00:01:40.450> pushing<00:01:40.720> the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
gears it's just about really pushing the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.210 
gears it's just about really pushing the
boundaries<00:01:41.080> as<00:01:41.380> far<00:01:41.560> as<00:01:41.619> what<00:01:41.800> you<00:01:41.890> can<00:01:42.040> do

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
boundaries as far as what you can do

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.800 
boundaries as far as what you can do
that's<00:01:42.850> really<00:01:43.090> what<00:01:43.210> we're<00:01:43.300> looking<00:01:43.360> forward

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
that's really what we're looking forward

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.719 
that's really what we're looking forward
to<00:01:43.899> like<00:01:44.259> just<00:01:44.920> seemed<00:01:45.100> kind<00:01:45.460> of<00:01:45.490> what<00:01:45.640> it

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
to like just seemed kind of what it

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.690
