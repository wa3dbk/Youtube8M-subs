00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
fresh water to use as well to the key

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.079 
fresh water to use as well to the key
features<00:00:37.879> with<00:00:38.059> this<00:00:38.180> is<00:00:38.420> that<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:38.960> has<00:00:39.199> GPS

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
features with this is that it has GPS

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.209 
features with this is that it has GPS
pinpoint<00:00:41.089> tracking<00:00:41.629> system<00:00:41.960> on<00:00:42.019> it<00:00:42.219> which

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
pinpoint tracking system on it which

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.219 
pinpoint tracking system on it which
we're<00:00:43.399> in<00:00:43.429> we're<00:00:43.969> in<00:00:44.120> in<00:00:44.690> mode<00:00:44.960> at<00:00:45.109> the<00:00:45.199> moment

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229 
we're in we're in in mode at the moment

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.119 
we're in we're in in mode at the moment
so<00:00:45.800> that's<00:00:47.409> one<00:00:48.409> of<00:00:48.499> the<00:00:48.559> key<00:00:48.710> features<00:00:48.920> that

so that's one of the key features that

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.099 
so that's one of the key features that
this<00:00:49.399> this<00:00:49.670> unit<00:00:50.030> does<00:00:50.210> what<00:00:50.449> that<00:00:50.479> allows<00:00:50.899> you

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
this this unit does what that allows you

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.250 
this this unit does what that allows you
to<00:00:51.229> do<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:52.460> we're<00:00:52.999> an<00:00:53.089> anchor<00:00:53.359> mode<00:00:53.569> here<00:00:53.870> so

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
to do is we're an anchor mode here so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.660 
to do is we're an anchor mode here so
we're<00:00:54.440> just<00:00:54.469> state<00:00:54.800> reduces<00:00:55.129> both<00:00:55.309> dropping

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
we're just state reduces both dropping

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.639 
we're just state reduces both dropping
your<00:00:55.729> anchor<00:00:56.059> we're<00:00:56.839> in<00:00:56.929> a<00:00:56.989> fixed<00:00:57.260> GPS

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
your anchor we're in a fixed GPS

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.759 
your anchor we're in a fixed GPS

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.139 
forward by simply pushing the button
once<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:45.409> by<00:01:45.770> pushing<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.189> once<00:01:46.399> did<00:01:46.789> you<00:01:46.850> see

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
once so by pushing it once did you see

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.179 
once so by pushing it once did you see
it<00:01:47.210> now<00:01:47.450> it's<00:01:47.929> going<00:01:48.079> to<00:01:48.140> move<00:01:48.350> as<00:01:48.469> five<00:01:48.920> feet

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
it now it's going to move as five feet

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.310 
it now it's going to move as five feet
to<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.820> right<00:01:49.999> we<00:01:50.749> can<00:01:50.869> actually<00:01:51.020> push

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
to the to the right we can actually push

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.410 
to the to the right we can actually push
it<00:01:51.469> twice<00:01:51.740> three<00:01:52.249> times<00:01:52.280> at<00:01:52.820> five<00:01:53.179> feet

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
it twice three times at five feet

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.880 
it twice three times at five feet
intervals<00:01:53.810> okay

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
intervals okay

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.560 
intervals okay
so<00:01:55.249> that<00:01:55.399> allows<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.789> didn't<00:01:56.030> then<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.390> move

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
so that allows you didn't then to move

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.419 
so that allows you didn't then to move
move<00:01:57.109> around<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.619> structure<00:01:58.039> basically

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
move around a structure basically

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.999 
move around a structure basically
pulling<00:01:58.609> up<00:01:59.109> anchoring<00:02:00.109> on<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.259> structure<00:02:00.799> and

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
pulling up anchoring on a structure and

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.679 
pulling up anchoring on a structure and
then<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.399> can<00:02:01.640> actually<00:02:01.820> maneuver<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.539> boat

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
then you can actually maneuver the boat

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.179 
then you can actually maneuver the boat
all<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.049> way<00:02:03.200> around<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.649> structure<00:02:04.039> by

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
all the way around the structure by

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.249 
all the way around the structure by
simply<00:02:04.640> just<00:02:04.819> pushing<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.210> buttons<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:06.229> I

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
simply just pushing the buttons so I

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.040 
simply just pushing the buttons so I
want<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.710> go<00:02:06.859> five<00:02:07.159> feet<00:02:07.429> forward<00:02:07.939> I'll<00:02:08.840> just

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
want to go five feet forward I'll just

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.890 
want to go five feet forward I'll just
push<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.530> once<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:10.789> unit<00:02:11.060> will<00:02:11.180> respond<00:02:11.810> to

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
push it once the unit will respond to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.780 
push it once the unit will respond to
that<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.260> take<00:02:12.410> me<00:02:12.530> five<00:02:12.740> feet<00:02:12.980> forward<00:02:13.370> or<00:02:13.580> 10

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
that and take me five feet forward or 10

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.580 
that and take me five feet forward or 10
feet<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.390> it's<00:02:14.540> right<00:02:14.750> great<00:02:15.170> little<00:02:15.380> feature

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
feet so it's right great little feature

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.760 
feet so it's right great little feature
there<00:02:15.740> is<00:02:16.100> without<00:02:16.400> having

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
there is without having

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.070 
there is without having
-<00:02:17.160> move<00:02:17.400> maneuver<00:02:17.970> yourself<00:02:18.090> will<00:02:18.600> move<00:02:18.750> in

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
- move maneuver yourself will move in

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.350 
- move maneuver yourself will move in
hands-free<00:02:19.560> mode<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.120> place

the boat wherever you want now the other
advantage<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.250> these<00:02:23.370> motor<00:02:23.610> guides<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
advantage of these motor guides is the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.730 
advantage of these motor guides is the
speed<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.750> head-turning<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.350> saw<00:02:25.560> how

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
speed of that head-turning we saw how

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.110 
speed of that head-turning we saw how
quickly<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.190> was<00:02:26.370> there<00:02:26.520> know<00:02:26.700> how<00:02:26.820> does<00:02:26.970> that

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
quickly it was there know how does that

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.460 
quickly it was there know how does that
benchmark<00:02:27.690> compared<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.170> what's<00:02:28.320> out<00:02:28.380> there

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
benchmark compared to what's out there

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.370

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
at the moment exactly four seconds you

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.530

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
can do a 360 rotation I'll just take

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.370 
can do a 360 rotation I'll just take
that<00:02:33.570> off

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
that off

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.340 
that off
ankle<00:02:34.830> load<00:02:34.950> Mona<00:02:35.250> here<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:35.790> show<00:02:35.820> you

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
ankle load Mona here and just show you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.530 
ankle load Mona here and just show you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
the speed of the rotation here so I can

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.530 
the speed of the rotation here so I can
do<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> 360<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.410> four<00:02:40.680> seconds<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.030> key<00:02:42.240> one

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
do a 360 in four seconds so the key one

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.990 
do a 360 in four seconds so the key one
