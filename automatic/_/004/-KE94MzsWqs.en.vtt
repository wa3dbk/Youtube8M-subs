00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 girls wanted to make a short video 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.860
 share your experiences about building up 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.700
 hair was somehow tempted to build 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.859
 hair in the salon and made me a tape 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.490
 build I don't remember how she is there 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.820
 called but there is now capsular yes 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.279
 there is a date tapes are not glued 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.720
 these tapes i'm so pretty pretty 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:35.120
 mermaid came out with long hair three 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:41.550
 month I passed with these curls 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:44.010
 overhead and decided to remove just tired 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.789
 they came back to me in three 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.510
 of the month 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.480
 of not removed this hair overhead and when 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.539
 I shot them 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.039
 I came out of the cabin blew wind and head 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.960
 my frozen in general took these to me 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.729
 overhead strands and along with my 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.549
 my hair was so there on 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.830
 kipi's head cooked like that when I'm 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.140
 collected hair tried to stab them 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.759
 the crab then the crab didn't even hold 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.780
 because there was simply nothing to cling to 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.490
 and there is nothing to hold on there 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.700
 I restored hair oily 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:33.710
 Masks and shampoo mask and tonic series 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.400
 firm cutrin there is such a series 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.400
 professional as professional 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.530
 it is specifically designed for 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.619
 stimulate hair growth me her 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.869
 my aunt advised 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:54.450
 that's basically how happy I was 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.880
 and a series of some kind of effect was maybe 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.450
 effect by oil masks but i'm all in 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.079
 complex deal but in general my dear 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.680
 if you don't care about your hair 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.259
 common 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.080
 do procedures like scaling 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.869
 hair can be on some kind of literally 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.500
 then you 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.980
 This is a wedding for some event 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.739
 same to remove them with them and not to go there 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.060
 how I am three months but the fact is that our 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.940
 hair bulb she just war 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.690
 unable to hold such a construction 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.909
 heavy and they respectively due to 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:41.140
 gravity yes something up there in the load 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:43.810
 extra some attached to 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.870
 the roots is a ribbon and you walk with it and 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.989
 respectively, then the hair remains on 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.239

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.590
