00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
camera I'm just gonna talk about it for

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.610 
camera I'm just gonna talk about it for
a<00:03:21.470> little<00:03:21.590> while<00:03:21.799> okay

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.680 

so<00:03:25.209> your<00:03:26.320> your<00:03:27.320> SD<00:03:27.950> card<00:03:28.280> one<00:03:28.850> gigabyte<00:03:29.299> will

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
so your your SD card one gigabyte will

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.810 
so your your SD card one gigabyte will
last<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.200> nine<00:03:30.410> minutes<00:03:30.830> on<00:03:30.980> HD<00:03:31.459> um<00:03:33.610> yes<00:03:34.610> and

last you nine minutes on HD um yes and

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.460 
last you nine minutes on HD um yes and
so<00:03:35.480> do<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.959> math<00:03:35.989> when<00:03:36.709> you<00:03:36.769> have<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:37.510> 436<00:03:39.760> 872

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
so do the math when you have a 436 872

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.280 
so do the math when you have a 436 872
um<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.970> yeah<00:03:44.360> it's<00:03:44.570> pretty<00:03:44.690> much<00:03:44.900> all<00:03:45.079> there<00:03:45.230> is

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
um so yeah it's pretty much all there is

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.000 
um so yeah it's pretty much all there is
to<00:03:45.380> it

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
to it

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.370 
to it
it'll<00:03:46.760> be<00:03:46.970> about<00:03:47.239> that<00:03:47.480> much<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:48.019> maybe<00:03:48.170> not

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
it'll be about that much and maybe not

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.850 
it'll be about that much and maybe not
quite<00:03:48.709> if<00:03:48.920> I'm<00:03:49.070> wrong<00:03:49.480> cuz<00:03:50.480> math<00:03:51.019> doesn't<00:03:51.560> work

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
quite if I'm wrong cuz math doesn't work

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.509 
quite if I'm wrong cuz math doesn't work
all<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.910> time<00:03:53.079> cuz<00:03:54.079> sometimes<00:03:54.500> like<00:03:55.130> on<00:03:55.250> this

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
all the time cuz sometimes like on this

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.560 
all the time cuz sometimes like on this
camera<00:03:57.310> 640<00:03:58.310> will<00:03:58.459> last<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.880> lot<00:03:59.000> longer<00:03:59.060> than
