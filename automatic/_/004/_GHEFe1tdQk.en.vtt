good night's sleep he's gonna have to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.220 
good night's sleep he's gonna have to
figure<00:00:35.460> out<00:00:35.730> why<00:00:36.000> he's<00:00:36.270> there<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.719> what's

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
figure out why he's there and what's

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.270 
figure out why he's there and what's
going<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:38.390> in<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.140> game<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.620> explore<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
going on in the game you explore the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.729 
going on in the game you explore the
castle<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:41.879> Jonas<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.660> you're<00:00:43.469> solving

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
castle as Jonas and you're solving

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
castle as Jonas and you're solving
puzzles<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.489> finding<00:00:45.030> hidden<00:00:45.300> objects<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
puzzles and finding hidden objects to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.130 
puzzles and finding hidden objects to
figure<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.440> what's<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.570> it's<00:00:48.570> kind<00:00:49.050> of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
figure out what's going on it's kind of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.869 
figure out what's going on it's kind of
similar<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> hidden<00:00:50.100> object<00:00:50.460> game<00:00:50.640> but

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
similar to a hidden object game but

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.010 
similar to a hidden object game but
there<00:00:51.000> definitely<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.420> couple<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.840> big

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
there definitely a couple of big

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
there definitely a couple of big
differences<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.920> biggest<00:00:56.250> difference<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
differences the biggest difference is

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.619 
differences the biggest difference is
because<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.510> game's<00:00:57.690> 3d<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.770> hide<00:00:59.129> stuff

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
because the game's 3d we can hide stuff

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.460 
because the game's 3d we can hide stuff
behind<00:01:00.629> chairs<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.680> top<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> tables<00:01:02.640> or<00:01:03.470> on

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
behind chairs and on top of tables or on

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.039 
behind chairs and on top of tables or on
the<00:01:04.739> ceiling<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> side<00:01:05.700> basically<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.720> 3d

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the ceiling or the side basically in 3d

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.020 
the ceiling or the side basically in 3d
space<00:01:07.229> where<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.310> obscured<00:01:08.700> by<00:01:08.850> other

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
space where it's obscured by other

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.910 
space where it's obscured by other
things<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:09.900> part<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> why<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.710> have

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
things and that's part of why you have

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.649 
things and that's part of why you have
to<00:01:11.100> move<00:01:11.220> around<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.729> room<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.150> order<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.420> find

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
to move around the room in order to find

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
to move around the room in order to find
them<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.560> other<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.950> big<00:01:14.040> difference<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
them the other really big difference is

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.429 
them the other really big difference is
that<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.180> lot<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> objects<00:01:15.840> themselves<00:01:15.960> are

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that a lot of the objects themselves are

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
that a lot of the objects themselves are
broken<00:01:16.799> into<00:01:16.920> multiple<00:01:17.400> pieces<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.939> also

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
broken into multiple pieces and also

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.560 
broken into multiple pieces and also
hidden<00:01:18.450> inside<00:01:18.840> other<00:01:19.049> objects<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.250> can

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
hidden inside other objects so you can

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.840 
hidden inside other objects so you can
basically<00:01:21.570> open<00:01:22.140> chests<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.860> turn<00:01:23.520> chairs

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
basically open chests or turn chairs

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.789 
basically open chests or turn chairs
around<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.420> rooms<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.960> order<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.229> find<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.560> piece

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
around in rooms in order to find a piece

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.490 
around in rooms in order to find a piece
and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.460> line<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.630> 3d<00:01:27.960> space<00:01:28.140> with

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and then line it up in 3d space with

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.830 
and then line it up in 3d space with
another<00:01:28.740> piece<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.280> order<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.000> create<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
another piece in order to create the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.999 
another piece in order to create the
object<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.439> add<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.220> inventory

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
object and add it to your inventory

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
object and add it to your inventory
earlier<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.220> year<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:36.000> released<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> game
