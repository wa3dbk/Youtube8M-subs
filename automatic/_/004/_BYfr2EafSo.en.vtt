hello<00:00:11.960> welcome<00:00:12.200> to<00:00:12.410> four-minute<00:00:12.770> mile<00:00:12.950> in

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:13.520 
hello welcome to four-minute mile in

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.250 
hello welcome to four-minute mile in
this<00:00:13.730> tutorial<00:00:13.879> in<00:00:14.360> shape<00:00:14.570> of<00:00:14.719> the<00:00:14.840> instance

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
this tutorial in shape of the instance

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.519 
this tutorial in shape of the instance
an<00:00:15.410> object<00:00:16.119> so<00:00:17.119> instancing<00:00:17.720> is<00:00:17.990> different<00:00:18.380> and

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
an object so instancing is different and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.440 
an object so instancing is different and
duplicating<00:00:19.279> to<00:00:20.150> be<00:00:20.210> duplicate<00:00:22.029> and<00:00:23.029> edit<00:00:23.330> the

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
duplicating to be duplicate and edit the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.990 
duplicating to be duplicate and edit the
object<00:00:23.680> it<00:00:24.680> will<00:00:24.800> not<00:00:24.950> affect<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:25.489> original

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
object it will not affect the original

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.069 
object it will not affect the original
asset<00:00:27.520> in<00:00:28.520> something<00:00:29.060> if<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:29.689> edit<00:00:29.989> the

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
asset in something if you edit the

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.109 
asset in something if you edit the
original<00:00:30.140> answer<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:31.189> will<00:00:31.279> affect<00:00:31.610> all<00:00:31.849> the

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
original answer it will affect all the

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.160 
original answer it will affect all the
instances<00:00:32.829> so<00:00:33.829> the<00:00:33.980> instance<00:00:34.309> in<00:00:34.430> object

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
instances so the instance in object

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.959 
instances so the instance in object
selector<00:00:36.170> object

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
selector object

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.350 
selector object
okay<00:00:37.969> that's<00:00:38.180> edit<00:00:39.250> duplicate<00:00:40.250> special

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
okay that's edit duplicate special

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.930 
okay that's edit duplicate special
nucleus<00:00:41.360> square<00:00:44.200> so<00:00:45.200> you<00:00:45.260> want<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:45.530> make<00:00:45.680> sure

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
nucleus square so you want to make sure

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.110 
nucleus square so you want to make sure
that<00:00:46.940> it's<00:00:47.600> not<00:00:47.810> copies<00:00:48.290> in<00:00:48.470> instant<00:00:49.120> they

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
that it's not copies in instant they

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.950 
that it's not copies in instant they
usually<00:00:50.360> have<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.990> group<00:00:51.170> under<00:00:51.530> parent<00:00:52.960> but

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
usually have the group under parent but

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.090 
usually have the group under parent but
it's<00:00:54.110> up<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.500> which<00:00:54.620> one<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:54.920> would

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's up to you which one you would

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.980 
it's up to you which one you would
rather<00:00:55.310> choose<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.510> we<00:00:56.600> need<00:00:56.720> to<00:00:56.810> do<00:00:56.900> this

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
rather choose so we need to do this

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
rather choose so we need to do this
point<00:00:57.260> is<00:00:57.350> head<00:00:57.500> applied<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.850> now<00:00:59.800> you've<00:01:00.800> got

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
point is head applied and now you've got

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.420 
point is head applied and now you've got
an<00:01:01.070> instance<00:01:02.230> say<00:01:03.230> if<00:01:03.290> I<00:01:03.410> did<00:01:03.739> anything<00:01:04.220> on

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
an instance say if I did anything on

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.330 
an instance say if I did anything on
this<00:01:04.519> model<00:01:04.729> will<00:01:05.059> automatically<00:01:05.930> update<00:01:06.799> on

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
this model will automatically update on

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.210 
this model will automatically update on
this<00:01:07.490> one<00:01:12.940> instance<00:01:13.940> in<00:01:14.120> can<00:01:14.270> be<00:01:14.330> really<00:01:14.659> handy

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
this one instance in can be really handy

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.840 
this one instance in can be really handy
if<00:01:16.220> you're<00:01:17.680> say<00:01:18.680> for<00:01:18.830> example<00:01:19.250> making<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.640> pile

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
if you're say for example making a pile

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.940 
if you're say for example making a pile
of<00:01:20.000> boxes<00:01:20.150> like<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:22.690> or<00:01:23.690> if<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.320> scattering

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
of boxes like this or if you scattering

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.050 
of boxes like this or if you scattering
around<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.520> same<00:01:25.729> object<00:01:26.150> reusing<00:01:28.060> for

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
around the same object reusing for

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.660 
around the same object reusing for
example<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.590> also<00:01:30.740> make<00:01:31.010> an<00:01:31.159> edit<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.549> all

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
example and you also make an edit to all

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.039 
example and you also make an edit to all
of<00:01:31.820> them<00:01:32.000> but<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.299> don't<00:01:32.420> want<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.659> go<00:01:32.780> through

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
of them but you don't want to go through

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.270 
of them but you don't want to go through
and<00:01:33.170> individually<00:01:33.740> change<00:01:33.950> each<00:01:34.190> one<00:01:35.770> so<00:01:36.770> all

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
and individually change each one so all

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.010 
and individually change each one so all
you<00:01:37.430> just<00:01:37.610> do<00:01:37.790> is<00:01:37.850> just<00:01:38.119> edit<00:01:38.420> one<00:01:38.570> of<00:01:38.690> them

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.090 

to<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.289> my<00:01:43.590> modeling<00:01:44.009> toolkit<00:01:44.490> here<00:01:46.100> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
to do for my modeling toolkit here and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.120 
to do for my modeling toolkit here and
turn<00:01:47.340> soft<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:48.090> Donna<00:01:48.590> think<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.799> too

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
turn soft like Donna think it's too

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.840 
turn soft like Donna think it's too
powerful

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
powerful

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.690 
powerful
there<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.149> go

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.070 

okay<00:01:59.570> we<00:01:59.720> can<00:01:59.960> just<00:02:01.060> just<00:02:02.060> state<00:02:02.299> NOLA<00:02:02.720> just

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.589 

every<00:02:06.080> single<00:02:06.970> objective<00:02:07.970> instance<00:02:10.599> I'm

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
every single objective instance I'm

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.300 
every single objective instance I'm
sorry

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.900 

that's<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.090> instance<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.720> Maya
