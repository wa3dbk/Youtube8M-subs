00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.790
 yes in salt are now his games 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.920
 you actually find out that that term 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.860
 on many things that we do from 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.320
 that is all that applies 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.360
 yes the music is turned inside out 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:04.780
 is viewed away or vice versa 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:07.710
 to let tap water go in for us 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.710
 you a cleo visually 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.619
 my sister would stick to that floor 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.270
 so just erwin is due to the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.039
 dance becomes music and music becomes 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.039
 becomes the board response movement 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.330
 we are first four with 4 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.370
 musicians we met 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.900
 have all been introduced to that 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.810
 have recorded material other than that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.340
 material has gone queen work and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.050
 when they actually have a calling 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.530
 used surprisingly few 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.330
 adapted to the original james 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.190
 we could have told you in advance 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.510
 from now you will jam and grab me 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.640
 piece from there and piece from the 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.370
 piece out there and now as women 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.610
 james gunn very well by very nice 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.960
 depended on puffing imperial another 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.400
 so yes that was very big that is 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.740
 nice but that was also very difficult 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.750
 thereby we had to copy and be now 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.950
 to copy something you what you 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.110
 basically how you just made it up 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.310
 without any structure that is best 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.230
 difficult 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.230
 and you are in a go 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.230
 No 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.230
 some steps but it was 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.190
 all a bit vague and now it is 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.750
 very fine king 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.030
 notice list view or a never that check 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.030
 lesson but its works well 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.920
 so then you sit with your head there 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.560
 but you have ten days to see where 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.049
 So they are in the scene that yes it 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.879
 is just very exciting 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.090
 now i have a pair of eyes lab b yes exactly 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.640
 increase here if yes we are interconnected 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.530
 very much together you could do this now 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.780
 ass honors and and and we must completely 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.260
 get used to different ways of 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.870
 explanation of what's coming 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.739
 and so it is very exciting now 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.739
 start coming now 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.630
 I think the videos watch that very much 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.330
 I think it's just the four of us 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.730
 standard that now of how do you remember one 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.770
 what you play and what pace you use 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.170
 You use the energy 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.790
 and what always what was the s what is the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.620
 essence thereof 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.120
 and we really have to link that to image 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.390
 because there is no other option 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.390
 bottle 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.569
 today more ready for that consumed 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.330
 started to put and then you feel it too 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.770
 effect of if you do that and there 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.650
 it is also good that it is kind of 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.190
 No summer comes together and then 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.620
 give up 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.600
 I assume we can do that without us 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.490
 still have to look down and 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.490
 tempio boat yes 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.730
 the
