to<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> moon<00:01:07.290> they<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.979> surely<00:01:08.310> find<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.060> cause

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
to the moon they can surely find a cause

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.050 
to the moon they can surely find a cause
for<00:01:09.299> tiredness<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.590> think<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.400> turning<00:01:11.700> water

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
for tiredness I think that turning water

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.300 
for tiredness I think that turning water
into<00:01:12.330> wine<00:01:12.630> would<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.200> easier<00:01:13.799> than<00:01:13.979> curing

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
into wine would be easier than curing

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.640 
into wine would be easier than curing
your<00:01:14.640> tiredness<00:01:15.080> have<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.259> considered

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
your tiredness have you considered

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.550 
your tiredness have you considered
becoming<00:01:16.950> an<00:01:17.340> alcoholic<00:01:18.080> perhaps<00:01:19.080> then<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
becoming an alcoholic perhaps then you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.020 
becoming an alcoholic perhaps then you
would<00:01:19.740> understand<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.460> feeling<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.970> being

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
would understand the feeling of being

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.570 
would understand the feeling of being
tired<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.810> morning<00:01:22.259> doctor<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.220> are<00:01:23.250> not
