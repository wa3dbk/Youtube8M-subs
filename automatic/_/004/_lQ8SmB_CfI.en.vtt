00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
is called the custom-built tour so he's

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
is called the custom-built tour so he's
very<00:01:30.150> into<00:01:30.420> hot<00:01:30.570> rods<00:01:30.780> motorcycles<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
very into hot rods motorcycles that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.499 
very into hot rods motorcycles that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
so it made a lot of sense when he wanted

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.719 
so it made a lot of sense when he wanted
to<00:01:35.970> adorn<00:01:36.630> his<00:01:36.869> guitars<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.590> flames<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.460> just
