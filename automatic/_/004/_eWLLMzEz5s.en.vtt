 to have nothing else arms I'm 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.660
 motivated by him because it feels like that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.560

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.170

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.719
 that he does it at just 14 in the beginning 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:43.739

 now I'm used to it 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.969

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.210
 make a difference but it's not a 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.350
 cheater and jewelry at 200 feet here it's 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.809
 something that is really rare 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.350
 point people to see offensively but same 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.910
 needs 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.170
 during the off season it's not 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.880
 the training partners who 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.520
 are missing and blenod him who trains 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:14.840
 with the alex louis leblanc and of course 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:17.270
 jonathan drouin he sees what is that 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.920
 takes to just succeed the line years to 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.890
 the mecca to stay in line 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.990
 national is an impact player and the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.770
 influence it that the older ones have 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.200
 according to him it is this situation that you 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.479
 can not really reach a price 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.430
 on top even though the names adopt the same 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.560
 attitude that drouin the game style the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.340
 two players differs slightly in a

 I hear he's welcomed like a 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:54.440
 match that delivers a concept especially 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.210
 the thing in blue and we're going glay 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.440
