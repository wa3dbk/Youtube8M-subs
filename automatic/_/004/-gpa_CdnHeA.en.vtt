exactly this much baking soda exactly
this<00:00:56.910> much<00:00:57.149> baking<00:00:57.539> powder<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.190> decided<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
this much baking powder I decided to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.510 
this much baking powder I decided to
challenge<00:00:59.520> myself<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.410> did<00:01:02.340> do

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
challenge myself and do it now I did do

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.329 
challenge myself and do it now I did do
some<00:01:02.820> supplements<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.439> wanted<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.979> put

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
some supplements because I wanted to put

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.340 
some supplements because I wanted to put
my<00:01:05.460> own<00:01:05.489> spin<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> say<00:01:06.840> it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
my own spin on it and I have to say it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.100 
my own spin on it and I have to say it
came<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.830> amazing<00:01:07.979> despite<00:01:08.909> my<00:01:09.240> changes<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
came out amazing despite my changes and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.370 
came out amazing despite my changes and
my<00:01:10.650> changes<00:01:11.280> made<00:01:12.210> these<00:01:12.420> cupcakes<00:01:12.630> even

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
my changes made these cupcakes even

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.730 
my changes made these cupcakes even
lower<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.340> fact<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.180> instead<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.140> sugar<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
lower in fact so instead of the sugar I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.539 
lower in fact so instead of the sugar I
use<00:01:17.369> half<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.330> way<00:01:19.110> low<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:20.369> called

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
use half of this way low it's called

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.940 
use half of this way low it's called
sugar<00:01:21.090> made<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.750> healthy<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.380> had<00:01:22.799> actually

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
sugar made to be healthy I had actually

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.490 
sugar made to be healthy I had actually
never<00:01:23.250> heard<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.970> before<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.869> saw<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.350> in

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
never heard of it before but I saw it in

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.910 
never heard of it before but I saw it in
whole<00:01:25.680> foods<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.970> says<00:01:27.509> 121<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.770> way

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
whole foods and so it says 121 the way

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.980 
whole foods and so it says 121 the way
low<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> sugar<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> thought<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.780> may<00:01:30.960> as

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
low to the sugar so I thought I may as

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
low to the sugar so I thought I may as
well<00:01:31.110> give<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> try<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.979> calories<00:01:32.579> per<00:01:32.909> 1

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
well give a try for calories per 1

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.260 
well give a try for calories per 1
teaspoon<00:01:33.720> serving<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.280> four<00:01:35.280> grams<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.939> carbs

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
teaspoon serving and four grams of carbs

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.740 
teaspoon serving and four grams of carbs
so<00:01:36.619> I<00:01:37.619> gave<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.189> shot<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> did<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.450> cup<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
so I gave it a shot so I did one cup of

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.590 
so I gave it a shot so I did one cup of
this<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.829> post-it<00:01:41.729> supplemented<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.420> from

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
this as a post-it supplemented it from

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.210 
this as a post-it supplemented it from
the<00:01:42.720> cup<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.110> sugar<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.680> still<00:01:43.920> did<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the cup of sugar then I still did the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.420 
the cup of sugar then I still did the
real<00:01:44.840> brown<00:01:45.840> sugar<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> real<00:01:46.740> sugar<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
real brown sugar the real sugar so I

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.030 
real brown sugar the real sugar so I
have<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.790> sweetness<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.450> then<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.890> I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
have that sweetness and then because I

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.370 
have that sweetness and then because I
didn't<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.520> buttermilk<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.390> called<00:01:52.200> for

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
didn't have buttermilk it called for

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.380 
didn't have buttermilk it called for
reduced<00:01:52.770> fat<00:01:52.979> buttermilk<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.670> used<00:01:53.909> regular

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
reduced fat buttermilk I used regular

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.330 
reduced fat buttermilk I used regular
milk<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.500> added<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.920> little<00:01:55.950> bit<00:01:56.189> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
milk and then I added a little bit of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.959 
milk and then I added a little bit of
this<00:01:56.520> fromage<00:01:57.149> blanc<00:01:57.810> zero<00:01:58.799> present<00:01:59.369> fat<00:01:59.610> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
this fromage blanc zero present fat it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.740 
this fromage blanc zero present fat it
has<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.170> tartness<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> felt<00:02:02.820> was<00:02:03.329> similar

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
has a tartness that I felt was similar

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.750 
has a tartness that I felt was similar
to<00:02:03.780> buttermilk<00:02:04.820> similar<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.060> a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
to buttermilk similar to a

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.719 
to buttermilk similar to a
our<00:02:06.910> cream<00:02:07.150> but<00:02:07.390> 15<00:02:07.900> calories<00:02:08.200> zero<00:02:08.710> grams<00:02:09.460> of

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
our cream but 15 calories zero grams of

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.620 
our cream but 15 calories zero grams of
fat<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.950> 2.5<00:02:11.950> grams<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.610> protein<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.600> I

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
fat and 2.5 grams of protein so I

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.690 
fat and 2.5 grams of protein so I
thought<00:02:13.840> may<00:02:14.020> as<00:02:14.170> well<00:02:14.290> give<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.070> try<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:15.670> I

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
thought may as well give that a try so I

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.600 
thought may as well give that a try so I
did<00:02:16.120> one<00:02:16.990> part<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.650> think<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.920> was<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.070> cup<00:02:18.400> of

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
did one part I think it was a cup of

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.320 
did one part I think it was a cup of
milk<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.390> then<00:02:19.930> half<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.800> cup<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.820> fromage

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
milk and then half a cup of this fromage

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.070 
milk and then half a cup of this fromage
blanc<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.940> topping<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.600> frosting

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
blanc then for the topping the frosting

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.440 
blanc then for the topping the frosting
which<00:02:26.230> was<00:02:26.440> already<00:02:26.890> very<00:02:26.980> very<00:02:27.700> light<00:02:28.030> I

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
which was already very very light I

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.250 
which was already very very light I
decided<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.560> lighten<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.130> up<00:02:30.220> even<00:02:31.090> further<00:02:31.540> so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
decided to lighten it up even further so

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.500 
decided to lighten it up even further so
I<00:02:32.290> did<00:02:32.650> use<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.920> reduced<00:02:33.790> fat<00:02:34.090> cream<00:02:34.480> cheese

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
I did use the reduced fat cream cheese

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.280 
I did use the reduced fat cream cheese
and<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:36.100> used<00:02:36.430> sip<00:02:36.760> peanut<00:02:37.090> butter<00:02:37.270> I<00:02:37.570> actually

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
and I used sip peanut butter I actually

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.500 
and I used sip peanut butter I actually
got<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.860> peanut<00:02:39.250> butter<00:02:39.280> that's<00:02:39.700> fresh<00:02:40.150> made

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
got this peanut butter that's fresh made

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.930 
got this peanut butter that's fresh made
peanut<00:02:40.900> butter<00:02:40.960> from<00:02:41.770> whole<00:02:41.980> foods<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:42.610> it's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
peanut butter from whole foods so it's

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.140 
peanut butter from whole foods so it's
only<00:02:43.210> organic<00:02:43.990> dry<00:02:44.320> roasted<00:02:44.740> peanuts<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
only organic dry roasted peanuts and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.510 
only organic dry roasted peanuts and
then<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:47.020> wanted<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.620> little<00:02:47.740> bit<00:02:47.980> more<00:02:48.130> texture

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
then I wanted a little bit more texture

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.280 
then I wanted a little bit more texture
and<00:02:48.820> honestly<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.150> little<00:02:49.450> bit<00:02:49.690> more<00:02:49.840> topping

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
and honestly a little bit more topping

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.880 
and honestly a little bit more topping
because<00:02:50.590> i<00:02:50.800> love<00:02:51.250> frosting<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.810> i<00:02:53.140> added<00:02:53.530> a

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
because i love frosting so i added a

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.030 
because i love frosting so i added a
half<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.430> cup<00:02:54.460> of<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:54.940> fat<00:02:55.270> free<00:02:55.570> rico<00:02:55.930> de<00:02:56.040> to

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
half a cup of this fat free rico de to

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.340 
half a cup of this fat free rico de to
add<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.550> little<00:02:57.580> bit<00:02:57.820> more<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.600> little<00:02:58.990> bit

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
add just a little bit more a little bit

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.590 
add just a little bit more a little bit
of<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.590> kick<00:02:59.800> a<00:03:00.010> little<00:03:00.040> bit<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.820> a<00:03:00.970> bitterness

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
of a kick a little bit of a bitterness

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.220 
of a kick a little bit of a bitterness
and<00:03:01.990> then<00:03:02.380> also<00:03:02.620> more<00:03:03.610> consistency<00:03:04.390> without

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
and then also more consistency without

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.070 
and then also more consistency without
the<00:03:05.380> fat<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.390> 50<00:03:07.390> calories<00:03:07.630> for<00:03:08.050> a

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
the fat and this is 50 calories for a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.910 
the fat and this is 50 calories for a
quarter<00:03:08.530> cup<00:03:08.709> as<00:03:09.420> zero<00:03:10.420> fat<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.050> 10<00:03:11.380> grams<00:03:11.650> of

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
quarter cup as zero fat and 10 grams of

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.650 
quarter cup as zero fat and 10 grams of
protein<00:03:12.130> so<00:03:12.520> i<00:03:12.580> was<00:03:12.730> really<00:03:12.910> upping<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.540> in

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
protein so i was really upping it in

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.010 
protein so i was really upping it in
terms<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.230> protein<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:15.130> all<00:03:15.370> areas<00:03:16.020> then

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
terms of the protein in all areas then

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.830 
terms of the protein in all areas then
because<00:03:17.920> i<00:03:17.950> do<00:03:18.280> have<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.700> tendency<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.300> lick<00:03:19.660> the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
because i do have a tendency to lick the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.990 
because i do have a tendency to lick the
bowl<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.590> have<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:20.860> scoop<00:03:21.220> here<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.700> is<00:03:21.820> good

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
bowl and have a scoop here it is good

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.550 
bowl and have a scoop here it is good
there<00:03:22.269> of<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:23.410> batter<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:24.090> was<00:03:25.090> chewing<00:03:25.390> gum

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
there of the batter I was chewing gum

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.040 
there of the batter I was chewing gum
this<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.860> apparently<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.820> big<00:03:28.090> Baker's<00:03:28.660> trick

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
this is apparently a big Baker's trick

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.199 
this is apparently a big Baker's trick
it's<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.769> way<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.130> Baker's<00:03:30.550> don't<00:03:30.880> gain<00:03:31.180> a

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
it's the way that Baker's don't gain a

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.729 
it's the way that Baker's don't gain a
huge<00:03:31.780> amount<00:03:32.050> of<00:03:32.140> weight<00:03:32.320> when<00:03:32.590> they're

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
huge amount of weight when they're

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.440 
huge amount of weight when they're
making<00:03:33.070> all<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.190> those<00:03:33.400> yummy<00:03:33.700> cakes<00:03:34.150> and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
making all of those yummy cakes and

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.990 
making all of those yummy cakes and
cookies<00:03:34.570> if<00:03:35.200> you're<00:03:35.830> chewing<00:03:36.130> gum<00:03:36.489> you're

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
cookies if you're chewing gum you're

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.110 
cookies if you're chewing gum you're
going<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.209> be<00:03:37.360> less<00:03:37.660> apt<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.400> take<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.430> spoonful

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
going to be less apt to take a spoonful

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.330 
going to be less apt to take a spoonful
of<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.739> whatever<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:41.920> is<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:42.220> you're

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
of that whatever it is that you're

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.820 
of that whatever it is that you're
making<00:03:42.489> because<00:03:43.000> remember<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.989> might<00:03:44.380> be<00:03:44.560> just

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
making because remember it might be just

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.160 
making because remember it might be just
a<00:03:44.950> little<00:03:44.980> spoonful<00:03:45.790> but<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.360> put<00:03:46.570> that<00:03:46.720> storm

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
a little spoonful but you put that storm

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.920 
a little spoonful but you put that storm
fall<00:03:47.500> on<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:48.550> cookie<00:03:48.850> sheet<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.300> it<00:03:49.690> turns

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
fall on the cookie sheet and it turns

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.580 
fall on the cookie sheet and it turns
into<00:03:50.080> this<00:03:50.519> gigantic<00:03:51.519> cookie<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.239> just

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
into this gigantic cookie so you just

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.040 
into this gigantic cookie so you just
huh<00:03:53.760> nothing<00:03:54.760> really<00:03:54.970> no<00:03:55.390> you<00:03:55.630> just<00:03:55.660> ate<00:03:56.019> a

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
huh nothing really no you just ate a

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.810 
huh nothing really no you just ate a
cookie<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.890> didn't<00:03:57.070> even<00:03:57.100> really<00:03:57.430> enjoy

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
cookie and you didn't even really enjoy

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.800 
cookie and you didn't even really enjoy
it<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:58.690> shoot<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.650> gun<00:03:59.800> then<00:04:00.640> bake<00:04:01.540> the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
it so shoot the gun then bake the

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.590 
it so shoot the gun then bake the
cupcakes<00:04:02.190> hold<00:04:03.190> them<00:04:03.400> out<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:03.970> as<00:04:04.209> they're

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
cupcakes hold them out and as they're

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.300
