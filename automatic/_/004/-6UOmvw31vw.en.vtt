00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.660
 first little message can be to 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.789
 yellow supporters and who discovers you a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.860
 little message let's go easy 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.010
 I come for to try to resume 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.960
 pleasure and 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.400
 I think that collectively on the team 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.260
 so I want it very well I hope 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.020
 also includes the then procured a lot 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.040
 of pleasure everything is a new 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.900
 challenge for everyone with this box 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.760
 who is a little bit of not on this 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.120
 three-quarter line how do you evaluate 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.970
 this staff that you discovered 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.580
 but in this case we share the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.510
 quality after it's a good mix 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.730
 two young people from old 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.490
 the two new ones so here we are from 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.840
 cause 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.030
 but let the mayonnaise take the most 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.800
 quickly possible so that for that 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.450
 season there is no way coming 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.010
 you're also part of 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.500
 new integration went well 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.000
 the stage in hourtin yeah we left 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.220
 one week 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.660
 quickly an internship at hourtin and it's 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.550
 true that it helped us a little 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.960
 integration after I had the good 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.400
 chance to know the self a vote 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.530
 by train which only facilitate a little 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.200
 of integration but after that it's true 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.250
 that the team and the players in place have 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.780
 makes sure that the new 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.300
 integrate quickly and easily 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.400
 so it's a very good thing 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.750
 the three weeks there we finish a 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.460

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.990

 not too many balloons but hey 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.119
 part of the game and I thought of a 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.270
