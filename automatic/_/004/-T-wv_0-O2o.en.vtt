00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.759
 range so the rivers that really not the 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:19.000
 mountaineer all terrain 50/50 really 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.190

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.450
 necklace to 187 under feet you will do 14 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.070
 radius meters that will really tour 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.480
 on earth entrusts father madam on track 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.610
 are saturated a wood structure with a 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.180
 double platinum to have a maximum of 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.600
 stability 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.649
 we will add a rocker on the front 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.079
 here is a little more modern 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.490
 with the spatula venturi and that's it 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.170
 product really about the conditions of 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.570
 snow like we'll see there this morning a 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.280
 little bit hard on the track also 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.480
 Bill's death is okay it's coming 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.900
 of what is ugly I believe that there is 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.900
 no surprises 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.930
 So here are very players 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.149
 a little cloud sarr sail alone from 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.530
 we want one feels a little above the bottom 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.410
 like that it holds good 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.159
 we tried a little snow a little 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.530
 little income listening it was the passage 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.810
 between ladies and the edges of the track 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.179
 done without any problem so really 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.069
 Versatile skiing it's really very 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:18.579
 easy so for me it's really a 

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:21.009
 accessible ski open to as many people as possible 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.499
 really it's a real high mountain 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.329
 that is very pleasant very player 

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:26.920
 on the track and then as soon as we go out to 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.200
 Ben side finally that a very good 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.549
 behavior on the brand new there like 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.369
 we had this morning a little bit this 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.380
 snow income and ben listens because 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.779
 it's really what you need 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.639
 advise to people who want 

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:41.319
 start to really get off 

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:44.799
 track having track skiing really 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:49.389
 super good performance already good little this 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.459
 who is really great the famous little 

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:52.869
 rivers that makes its way too who 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.939
 was pretty modern a little too year 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.249
 last and then in fact according to 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.659
 proportions we have found identity 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.909
 that is given in terms oh! 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.229
 skis that are fairly small radius 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.509
 directional but that remains pretty 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.869
 playful bull because ebe off track 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.220
 so that's a bit objective 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.020
 then very slowly people adhere to 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.799
 what to have skis that do a little 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.799
 all lands udder
