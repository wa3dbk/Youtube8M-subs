00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.869
 so hello friends with you i am artem 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:21.810
 love and in this video I will tell you about 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.990
 exercise for hands and scissors for 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.430
 hand scissors with exercise scissors 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.820
 how do i literally sew myself skill well 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.620
 cut properly wield a pair of scissors and 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.040
 a large number of my students on 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.260
 seminars just do what that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.560
 wrong strong things i face 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.530
 so that when the master cuts it at 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.190
 opening canvases work immediately 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.500
 and upper arms of the Lord or upper 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.550
 fingers ring walks and thumb 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.620
 go down and it turns out that I have 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.630
 not even so it turns out to do already 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.520
 just can't do wrong but 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.110
 the point here is that if any of you 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.799
 so does it get so wrong 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.049
 why because you have a snag 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.719
 in order to make shading for example for 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.270
 when you do the shading you have scissors 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.610
 one canvas always stands still and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.159
 only go second canvas when you 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.360
 do pointing when you do point 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.890
 how when do you do most 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.560
 sections generally have any sections you do not 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.640
 did you always will work 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.400
 only one only one canvas where 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.380
 you have a thumb with the second 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.560
 the canvas should always stand it as 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.760
 your like yours 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.260
 which line you lead is yours 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.810
 the starting is the most important movement 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.299
 literally and key but many masters 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.590
 at the same time can not do so 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.350
 one stood 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.180
 and the other finger went and so I 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.650
 developed a set of exercises that 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.810
 we have very fast results for years 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.060
 they switch quickly enough 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.990
 start to cut correctly and can no longer 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.069
 repeat your old mistakes so 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.780
 the first exercise is 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.420
 next find yourself some 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.390
 support in our role as support to 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.030
 you see favored our immense 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.770
 beautiful pig find here such 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.410
 it's time 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.760
 you put all four fingers on it and 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:31.660
 just start working like this 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.850
 thumb at this moment your muscles 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.580
 and tendons should get used to the thought 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.690
 that the thumb can move 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.519
 apart from all other fingers 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.739
 that is, it is a self-contained separate 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.410
 unit he does the work the rest do not 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.019
 performs do it point-blank after 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.209
 how is your first time possible 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.830
 the hand will start to hurt a little and somehow 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.630
 not a hand holding here some 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.239
 tension will appear but let it be you 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.790
 confuses it so happens after u 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.250
 you got it you leave the prop 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.549
 from the prop and start working in 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.980
 limbo here such here 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.230
 movement at this stage is often in people still 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.030
 starts there somehow 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.280
 fun to walk hands don't skate if 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.459
 starts to walk your fingers up come back 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.510
 again in focus and you start doing again 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.390
 here is the movement 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.579
 some moment the java beast will start 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.720
 get it and in this moment you 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:33.519
 have to take your scissors and take them in 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.560
 arm and already at this moment you will have everything 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.609
 the same one canvas stands still 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.670
 and the thumb is coming off that is 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.310
 almost all the same but with 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.530
 adding scissors to fix 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.650
 I recommend this canvas to you 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.109
 put it on your finger on your fingertip 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.959
 you will have the following exercise 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.780
 here you keep and walks with you only 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.430
 thumb 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.180
 the main thing in this exercise as wide as possible 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.370
 open your thumb to withdraw from 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.100
 you swamp movement amplitude was 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.250
 sufficient in most large reel 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.950
 capable of your scissors and your finger and here 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.180
 you start walking 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.010
 one was but the second stands still 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.630
 now the most difficult exercise 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.120
 after you got it 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.780
 you begin this exercise you 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.700
 this canvas drive along a finger waiting 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.670
 smoothly gentle without jerking 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.760
 and the second canvas you have at this moment 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.920
 works and here you need to achieve here 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.240
 such a result that goes back she 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:53.400
 was back forward 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:55.440
 and the second does work at a certain 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.020
 the moment you get used to that yes you walk 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.090
 only one thumb and this then 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.420
 it will be useful to you in all in all works 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.100
 for can't even list and that's all 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.290
 that is, only one always works 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.900
 the thumb is a canvas never 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.000
 these four exercises work if you 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.430
 you will perform at least 10 minutes there 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.320
 a day through there three or four days you 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.480
 you can absolutely work at 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.930
 you stop and the tension comes from 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.160
 hands and so you 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.230
 move up one small step 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.640
 closer to his skill at not 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.080
 I wish you good luck doing these exercises 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.080
 all the best for now
