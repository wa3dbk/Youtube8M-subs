Cataclysm<00:03:21.880> well<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.180> don't<00:03:23.390> know<00:03:23.840> for<00:03:24.080> sure<00:03:24.110> but

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
Cataclysm well I don't know for sure but

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.410 
Cataclysm well I don't know for sure but
checking<00:03:24.800> my<00:03:24.920> level<00:03:25.190> 70<00:03:25.550> mage<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.090> tell<00:03:26.270> you

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420

checking my level 70 mage I can tell you
he<00:03:26.570> still<00:03:26.630> holds<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.440> general<00:03:27.890> title<00:03:28.280> I

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
he still holds the general title I

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.250 
he still holds the general title I
honestly<00:03:28.760> don't<00:03:29.209> see<00:03:29.360> why<00:03:29.660> they<00:03:29.900> would<00:03:29.930> remove

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
honestly don't see why they would remove

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.620 
honestly don't see why they would remove
them<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.920> if<00:03:31.070> they<00:03:31.130> do<00:03:31.310> me<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.300> a<00:03:32.360> lot<00:03:32.570> of

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
them and if they do me and a lot of

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.510 
them and if they do me and a lot of
people<00:03:33.080> who<00:03:33.230> are<00:03:33.410> tarred<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.950> obtain<00:03:34.250> them

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
people who are tarred to obtain them

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.490 
people who are tarred to obtain them
back<00:03:34.820> in<00:03:35.060> classic<00:03:35.630> will<00:03:35.840> be<00:03:35.959> pretty<00:03:36.200> thick

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
back in classic will be pretty thick

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.290 
back in classic will be pretty thick
instead<00:03:37.100> I<00:03:37.130> think<00:03:37.340> they<00:03:37.850> may<00:03:38.030> use<00:03:38.270> different

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
instead I think they may use different

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.470 
instead I think they may use different
titles<00:03:39.110> so<00:03:39.320> people<00:03:39.709> aren't<00:03:39.860> confused<00:03:40.480> what

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
titles so people aren't confused what

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.030 
titles so people aren't confused what
does<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.870> auction<00:03:42.260> house<00:03:42.410> look<00:03:42.680> like<00:03:42.860> in

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
does the auction house look like in

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.430 
does the auction house look like in
Cataclysm<00:03:43.640> in<00:03:43.790> orgrimmar<00:03:44.780> there<00:03:44.959> are<00:03:45.050> several

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
Cataclysm in orgrimmar there are several

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.500 
Cataclysm in orgrimmar there are several
different<00:03:46.040> auction<00:03:46.370> houses<00:03:46.730> but<00:03:46.880> my<00:03:47.060> favorite

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
different auction houses but my favorite

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.990 
different auction houses but my favorite
so<00:03:47.690> far<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.959> this<00:03:48.230> one<00:03:48.440> ran<00:03:48.709> by<00:03:48.890> goblins<00:03:49.100> it

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
so far is this one ran by goblins it

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.759 
so far is this one ran by goblins it
looks<00:03:50.269> really<00:03:50.720> nice<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.200> hopefully<00:03:51.590> they'll

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
looks really nice and hopefully they'll

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.350 
looks really nice and hopefully they'll
also<00:03:51.950> update<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.489> auction<00:03:52.940> house<00:03:53.090> pain

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
also update the auction house pain

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.500 
also update the auction house pain
itself<00:03:53.720> as<00:03:53.959> well<00:03:54.170> are<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:55.700> mountains<00:03:56.090> events

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
itself as well are the mountains events

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.630 
itself as well are the mountains events
removed<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:56.989> Cataclysm<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:58.100> far<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.519> doesn't

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
removed in Cataclysm so far it doesn't

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.310 
removed in Cataclysm so far it doesn't
look<00:03:58.850> like<00:03:58.970> they'll<00:03:59.330> be<00:03:59.480> removed<00:03:59.900> you'll

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
look like they'll be removed you'll

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.290 
look like they'll be removed you'll
probably<00:04:00.620> still<00:04:01.040> be<00:04:01.100> able<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.489> go<00:04:01.730> back<00:04:01.970> when

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
probably still be able to go back when

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.940 
probably still be able to go back when
you're<00:04:02.420> 85<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.260> breeze<00:04:03.500> through<00:04:03.739> some

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
you're 85 and breeze through some

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.740 
you're 85 and breeze through some
achievements<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.640> get<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.910> mount<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.330> just

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
achievements to get that mount you just

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.870 
achievements to get that mount you just
couldn't<00:04:06.140> seem<00:04:06.380> to<00:04:06.410> get<00:04:06.739> during<00:04:07.010> wrath<00:04:07.340> while

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
couldn't seem to get during wrath while

I'm<00:04:08.030> purely<00:04:08.630> speculating<00:04:09.050> I<00:04:09.530> think<00:04:09.830> the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950
