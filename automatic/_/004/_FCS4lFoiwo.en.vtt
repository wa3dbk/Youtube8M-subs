00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.000 
first video I'd made just because it was
a<00:00:14.940> proof<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.299> concept<00:00:15.470> just<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.619> show<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
a proof of concept just to show that I

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.109 
a proof of concept just to show that I
was<00:00:17.310> able<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.730> get<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.920> sega<00:00:19.920> master<00:00:20.310> system<00:00:20.580> rom

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
was able to get a sega master system rom

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.620 
was able to get a sega master system rom
to<00:00:21.330> work<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.800> gameboy<00:00:23.130> emulator<00:00:23.630> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
to work on the gameboy emulator the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.720 
to work on the gameboy emulator the
second<00:00:24.990> video<00:00:25.080> was<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.590> Sonic<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.490> I've

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
second video was for Sonic and so I've

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.019 
second video was for Sonic and so I've
added<00:00:26.880> quite<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> few<00:00:27.779> more<00:00:28.010> romps<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.189> haven't

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
tested all of them so hopefully they all

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.729 
tested all of them so hopefully they all
work<00:00:31.769> at<00:00:32.000> at<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.719> play<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:36.620> what<00:00:37.620> do

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
a gameboy emulator and so I thought

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.670 
a gameboy emulator and so I thought
about<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.949> idea<00:00:59.930> earlier<00:01:00.930> today<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.500> kind

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
about this idea earlier today just kind

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.740

of<00:01:01.710> mind<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.010> see<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> would<00:01:02.399> work<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.030> so

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
of mind and see if it would work and so

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.509 
of mind and see if it would work and so
I<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.439> listening<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.920> three<00:01:05.040> different<00:01:05.189> ones

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
create a new app all i did was just

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249

convert<00:01:17.759> these<00:01:18.000> files<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.630> able<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> work

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
convert these files to be able to work

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.620 
convert these files to be able to work
on<00:01:19.439> GG<00:01:20.330> spgs<00:01:21.770> gps<00:01:22.770> phone<00:01:23.280> which<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.240> created<00:01:24.540> by

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
on GG spgs gps phone which is created by

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.310 
on GG spgs gps phone which is created by
the<00:01:24.689> salty<00:01:25.110> TD<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:27.150> hopefully<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.170> will

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the salty TD and hopefully this will

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.990 
the salty TD and hopefully this will
hold<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.590> people<00:01:28.950> over<00:01:29.070> while<00:01:29.460> he<00:01:29.640> releases

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
hold for people over while he releases

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330 
hold for people over while he releases
the<00:01:30.240> genesis<00:01:30.740> emulator<00:01:31.740> which<00:01:31.890> should<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.220> out

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the genesis emulator which should be out

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.730 
the genesis emulator which should be out
in<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.520> next<00:01:32.549> couple<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.970> days<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> let's<00:01:34.680> open

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
in the next couple of days so let's open

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.200 
in the next couple of days so let's open
this<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:37.250> first<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.970> is

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
this up first for all I see is

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.940 
this up first for all I see is
afterburner<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.110> haven't<00:01:40.380> tested<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.770> one

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
afterburner I haven't tested this one

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:51.560 
afterburner I haven't tested this one
hopefully<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.369> works<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.700> me<00:01:45.259> there<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.380> go

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.540 

and<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.380> does<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.710> found<00:01:52.980> this<00:01:53.130> choppy

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
and it does have found this choppy

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.350 
and it does have found this choppy
though<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.479> turned<00:01:54.690> it<00:01:54.750> off<00:01:59.240> try<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
though so I just turned it off try to

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.310 
though so I just turned it off try to
move<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.750> brighter<00:02:01.260> area<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:02.370> we<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:03.320> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
move to a brighter area there we go and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.419 
move to a brighter area there we go and
just<00:02:05.310> show<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.760> it<00:02:05.880> does<00:02:06.060> work<00:02:06.300> and

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
just show you that it does work and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.630 
just show you that it does work and
actually<00:02:08.429> plays<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.910> pretty<00:02:09.240> smoothly<00:02:09.600> that

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
actually plays it pretty smoothly that

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.680 
actually plays it pretty smoothly that
one<00:02:11.640> hundred<00:02:11.850> percent<00:02:11.880> desperate<00:02:12.450> shirts

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
one hundred percent desperate shirts

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.890 
one hundred percent desperate shirts
maybe<00:02:13.080> close<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.709> x70<00:02:14.340> rating<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.910> so

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
maybe close to the x70 rating and so

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.810 
maybe close to the x70 rating and so
this<00:02:16.050> has<00:02:16.260> been<00:02:16.290> after<00:02:16.920> burner<00:02:17.130> which<00:02:17.580> was

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
this has been after burner which was

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
world to another one start new game i

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.360 
world to another one start new game i
know<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:31.440> works<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.920> first<00:02:32.130> game<00:02:32.310> i

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
know this one works is the first game i

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:43.270 
know this one works is the first game i
got<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.760> work<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.770> fine

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.280 

this<00:02:43.940> one<00:02:44.090> actually<00:02:44.150> runs<00:02:44.480> pretty<00:02:44.660> smoothly<00:02:44.959> I

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
this one actually runs pretty smoothly I

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.559 
this one actually runs pretty smoothly I
think<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:45.950> just<00:02:45.980> gives<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.370> simple<00:02:46.850> game<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:49.569> so

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
think it just gives a simple game and so

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.140 
think it just gives a simple game and so
