00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.070

 current playing and practicing in 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.170
 international servers very well those that 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.939
 I wanted to tell you in this video is a 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.220
 experience that I had the horror of having 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.779
 lived is a very bitch experience 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.359
 mother that I had to live while being 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.219
 playing the c before starting to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.380
 tell them the story I tell them that the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.390
 content is totally real since I 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.300
 I lived it myself and if you do not believe me then neither 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.149
 take the trouble to watch the video 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.250
 I tell you every detail of what happened this 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.260
 year as always boring on the internet 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.670
 when I was given to play some game 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.219
 online so I started playing 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.460
 minecraft for 1 hour after that I 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.840
 I get bored and I decided to play 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.239
 I turned on the launcher of the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.190
 every normal game opened the box 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.800
 play online and I saw a lot of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.719
 servers but I noticed something strange because there was 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.400
 a server that said one of zero 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.430
 It means that there was a player 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.460
 zero but that 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.530
 of logic so I remembered the creepy 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.690
 aluce paste in a boy said that 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.000
 I had seen a box that said 12 of 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.890
 6 I told myself that this could not 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.020
 be true since he believes them pipes 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.870
 they are fake fucking stories created 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.790
 to scare and intrigue in my head I 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.320
 I said to myself that it was not true 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.600
 that I thought was a failure of my 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.310
 computer that is crap even so I 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.920
 I decided to enter and to my surprise 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.290
 was the normal server was the map of 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.720
 blood girls all normal until I saw the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.700
 names of the players were just me 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.520
 and another user who did not have any 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.470
 name I did not give importance and I started 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.119
 walk the map to find something 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.160
 rare and take a screenshot 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.410
 everything was fine until the user 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.600
 no name told me dies dies and a 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.000
 heap of symbols in demonic colors 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.490
 at that time I left immediately 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.320
 the server was very scared with what 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.430
 it happened that he did not want to play again and 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.430
 almost erased the halo c 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.180
