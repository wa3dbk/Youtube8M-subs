00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
manic panic and all those colors are

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.670 
manic panic and all those colors are
semi<00:04:41.150> permanent<00:04:41.509> and<00:04:41.840> they're<00:04:42.110> honestly<00:04:42.469> not

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
semi permanent and they're honestly not

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.040 
semi permanent and they're honestly not
as<00:04:42.860> damaging<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.699> through<00:04:44.569> all<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.930> different

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
as damaging so through all the different

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.749 
as damaging so through all the different
bright<00:04:45.409> colors<00:04:45.740> I<00:04:45.949> didn't<00:04:46.280> damage<00:04:46.400> my<00:04:46.610> hair
