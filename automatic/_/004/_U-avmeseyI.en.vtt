can get from the grinder this is

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.780

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
was the slim defragment at the Logans

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.810 
was the slim defragment at the Logans
come<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.350> blowfly<00:02:04.829> at<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.070> maggie<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.460> they

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
come the blowfly at the maggie and they

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.080 
come the blowfly at the maggie and they
shoot<00:02:06.210> around<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:07.110> total<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.670> said<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
shoot around in total so like I said I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.839 
shoot around in total so like I said I
did<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.509> 50<00:02:09.780> times<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.340> results<00:02:11.790> have

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
did that 50 times and the results have

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.610 
did that 50 times and the results have
come<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.239> after<00:02:12.450> 15

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
come out after 15

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.220 
come out after 15
so<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:14.069> most<00:02:14.340> common<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.180> got<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> draw

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so the most common that I got was a draw

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.649 
so the most common that I got was a draw
between<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.830> Zim<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.549> fragment<00:02:18.060> which

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
between the Zim and the fragment which

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.890 
between the Zim and the fragment which
were<00:02:18.870> both<00:02:19.110> 11<00:02:19.709> runs<00:02:19.890> each<00:02:20.370> after<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.690> was

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
were both 11 runs each after that it was

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.110 
were both 11 runs each after that it was
a<00:02:21.930> close<00:02:22.590> second<00:02:23.069> for<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.310> Logan's<00:02:23.700> gone<00:02:23.909> on

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
a close second for the Logan's gone on

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.190 
a close second for the Logan's gone on
10<00:02:24.569> rooms<00:02:26.030> blowfly<00:02:27.030> came<00:02:27.390> out<00:02:27.599> eight<00:02:27.840> times

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
10 rooms blowfly came out eight times

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.520 
10 rooms blowfly came out eight times
the<00:02:29.099> Maggie<00:02:29.459> came<00:02:29.819> out<00:02:30.060> seven<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.780> then<00:02:31.170> right

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
the Maggie came out seven and then right

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.160 
the Maggie came out seven and then right
and<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.920> very<00:02:32.220> bottom<00:02:32.730> was<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.510> shooter<00:02:33.989> and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
and the very bottom was the shooter and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.520 
and the very bottom was the shooter and
which<00:02:34.470> was<00:02:34.739> three<00:02:35.099> times<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:36.239> unlike<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.379> last

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
which was three times so unlike the last

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.559 
which was three times so unlike the last
episode<00:02:38.040> where<00:02:38.400> there<00:02:39.090> was<00:02:39.239> only<00:02:39.420> a

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
episode where there was only a

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.380 
episode where there was only a
difference<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.110> about<00:02:40.200> four<00:02:40.680> between<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
difference of about four between in the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.600 
difference of about four between in the
assault<00:02:42.690> rifles<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.950> seemed<00:02:44.159> that<00:02:44.190> there

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
assault rifles so it seemed that there

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.920 
assault rifles so it seemed that there
was<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> good<00:02:44.940> chance<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.450> gaining<00:02:45.629> every

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
was a good chance of gaining every

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.220 
was a good chance of gaining every
single<00:02:46.410> one<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.640> pistol<00:02:48.090> certainly<00:02:49.049> for

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
single one in the pistol certainly for

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.289 
single one in the pistol certainly for
me<00:02:49.379> anyway<00:02:49.859> it<00:02:50.129> seemed<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.269> a

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
me anyway it seemed that there is a

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.470 
me anyway it seemed that there is a
clear<00:02:51.780> difference<00:02:52.049> about<00:02:52.739> rarity<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.549> pistols

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
clear difference about rarity of pistols

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.569 
clear difference about rarity of pistols
that<00:02:54.660> will<00:02:54.750> come<00:02:54.959> out<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.319> grinder<00:02:55.829> for<00:02:56.400> me

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
that will come out of the grinder for me

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.509 
that will come out of the grinder for me
anyway<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.690> when<00:02:57.930> three<00:02:58.680> was<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> very<00:02:59.250> bottom

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
anyway so when three was the very bottom

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.190 
anyway so when three was the very bottom
of<00:02:59.609> the<00:02:59.700> shoot<00:02:59.909> around<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.480> then<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.780> winner

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
of the shoot around and then the winner

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.099 
of the shoot around and then the winner
was<00:03:01.530> 11<00:03:02.190> with<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.459> sim<00:03:02.849> and<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.150> fragment<00:03:03.720> so

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
was 11 with the sim and the fragment so

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.920 
was 11 with the sim and the fragment so
there<00:03:04.319> seems<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.739> definitely<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.790> rarity<00:03:06.720> of

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
there seems to definitely be a rarity of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.190 
there seems to definitely be a rarity of
pistols<00:03:07.650> with<00:03:08.579> a<00:03:08.609> difference<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.480> eight<00:03:09.750> that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
pistols with a difference of eight that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.410 
pistols with a difference of eight that
is<00:03:10.260> definitely<00:03:10.799> a<00:03:10.859> big<00:03:11.420> difference

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
is definitely a big difference

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.319 
is definitely a big difference
especially<00:03:12.510> over<00:03:13.290> six<00:03:13.590> different<00:03:14.430> weapons

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
especially over six different weapons

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.050 
especially over six different weapons
so<00:03:15.900> we're<00:03:16.109> yeah<00:03:16.379> it<00:03:16.560> seems<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.430> occasion

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
so we're yeah it seems on this occasion

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.659 
so we're yeah it seems on this occasion
that<00:03:18.450> if<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.260> want<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.500> shoot<00:03:19.769> around<00:03:19.950> you're

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
that if you want to shoot around you're

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.490 
that if you want to shoot around you're
going<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.880> have<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> hard<00:03:21.329> time<00:03:21.389> in<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.900> grinder

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
going to have a hard time in the grinder

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.729 
going to have a hard time in the grinder
mid<00:03:23.400> range<00:03:23.669> Maggie<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.359> blowfly<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
mid range Maggie and blowfly and the

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.250 
mid range Maggie and blowfly and the
Logan's<00:03:26.099> gone<00:03:26.280> all<00:03:26.519> pretty<00:03:27.269> rare<00:03:27.569> really<00:03:27.840> but

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
Logan's gone all pretty rare really but

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.379 
Logan's gone all pretty rare really but
these<00:03:28.440> sim<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.040> fragment<00:03:29.609> come<00:03:30.239> out

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
these sim and the fragment come out

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.180 
these sim and the fragment come out
pretty<00:03:30.720> common<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.739> want<00:03:31.889> one<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.069> them

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
pretty common so if you want one of them

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.580 
pretty common so if you want one of them
weapons<00:03:32.400> head<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.150> grinder<00:03:33.629> and<00:03:33.810> yeah

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
weapons head to the grinder and yeah

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.860 
weapons head to the grinder and yeah
that<00:03:34.859> was<00:03:34.980> my<00:03:35.459> own<00:03:35.609> resource<00:03:35.970> anyway<00:03:36.450> but

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
that was my own resource anyway but

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.690 
that was my own resource anyway but
that's<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.470> front<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.829> legendary<00:03:38.220> grinder
