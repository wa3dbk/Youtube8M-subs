alive<00:04:21.079> vanda<00:04:21.650> has<00:04:21.859> flash<00:04:22.190> available<00:04:22.639> and<00:04:22.729> I

alive vanda has flash available and I

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.070 
alive vanda has flash available and I
think<00:04:22.940> that's<00:04:23.120> why<00:04:23.270> he's<00:04:23.419> moving<00:04:23.720> a<00:04:23.840> little

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
think that's why he's moving a little

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.420 
think that's why he's moving a little
bit<00:04:24.199> further<00:04:24.410> board<00:04:24.770> he's<00:04:24.860> gonna<00:04:24.979> have<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.340> go

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
bit further board he's gonna have to go
