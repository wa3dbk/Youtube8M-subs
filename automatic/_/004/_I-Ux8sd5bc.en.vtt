00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.880
 we are living in a world where already 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:14.190
 this does not matter anymore orlando is 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.740
 a person that I admire so much because 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.360
 imagine the fear I was feeling 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.510
 within it 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.430
 and you can not tell anyone for me 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.070
 for me he is a hero 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.420
 He is a superhero because he is now 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.180
 opening doors is breaking down barriers 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.610
 especially our culture where 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.560
 still many people see it as what but 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.080
 what happens do not understand that enough is enough already 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.660
 orlando is a is he is a superhero les 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.510
 he is better than calling him and he is better 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.840
 that an Oscar de la hoya a better than 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:57.110
 they could be chaves the broke barriers he 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.420
 he did something that nobody in the history of 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.070
 boxing could do and have that courage is 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:09.750
 I do not know how 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.980
 that value that value that's value so 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.989
 If I had a beanie right now, I would 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.989
