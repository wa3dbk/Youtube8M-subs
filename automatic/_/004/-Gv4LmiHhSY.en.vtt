00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
 That 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.230
 who ever got into a vehicle with that nasty smell 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.480
 You know how uncomfortable it is. 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.430
 especially you need to stay a lot of time inside the car as on a trip 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.330
 longer but know that even those most careful owners 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.960
 who do everything right to keep the inside of the car also always 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.370
 shining and fragrant 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.000
 at some point they may end up becoming victims of this bad smell as 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.780
 cherry wrong 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.930
 was a series of factors among them are born in fungal colonies 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.210
 they want more anger with dry hair that gets trapped in the evaporators is 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.060
 with the passage of time they create a local monastery 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.060
 I went back to those who have respiratory problems 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.470
 this foul smell laden with funds can cause large and redactions to the extent that 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.990
 bad person 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.610
 something that is not pleasant but can easily be avoided only by knowing how 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.480
 properly use the air-conditioning system there is some 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.600
 cases that can mitigate the bad smell is marisa 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.249
 the growth of the colonies of the mello the correct use of the conditioned 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.650
 and also liked total to try to dry was prosecutor and the other is the use of 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.050
 products that make them fall cover that smell 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.170
 the little colon 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.949
 the chemical r 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.419
 the mini up the smell 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.209
 legal is also that the application of some chemicals 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.010
 can be very simple and fast since it does not require the disassembly of any item 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.169
 of the vehicle 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:24.839
 When the car is switched on, first of all the hot air must be 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.429
 minutes for the system ducts to dry thoroughly 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:32.809
 then turn on the air conditioner and start the circulation system 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.790
 Finally, it is the turn to close all the doors and windows and spray the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.769
 product throughout the car interior 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.769
 but 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:52.249
 although the use of products of this type is very easy, it is always 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.200
 recommended 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.200
 that the process be done with the follow-up of a specialist 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:01.809
 because it is the cause of the bad smell may be somewhere else or in some 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:06.849
 The situation requires a thorough sanitation of the system. 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:07.609
 daily 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.799
 your physical work is missing from the box 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.809
 clean the red line. 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.379
 now is a much longer process 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.439
 much more powerful played efficient producer by 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.789
 bactericide is sufficient 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:28.489
 and of course we can not forget what others in the cabin after all he has 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.639
 letter all external dirt 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.079
 therefore changing the filter is also important to avoid the effects 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.579
 unpleasant coast to coast
