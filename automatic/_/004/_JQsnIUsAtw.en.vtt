00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
back and cut some more holes this is

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.449 
back and cut some more holes this is
where<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.590> put<00:02:07.800> your<00:02:07.950> whole<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.119> water

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
where you put your whole for your water

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.420 
where you put your whole for your water
for<00:02:11.459> your<00:02:11.610> old<00:02:11.819> fam<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.680> way<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.920> your<00:02:14.280> old

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
for your old fam that way that your old

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.339 
for your old fam that way that your old
pan<00:02:14.730> will<00:02:14.909> come<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.239> probably<00:02:15.709> this<00:02:16.709> high<00:02:18.349> so

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
pan will come up probably this high so

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.830 
pan will come up probably this high so
if<00:02:19.409> you<00:02:19.530> drew<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.099> reel<00:02:20.340> four<00:02:20.640> holes<00:02:21.200> about

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
if you drew I just reel four holes about

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.330 
if you drew I just reel four holes about
5/16<00:02:24.840> hole<00:02:24.989> whatever<00:02:25.290> bit<00:02:25.620> ahead<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.159> tree

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
5/16 hole whatever bit ahead in a tree

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.720 
5/16 hole whatever bit ahead in a tree
but<00:02:26.550> don't<00:02:26.700> really<00:02:26.879> matter<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.220> take<00:02:29.519> me

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
but don't really matter and you take me

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.259 
but don't really matter and you take me
to<00:02:29.819> fill<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.209> bucket<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:30.659> I<00:02:32.090> think<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> feel
