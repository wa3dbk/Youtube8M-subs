00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
a 24 volts to 12 12 volt batteries now

00:00:28.250 --> 00:01:21.530 
a 24 volts to 12 12 volt batteries now
some<00:00:29.250> reason<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.789> leaking<00:00:30.090> oil

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:42.719 

that<00:01:22.540> looks<00:01:22.810> like<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:40.110> broken<00:01:41.110> hose<00:01:41.289> here<00:01:41.729> this

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
that looks like a broken hose here this

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:51.260 
that looks like a broken hose here this
is<00:01:43.979> oil<00:01:44.979> pressure<00:01:48.659> okay<00:01:49.659> so<00:01:50.050> yeah<00:01:50.110> fix<00:01:50.409> that

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
is oil pressure okay so yeah fix that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.320 
is oil pressure okay so yeah fix that
and<00:01:52.270> probably<00:01:52.720> drain<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.140> filters<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:54.330> put

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
and probably drain the filters and put

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:07.140 
and probably drain the filters and put
some<00:01:55.450> fresh<00:01:55.630> fuel<00:01:55.869> in<00:01:56.050> there<00:02:04.080> all<00:02:05.080> right
