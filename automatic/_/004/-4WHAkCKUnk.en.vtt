 having an excellent internal space is 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.610

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.410

 country behind the Celtic produced in 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.100
 gravataí 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.259
 unix is ​​a global model and by this 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.869
 incorporates the latest trends in 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.530
 world chevrolet style 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.210
 it was developed on the platform 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.659
 gsm which also gave rise to other 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.509
 models such as spin the cobalt and the 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.450
 sonic non-visual 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.700
 highlight for elongated headlamps and 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.720
 a blue detail advancing over the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.200
 side 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.170
 on this model I'm testing ltz top 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.450
 line of torches and alloy wheels 15 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.240
 inches are also standard 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.000
 the grid outlined by a chrome trim 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.200
 the global visual identity of the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.470
 general motorcycles 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.690
 Shock is the color of the body 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.900
 with a matte black detail in the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.900
 light the door handles and the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.180
 rear view mirrors are also in the color of the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.060
 vehicles in this version and 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.640
 style finish to the finish here in 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.920
 two points draw attention to the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.560
 First is an excellent internal space the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.590
 of the category has sufficient areas 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.450
 the driver moves a comfort 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.239
 as well as passengers 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.959
 the second point is the technological visual 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.269
 onyx 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.460
 this instrument panel with the 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.450
 digital speedometer and yes 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.540
 and without much pain and leave the car a 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.320
 modern technological appearance and this 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.440
 enchants 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.990
 as soon as you board the bus you are 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.020
 two meters and 52 centimeters from 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.420
 the largest of the category 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.410
 he is a burly hatch on the outside and 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.660
 spacious inside inside the trunk 280 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.690
 liters of load capacity 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.580
 the suspension is well calibrated and 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.560
 absorb without problems the 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.490
 floor irregularities 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.770
 the sound insulation also surprises 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.530
 the finishes are of good quality with 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.860
 good texture providing interior 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.900
 comfortable at the fingertips that the 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.600
 board computer access 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.490
 the driver does not have to take his hands off the 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.410
 to access the information 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:44.750
 of the odometer consumption distance in 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.320
 center console are the commands of the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.690
 air-conditioning auxiliary input and usb 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.720
 and the five- speed manual shift lever 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.490
 speeds 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.670
 but one of the great differentials of 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.370
 Onyx is the multimedia system more links 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.950
 the equipment works in a simple way 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.490
 with touch screen of 7 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.680
 and features unprecedented functions for 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.050
 a car of this category as the exhibition 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.180
 videos and photos on the monitor 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.010
 today only my third day with cheyrou 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.530
 leonice and still counting a bit of 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.620
 difficulty with touch pressure to 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.720
 access the software but I realize that 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.880
 yesterday and today it has improved and 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.350
 this adaptation tends to occur 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.110
 natural way with the passage of time 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.660
 then the driver will get used to 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.790
 the car is getting used to loose and 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.780
 this is sure to be easier 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.510
 this 1.4 engine is excellent has 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.700
 torque for the weight of the car and 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.160
 combines performance with economy 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.240
 ideal for the urban vehicle but the year 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.180
 which is not just a beautiful car 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.640
 elegant and technological and has a 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.090
 very interesting mechanic 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.150
 torque is excellent on this 1.4 engine and the 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.700
 I need a gearshift 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.680
 ideal for any application, whether for 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.680
 a trip or a day in the city 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.460
 there is still no unix version with 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.770
 automated exchange 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.040
 but the chevrolet is preparing a launch 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.740
 with this option still for 2013 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.670
 This was the unix chevrolet test drive. 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.670
 until the next
