00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 the dangers of watching television see 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.720
 television is the activity or rather the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.580
 favorite leisure inactivity 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.969
 of millions of people worldwide 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.099
 at the age of 60 the American 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.350
 will have spent 15 years of his life 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.970
 in front of the TV screen and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.730
 the figures of other countries are 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.250
 similar for many people the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.439
 television is relaxing if we observe 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.330
 Attentively we realize that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.699
 The longer we keep the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.740
 attention focused on the screen more is 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.050
 suspend the activity of thought and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.180
 more time we spend seeing only the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.950
 interview the game show the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.860
 comedy or even commercials without 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.510
 generate a single thought not only 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.550
 we completely forget our 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.100
 problems but we get rid of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.050
 ourselves transiently that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.660
 It could be more relaxing than that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.510
 then television is a means to 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.449
 creating interior space helps us to be 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.059
 present unfortunately it is not like that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.859
 although the mind suspends its activity 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.470
 for extended periods of time 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.240
 connects with the mental activity of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.280
 television show 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.200
 connects with the televised version of the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.810
 collective mind and come to think those 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.790
 thoughts the mind is inactive 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.549
 only in the sense of not generating 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.649
 your own thoughts however 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.020
 is continuously absorbing the 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.020
 thoughts and the images coming 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.429
 of television this induces a kind 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.380
 of trance status and greater 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.990
 susceptibility similar to that of 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.119
 hypnosis that's why it's ideal for 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.340
 manipulate public opinion as 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.100
 the politicians know well the groups of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.659
 interest and advertisers that's why 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.729
 they pay millions of dollars for 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.580
 surprise us unarmed in that state of 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.740
 receptivity seek to replace our 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.319
 thoughts for theirs and so 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.569
 general they achieve it this way while we see 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.310
 television the tendency is to fall by 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.950
 below the thought instead of 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.600
 rise above him in this the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.119
 television looks like alcohol and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.340
 certain drugs although it frees us 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.890
 transitorily from the yoke of the mind the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.770
 price is also high the unconsciousness 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.630
 the same as drugs television 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.970
 It has a great addictive quality 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.870
 we take control to turn off the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.030
 apparatus and in 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.340
 to do it we started to review all 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.049
 the channels half an hour or an hour 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.810
 then we are still seeing and 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.790
 going through the channels it 's as if the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.069
 off button was the only one that the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.930
 finger does not manage to press continue 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.360
 stuck to the device not because something 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.950
 interesting attracts our attention but 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.560
 precisely because there is nothing 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.870
 interesting to see once caught 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.329
 while more trivial and more nonsense 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.459
 more addictive it turns if it were 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.799
 interesting and will challenge the intellect 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.420
 would lead the mind to think again 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.459
 which would be more conscious and 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.920
 preferable to a trance induced by a 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.959
 apparatus then the images of the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.569
 screen would not keep totally 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.819
 captivates our attention if the content 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.859
 of the program is of certain quality can 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.629
 counteract to a certain point or 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.450
 even undo the numbing effect 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.010
 in the middle of the television there are some 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.560
 programs that have been very helpful 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.420
 for many people they have changed the 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.190
 life for good they have served for 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.680
 open their hearts and have helped them 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.109
 reach the state of consciousness there 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.269
 even certain comedies that although not 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.740
 they deal with no particular subject they are 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.570
 spiritual without knowing it 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.270
 because they show us a caricature of 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.550
 ego and human unreason teach us 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.830
 to not take anything too seriously to 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.960
 live life with carelessness and for 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.630
 above all they teach through the 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.240
 laugh laughter is extraordinary as 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.640
 liberating factor and also healing without 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.650
 However, in most cases, 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.110
 television continues under the control of 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.910
 people totally submitted to the ego of 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.830
 so that we continue under the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.500
 control of that second intention of 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.530
 numbing is telling us to plunge into the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.480
 unconsciousness however the middle of the 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.610
 television holds a huge potential 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.290
 still unexplored 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.210
 we must avoid programs and 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.040
 commercials that attack us with a 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.110
 accelerated sequence of images that 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.570
 they change every two or three seconds or less 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.430
 the excess of television and those 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.500
 particular programs is the cause 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.930
 to a large extent deficit disorder 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.790
 of attention a mental dysfunction that 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.489
 affects millions of children around the world 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.650
 whole those brief periods of attention 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.320
 they are translated into perceptions and relationships 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.360
 vacuous and unsatisfactory all that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.340
 let's make being in that state lacks 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.160
 quality because quality requires 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.260
 and watch television frequently and for 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.330
 long periods not only we 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.979
 plunge into a state of unconsciousness but 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.830
 that induces us to passivity and we 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.930
 it depletes energy accordingly in 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.300
 instead of seeing anything choose the 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.370
 programs that you want to see every time 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.900
 remember feel life inside your 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.060
 body while facing the 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.880
 screen be aware of your 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.620
 periodically breathing apart the 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.660
 eyes of the screen at intervals 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.580
 regular so that it does not take over 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.830
 completely from your sense of sight 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.110
 Do not turn up the volume more than necessary 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.479
 so that television does not take over 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.250
 your sense of hearing oppresses the 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.280
 button to mute the device during 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.680
 the commercials make sure you do not fall asleep 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.050
