 A total of 17 people for the draw 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.200
 Although there were several qualified 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.030
 comments on this in the other 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.799
 however, not all were video 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.689
 necessarily fulfill conditions for 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.470
 example, it often has to the subscribers 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.600
 lacking 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.189
 or just stop by the video views why 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.610
 Of course I do not attend you 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.670
 could and if you could 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.729

 admitted because the other 90 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.299
 piece did not seem to have made it 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.649
 to write a comment I think 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.829

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.990
