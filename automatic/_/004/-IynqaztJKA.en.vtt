00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:24.096
 So it is very interesting project 

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:26.056
 Basically one neighborhood lab heads 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.560
 There should be done a lot of tests with 

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:31.102
 The heat there you put the other 

00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:36.118
 You've got a pop before you open 

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:39.037
 So it also goes through the other side 

00:00:37.018 --> 00:00:40.827
 You'll see what was down there and we did not 

00:00:39.037 --> 00:00:43.039
 You have any of Stoner in the end on 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.900
 The walls after the roofing is pretty much in 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.116
 The windows of the place are in and we will talk to 

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.075
 A little more about that when we get on 

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:53.035
 There in this particular wall 

00:00:50.056 --> 00:00:55.081
 The system we came home would have been another 

00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:57.130
 Just sit at the rock table or amb 

00:00:55.081 --> 00:01:00.097
 And it's a 6-inch concrete wall that 

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:02.020
 Happened to the thickness of the wall but we have 

00:01:00.097 --> 00:01:36.143
 I got to consider it radiant from the fact we are 

00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:51.136
 Consider the monitoring mode 

00:01:37.043 --> 00:01:59.044
 Grow just about the net 

00:01:52.036 --> 00:02:00.094
 Everyone is this friend 

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:04.117
 Well we must set girl passes 

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:15.172
 And you do not lock me to make sure 

00:02:05.017 --> 00:02:41.111
 They do not lock it 

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:46.129
 Section of the wall which is 

00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:57.840
 Okay 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:03:15.040
 The brand name variety has become some island 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:21.000
 Somewhere on a pyramid for the latter part 

00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:20.010
 Of stone
