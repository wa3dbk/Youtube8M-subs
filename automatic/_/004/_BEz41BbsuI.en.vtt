00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.650
 Magno was a guy here that he left more 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.930
 He's a difficult guy to score. 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.859
 is that he has a lot of quality when he 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.380
 leave the area 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.210
 this complicates the markers that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.960
 different situation, but we win in the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.720
 1 and not in terms of air move is that 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.670
 He's more centralized there, but it's okay. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.560
 game was cool since it was cool is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.090
 It was important that we win the game. 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.070
 the sea was talking about the loss of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.779
 players the team has to learn a 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.900
 new way of playing, huh? 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.140
 It's true, but we know that when 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.610
 team can be champion of a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.200
 competition as strong as the cup 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.040
 Northeast will have player going 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 leave 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.500
 this is normal happens in every team 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.760
 winning the title but as it spoke to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.879
 People have to learn to play with this. 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.050
 We come and do what we do. 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.270
 teacher is making some changes 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.789
 and today it worked out right 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.289
 today the team played very well a 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.449
 intensity leaving their team 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.699
 play and we were worthy of the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.109
 result the cearÃ¡ came from the first 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.870
 time trying long distance kicks 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.549
 had not fit in the second half 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.750
 had a conversation with the technician to 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.700
 thing was different 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.430
 The ball started to fit the two of you. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
 to leave naturally is this orientation of the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.270
 coach and constant for you always 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.100
 beat and long distance to try 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 surprise the opposing goalkeeper 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.570
 I imagine in the test also only to make goal 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.600
 inside the area we have a player of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.090
 quality outside the area that kicks well 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.220
 We have to try training the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.250
 people do it because in the game it's not a 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.810
 Game mirror our training 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.579
 in training we have been training well 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.979
 kicking well from outside the area both I 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.110
 how much ina as Ricardinho is a guy is 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.600
 specialist in this beat there we went 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.720
 happy for work and what do we do? 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.880
 has a farm, not in the teacher's 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.229
 comes always passing the situations 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.390
 We're going to field you. 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.640
 divine promise even you promised 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.619
 range kept the debt and paid in 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.780
 second game time, right? 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.799
 It's true, I 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.570
 knew that the opportunity would appear 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.710
 the quality of our team so we 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.330
 We've been doing for Brazil. 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.459
 creating also did not have a chance with 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.899
 a complete one but I knew that in the second 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.030
 time was going to be different so I 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.970
 I spoke very loud and I said I was going 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.660
 to make the goal if I could write I left 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.370
 happy 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.950
 It's a thing now because it's in the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.940
 He wants to stay here to do television. 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.130
 the best in the field 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.160
 preached the word of the arelho marine more 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.459
 a difficult game with many opportunities 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.430
 in the first time it will almost r 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.019
 goal but the goalkeeper sometimes defended 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.239
 also anger but in the second stage the 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.190
 other will be and you promised and made goal 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.459
 how did you also notice if the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.920
 good intensity departure mainly 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.550
 in our team had an intensity 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.800
 very good, we are pressing and yes 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.050
 a lot of ball possession only in the first 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.790
 time we've finished little goal so it 's 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.800
 this lack of light was necessary to have 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.510
 tranquility ability to quit this 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.500
 strong marking for example if you were 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.360
 complaining of this I had spoken in him 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.090
 because it usually happens that the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.260
 players reveal but when they have 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.360
 quality players on the other side 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.250
 they reveal in the marking comes strong 1 to 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.950
 2 and take turns 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.320
 But we have how to get out of these 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.019
 We train people for this. 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.750
 so if we play a game 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.390
 is marking so strongly 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.549
 and we did not know how to excel 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.859
 This, then, we have to have 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.989
 that changing jobs will always be 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.060
 difficult but quality player has to 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.280
 know about it there not midweek 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.920
 now has a cup from Brazil and then also 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.870
 Are you Brazilian championship? 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.850
 how do you keep the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.519
 physical performance of the athlete in this 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.640
 marathon games 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:50.640
 It's us who came from competitions. 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.700
 both northeastern and state cup 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.829
 we had 12 days four games and 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.090
 after these games competitions to 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.069
 people did not stop 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.629
 It was a day off just after 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.569
 knew that until the premiere on Saturday today 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.299
 You had cramp at the end there, right? 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.090
 but when you're running the whole field is 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:12.810
 normal, what are you going to give it to? 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.400
 it is as player who moves from the field 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.269
 whole game all 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.470
 one hour will feel the wear but I 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.940
 I know it 's like I said I felt it 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.590
 right there at the time the 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.419
 pull had already warned teacher too 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.020
 eight minutes left 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.770
 then this situation of protecting a 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.320
 little 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.460
 2-0 score missing seven minutes 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.810
 people have enough quality player 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.669
 to enter 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.669
 This is okay, thank you.
