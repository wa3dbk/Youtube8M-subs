00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
playing a character that you really

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.150 
playing a character that you really
never<00:00:42.899> thought<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.260> before<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.739> way<00:00:43.920> may<00:00:44.129> be

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
never thought of before this way may be

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.220 
never thought of before this way may be
very<00:00:44.460> good<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.539> might<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.840> even<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.140> good

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
very good and it might not even be good

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.360 
very good and it might not even be good
but<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.500> might<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.770> really<00:00:46.980> funny<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> you

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.390 
of people - most people actually like to
pick<00:01:10.320> characters<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.860> were<00:01:10.979> similar<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
pick characters that were similar to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.280 
pick characters that were similar to
their<00:01:11.520> old<00:01:11.670> main<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> did<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> main

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
their old main so if you did have a main

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
their old main so if you did have a main
before<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> would<00:01:13.860> recommend<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.460> look<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.790> that

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
before I would recommend to look at that

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.310 
before I would recommend to look at that
previous<00:01:15.090> main<00:01:15.390> kind<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.170> they<00:01:16.259> were

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
previous main kind of see what they were

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.600 
previous main kind of see what they were
good<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:16.830> they're<00:01:16.950> good<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.189> spacing

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.710 
can win with a low tier it's definitely
a<00:03:35.319> possibility<00:03:35.739> but<00:03:36.669> if<00:03:36.909> you<00:03:37.120> do<00:03:37.299> want<00:03:37.509> to<00:03:37.569> win

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
a possibility but if you do want to win

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.719 
a possibility but if you do want to win
more<00:03:37.989> often<00:03:38.199> and<00:03:38.590> if<00:03:39.099> you<00:03:39.189> just<00:03:39.370> want<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.579> keep

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:39.729 
more often and if you just want to keep

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.009 
more often and if you just want to keep
enjoying<00:03:40.090> your<00:03:40.239> character<00:03:40.479> I'd<00:03:40.569> recommend<00:03:40.959> to

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
enjoying your character I'd recommend to

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.390 
enjoying your character I'd recommend to
pick<00:03:41.199> a<00:03:41.379> character<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.859> you<00:03:41.949> can<00:03:42.099> win<00:03:42.250> with

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
pick a character that you can win with

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.249 
pick a character that you can win with
most<00:03:42.609> often<00:03:42.819> even<00:03:43.419> if<00:03:43.509> you<00:03:43.599> always<00:03:43.930> win<00:03:44.079> with<00:03:44.169> a

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:44.259 
most often even if you always win with a

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:45.689 
most often even if you always win with a
low<00:03:44.379> two<00:03:44.439> that's<00:03:44.739> fine<00:03:44.919> just<00:03:45.159> pick<00:03:45.519> someone

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
low two that's fine just pick someone

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.099 
low two that's fine just pick someone
you<00:03:45.909> win<00:03:46.060> with<00:03:46.209> because<00:03:46.479> if<00:03:46.629> you<00:03:46.720> don't<00:03:46.900> win

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109
