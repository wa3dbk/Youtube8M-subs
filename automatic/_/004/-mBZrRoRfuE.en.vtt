little bit new and trick that we bought
out<00:00:48.620> for<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:48.980> 2012<00:00:49.850> season<00:00:50.170> start<00:00:51.170> what<00:00:51.530> do

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
out for the 2012 season start what do

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.240 
out for the 2012 season start what do
you<00:00:51.649> mean<00:00:52.300> well<00:00:53.300> cast<00:00:53.629> iron<00:00:53.899> is<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.829> standard

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
you mean well cast iron is the standard

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.220 
you mean well cast iron is the standard
material<00:00:55.699> for<00:00:55.879> all<00:00:56.059> automotive<00:00:56.269> brake<00:00:56.839> rotors

material for all automotive brake rotors

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.660 
material for all automotive brake rotors
there's<00:00:57.440> very<00:00:57.679> few<00:00:57.769> that<00:00:58.190> are<00:00:58.309> made<00:00:58.460> out<00:00:58.640> of

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
there's very few that are made out of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.270 
there's very few that are made out of
anything<00:00:59.120> but<00:00:59.390> cast<00:00:59.719> iron<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.859> difference

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
anything but cast iron the difference

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.310 
anything but cast iron the difference
with<00:01:01.460> this<00:01:01.609> one<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.030> it's<00:01:02.269> a<00:01:02.480> new<00:01:02.750> grade<00:01:03.109> of

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
with this one is it's a new grade of

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.660 
with this one is it's a new grade of
cast<00:01:03.589> iron<00:01:03.829> called<00:01:04.250> GG<00:01:04.699> 15<00:01:05.239> HC<00:01:06.020> +<00:01:06.260> HT<00:01:06.770> stands

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.600 
cast iron called GG 15 HC + HT stands
for<00:01:08.000> high<00:01:08.180> carbon<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.050> what<00:01:09.530> these<00:01:09.710> are<00:01:09.979> is<00:01:10.310> a

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
for high carbon and what these are is a

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.109 
for high carbon and what these are is a

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
standard cast iron rotor into something

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.230 
standard cast iron rotor into something
that<00:01:21.470> will<00:01:21.619> handle<00:01:21.979> heat<00:01:22.220> better<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.880> will

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
that will handle heat better it will

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.109 
that will handle heat better it will
stop<00:01:23.540> vibrations<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:24.829> runs<00:01:25.220> quieter<00:01:25.939> it

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
stop vibrations it runs quieter it

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.319 
stop vibrations it runs quieter it
actually<00:01:26.509> grips<00:01:27.020> better<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:27.619> it<00:01:27.740> is<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.890> really

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
actually grips better so it is a really

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.149 
actually grips better so it is a really
high-end<00:01:29.329> grade<00:01:29.899> of<00:01:30.079> cast<00:01:30.350> iron<00:01:30.560> only

course now i have a question about these

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.550 
course now i have a question about these
patterns<00:01:43.460> because<00:01:44.030> i<00:01:44.329> haven't<00:01:44.869> seen<00:01:45.170> any<00:01:45.350> that

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
patterns because i haven't seen any that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.840 
patterns because i haven't seen any that
do<00:01:45.799> quite<00:01:46.280> this<00:01:46.549> what<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:47.060> for<00:01:47.619> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
do quite this what is that for the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.730 
do quite this what is that for the
departments<00:01:49.850> are<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:51.020> little<00:01:51.170> bit<00:01:51.350> different

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
departments are a little bit different

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.700 
departments are a little bit different
on<00:01:51.829> this<00:01:52.070> because<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.700> heat<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:53.630> brake<00:01:53.840> pad

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
on this because the heat and a brake pad

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.950 
on this because the heat and a brake pad
is<00:01:55.310> all<00:01:55.549> around<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.939> center<00:01:56.390> of<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.630> pad<00:01:56.810> on

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
is all around the center of the pad on

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.440 
is all around the center of the pad on
the<00:01:56.990> rotor<00:01:57.289> and<00:01:57.619> getting<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.430> hot<00:01:58.789> gas<00:01:59.180> away
