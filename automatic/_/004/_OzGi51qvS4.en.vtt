really wet and sticky I felt kind of
gross<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> wish<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.640> product<00:01:42.030> would<00:01:42.150> have

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
gross so I wish this product would have

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.999 
gross so I wish this product would have
dried<00:01:42.479> faster<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.259> pretty<00:01:43.470> unhappy<00:01:43.619> with

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
dried faster I was pretty unhappy with

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.429 
dried faster I was pretty unhappy with
how<00:01:44.130> long<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.340> took<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.850> dry<00:01:45.170> plus<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.350> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
how long it took to dry plus then you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
how long it took to dry plus then you
kind<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> wait<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.430> into<00:01:47.579> bed<00:01:47.700> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
kind of have to wait to get into bed and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.109 
kind of have to wait to get into bed and
to<00:01:48.479> touch<00:01:48.659> things<00:01:49.049> while<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.500> drying<00:01:50.119> but

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
to touch things while it's drying but

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.480 
to touch things while it's drying but
the<00:01:51.240> good<00:01:51.420> thing<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.159> did

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the good thing that is that if I did

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.830 
the good thing that is that if I did
accidentally<00:01:54.090> touch<00:01:54.270> something<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.810> really

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
accidentally touch something it really

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.080 
accidentally touch something it really
wouldn't<00:01:55.500> stain<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.280> because<00:01:56.909> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
wouldn't stain it like it because it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.469 
wouldn't stain it like it because it
died<00:01:57.420> wasn't<00:01:57.899> very<00:01:58.049> dark<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.969> did<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
died wasn't very dark I did like the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
died wasn't very dark I did like the
color<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.110> produced<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.710> was<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> medium

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
color that this produced it was a medium

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.310 
color that this produced it was a medium
shade<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.060> very<00:02:03.420> natural-looking<00:02:04.020> I

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
shade and it was very natural-looking I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.139 
shade and it was very natural-looking I
was<00:02:04.439> actually<00:02:04.770> surprised<00:02:05.159> by<00:02:05.430> how<00:02:05.579> natural<00:02:06.060> it

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
was actually surprised by how natural it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.869 
was actually surprised by how natural it
looked<00:02:06.500> it's<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.680> very<00:02:07.860> smooth<00:02:08.340> natural

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
looked it's just very smooth natural

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.980 
looked it's just very smooth natural
looking<00:02:09.119> tan<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.660> would

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
looking tan I would

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.780 
looking tan I would
say<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.230> is<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> good<00:02:10.710> tan<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.160> try<00:02:11.370> during<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
say this is a good tan to try during the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.850 
say this is a good tan to try during the
winter<00:02:12.090> because<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.870> don't<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:13.200> super<00:02:13.620> dark

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
winter because you don't get super dark

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.500 
winter because you don't get super dark
but<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.130> does<00:02:14.310> give<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> some<00:02:14.880> color<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.240> it's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
but it does give you some color and it's

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.930 
but it does give you some color and it's
very<00:02:15.570> natural-looking

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
very natural-looking

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.640 
very natural-looking
so<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.060> color<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.630> was<00:02:19.050> happy<00:02:19.380> with<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
so the color I I was happy with the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.520 
so the color I I was happy with the
color<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.670> lasts<00:02:20.940> about<00:02:21.120> 3<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.660> 4<00:02:21.960> days<00:02:22.110> which

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
color it lasts about 3 to 4 days which

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.110 
color it lasts about 3 to 4 days which
is<00:02:22.680> about<00:02:22.890> average<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.610> will<00:02:23.820> have<00:02:23.970> to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120

times<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.490> week<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:28.230> that's<00:02:28.380> pretty<00:02:28.590> average

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
times a week but that's pretty average

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.870 
times a week but that's pretty average
so<00:02:30.810> overall<00:02:31.080> men<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:32.010> think<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.550> would<00:02:32.700> like

so overall men I think you would like
this<00:02:33.090> product<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.870> does<00:02:34.380> smell<00:02:34.740> manlier<00:02:35.460> it's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
this product it does smell manlier it's

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.540 
this product it does smell manlier it's
very<00:02:36.180> inexpensive<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.110> can<00:02:37.290> buy<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.220> at<00:02:38.370> some

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.210 
very inexpensive you can buy it at some
drugstores<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.150> alt<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.450> think<00:02:40.220> very

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
drugstores and alt I think very

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.970 
drugstores and alt I think very
inexpensive<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:43.020> think<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.530> smell<00:02:43.770> is

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
inexpensive and it I think the smell is

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.110 
inexpensive and it I think the smell is
geared<00:02:44.310> towards<00:02:44.640> men<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.440> after<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.830> washed<00:02:47.550> it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
geared towards men so after I washed it

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.270 
geared towards men so after I washed it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
off I could still smell the DHA a little

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.120 
off I could still smell the DHA a little
bit<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.210> men's<00:02:51.420> body<00:02:51.750> wash<00:02:52.050> was<00:02:52.500> totally

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
bit but the men's body wash was totally

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.830 
bit but the men's body wash was totally
that<00:02:53.490> smell<00:02:53.820> was<00:02:54.000> gone<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.300> next<00:02:54.480> day<00:02:54.630> but<00:02:54.750> I

that smell was gone the next day but I

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.420 
that smell was gone the next day but I
could<00:02:54.990> still<00:02:55.140> smell<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.530> DHA<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> little<00:02:56.310> bit

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
could still smell the DHA a little bit

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.470 
could still smell the DHA a little bit
