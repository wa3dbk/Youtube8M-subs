00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
you always leave with inspiration how

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.500 
you always leave with inspiration how
important<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:50.280> gear<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:51.150> gear<00:03:51.390> is

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
important is is the gear the gear is

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.050 
important is is the gear the gear is
very<00:03:51.750> important<00:03:52.410> but<00:03:52.590> what<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.310> end<00:03:53.520> goal<00:03:53.790> is

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
very important but what the end goal is

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.300 
very important but what the end goal is
for<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.480> gear<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.750> be<00:03:54.870> transparent<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.739> it

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
for the gear to be transparent and it

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.370 
for the gear to be transparent and it
just<00:03:56.550> to<00:03:56.670> kind<00:03:56.820> of<00:03:56.940> be<00:03:57.090> about<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.020> way<00:03:58.200> that

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
just to kind of be about the way that

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.290 
just to kind of be about the way that
you<00:03:58.500> deliver<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.370> music<00:03:59.820> you<00:04:00.030> know<00:04:00.120> and

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
you deliver the music you know and

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.880 
you deliver the music you know and
that's<00:04:00.390> why<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.630> think<00:04:00.780> sometimes<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.650> gear

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
that's why I think sometimes the gear

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.190 
that's why I think sometimes the gear
doesn't<00:04:02.100> get<00:04:02.459> enough<00:04:02.850> credit<00:04:02.959> because<00:04:03.959> I

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
doesn't get enough credit because I

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.250 
doesn't get enough credit because I
think<00:04:04.470> putting<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> perfect<00:04:05.820> show<00:04:06.260> really

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
think putting on the perfect show really

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.870 
think putting on the perfect show really
means<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.770> have<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.070> perfect<00:04:08.280> gear<00:04:08.670> to

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
means that you have the perfect gear to

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.910 
means that you have the perfect gear to
allow<00:04:09.180> your<00:04:09.420> talent<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.440> kind<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.739> come

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
allow your talent to kind of come

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.160 
allow your talent to kind of come
