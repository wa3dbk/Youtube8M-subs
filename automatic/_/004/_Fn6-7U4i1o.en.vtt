guessing<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.790> iOS<00:02:23.330> app<00:02:23.569> has<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.530> latest

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
guessing that the iOS app has the latest

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.589 
guessing that the iOS app has the latest
version<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.520> firmware<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.180> it

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
version of the firmware and it

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.500 
version of the firmware and it
automatically<00:02:27.530> upgrades<00:02:28.190> units<00:02:28.610> as<00:02:28.760> needed<00:02:29.300> I

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
automatically upgrades units as needed I

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.600 
automatically upgrades units as needed I
just<00:02:30.110> followed<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.530> on-screen<00:02:31.010> prompts<00:02:31.459> and

just followed the on-screen prompts and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.580 
just followed the on-screen prompts and
the<00:02:31.700> update<00:02:32.030> was<00:02:32.239> automatic<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.049> very<00:02:33.079> easy

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
the update was automatic and very easy

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.429 
the update was automatic and very easy

so the iusbportcamera - adds a little or

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.260 
so the iusbportcamera - adds a little or

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
the original camera icon and it gave me

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.850 
the original camera icon and it gave me
