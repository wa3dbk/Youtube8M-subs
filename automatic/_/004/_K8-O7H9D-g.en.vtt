00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.989
 We just received "The Witcher." 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:14.679
 The Witcher is a board game of 2 to 4 players from Fantasy Flight and in Spain publishes Edge. 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.320
 It is based on a series of Andrzej novels ... 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.419
 Sapkowski. 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.130
 They made a series of video games, now they have made a game based on the board game ... 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.630
 Well, anyway. 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.739
 We are going to open the box and we will show you the content. 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.399
 We're going to take the plastic out of the box. 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.050
 with the help of the cutter 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.440
 and trying not to burden us, that with the awkwardness that we are ... 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.050
 We already told you before. 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.080
 This out. 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.140
 Plastics outside. Cutter out. 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.100
 We are going to try to open the box. 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.900
 Clumsy as always. 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.730
 And the first thing we find is the manual 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.080
 Sorry! It's the typical Edge advertising. 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.520
 Then I see her, to the truncheon. 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.770
 And these are the manuals. 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.520
 We have the one to learn to play and the reference guide. The one to learn to play is a guide 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.160
 Very fast to start our first game. 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.560
 In the reference guide come the rest of the rules that we must learn. 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.509
 "Learning to Play" is an 8-page manual, in full color, in which it seems 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.080
 that many examples come. 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.540
 And the "Reference Guide" has 16 pages, it is 2 columns, 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.200
 comes a lot of text 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.290
 and almost at the end of the whole comes an index to find everything quickly. 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.920
 On the last page comes a quick reference with the meaning of the chips, 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.890
 of the icons, the dice ... 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.400
 We take the character tiles. 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.130
 Open the zip bag. 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.200
 if we are going to see with a little detail how they are. 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.270
 These are the character's cards. There is one for each player and they represent 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.520
 the four characters in the story. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.520
 They are made of thin cardboard and are quite beautiful. 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:20.179
 In this package come the stamped cardboard plates. Let's open it 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:25.299
 I accelerate the video a bit so I do not bore. 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.919
 We have the gold chips, 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.879
 the hero tokens 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.669
 the diploma cards, 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.459
 those of wound that are double-sided, 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.569
 the test ones, 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.959
 those of track in 3 different colors, 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.569
 combat tokens, 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.919
 of fateful destiny, 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.799
 and the common indicators. 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.279
 Then we have the 30 monster tokens that come in 3 colors 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.859
 Below this comes 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.019
 the board. 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.059
 We are going to remove the plastic quickly. 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:13.929
 It's a pretty big board with 6 wings. 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:15.899
 We see it in detail. 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.669
 It's a very large board, the size of the Arkham. 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.469
 With space to leave the letters, with all the locations where the 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.909
 history. 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.439
 We remove the board and 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.569
 and let's see what else we can find. 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.039
 You can see, the miniatures. These are the miniatures that come in a plastic 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:38.949
 pretty nice 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:44.349
 and in a lot of detail 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.009
 Let's show the cards now. 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.789
 These are the letters of investigation: those of combat, those of magic and those of diplomacy. 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.689
 In standard American size. 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.659
 This is the deck of good fortune and this is the fateful destination. 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.049
 Below we have the development letters of Yarpen, Jaskier, Geralt and Triss, and 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.769
 4 companion cards for Yarpen. All in American Mini size 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:12.769
 And in tarot size we have all these adventure cards. 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.759
 In this bag here in the manual says that 8 chips come, but in reality they come 12 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.870
 in 4 different colors. 3 for each hero. 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.590
 These are the data that are coming. There are 3 dice for Geralt, one for Triss, 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.710
 another for Yarpen, another for Jaskier and 3 common combat. 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.250
 And that all friends, only the birthplace of Fantasy Flight remains 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.439
 of cardboard, 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:42.439
 that does not have much use and below, nothing comes. 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:46.839
 Thank you very much for watching the video, give it to the Like if you liked it, share it 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:49.859
 in the networks and in the next video we are going to tell you what is "The Witcher"
