00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.580
 When you turn the ring 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.950
 Hey you came out here 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.039
 How many meters it is Bello It is now shown to everyone on the LCD screen 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.820

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:23.520
 Because it is natural with evf evf 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.179
 Is n't it good? Well , I can not say that super- resolution images can also be used Even if I use it already 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.970
 I want to use other lenses after all because it is all right 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.660
 For now 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:36.820
 Such this it is an adapter that I bought the thing 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:40.450

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.080

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:54.120
 50 mm f constant 8 that bright 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:57.620
 I there a God that lens to say that off the actual sales of 10,000 yen in this 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.620
 By this adapter 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:07.660
 Then you're not going to put it in the way 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:11.080
 Funny that there is alpha is yes This is it of the Canon of God lens 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:15.520
 I do not know at all in size as I attached 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.290
 In this adapter itself has nothing to do with that electrical setup 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.400
 Just change the mount ko 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.739
 Well, autofocus will not be possible Manual focus will only be that 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.480
 You can not use the aperture from 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:32.510
 It becomes example open aperture of person is if you're still say cormorant cat 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.579
 This is about 3000 yen Mount adapter 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.310
 If you want to use the aperture and the autofocus, there is a high-end guy of around 50,000 yen 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.420
 Oh dear 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:47.520
 If you only change a , you can go around Mount 3000 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.370
 So I used this to shoot the example, so please take a look 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.700
 Hey 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.440
 How is it? 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.530
 You can see the swaying blurs of the dots . 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:04.890
 You can enjoy this god lens 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.730
 The next lens is for next year, so it is good to pay 3 taxes of cat to enjoy until then 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.430
 Kanata 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.469
 It seems that way 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:18.500
 Well this of course as a note of when using a conversion adapter that alpha 7 r 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:20.540
 It is a full-size sensor. Full-size because it mounts here ef lens is full-size 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.930
 I have to use the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.420
 My other one got off want full size It is Kaiserslautern sigma of 150500mm 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.260
 To 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.500
 With a 2-fold of the extender 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.810
 Specialist 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.690
 A low-pass-less, which has been I photographed the moon's immersed in alpha 7 r sleep this 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.960
 In the moon 1000mm 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.790
 Now this is a photo of the moon I 've taken 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:52.409
 What do you think 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:56.040
 As I said earlier, this adapter itself has no electrical contacts 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:04:00.569
 There is no excellent camera shake correction laser 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:05.629
 Using this kind of easy to mount adapter it is today by say that I am not able to use 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.810
 I tried to attach the lens of Canon to Alpha 7 and play 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:11.860
 Next year's proper 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:16.980
 The lens was released, but there is still more than one month 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.980
 a I think such play is important 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.290
