00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
looked and the cheese just kind of

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.050 
looked and the cheese just kind of
splatted<00:01:31.319> all<00:01:31.560> around<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.940> were

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
splatted all around and you were

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.479 
splatted all around and you were
supposed<00:01:33.239> to<00:01:33.450> by<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.959> directions<00:01:34.560> folded<00:01:35.340> in

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:35.489 
supposed to by the directions folded in

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:37.100 
supposed to by the directions folded in
half<00:01:35.670> which<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.840> right

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
half which is what I got going on right

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.040 
half which is what I got going on right
now<00:01:37.459> this<00:01:38.459> doesn't<00:01:38.700> look<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
now this doesn't look like it's going to

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.410 
now this doesn't look like it's going to
be<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> very<00:01:40.739> clean<00:01:42.619> meal<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.830> eat<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.280> fact<00:01:44.940> as<00:01:45.149> I

was<00:01:45.450> folding<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.140> over<00:01:47.630> there<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:49.349> has<00:01:49.709> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
was folding this over there it has the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.449 
was folding this over there it has the
benefit<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.819> lot<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.450> filling<00:01:52.410> but<00:01:53.250> that's

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
benefit of a lot of filling but that's

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.089 
benefit of a lot of filling but that's
also<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:54.179> a<00:01:54.450> good<00:01:54.869> thing<00:01:55.080> if<00:01:55.380> you're<00:01:55.560> like
