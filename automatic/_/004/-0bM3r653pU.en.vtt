00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.110
 tutorial where I will show you a page 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.690
 to download games by torrents a 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.910
 very good page where they can 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.750
 download games in a single link to 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.539

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.610
 nintendo and other consoles apart from that 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.160
 you can also download documentaries 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.140
 movies series and so on 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.790
 well the page is called better torrent and 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.860
 as I already told you, it's to download 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.430
 games by torrent in a single link 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.470
 Well the page I leave the link in the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.620
 description of the video so that you 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.790
 visit it is a very good page has 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.070
 an infinity of games ordered by 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.210
 alphabetical order what they have to do 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.160
 It is very simple to select the game 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.080
 they want here they look for them as they already 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.390
 I said countless games 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.390
 I'm going to choose face of fighters 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.280
 and here we have the game here is the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.340
 game tab the platform obviously 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.979
 pc the size 12 gigabytes 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.430
 here is the description and here too 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.440
 there is 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.660
 some files that may be the 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.610
 cracks the translations and so on 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.380
 the games that are obviously going to 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.070
 download from another page no 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.180
 good what they have to do is give it 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.180
 here in download 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.210
 and now something very important do not give to the 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.300
 green button that says download but 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.220
 where it says click here 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.900
 there you have to give it because if you give it 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.440
 here is going to address another page and 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.180
 Well , a huge problem arises. 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.800
 what they have to do here is obviously 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.580
 give it to open computation order 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.600
 default they give you to accept 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.760
 wait and ready opens us the utorrent 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.710
 any order they have and good here 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.010
 they select all the files that are going to 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.860
 download I'm going to select them 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.890
 Internet shortcuts files 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.750
 because then you do not need them and then here 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.040
 you just hit ok and it starts 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.640
 to download as if you were 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.290
 downloading the game torrents is not almost 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.750
 same is a very good page is you 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.280

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.120
 important of this page 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.290
 is that here if you are going to find the packs 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.719
