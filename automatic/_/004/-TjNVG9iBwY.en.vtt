lot<00:03:23.980> then<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.370> believe<00:03:24.609> that<00:03:24.639> swap<00:03:25.090> is<00:03:25.209> already

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
lot then I believe that swap is already

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.629 
lot then I believe that swap is already
full<00:03:25.810> but<00:03:26.049> she's<00:03:26.230> got<00:03:26.409> a<00:03:26.620> few<00:03:26.919> more<00:03:27.099> coming<00:03:27.519> up
