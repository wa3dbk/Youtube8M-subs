you're a pot smoker in your roll joints

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.780 
you're a pot smoker in your roll joints
there<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.739> go<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:47.950> know<00:02:48.610> how<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.910> is<00:02:49.030> okay<00:02:49.959> I

there you go you know how it is okay I
don't<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:52.360> fold<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.050> middle<00:02:53.170> now<00:02:55.290> like

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
don't you fold it in the middle now like

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.900 
don't you fold it in the middle now like
so<00:02:56.670> open<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:57.940> back<00:02:58.090> up<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:59.080> make<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.520> ends

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
so open it back up and make the ends

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:09.910 
so open it back up and make the ends
meet<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.989> middle<00:03:02.260> again<00:03:04.500> like<00:03:05.500> so

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.300 

now<00:03:10.610> fold<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.569> middle<00:03:12.100> it'll<00:03:13.100> look

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
now fold it in the middle it'll look

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.020 
now fold it in the middle it'll look
like<00:03:13.490> this<00:03:15.850> basically<00:03:17.200> okay<00:03:18.760> didn't<00:03:19.760> see<00:03:19.910> the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
like this basically okay didn't see the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.210 
like this basically okay didn't see the
other<00:03:20.060> one<00:03:20.390> when<00:03:21.350> you're<00:03:21.500> just<00:03:21.709> starting<00:03:21.920> out

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
other one when you're just starting out

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.770 
other one when you're just starting out
I<00:03:24.310> want<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.760> show<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.030> what<00:03:26.330> it<00:03:26.420> will<00:03:26.540> look

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
I want to show you what it will look

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.780 
I want to show you what it will look
like<00:03:26.810> when<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:28.130> put<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.430> two<00:03:28.610> pieces

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
like when you put the two pieces

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.590 
like when you put the two pieces
together<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:31.370> would<00:03:31.490> be<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.610> lot<00:03:31.790> easier<00:03:32.090> for

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
together it would be a lot easier for

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.170 
together it would be a lot easier for
you<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.290> understand<00:03:34.010> if<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:34.370> can<00:03:34.580> at<00:03:34.700> least<00:03:34.730> make

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
you to understand if I can at least make

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.830 
you to understand if I can at least make
four<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.570> them<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.610> way<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:37.850> can<00:03:38.150> see

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
four of them so that way you can see

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.360 
four of them so that way you can see
what<00:03:39.080> it<00:03:39.230> will<00:03:39.380> end<00:03:39.560> up<00:03:39.739> looking<00:03:40.130> like<00:03:40.160> because

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
what it will end up looking like because

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.390 
what it will end up looking like because
that's<00:03:43.370> how<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:44.000> got<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.450> directions<00:03:44.750> when<00:03:45.200> I

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
that's how I got the directions when I

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.360 
that's how I got the directions when I
bought<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.640> movie<00:03:46.820> twenty-eight<00:03:47.810> days<00:03:48.340> now<00:03:49.340> I

Bullock<00:03:59.480> was<00:03:59.660> making<00:04:00.140> that<00:04:00.530> gum<00:04:00.800> wrapper

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
Bullock was making that gum wrapper

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.650 
Bullock was making that gum wrapper
chains<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.580> I<00:04:01.640> always<00:04:01.970> wanted<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.300> know<00:04:02.480> how

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
chains and I always wanted to know how

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.620 
chains and I always wanted to know how
and<00:04:02.989> you<00:04:03.110> know<00:04:03.230> what<00:04:03.940> they<00:04:04.940> have<00:04:05.120> a<00:04:05.150> special

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.560 
and you know what they have a special
feature<00:04:05.810> showing<00:04:06.590> how<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:06.950> do<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.550> and<00:04:08.420> I

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
feature showing how to do it and I

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.590 
feature showing how to do it and I
thought<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:09.610> bet<00:04:10.610> there's<00:04:10.850> gotta<00:04:11.180> be<00:04:11.300> some

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
thought I bet there's gotta be some

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.390 
thought I bet there's gotta be some
people<00:04:11.780> out<00:04:11.959> there<00:04:12.019> that<00:04:12.290> like<00:04:12.440> origami<00:04:13.040> but

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
people out there that like origami but

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.670 
people out there that like origami but
aren't<00:04:13.670> good<00:04:13.880> at<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.209> but<00:04:14.959> they<00:04:15.140> like<00:04:15.350> paper

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
aren't good at it but they like paper

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.440 
aren't good at it but they like paper
folding<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.400> it's<00:04:16.519> fun<00:04:16.820> but<00:04:17.060> they<00:04:17.180> don't<00:04:17.359> know

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
folding and it's fun but they don't know

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.240 
folding and it's fun but they don't know
anything<00:04:17.840> about<00:04:17.959> gum<00:04:18.350> wrapper<00:04:18.709> chains<00:04:18.979> so<00:04:19.220> I

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
anything about gum wrapper chains so I

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.060 
anything about gum wrapper chains so I
figured<00:04:19.729> I'd<00:04:20.329> show<00:04:20.600> you<00:04:20.630> how<00:04:20.900> okay<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:21.650> there's

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
figured I'd show you how okay so there's

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.730 
figured I'd show you how okay so there's
your<00:04:22.190> second<00:04:22.640> one<00:04:22.810> now<00:04:23.810> apparently<00:04:24.440> it's

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
your second one now apparently it's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.969 
your second one now apparently it's
easier<00:04:25.310> to<00:04:25.520> do<00:04:25.669> it<00:04:25.850> on<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.780> good<00:04:27.260> folded<00:04:27.740> side

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
easier to do it on the good folded side

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.550 
easier to do it on the good folded side
not<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:29.000> outer<00:04:29.180> folded<00:04:29.750> side<00:04:29.960> where<00:04:30.320> it's

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
not the outer folded side where it's

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.200 
not the outer folded side where it's
kind<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:30.890> hard<00:04:31.130> to<00:04:31.190> meet<00:04:31.460> that<00:04:31.669> make<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.030> to

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
kind of hard to meet that make the to

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.360 
kind of hard to meet that make the to
meet<00:04:32.590> well<00:04:34.840> you<00:04:35.840> can<00:04:35.990> kind<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.740> sort<00:04:36.979> of<00:04:37.130> see

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
meet well you can kind of sort of see

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.340 
meet well you can kind of sort of see
this<00:04:37.580> let<00:04:37.820> me<00:04:37.850> make<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.330> open<00:04:38.600> itself<00:04:38.960> up<00:04:39.140> see

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
this let me make it open itself up see

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.950 
this let me make it open itself up see
if<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.590> see<00:04:39.800> how<00:04:39.979> it<00:04:40.130> looks

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
if and see how it looks

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.530 
if and see how it looks
it'll<00:04:41.960> look<00:04:42.080> like<00:04:42.320> that<00:04:42.680> basically<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:44.450> you

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
it'll look like that basically and you

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.980 
it'll look like that basically and you
want<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.840> insert<00:04:45.260> in<00:04:45.500> both<00:04:45.740> sides<00:04:46.220> into<00:04:47.090> each

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
want to insert in both sides into each

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.210 
want to insert in both sides into each
slot<00:04:48.460> like<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.820> so<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.690> needs<00:04:52.360> like<00:04:53.360> that

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
slot like that so it needs like that

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.820 
slot like that so it needs like that
okay

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
okay

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.890 
okay
so<00:04:57.449> get<00:04:58.449> another<00:04:58.720> one<00:04:59.160> of<00:05:00.160> course<00:05:00.699> and<00:05:01.599> they're

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
so get another one of course and they're

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:25.860 
so get another one of course and they're
the<00:05:02.020> same<00:05:02.050> thing<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.590> did<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.860> this<00:05:24.659> okay<00:05:25.659> I

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
the same thing you did to this okay I

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.779 
the same thing you did to this okay I
know<00:05:26.650> it's<00:05:26.949> kind<00:05:27.159> of<00:05:27.220> tough<00:05:27.460> to<00:05:27.610> work<00:05:27.729> with

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
know it's kind of tough to work with

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.529 
know it's kind of tough to work with
because<00:05:28.030> this<00:05:28.240> foil<00:05:28.449> and<00:05:28.960> on<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:30.130> movie<00:05:30.539> extra

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
because this foil and on the movie extra

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.899 
because this foil and on the movie extra
they<00:05:31.720> did<00:05:31.990> say<00:05:32.380> not<00:05:33.009> to<00:05:33.159> use<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.430> foil<00:05:33.639> ones

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
they did say not to use the foil ones

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.339 
they did say not to use the foil ones
but<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.180> know<00:05:34.300> what<00:05:34.479> they're<00:05:34.720> longer<00:05:35.139> they're

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
but you know what they're longer they're

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:36.930 
but you know what they're longer they're
easier<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.710> work<00:05:35.830> with<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.400> actually<00:05:36.849> if

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
easier to work with and actually if

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.999 
easier to work with and actually if
they're<00:05:37.090> colorful<00:05:37.389> like<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.930> ones<00:05:38.169> of<00:05:38.800> the

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
they're colorful like the ones of the

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.490 
they're colorful like the ones of the
five<00:05:39.250> gum<00:05:39.639> they<00:05:40.240> look<00:05:40.449> a<00:05:40.539> lot<00:05:40.690> prettier<00:05:40.750> so<00:05:41.470> I

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
five gum they look a lot prettier so I

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.450 
five gum they look a lot prettier so I
don't<00:05:41.770> really<00:05:41.919> care

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
don't really care

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.629 
don't really care
okay<00:05:43.330> so<00:05:43.389> when<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:44.289> take<00:05:44.530> this<00:05:44.860> one<00:05:45.159> and<00:05:45.220> add

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
okay so when you take this one and add

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.959 
okay so when you take this one and add
it<00:05:45.669> to<00:05:45.819> this<00:05:46.120> you<00:05:47.110> want<00:05:47.349> to<00:05:47.440> go<00:05:47.620> up<00:05:47.860> with<00:05:48.250> it<00:05:48.430> so

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
it to this you want to go up with it so

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:50.730 
it to this you want to go up with it so
that<00:05:49.000> way<00:05:49.150> by<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.360> time<00:05:49.690> you're<00:05:49.840> done<00:05:49.870> it

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
that way by the time you're done it

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.370 
that way by the time you're done it
looks<00:05:51.069> like<00:05:51.370> a<00:05:51.969> halfway<00:05:52.509> completed<00:05:53.139> em

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
looks like a halfway completed em

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.850 
looks like a halfway completed em

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
because the next one will go this way it

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.629 
because the next one will go this way it
won't<00:05:56.949> look<00:05:57.099> like<00:05:57.190> a<00:05:57.280> W<00:05:57.759> or<00:05:57.969> an<00:05:58.360> M<00:05:58.539> whatever<00:05:59.639> so
