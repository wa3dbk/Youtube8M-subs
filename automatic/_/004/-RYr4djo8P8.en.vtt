00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:13.860
 the smn contreiras and I'm going to make a 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.860
 functional tapioca with sweet filling 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.230
 Now I'm going to prepare the tapioca pasta. 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.990
 and to make it functional and 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.630
 to use a spoon of coconut in chips 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.410
 increases the amount of fiber and fat 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.230
 good and two tablespoons of tapioca paste 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.409
 If you need it you can help spread it. 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.100
 with the spoon but without pressing any 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:41.739
 because otherwise it gets very dry 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.530
 now you put the fire down to put the 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.569
 stuffing I'll use banana and banana and 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.550
 I took a little in the microwave for her 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:50.440
 get softer 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.899
 if you want you can by cinnamon 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.420
 little antioxidant takes away 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.539
 to eat sweet put a little bit of 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.139
 nuts that have good fat and some splinters 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.570
 semisweet chocolate the more 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:08.649
 chocolate cocoa has more antioxidant 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.860
 it is easy to come to remove 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.829
 I'm going to make the tapioca filling with 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.469
 I also put it in the microwave for 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:21.009
 30 seconds to let the mass of the 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:24.369
 tapioca with more nutritional value and 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.740
 I'll add aquino influx a spoon 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.380
 only for two of the gum 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.920
 tapioca will now put the filling to 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.829
 apple slices heated in the microwave 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.039
 gourd and hydrated water 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.950
 stay soft and look hot 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.810
 Do you want a little honey? 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.009
 if you want you can also put a 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.009
 little bit of cake, just fold it ready 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.750
