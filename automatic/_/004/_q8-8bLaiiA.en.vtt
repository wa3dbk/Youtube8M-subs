00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:10.020 

and<00:01:58.820> there<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.060> have<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.210> folks

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.030 

you<00:02:10.450> hold<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.929> here<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.170> let<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.500> idle<00:02:11.650> for<00:02:11.980> a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
you hold it here and let it idle for a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.780 
you hold it here and let it idle for a
little<00:02:12.280> bit

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
little bit

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.360 
little bit
all<00:02:14.269> right<00:02:15.230> mind<00:02:15.470> control<00:02:15.799> for<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> little<00:02:16.220> bit

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
all right mind control for a little bit

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:25.820 
all right mind control for a little bit
so<00:02:16.519> that<00:02:16.549> it<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:17.689> just<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:18.200> run

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:45.350 

not<00:02:26.370> perfect<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.060> pretty<00:02:27.990> decent<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.560> think

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.790 

there's<00:02:45.750> dad<00:02:45.990> putting<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.410> air<00:02:46.500> cleaner

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
there's dad putting the air cleaner

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.410 
there's dad putting the air cleaner
element<00:02:47.190> back<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.820> probably<00:02:48.030> can't<00:02:48.330> see

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
element back on you probably can't see

00:02:48.420 --> 00:03:07.450 
element back on you probably can't see
it<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.940> there<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.210> go

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.290 

doesn't<00:03:08.210> smoke<00:03:08.510> or<00:03:08.750> nothing<00:03:09.790> how<00:03:10.790> about<00:03:11.000> that

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300
