powering<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.260> these<00:00:34.440> devices<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.040> require<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
powering up these devices that require a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.720 
powering up these devices that require a
normal<00:00:35.969> electricity<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:37.500> water<00:00:38.129> how<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
normal electricity with water how do you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.090 
normal electricity with water how do you
do<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.030> that's<00:00:39.570> right<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.260> generator

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
do it that's right this is a generator

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.369 
do it that's right this is a generator
that<00:00:41.340> we've<00:00:41.520> put<00:00:41.700> together<00:00:42.079> which<00:00:43.079> is

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
that we've put together which is

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.729 
that we've put together which is
basically<00:00:43.829> using<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.940> cartridge<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.930> this

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
basically using a cartridge and this

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.770 
basically using a cartridge and this
cartridge<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.489> stored<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.090> quite<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> long

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
cartridge can be stored for quite a long

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.319 
cartridge can be stored for quite a long
time<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.320> uses<00:00:49.590> water<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
time it just uses water so the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.029 
time it just uses water so the
electricity<00:00:51.870> here's<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> cartridge<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
electricity here's the cartridge in it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.830 
electricity here's the cartridge in it
and<00:00:53.219> there's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> cap<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.420> almost<00:00:54.570> looks<00:00:54.780> like

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and there's a cap it almost looks like

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
and there's a cap it almost looks like
you<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.649> gas<00:00:55.920> cap<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.489> car<00:00:56.730> yeah

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you know the gas cap on your car yeah

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.790 
you know the gas cap on your car yeah
you<00:00:57.420> fill<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.050> water<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.739> then

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you fill this up with water and then

you fill this up with water and then
what<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.910> fill<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.329> with

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
what do you do just fill this up with

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.840 
what do you do just fill this up with
water<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.590> slide<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> into<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.699> this

the charger cell phone is right this is
what's<00:03:30.320> inside<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:31.040> hydro<00:03:31.880> pack<00:03:32.090> mini<00:03:32.329> this

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
what's inside the hydro pack mini this

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.199 
what's inside the hydro pack mini this
is<00:03:33.290> actual<00:03:33.620> cartridge<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.000> fuel

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
is actual cartridge and this is the fuel

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.150 
is actual cartridge and this is the fuel
cells<00:03:35.480> that's<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.230> fuel<00:03:36.410> cell<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.799> cartridge

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
cells that's the fuel cell the cartridge

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.910 
cells that's the fuel cell the cartridge
both<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.790> them<00:03:37.880> are<00:03:38.030> kind<00:03:38.269> of<00:03:38.329> independent<00:03:38.920> so

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
both of them are kind of independent so

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.949 
both of them are kind of independent so
what<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.250> consumer<00:03:40.700> would<00:03:40.820> buy<00:03:41.000> in<00:03:41.329> retail<00:03:41.690> is

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959

what the consumer would buy in retail is
just<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.500> cartridge<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:44.120> I'm<00:03:44.209> just<00:03:44.329> going<00:03:44.480> to

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
just the cartridge so I'm just going to

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.780 
just the cartridge so I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:03:44.720> how<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.650> works<00:03:45.860> here's<00:03:46.640> the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
demonstrate how that works here's the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.570 
demonstrate how that works here's the
USB<00:03:47.239> plug

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
USB plug

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.140 
USB plug

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
about the fuel cell yeah is this a

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.380 
about the fuel cell yeah is this a
bigger<00:04:10.560> version<00:04:10.769> of<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.610> this<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.360> a

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
bigger version of that is that this is a

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.420 
bigger version of that is that this is a
larger<00:04:12.989> unit<00:04:13.290> here<00:04:13.440> yeah<00:04:13.590> that's<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.040> guts<00:04:14.250> of

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
larger unit here yeah that's the guts of

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.729 
larger unit here yeah that's the guts of
this<00:04:15.120> one<00:04:15.329> actually<00:04:15.480> it's<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.930> smaller<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.380> it's

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
this one actually it's a smaller I it's

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.129 
this one actually it's a smaller I it's
smaller<00:04:17.100> inside<00:04:17.519> because<00:04:17.940> we<00:04:18.060> use<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.239> 25<00:04:18.840> watt

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
smaller inside because we use a 25 watt

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.319 
smaller inside because we use a 25 watt
this<00:04:19.680> is<00:04:19.829> actually<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.190> 100<00:04:20.519> watt<00:04:20.639> fuel<00:04:21.090> cell

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
this is actually a 100 watt fuel cell

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.689 
this is actually a 100 watt fuel cell
okay<00:04:21.930> for<00:04:22.169> future<00:04:22.620> some<00:04:23.130> commercial
