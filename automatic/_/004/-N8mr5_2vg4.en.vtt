it's<00:02:01.940> not<00:02:02.060> going<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.360> scratch<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.840> thinnest

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
it's not going to scratch the thinnest

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.450 
it's not going to scratch the thinnest
i've<00:02:03.260> dealt<00:02:03.410> with<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.560> lot<00:02:03.650> of<00:02:03.800> cases<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.280> my

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
i've dealt with a lot of cases in my

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.160 
i've dealt with a lot of cases in my
past<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.940> has<00:02:05.210> scratched<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.810> finish

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
past that has scratched the finish

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.990 
past that has scratched the finish
because<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.040> doesn't<00:02:07.070> have<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.400> soft<00:02:07.700> lining

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
because it doesn't have a soft lining

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.490 
because it doesn't have a soft lining
like<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.599> lining<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:09.019> perfect

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
like this this lining is perfect

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.710 
like this this lining is perfect

speaking also has their air cushion
technology<00:02:12.319> basically<00:02:12.980> just<00:02:13.430> means<00:02:13.580> there's

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
technology basically just means there's

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.700 
technology basically just means there's
a<00:02:13.910> little<00:02:14.150> indent<00:02:14.629> each<00:02:14.870> corner<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.440> case

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
a little indent each corner of the case

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.900 
a little indent each corner of the case
i'm<00:02:15.920> not<00:02:16.070> sure<00:02:16.160> if<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.340> be<00:02:16.490> able<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.700> see

in the fall you know it's it's protected

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.230 
in the fall you know it's it's protected
so<00:02:23.630> far<00:02:23.930> especially<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.280> iphone<00:02:25.730> 6<00:02:26.030> case

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
so far especially in this iphone 6 case

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.280 
so far especially in this iphone 6 case
i<00:02:26.270> haven't<00:02:26.450> talked<00:02:26.660> about<00:02:26.750> yet<00:02:27.020> but<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.230> is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
i haven't talked about yet but this is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.740 
i haven't talked about yet but this is
the<00:02:27.470> spigen<00:02:27.980> tough<00:02:28.700> armor<00:02:29.210> case<00:02:29.420> for<00:02:29.660> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
the spigen tough armor case for the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.780 
the spigen tough armor case for the
iphone<00:02:30.200> 6<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.830> i<00:02:30.920> think<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.640> best

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
iphone 6 and i think this is the best

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.180 
iphone 6 and i think this is the best
case<00:02:32.090> for<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.360> iphone<00:02:32.690> 6<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.290> i'll<00:02:34.100> have

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
case for the iphone 6 and i'll have

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.580 
case for the iphone 6 and i'll have
another<00:02:34.460> video<00:02:34.730> up<00:02:35.000> on<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.660> elaborate

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
another video up on that and elaborate

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.050 
another video up on that and elaborate
on<00:02:36.680> why<00:02:36.770> i<00:02:36.800> think<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.430> best<00:02:37.580> case<00:02:38.030> for

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
on why i think this is the best case for

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.900 
on why i think this is the best case for
the<00:02:38.300> iphone<00:02:38.510> 6<00:02:38.780> but<00:02:39.560> um<00:02:39.800> anyway<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.580> point<00:02:40.730> is

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
the iphone 6 but um anyway the point is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.030 
the iphone 6 but um anyway the point is
that<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.330> case<00:02:41.660> have<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:41.990> lot<00:02:42.350> of<00:02:42.380> drops<00:02:42.800> and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
that this case have a lot of drops and

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.950 
that this case have a lot of drops and
falls<00:02:43.250> hasn't<00:02:44.150> haven't<00:02:44.390> broken<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.690> phone

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
falls hasn't haven't broken the phone

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.600 
falls hasn't haven't broken the phone

yet you know knock on wood however you
know<00:02:49.730> I'd<00:02:49.820> expect<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.240> same<00:02:50.420> performance

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
know I'd expect the same performance

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.520 
know I'd expect the same performance
from<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.260> case<00:02:51.500> right<00:02:51.830> here<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:53.720> where<00:02:54.380> can

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
you get the case how much is it costing

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.690 
you get the case how much is it costing
a<00:02:56.840> search<00:02:57.200> around<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.470> internet<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.040> best
