00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
mistake it's actually a mistake in the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.160 
mistake it's actually a mistake in the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
opening scene where where the show steps

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.640 
opening scene where where the show steps
so<00:01:07.170> first<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.740> need<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.189> go<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.409> should

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
so first you need to go get so it should

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
so first you need to go get so it should
actually<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> intro<00:01:12.060> something

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
actually like in the intro something

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.140 
actually like in the intro something
like<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> answer<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.090> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
like it's in the answer that's all I can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:33.749 
like it's in the answer that's all I can
say<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:16.350> here's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> mistake<00:01:16.890> what

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.109 

now<00:01:34.759> right<00:01:35.090> there<00:01:35.289> as<00:01:36.289> you<00:01:36.560> can<00:01:36.590> see<00:01:36.939> Mario<00:01:37.939> is

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
now right there as you can see Mario is

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.960 
now right there as you can see Mario is
behind<00:01:38.509> Luigi<00:01:39.049> when<00:01:39.530> they're<00:01:40.130> both<00:01:40.369> rolling

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
behind Luigi when they're both rolling

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.340 
behind Luigi when they're both rolling
but<00:01:41.299> in<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.569> next<00:01:41.990> clip<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:43.960> cannot<00:01:44.960> see

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
but in the next clip you cannot see

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.539 
but in the next clip you cannot see
Mario<00:01:45.850> anywhere<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.689> I<00:01:47.929> mean<00:01:48.200> anywhere<00:01:48.950> look

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
Mario anywhere and I mean anywhere look

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.429 
Mario anywhere and I mean anywhere look
he's<00:01:49.909> not<00:01:49.939> there<00:01:50.360> at<00:01:50.509> all<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:50.929> look<00:01:51.049> he's<00:01:51.229> he's

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
he's not there at all but look he's he's

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.580 
he's not there at all but look he's he's
just<00:01:51.679> there<00:01:52.149> now<00:01:53.149> it<00:01:53.299> would<00:01:53.720> make<00:01:53.960> sense<00:01:54.319> as

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
just there now it would make sense as

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.100 
just there now it would make sense as
Mario's<00:01:55.009> rolling<00:01:55.549> in<00:01:55.939> between<00:01:56.630> um<00:01:56.810> but<00:01:56.990> you

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
Mario's rolling in between um but you

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.370 
Mario's rolling in between um but you
can't<00:01:57.380> see<00:01:57.590> any<00:01:57.830> red<00:01:58.250> at<00:01:58.459> all

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
can't see any red at all

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.520 
can't see any red at all
so<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.590> she's<00:02:00.770> weird<00:02:01.099> and<00:02:01.959> then<00:02:02.959> in<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.229> next

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
so it she's weird and then in the next

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.899 
so it she's weird and then in the next
thing<00:02:03.649> when<00:02:03.830> Cooper<00:02:04.069> jumps<00:02:04.429> off<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.670> class

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
thing when Cooper jumps off the class

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.399 
thing when Cooper jumps off the class
he's<00:02:05.780> back

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
he's back

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.120 
he's back
so<00:02:07.869> where<00:02:08.869> did<00:02:09.019> Mario<00:02:09.259> come<00:02:09.619> out<00:02:09.799> of<00:02:09.950> nowhere

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
so where did Mario come out of nowhere

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.089 
so where did Mario come out of nowhere
from<00:02:10.519> he<00:02:11.330> just<00:02:11.360> disappeared<00:02:12.260> then<00:02:12.560> kid<00:02:12.860> under

from he just disappeared then kid under
nowhere<00:02:13.720> that's<00:02:15.160> yeah<00:02:16.239> so<00:02:17.239> that's<00:02:17.540> pretty

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
nowhere that's yeah so that's pretty

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.949 
nowhere that's yeah so that's pretty
much<00:02:18.019> it<00:02:18.410> for<00:02:18.920> mistake<00:02:19.849> number<00:02:20.120> two<00:02:20.480> that's

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:44.440 
the next shot you can see has less coins
then<00:02:38.870> before<00:02:39.970> grabbing<00:02:41.739> one<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:44.000> just<00:02:44.299> a
