00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
system in real time later and we can see

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.880 
system in real time later and we can see
that<00:02:24.920> clearly<00:02:25.100> here<00:02:25.930> when<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:26.959> move<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.440> object

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
that clearly here when I move the object

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.670 
that clearly here when I move the object
the<00:02:28.400> light<00:02:28.670> changes<00:02:29.329> from<00:02:29.570> left<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.989> right<00:02:30.110> and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
the light changes from left to right and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.310 
the light changes from left to right and
we<00:02:31.459> have<00:02:31.489> exactly<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.239> same<00:02:32.390> effect<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:33.200> the

we have exactly the same effect if the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.830 
we have exactly the same effect if the

we need to get our customers on board

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.990 
we need to get our customers on board
the<00:05:02.990> very<00:05:03.230> first<00:05:03.530> time<00:05:03.740> we<00:05:03.920> meet<00:05:04.070> them<00:05:04.280> explain

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
the very first time we meet them explain

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.670 
the very first time we meet them explain
to<00:05:05.030> them<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.360> degree<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:05.840> freedom<00:05:06.140> they<00:05:06.470> have

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
to them the degree of freedom they have

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.080 
to them the degree of freedom they have
when<00:05:06.890> operating<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:07.550> system<00:05:07.700> from<00:05:08.030> the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
when operating the system from the

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.840 
when operating the system from the
controller<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.840> nice<00:05:09.410> example<00:05:09.650> here<00:05:10.250> is<00:05:10.400> the

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
controller a nice example here is the

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.030 
controller a nice example here is the
direction<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.420> rotation<00:05:11.480> how<00:05:12.470> do<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:12.740> need<00:05:13.010> to

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
direction of rotation how do I need to

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.040 
direction of rotation how do I need to
rotate<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.760> controller<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.420> move<00:05:14.630> down<00:05:14.870> the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
rotate the controller to move down the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.230 
rotate the controller to move down the
list<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.890> connection<00:05:16.340> between<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.760> cursor

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
list the connection between the cursor

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.270 
list the connection between the cursor
and<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.420> controller<00:05:17.840> shows<00:05:18.290> that<00:05:18.770> this<00:05:19.010> works

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
and the controller shows that this works

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.330 
and the controller shows that this works
only<00:05:19.669> by<00:05:19.820> rotating<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.660> right<00:05:21.190> what<00:05:22.190> we

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
only by rotating to the right what we

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.600 
only by rotating to the right what we
also<00:05:22.550> need<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:22.970> system

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
also need the system

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.149 
also need the system
is<00:05:23.909> a<00:05:23.969> menu<00:05:24.449> interaction<00:05:25.080> over<00:05:25.349> various<00:05:25.770> menu

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
is a menu interaction over various menu

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.640 
is a menu interaction over various menu
levels<00:05:26.580> we<00:05:27.210> can<00:05:27.360> show<00:05:27.569> that<00:05:27.599> clearly<00:05:28.110> here<00:05:28.500> I

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
levels we can show that clearly here I

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.439 
levels we can show that clearly here I
come<00:05:29.039> from<00:05:29.189> the<00:05:29.340> left<00:05:29.520> side<00:05:29.759> I'm<00:05:30.180> in<00:05:30.330> the

come from the left side I'm in the
telephone<00:05:30.719> directory<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:31.469> can<00:05:31.889> now<00:05:32.039> move<00:05:32.280> by

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
telephone directory and can now move by

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.279 
telephone directory and can now move by

tilting the controller at the very

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.709 
tilting the controller at the very
moment<00:05:34.560> I<00:05:34.830> actuated<00:05:35.490> this<00:05:36.090> list<00:05:36.419> moves

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
moment I actuated this list moves

another<00:05:42.750> very<00:05:43.050> important<00:05:43.560> aspect<00:05:43.740> for<00:05:44.189> us<00:05:44.400> is

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
another very important aspect for us is

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.790 
another very important aspect for us is
scrolling<00:05:44.909> the<00:05:45.210> driver<00:05:45.810> needs<00:05:46.139> to<00:05:46.379> be<00:05:46.500> able<00:05:46.590> to

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
scrolling the driver needs to be able to

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.589 
scrolling the driver needs to be able to
select<00:05:47.009> entries<00:05:47.699> while<00:05:47.939> driving<00:05:48.449> without

distraction<00:05:49.349> here<00:05:49.919> we<00:05:50.039> have<00:05:50.219> varying<00:05:50.699> degrees

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
distraction here we have varying degrees

of speed so when I interact slowly I see

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.909 
of speed so when I interact slowly I see
slow<00:05:54.360> scrolling<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.080> when<00:05:55.469> I<00:05:55.500> interact
