mob the dead and this spot is actually
on<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.240> bridge<00:00:22.480> now<00:00:22.929> the<00:00:22.990> reason<00:00:23.259> this<00:00:23.349> is

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
on the bridge now the reason this is

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.779 
on the bridge now the reason this is
number<00:00:23.619> five<00:00:23.890> and<00:00:24.189> it's<00:00:24.279> not<00:00:24.369> higher<00:00:24.580> on<00:00:24.609> the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
number five and it's not higher on the

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.429 
number five and it's not higher on the
list<00:00:25.029> is<00:00:25.179> because<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.570> to<00:00:25.720> downsize<00:00:26.199> that

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
list is because the to downsize that

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.620 
list is because the to downsize that
actually<00:00:26.800> has<00:00:26.980> one<00:00:27.339> of<00:00:27.369> them<00:00:27.550> is<00:00:27.699> Brutus<00:00:28.150> now

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
every now and then probably have to a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.380 
every now and then probably have to a
couple<00:01:12.340> rounds<00:01:12.460> I'll<00:01:12.729> actually<00:01:12.880> teleport

back<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.750> prison<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.200> then<00:01:14.320> come<00:01:14.470> right

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
back to the prison and then come right

back to the prison and then come right
back<00:01:14.799> to<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.070> bridge<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.490> we<00:01:15.610> can<00:01:15.759> sort<00:01:16.000> of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
back to the bridge that we can sort of

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.249 
back to the bridge that we can sort of
reset<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.479> Brutus<00:01:16.780> counts<00:01:17.080> you're<00:01:17.170> not

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
open area a zombie spawn in fairly quick

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.730 
open area a zombie spawn in fairly quick
and<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.810> can<00:02:19.930> really<00:02:20.050> sort<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.350> horde<00:02:20.560> them<00:02:20.680> up

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
and you can really sort of horde them up

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.080 
and you can really sort of horde them up
any<00:02:20.890> way<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.070> want<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.550> there's<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.760> really

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
any way you want and there's a really

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.610 
any way you want and there's a really
low<00:02:22.420> risk<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.810> actually<00:02:23.080> getting<00:02:23.170> trapped<00:02:23.500> in

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
low risk of actually getting trapped in

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.810 
low risk of actually getting trapped in
a<00:02:23.680> corner<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:23.980> because<00:02:24.370> there's<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:24.580> many

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
a corner just because there's so many

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.490 
a corner just because there's so many
ways<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.210> get<00:02:25.330> out<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.410> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
ways to get out of it so this is a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.570 
ways to get out of it so this is a
really<00:02:26.740> nice<00:02:26.830> area<00:02:27.010> there's<00:02:27.280> multiple

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
really nice area there's multiple

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.160 
really nice area there's multiple
different<00:02:27.610> strategies<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.210> can<00:02:28.330> do<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.960> you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
different strategies you can do or you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.420 
different strategies you can do or you
just<00:02:29.320> really<00:02:29.680> run<00:02:29.860> around<00:02:29.980> whichever

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
just really run around whichever

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.620 
just really run around whichever
direction<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:30.880> want<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.210> run<00:02:31.330> because

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
direction you want to run because

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.550 
direction you want to run because
there's<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.900> multiple<00:02:32.260> different<00:02:32.410> options

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
there's this multiple different options

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.170 
there's this multiple different options
you<00:02:32.830> can<00:02:32.950> take<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:33.700> going<00:02:33.850> at<00:02:34.030> number

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
you can take so it's going at number

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.610 
you can take so it's going at number
three<00:02:34.390> all<00:02:34.960> right<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.260> coming<00:02:35.500> at<00:02:35.560> number

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
helps with the spawn and flow of the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.950 
helps with the spawn and flow of the
zombies<00:02:58.090> if<00:02:58.210> you<00:02:58.270> keep<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.600> door<00:02:58.750> closed

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
zombies if you keep that door closed

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960 
zombies if you keep that door closed
never<00:02:59.380> open<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.710> door<00:02:59.830> now<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.640> only<00:03:00.820> real

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
never open that door now the only real

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.700 
never open that door now the only real
downside<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.720> George<00:03:02.200> he's<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.500> real

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
downside of this is George he's a real

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.240 
downside of this is George he's a real
pain<00:03:02.890> in<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.040> ass

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
pain in the ass

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.490 
pain in the ass
and<00:03:03.550> if<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.270> have<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.480> V<00:03:04.600> R<00:03:04.720> 11<00:03:05.080> it's<00:03:05.230> kind<00:03:05.440> of

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
and if you have the V R 11 it's kind of

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.080 
and if you have the V R 11 it's kind of
hard<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.830> get<00:03:05.980> him<00:03:06.160> in<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.430> water<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.060> I

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
hard to get him in the water and so I

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.400 
hard to get him in the water and so I
get<00:03:07.300> away<00:03:07.390> from<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.690> zombies<00:03:08.050> at<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.230> same

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
get away from the zombies at the same

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.990 
get away from the zombies at the same
time<00:03:08.680> because<00:03:09.070> this<00:03:09.250> little<00:03:09.400> water<00:03:09.640> area<00:03:09.940> at

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
time because this little water area at

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.160 
time because this little water area at
the<00:03:10.060> bottom<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.390> lighthouse<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.810> kind<00:03:11.110> of

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
the bottom of the lighthouse is kind of

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.780 
the bottom of the lighthouse is kind of
small<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.980> might<00:03:12.160> get<00:03:12.310> trapped<00:03:12.490> in<00:03:12.670> here

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
small and you might get trapped in here

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.830 
small and you might get trapped in here
very<00:03:12.970> easily<00:03:13.150> if<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.390> try<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.600> get<00:03:13.690> rid<00:03:13.810> of

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
very easily if you try to get rid of

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.300 
very easily if you try to get rid of
George<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.560> would<00:03:14.680> recommend<00:03:14.800> doing<00:03:15.100> if

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
George so I would recommend doing if

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.350 
George so I would recommend doing if
it's<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> new<00:03:15.550> round<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:15.970> have<00:03:16.090> George

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
it's a new round and you have George

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.120 
it's a new round and you have George
starting<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:16.990> spawn<00:03:17.230> get<00:03:17.710> rid<00:03:17.860> of<00:03:17.920> George

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
starting that spawn get rid of George

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.440 
starting that spawn get rid of George
with<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.310> V<00:03:18.400> R<00:03:18.520> 11<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:18.940> then<00:03:19.030> make<00:03:19.180> your<00:03:19.300> way

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
with the V R 11 and then make your way

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.340 
with the V R 11 and then make your way
over<00:03:19.480> here<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.990> bottom<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.260> the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
over here to the bottom of the

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.660 
over here to the bottom of the
lighthouse<00:03:20.530> once<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.220> do<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.610> a

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
lighthouse once you do that this is a

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.890 
lighthouse once you do that this is a
very<00:03:21.850> easy<00:03:22.000> place<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.240> train<00:03:22.570> if<00:03:22.690> you're<00:03:22.810> on

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
very easy place to train if you're on

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.720 
very easy place to train if you're on
low<00:03:23.080> ground<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.440> believe<00:03:23.650> below<00:03:23.890> 36<00:03:24.490> I<00:03:24.580> think

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
low ground I believe below 36 I think

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.040 
low ground I believe below 36 I think
that's<00:03:24.850> when<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.060> scavenger<00:03:25.450> stops<00:03:25.690> working

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
that's when the scavenger stops working

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.540 
that's when the scavenger stops working
with<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.200> one-hit<00:03:26.530> kill<00:03:26.740> just<00:03:27.310> shoot<00:03:27.460> the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
with a one-hit kill just shoot the

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.740 
with a one-hit kill just shoot the
scavenger<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.120> scavenger<00:03:28.510> can<00:03:28.630> almost

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
scavenger and the scavenger can almost

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.750 
scavenger and the scavenger can almost
reach<00:03:29.050> this<00:03:29.170> entire<00:03:29.590> area<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:30.220> really<00:03:30.610> the

reach this entire area and really the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
only place that I can see you getting

from<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:39.820> you'll<00:03:40.000> be<00:03:40.060> fine<00:03:40.330> so<00:03:40.720> it's

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
from you and you'll be fine so it's

near<00:03:44.800> PhD<00:03:45.400> flopper<00:03:45.580> now<00:03:46.360> this<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.540> definitely

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
near PhD flopper now this is definitely

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.030 
near PhD flopper now this is definitely
one<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:46.960> the<00:03:47.050> easiest<00:03:47.260> pots<00:03:47.500> in<00:03:47.680> zombies<00:03:47.950> to

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
one of the easiest pots in zombies to

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.190 
one of the easiest pots in zombies to
actually<00:03:48.310> train<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:49.060> zombie<00:03:49.360> spawning<00:03:49.630> kind

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
actually train the zombie spawning kind

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.300 
actually train the zombie spawning kind
of<00:03:50.350> quick<00:03:50.530> it's<00:03:50.680> not<00:03:50.770> the<00:03:50.860> quickest<00:03:51.130> spawn

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
of quick it's not the quickest spawn

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.380 
of quick it's not the quickest spawn
ascension<00:03:51.700> but<00:03:51.790> they<00:03:51.910> do<00:03:52.060> spawn<00:03:52.270> in

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
ascension but they do spawn in

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.270 
ascension but they do spawn in
relatively<00:03:52.750> quick<00:03:53.020> and<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.680> spot<00:03:53.890> just<00:03:53.920> so

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
relatively quick and the spot just so

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.770 
relatively quick and the spot just so
easy<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:54.700> do<00:03:54.820> all<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.120> really<00:03:55.270> to<00:03:55.450> do<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.660> just

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
easy to do all you really to do is just

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.720 
easy to do all you really to do is just
keep<00:03:55.960> running<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.290> circle<00:03:56.680> or<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.370> reason

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
keep running a circle or you the reason

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.070 
keep running a circle or you the reason
you<00:03:57.820> want<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.030> run<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.420> is<00:03:58.570> if<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.780> zombies

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
you want to run you is if the zombies

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.300 
you want to run you is if the zombies
you<00:03:59.110> coming<00:03:59.350> up<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.440> stairs<00:03:59.740> just<00:03:59.950> one<00:04:00.160> too

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
you coming up the stairs just one too

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.650 
you coming up the stairs just one too
many<00:04:00.520> and<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.760> really<00:04:01.000> can't<00:04:01.180> get<00:04:01.240> by<00:04:01.420> them

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
many and you really can't get by them

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.820 
many and you really can't get by them
you<00:04:01.720> don't<00:04:01.780> want<00:04:01.990> to<00:04:02.050> slip<00:04:02.260> by<00:04:02.440> them<00:04:02.470> and

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
you don't want to slip by them and

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.320 
you don't want to slip by them and
accidentally<00:04:03.250> down<00:04:03.400> yourself<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:04.150> can't

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
accidentally down yourself you can't

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.430 
accidentally down yourself you can't
just<00:04:04.450> want<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.630> double<00:04:04.840> back<00:04:04.990> and<00:04:05.020> make<00:04:05.410> a

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
just want to double back and make a

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.590 
just want to double back and make a
u-shaped<00:04:06.100> instead<00:04:06.370> of<00:04:06.460> an<00:04:06.550> O<00:04:06.670> shape<00:04:06.700> but<00:04:07.420> now

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
u-shaped instead of an O shape but now

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.730 
u-shaped instead of an O shape but now
this<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.930> probably<00:04:08.140> easy<00:04:08.320> spot<00:04:08.620> of

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
this is the probably easy spot of

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.780 
this is the probably easy spot of
terrain<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:08.980> ascension<00:04:09.460> there's<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.640> couple

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
terrain and ascension there's a couple

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.190 
terrain and ascension there's a couple
other<00:04:09.970> spots<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:10.270> can<00:04:10.330> do<00:04:10.510> but<00:04:10.720> my<00:04:10.870> opinion

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
other spots you can do but my opinion

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.960 
other spots you can do but my opinion
this<00:04:11.260> is<00:04:11.320> probably<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.770> easiest<00:04:11.920> yeah<00:04:12.640> floppy

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
this is probably the easiest yeah floppy

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.160 
this is probably the easiest yeah floppy
right<00:04:13.210> there<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:13.480> if<00:04:13.570> you're<00:04:13.690> on<00:04:13.780> early<00:04:14.020> runs

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
right there so if you're on early runs

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.480 
right there so if you're on early runs
you<00:04:14.260> can<00:04:14.350> just<00:04:14.500> keep<00:04:14.650> flopping<00:04:15.070> off<00:04:15.190> there's

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
you can just keep flopping off there's

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.740 
you can just keep flopping off there's
always<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:15.790> drop-off<00:04:16.120> up<00:04:16.359> there<00:04:16.540> near<00:04:16.720> that

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
always that drop-off up there near that

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.240 
always that drop-off up there near that
window<00:04:16.960> that<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:17.560> can<00:04:17.680> always<00:04:17.770> drop<00:04:17.950> off<00:04:18.130> if

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
window that you can always drop off if

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.470 
window that you can always drop off if
you're<00:04:18.370> about<00:04:18.460> to<00:04:18.580> get<00:04:18.670> cornered<00:04:19.060> if<00:04:19.210> you're

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
you're about to get cornered if you're

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.729 
you're about to get cornered if you're
really<00:04:19.570> not<00:04:19.720> good<00:04:19.870> at<00:04:19.900> training<00:04:20.170> zombies<00:04:20.620> this

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
really not good at training zombies this

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:21.660 
really not good at training zombies this
probably<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.100> spots<00:04:21.430> that<00:04:21.520> I<00:04:21.580> would

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
probably the spots that I would

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.070 
probably the spots that I would
recommend<00:04:21.910> you<00:04:22.090> go<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.270> just<00:04:22.630> sort<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.870> learn

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
recommend you go to just sort of learn

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.660 
recommend you go to just sort of learn
how<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:23.560> sort<00:04:23.950> of<00:04:23.980> get<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.130> good<00:04:24.250> feeling<00:04:24.580> for

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
how and sort of get a good feeling for

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.280 
how and sort of get a good feeling for
how<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.820> round<00:04:25.030> up<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.240> zombies<00:04:25.570> that's<00:04:25.960> going

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
how to round up the zombies that's going

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.540 
how to round up the zombies that's going
at<00:04:26.380> number<00:04:26.560> one<00:04:26.710> alright<00:04:27.160> coming<00:04:27.370> in<00:04:27.490> number

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
at number one alright coming in number

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.159 
at number one alright coming in number
one<00:04:27.790> is<00:04:27.940> going<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.150> be<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.360> moon's<00:04:28.600> bio<00:04:28.930> dome

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
one is going to be the moon's bio dome

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:29.719 
one is going to be the moon's bio dome
now

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
now

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:30.829 
now
is<00:04:29.849> definitely<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> easiest<00:04:30.270> spot<00:04:30.719> in

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:30.839 
is definitely the easiest spot in

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:32.749 
is definitely the easiest spot in
zombies<00:04:31.169> to<00:04:31.259> actually<00:04:31.529> do<00:04:31.680> anything<00:04:32.039> the<00:04:32.610> only

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
zombies to actually do anything the only

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.029 
zombies to actually do anything the only
one<00:04:33.150> downside<00:04:33.659> to<00:04:33.719> this<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.259> takes<00:04:34.499> a<00:04:34.650> while

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
one downside to this is it takes a while

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.320 
one downside to this is it takes a while
for<00:04:35.309> the<00:04:35.400> zombies<00:04:35.669> to<00:04:35.729> spawn<00:04:35.969> and<00:04:36.180> so<00:04:36.240> if

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
for the zombies to spawn and so if

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.670 
for the zombies to spawn and so if
you're<00:04:36.419> trying<00:04:36.449> to<00:04:36.629> go<00:04:36.689> for<00:04:36.839> far<00:04:37.020> around<00:04:37.110> this

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
you're trying to go for far around this

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.839 
you're trying to go for far around this
is<00:04:37.830> definitely<00:04:38.189> a<00:04:38.219> strategy<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.669> I<00:04:38.729> would

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
is definitely a strategy that I would

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.279 
is definitely a strategy that I would
not<00:04:38.999> recommend<00:04:39.180> just<00:04:39.539> takes<00:04:39.719> the<00:04:39.839> zombies<00:04:40.139> too

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
not recommend just takes the zombies too

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.929 
not recommend just takes the zombies too
long<00:04:40.469> to<00:04:40.589> spawn<00:04:40.800> in<00:04:40.949> because<00:04:41.460> this<00:04:41.550> is<00:04:41.610> just

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:41.939 
long to spawn in because this is just

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.149 
long to spawn in because this is just
such<00:04:42.089> a<00:04:42.120> big<00:04:42.509> open<00:04:42.990> area<00:04:43.110> but<00:04:43.710> in<00:04:43.800> terms<00:04:43.979> of

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
such a big open area but in terms of

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.709 
such a big open area but in terms of
easiness<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.789> is<00:04:44.939> probably<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.270> easiest<00:04:45.419> in

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
easiness this is probably the easiest in

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:47.119 
easiness this is probably the easiest in
my<00:04:45.809> opinion<00:04:46.139> you<00:04:46.229> can<00:04:46.379> do<00:04:46.499> whatever<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.889> want

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
my opinion you can do whatever you want

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.429 
my opinion you can do whatever you want
there's<00:04:47.339> really<00:04:47.550> no<00:04:47.789> set<00:04:48.120> strategy<00:04:48.449> to<00:04:49.139> run<00:04:49.349> in

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
there's really no set strategy to run in

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:50.839 
there's really no set strategy to run in
here<00:04:49.589> because<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.039> zombies<00:04:50.189> just<00:04:50.430> spawn<00:04:50.669> in

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
here because the zombies just spawn in

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.850 
here because the zombies just spawn in
in<00:04:50.999> the<00:04:51.089> entire<00:04:51.389> area<00:04:51.719> you<00:04:52.349> could<00:04:52.499> literally

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
in the entire area you could literally

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.290 
in the entire area you could literally
run<00:04:53.099> from<00:04:53.249> one<00:04:53.430> end<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:53.729> other<00:04:53.819> and<00:04:54.180> maybe

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
run from one end to the other and maybe

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.119 
run from one end to the other and maybe
not<00:04:54.569> even<00:04:54.629> get<00:04:54.839> hit<00:04:54.960> by<00:04:55.080> a<00:04:55.110> zombie<00:04:55.349> it's<00:04:55.949> just

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
not even get hit by a zombie it's just

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.619 
not even get hit by a zombie it's just
such<00:04:56.249> a<00:04:56.339> big<00:04:56.490> open<00:04:56.789> area<00:04:56.909> you<00:04:57.180> can<00:04:57.300> really<00:04:57.509> do

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629 
such a big open area you can really do

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:58.670 
such a big open area you can really do
whatever<00:04:57.749> you<00:04:57.990> want<00:04:58.199> you<00:04:58.289> can<00:04:58.379> go<00:04:58.439> whichever

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
whatever you want you can go whichever

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.679 
whatever you want you can go whichever
way<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:58.949> want<00:04:59.219> the<00:04:59.909> only<00:05:00.029> downside<00:05:00.449> like<00:05:00.599> I

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689 
way you want the only downside like I

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.119 
way you want the only downside like I
said<00:05:00.839> before<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.229> it<00:05:01.349> takes<00:05:01.499> forever<00:05:01.680> to<00:05:01.889> spawn

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
said before is it takes forever to spawn

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.499 
said before is it takes forever to spawn
in<00:05:02.249> the<00:05:02.309> zombies<00:05:02.639> and<00:05:02.819> the<00:05:02.939> astronaut<00:05:03.300> really

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
in the zombies and the astronaut really

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:04.730 
in the zombies and the astronaut really
I<00:05:03.539> won't<00:05:03.689> even<00:05:03.749> say<00:05:03.899> as<00:05:03.990> a<00:05:04.050> downside<00:05:04.469> because<00:05:04.710> I

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
I won't even say as a downside because I

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.019 
I won't even say as a downside because I
mean<00:05:04.860> as<00:05:04.919> long<00:05:04.979> as<00:05:05.039> you<00:05:05.189> pay<00:05:05.550> attention<00:05:05.879> to<00:05:05.939> the

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.029 
mean as long as you pay attention to the

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.670 
mean as long as you pay attention to the
relative<00:05:06.360> area<00:05:06.809> he's<00:05:06.990> in<00:05:07.169> not<00:05:07.349> the<00:05:07.439> exact

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
relative area he's in not the exact

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.379 
relative area he's in not the exact
location<00:05:08.129> but<00:05:08.249> just<00:05:08.399> the<00:05:08.490> area<00:05:08.789> you'll<00:05:09.149> never

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
location but just the area you'll never

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.329 
location but just the area you'll never
run<00:05:09.569> into<00:05:09.719> man's<00:05:10.080> very<00:05:10.379> easy<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.770> kill<00:05:10.949> him<00:05:11.129> all

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:11.339 
run into man's very easy to kill him all

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:12.529 
run into man's very easy to kill him all
I<00:05:11.399> really<00:05:11.639> need<00:05:11.849> is<00:05:11.879> like<00:05:12.029> a<00:05:12.059> ray<00:05:12.270> gun<00:05:12.300> or

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
I really need is like a ray gun or

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:13.549 
I really need is like a ray gun or
something<00:05:12.779> like<00:05:12.839> that<00:05:13.050> or<00:05:13.319> you<00:05:13.409> could<00:05:13.499> just

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:13.559 
something like that or you could just

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.139 
something like that or you could just
completely<00:05:13.830> ignore<00:05:14.279> him<00:05:14.550> initially<00:05:14.789> all<00:05:14.909> to

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:15.149 
completely ignore him initially all to

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.920 
completely ignore him initially all to
you<00:05:15.270> if<00:05:15.389> you<00:05:15.449> want<00:05:15.599> to<00:05:15.659> make<00:05:15.749> sure<00:05:15.779> the

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
personally like having my gravity on but

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:22.879 
personally like having my gravity on but
