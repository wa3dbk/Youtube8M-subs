characteristic<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:35.970> why<00:02:36.209> yours<00:02:36.630> while<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
characteristic this is why yours while I

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.160 
characteristic this is why yours while I
think<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.470> possibly<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.580> yeah<00:02:39.330> 2005

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
think this is possibly to that yeah 2005

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.960 
think this is possibly to that yeah 2005
so<00:02:40.440> but<00:02:40.769> already<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.280> getting<00:02:41.610> like<00:02:41.730> that

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
so but already it's getting like that

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.920 
so but already it's getting like that
kind<00:02:42.269> of<00:02:42.390> yeah<00:02:44.000> bit<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.060> spice<00:02:45.299> not<00:02:45.660> me<00:02:45.810> from

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
kind of yeah bit of spice not me from

kind of yeah bit of spice not me from
that<00:02:46.080> oak<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.900> would<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.140> actually

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
