those<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.729> multi<00:01:57.060> window<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.390> let's<00:01:57.540> I'll<00:01:57.719> show

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
those as multi window so let's I'll show

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260 
those as multi window so let's I'll show
you<00:01:57.930> an<00:01:58.020> example<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.409> camera<00:01:58.950> I'll<00:01:59.520> use<00:01:59.790> camera

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you an example so camera I'll use camera

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.889 
you an example so camera I'll use camera
and<00:02:00.479> calculator<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> same<00:02:01.649> time<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.689> let

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
and calculator at the same time so let

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.089 
and calculator at the same time so let
me<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.259> tap<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.530> camera<00:02:04.979> oh<00:02:06.770> let's<00:02:07.770> tap

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
me go and tap on camera oh let's tap

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.050 
me go and tap on camera oh let's tap
done<00:02:08.420> now<00:02:09.420> let's<00:02:09.599> step<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.110> camera<00:02:10.849> all<00:02:11.849> right

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
done now let's step on camera all right

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.699 
done now let's step on camera all right
cameras<00:02:12.450> working<00:02:12.629> now

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
cameras working now

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.539 
cameras working now
let<00:02:14.010> me<00:02:14.099> go<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.340> select<00:02:14.549> multi-window<00:02:15.060> Oh

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
let me go and select multi-window Oh

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.770 
let me go and select multi-window Oh
actually<00:02:17.549> um<00:02:17.849> let<00:02:18.030> me<00:02:18.090> try<00:02:18.299> it<00:02:18.359> let<00:02:18.599> me<00:02:18.629> do

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
actually um let me try it let me do

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.390 
actually um let me try it let me do
calculator<00:02:19.200> first<00:02:19.439> and<00:02:19.709> then<00:02:19.829> camera

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
calculator first and then camera

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.059 
calculator first and then camera
so<00:02:20.909> we'll<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.180> calculator<00:02:21.629> first<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.200> then

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
so we'll do calculator first and then

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.839 
so we'll do calculator first and then
we'll<00:02:23.219> do<00:02:23.340> camera

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
we'll do camera

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.610 
we'll do camera
so<00:02:24.510> works<00:02:24.689> at<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.870> same<00:02:24.989> time<00:02:25.200> there<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:25.500> go

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
so works at the same time there you go

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.020 
so works at the same time there you go
so<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:25.829> have<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> do<00:02:26.099> that<00:02:26.219> first<00:02:26.430> or<00:02:26.730> camera

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
so you have to do that first or camera

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.789 
so you have to do that first or camera
it<00:02:27.150> goes<00:02:27.329> away<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.569> camera<00:02:27.930> multi<00:02:28.469> window<00:02:28.590> so

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
it goes away in camera multi window so

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.050 
it goes away in camera multi window so
you<00:02:28.859> can<00:02:29.010> see<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.189> can<00:02:29.310> do<00:02:29.400> both<00:02:29.549> at<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.849> same

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
you can see you can do both at the same

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.879 
you can see you can do both at the same
time<00:02:30.090> go<00:02:30.719> into<00:02:30.840> your<00:02:30.959> calculations<00:02:31.349> take<00:02:31.859> a

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
time go into your calculations take a

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.800 
time go into your calculations take a
couple<00:02:32.069> pictures<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.519> have<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.359> little<00:02:33.540> bit<00:02:33.689> of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
couple pictures I have a little bit of

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.220 
couple pictures I have a little bit of
fun<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.319> doing<00:02:34.950> making<00:02:35.430> your<00:02:35.730> head<00:02:36.090> burn<00:02:36.359> burn

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
fun and doing making your head burn burn

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
or whatever run at the same time so it's

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:40.940 
or whatever run at the same time so it's
pretty<00:02:39.900> cool<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.349> like<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.650> modification

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
pretty cool and like that modification

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.649 
pretty cool and like that modification

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
very useful if you have lot of

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.420 
very useful if you have lot of
applications<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.709> you're<00:02:43.799> not<00:02:43.920> able<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.189> use

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
applications that you're not able to use

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.740 
applications that you're not able to use
um<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.150> actually<00:02:45.239> use<00:02:45.450> them

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.920 
this I've noticed it's optimized to be
much<00:04:52.530> more<00:04:52.740> snappier<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.310> smoother<00:04:54.060> he<00:04:54.780> did

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
much lag as I usually do with stack

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.100 
much lag as I usually do with stack
TouchWiz<00:04:59.190> so<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.210> don't<00:05:00.510> see<00:05:00.780> any<00:05:00.930> lag

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
TouchWiz so I don't see any lag

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.780 
TouchWiz so I don't see any lag
especially<00:05:01.650> tight<00:05:01.950> not<00:05:02.160> typing<00:05:02.670> with<00:05:02.760> a

especially tight not typing with a

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.910 
especially tight not typing with a
keyboard<00:05:03.180> there<00:05:03.750> isn't<00:05:04.110> that<00:05:04.140> much<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.650> lag

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
as I usually get from TouchWiz so that's

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.110 
as I usually get from TouchWiz so that's
a<00:05:06.960> big<00:05:07.200> bonus<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.890> hate<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.700> lag<00:05:08.880> from

a big bonus I hate that lag from
