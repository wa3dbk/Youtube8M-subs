 tie what are the lines of these 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.850

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.450
 you can bet live can 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.460
 doing it at halftime can do it at 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.469
 the highs and lows and of course the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
 full match is the one-way game of 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.280
 semifinals remember that he had a 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.710
 pause for the World Cup and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.020
 faces the national of Paraguay in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.180
 against the sporting defender of Uruguay 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.210
 this is going to be in asunción in paraguay 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.949
 very favorite the national team 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.640
 you would have to see what are the advantages and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.559
 the disadvantages 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.899
 both arrive for the first time in their 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 story to the semifinals and it fits 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.320
 highlight that national 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.140
 also leads against equipment 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.990
 Uruguayans when playing at home and without 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.000
 however the sporting defender set 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.500
 he's doing very well when he goes to Paraguay 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.750
 I lean for this game for a 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.299
 implant start touch this can in 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.310
 the Paraguayans to the Uruguayans and the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.240
 Paraguayan in their noise are very 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.490
 strong I think not 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.979
 paraguay to paraguay if it is also 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.320
 I also stay in this first leg match 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.580
 with the Paraguayan team, I'm the one 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.350
 has to take the opposite web with 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.820
 the Uruguayans because apart to get 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.490
 to this phase they had to go through 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.950
 above the crossing are always complicated 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.170
 if it comes from a very eliminatory 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.789
 disputed and good the other party this 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.159
 it will be on Wednesday bolivar Bolivia 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.020
 against san lorenzo from argentina the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.240
 lounge that for my taste is the broad 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.880
 favorite after there are four left 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.830
 teams in the final stretch that are not 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.869
 such a tradition of so much weight in the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.789
 T-shirt I'm leaving with San's team 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.950
 lorenzo if he is very favorite is less 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.819
 255 this means that they must be 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.670
 invest 255 to earn 100 but to me yes 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.770
 I love San Lorenzo from Argentina 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.410
 I do not know how this is going I go back 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.950
 olive grove because it will play 3,600 meters of 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.870
 height is that it is criminal 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.239
 and his oars Argentine teams and 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.489
 Uruguayan I'm going for the bolívar although 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.739
 they had against the lion has been removed 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.069
 the lion hymn be that bolivar and is 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.840
 difficult I'm going to stay with the team 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.690
 bolivar because the leg is 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.180
 in Argentina the return is in peace if 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.860
 well the Argentine team has eliminated in 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.900
 rooms and in the second round teams 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.160
 Brazilians that by the way for the first 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.150
 Once in more than 20 years there is no 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.700
 Brazilian in semifinals I think he's going 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.890
 despite too much to the Argentines and a 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.569
 week later to play peace I'll 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.519
 with the bolivar I go with salons 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.380
 gentlemen simply because the 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.760
 Bolivians have not been able to 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.319
 moment with the Argentine team san 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.940
 lorenzo then let's go to the safe and 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.410
 in history come san lorenzo ah 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.120
 well then there you can put together 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.890
 your law pair can do it 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.690
 the full match to the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.340
 half time and remember also that 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.220
 this weekend is the grand prize of 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.930
 emilio hungary because who else is the 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.569
 favorite more than louis hamilton though 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.310
 the nico rosbert also still do not come out 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.079
 the lines in betclic are going to come out 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.540
 throughout this week you can 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.160
 do it in different ways but to me 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.320
 I really like Lewis Hamilton because 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.140
 already won four times in hungary the two 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.910
 latest including and because it is a clue 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.670
 that fits very much is a very clue 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.230
 brief of many very slow curves and I think 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.060
 that louis hamilton is going to prove that he is 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.360
 one of the best pilots I 'm going to 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.060
 meet with robert for the fact of having 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.100
 won the grand prize of germany the 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.100
 first races and louis hamilton was 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.230
 best pilot but there have been the last 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.710
 45 in which rosberg has started to 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.450
 to dominate 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.490
 I stay with Rosberg for champion of the 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.010
 world and also to win this race 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.260
 in hungary what you say at the beginning 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.730
 I then have already seen you will generate 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.250
 million is a great pilot and I know that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.620
 there 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.209
 with the race and esteban gutiérrez that 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.980
 At least try to add your first 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.140
 points in the season but also 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.670
 say that nico rosberg has won three of 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.689
 the last five grand prizes as well 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.489
 that I think the bet is 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.650
 great if we go to the German or friend 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.289
 that's why I'm staying with Robert because he's 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.009
 the pilot in cycles that has been better 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:28.060
 in the last races so the 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:29.500
 rudos against good lords and for 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.060
 course it gives us great pleasure that we 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.259
 have accompanied here on his show the 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.759
 money maker if we see you next 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.050
 week to do them again 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.070
 immensely millionaires 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.980
 bye 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:44.070
 the trees Latin American leader in 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.070
 sports plays present moneymaker
