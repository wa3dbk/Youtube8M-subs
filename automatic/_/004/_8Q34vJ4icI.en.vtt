00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.660
 box obviously the dents no 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.380
 because if people don't pull us 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.149
 saccagnate is not not happy about it 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.940
 less is well put by the like boxes 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.440
 this is the back of the box that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.309
 contains the console of course 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.739
 charger the nib the 4g sd 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.899
 the augmented reality cards and just co'm 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.710
 here is not the bundle with pokÃ©mon in it 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.539
 sapphire alpha ok so I would say of 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.539
 proceed immediately to open the box 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.799
 avoiding ruining it okay first thing 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.670
 that we are facing is the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.009
 usual charger battery charger 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:23.759
 equal to that of the 3ds he called aside 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.350
 and the edition is recordings that are 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.930
 the scenarios 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.000
 the code is ok, here is a joke 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.540
 I've already used it so you can't 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.540
 copy 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.140
 here there is a quick guide tele will jump 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:45.149
 well and it's build the manual of 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.649
 instructions then there are as many 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.030
 not even my story book like that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:55.740
 so many pages are 430 pages we see 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.390
 cisco hudson barba are 480 pages but 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.930
 430 excused an enormity 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.760
 because so many pages there is a nice 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.340
 bronze, that is, so much you are 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.440
 let's say huge then into this 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.960
 sachet should be the cards 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.870
 of augmented reality that they have a 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.870
 other because they are those of 3ds therefore 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.470
 it seems useless to also open things that 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.470
 you got the away is obviously inside 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.090
 unless they put it if they are 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.200
 forgotten to put it there should 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:37.350
 be the cosca they got it stuck 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.740
 press i can make ok away the cardboard 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.310
 empty box 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:51.010
 fly away is here there is the cardboard of contini 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.360
 our two of them ok it all here 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.360
 we throw everything away 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:00.040
 here it is in the big good plastichina 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.020
 here it is, the dust has already taken the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.400
 windward on this little 3 of the 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.890
 however, two of them are small 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.650
 the less there is, the better I remember 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.370
 very much the old game boy and game 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.750

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.380

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:29.769

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:34.150
 sd cards beautiful volume then ok 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:38.140
 analog in the directional bunks then 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.820
 well keys abhi sinha mix start and select 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:47.680

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.320
 above is a sd slot or better 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.920
 there were people because I tried a game 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.019
 before doing the unboxing to see if 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.310
 everything worked 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.700
 then there is the recall the hook for the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.980
 recharge 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.220
 above is the poor infrared door 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.870
 lr keys which is so cool because when 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.769
 now type products you see everything behind 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.930
 fair you see you see everything when 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:18.130
 first moves everything behind even when 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.760
 type put in sd card look 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.540
 if you see everything through it is so cool 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.390
 well it goes well 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.310
 the camera is because there are within 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.470
 career because the camera in 3d 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.980
 the rear camera and camera 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.200
 front then here is the speaker and here 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.520
 instead the notification 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.620
 anyway I'm here and the console is already 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.440
 full of life the guardian if the console 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:50.740

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:54.880
 fantastic side top and you can 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.520
 call the bottom of the console where 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.560
 there is the audio jack for three and a half and then 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.690
 here is the key of the strip because 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.710

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.120
 3ds that fold it and vat in the mode 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.630
 sleep that is the key in place has 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.150
 dedicated for the rest mode so in 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.970
 Italian would however say sleep mode 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.030
 cooler than boys 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.890
