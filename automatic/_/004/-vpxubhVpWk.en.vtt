00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.660
 super soft and super simple is this 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.779
 typical makeup without makeup 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.210
 makeup is inspired by a 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.400
 photograph of a cover of 'the one of no 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.559
 It's been a while since I left you the cover in 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.090
 my blog that follows quiroz blog.com for 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:31.189
 that you see the photo in which I have thrown 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.050
 but good is a very simple makeup 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.790
 and very soft this style without 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.219
 makeup makeup so if you want 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.379
 see how we unite, we're going to start 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:44.030
 applying the base to apply the base of 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:47.920
 that psir skin chin de lis l is a base 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.920
 that has a super super natural finish 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.020
 i 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.970
 all right 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.970
 Right 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.030
 half 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.250
 seal the face I'll seal it in 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.350
 very limited areas such as areas of 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.030
 corrector to be the proofreader because 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.830
 I do not have a skin that needs it but 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.640
 If your skin is more you need it 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.640
 it would be the whole face 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.369
 we managed to give a light touch of powder 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.369
 Sun 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.130
 ah 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.990
 as blusher we are going to use a very tone 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.240
 natural is this what the mecca I want to give a 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.610
 more natural tone to the face then 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.890
 I'm going to apply it right where the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.640
 the sun dust and before reaching the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.100
 cheek in between so that there is a 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.800
 colorful much more natural a flushed 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.950
