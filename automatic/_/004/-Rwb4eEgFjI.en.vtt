00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.840
 my ladies and gentlemen please ask 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.469
 Now the TV set to maximum 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.509
 volume 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.009
 This is followed by an address from ten 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.009
 cylinders and four tailpipes 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.410
 a 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.840
 the war paint says it all 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.050
 limousine is in dispute with and with 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.809
 ferrari lamborghini and porsche the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.809
 hardt be walked 50 no mess rather small 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.479
 can this be a threesome with v10 engine 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.640
 There is not that right 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.260
 that's why it's no bmw anymore 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.960
 but a hartl 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.000
 that 's what it says in the vehicle license during the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.800
 next m3 with an eight-cylinder over 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 the freeway hunt is here 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.570
 ten-cylinder from the m5 in it 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.150
 the sequential gear comes 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.790
 also from the big brother by sheep 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.040
 camshafts and new engine electronics 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:46.310
 riding 550 horses on the rear axle 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.310
 that's enough for 320 km h peak 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.940
 when accelerating remains at harbke 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.800
 barely time to breathe 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.830
 but you should not give up the reins 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.210
 let himself 285 he is behind attack 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.210
 overwhelmed with her job 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 use 20 inches is quickly consumed 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.180
 thanks to start automatic he shoots in 14 2 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.460
 seconds at 200 km / h with 520 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.250
 Newton torque and that up to 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.340
 100 locking differential from the m5 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.340
 the h50 goes wonderfully across the corner 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.870
 only the chassis could be more harmonic 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.920
 Just be for bad highways 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.430
 missing the fine cut 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.430
 that's the sound of the track 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.599
 for about 168,000 euros rolls the next 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.610
 first h50 to the customer when they are very quiet 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.810
 they may be there for him 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.810
 Already hear outside
