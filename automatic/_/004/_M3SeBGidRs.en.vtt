00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
screwed them to the inside so when you

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.860 
screwed them to the inside so when you
close<00:03:17.400> those<00:03:17.640> doors<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.239> almost<00:03:18.480> total

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.259 
darkness so I guess I guess if you don't
keep<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.500> total<00:03:22.680> darkness<00:03:22.950> they<00:03:23.340> continue
