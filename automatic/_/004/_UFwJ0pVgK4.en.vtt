00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Visited Vladimir and what do you think 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.490
 Poroshenko's legitimacy she say so 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.500
 doubtful or even its not legitimacy 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.300
 no doubt glad it was more or less 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.870
 only legitimate authority 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.539
 who stayed from her time now her 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.980
 I allowed to abruptly stay with us it is very 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.070
 popular opinion glad lost 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.240
 its this one on the symbolism especially in 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.910
 that moment when 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.610
 attempts and miroslav things go no words 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.340
 all and the president is actually not legitimate 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.180
 choice in a civil war 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.450
 virtually illegitimate 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.760
 what could be the result of this election 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.500
 they will be able to remove some contradictions in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.149
 society or vice versa will only strengthen them 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.460
 Ukraine split only mustache not to mention 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.840
 about what dnr lan lnr already said clearly 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.449
 we will not hold we have a choice 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.340
 Well, the operator visited steel 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.649
 bother not legitimacy Poroshenko 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.940
 initiated because all Ukrainian 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.039
 authorities have been illegitimate since 2007 in 2005 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.650
 the year was illegitimate assigned student 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.600
 which 2007 is illegitimate dismissed 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.460
 parliament as a result were illegitimate 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.680
 and the election for which the new one was chosen 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.450
 legitimate parliament who appointed 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.189
 new not legitimate government of this 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.229
 now all the authorities in Ukraine 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.240
 were illegitimate sadness yanukovich a 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.439
 because he was elected on the basis of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 electoral law you this 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.540
 illegitimate parliament and signed not 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.009
 legitimate president 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.740
 so some kind of legitimacy burn 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.900
 it's a long time ago 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.090
 legitimacy there or legitimization 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.610
 the results of this election are the same as 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.710
 was to legitimize everything before she 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.100
 of course will legitimize ales and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.140
 they said that lovers the only thing 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.070
 I can not say that very worried 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.960
 but honestly I'm afraid that somewhere with 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.200
 80 probability 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.509
 which is 90 percent Poroshenko will 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.119
 deposed or killed long before 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.979
 parliamentary elections and parliament will be held 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.009
 no one will need along with the election 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.530
 not only 10-20 percent for what 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.210
 in two months we will sit here and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.129
 discuss who has one seat there 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.340
 more who have one less chair 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.470
 Parliament and what will depend on it 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.840
 so I think today to condemn and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.240
 election balance of power and legitimacy why 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.710
 it generally had Poroshenko yet 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.710
 early it's pointless
