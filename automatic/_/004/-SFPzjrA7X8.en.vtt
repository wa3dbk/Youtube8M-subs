00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.039 
nikhyl from day one came in her and
soaked<00:03:37.230> everything<00:03:37.409> up<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.900> obviously<00:03:39.900> and

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
soaked everything up and obviously and

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.660 
soaked everything up and obviously and
help<00:03:40.200> them<00:03:40.290> start<00:03:40.560> from<00:03:40.709> day<00:03:40.859> one

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
help them start from day one

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.449 
help them start from day one
so<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.700> think<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:45.440> know<00:03:45.560> figure<00:03:46.340> out

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
so I think that you know figure out

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.680 
so I think that you know figure out
where<00:03:46.610> we<00:03:46.730> can<00:03:46.760> play<00:03:47.030> him<00:03:47.180> where's<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.569> best

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
where we can play him where's the best

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.699 
where we can play him where's the best
spot<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.959> clam<00:03:48.580> 320<00:03:49.580> pounds<00:03:49.910> already<00:03:50.709> he

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
spot to clam 320 pounds already he

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.470 
spot to clam 320 pounds already he
doesn't<00:03:51.980> look<00:03:52.100> like<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.450> which<00:03:53.450> is

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
doesn't look like that which is

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.330 
doesn't look like that which is
obviously<00:03:53.900> very<00:03:53.959> unusual<00:03:54.500> for<00:03:54.650> graduate<00:03:55.130> soon

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
obviously very unusual for graduate soon

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.710 
obviously very unusual for graduate soon
as<00:03:55.610> poverty<00:03:56.000> 220<00:03:57.760> anything<00:03:58.760> they<00:03:58.880> saw<00:03:59.120> in<00:03:59.570> the

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
as poverty 220 anything they saw in the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:09.210 
as poverty 220 anything they saw in the
film<00:03:59.900> Saturday's<00:04:00.800> scrimmage<00:04:06.340> Saturdays<00:04:07.340> I

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
film Saturday's scrimmage Saturdays I

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.380 
film Saturday's scrimmage Saturdays I
thought<00:04:10.220> that<00:04:11.440> Cody<00:04:12.440> did<00:04:12.650> some<00:04:12.830> good<00:04:12.950> things

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
thought that Cody did some good things

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.640 
thought that Cody did some good things
and<00:04:14.390> think<00:04:14.660> we<00:04:14.720> played<00:04:14.930> very<00:04:14.959> well<00:04:15.290> up<00:04:15.410> front

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
and think we played very well up front

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.740 
and think we played very well up front
on<00:04:15.800> offense<00:04:18.220> out<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.430> first<00:04:19.700> string<00:04:19.970> front

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
on offense out of the first string front

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.720 
on offense out of the first string front
