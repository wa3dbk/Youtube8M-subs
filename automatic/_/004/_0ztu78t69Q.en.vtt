i<00:02:42.330> think<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.019> list<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.410> sniper<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.890> def

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
i think that the list the sniper is def

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.080 
i think that the list the sniper is def
it<00:02:44.160> going<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.340> be<00:02:44.430> something<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.879> lot<00:02:44.940> of

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it going to be something that a lot of

it going to be something that a lot of
us<00:02:45.269> are<00:02:45.450> going<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.780> hope<00:02:46.019> for<00:02:46.220> they<00:02:47.220> also<00:02:47.370> have
