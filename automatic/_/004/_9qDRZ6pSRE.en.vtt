00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
living too well so I think this idea

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.120 
living too well so I think this idea
that<00:00:39.970> has<00:00:40.060> been<00:00:40.590> spawned<00:00:41.590> here<00:00:41.890> in<00:00:42.010> our

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
that has been spawned here in our

us<00:00:44.440> like<00:00:44.590> a<00:00:44.740> plague<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.370> therefore<00:00:45.730> it's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
us like a plague and therefore it's

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.250 
us like a plague and therefore it's
uncontrollable<00:00:46.330> and<00:00:46.720> no<00:00:46.840> one<00:00:46.990> can<00:00:47.140> do

uncontrollable and no one can do

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.030 
uncontrollable and no one can do
anything<00:00:47.470> about<00:00:47.650> it

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
anything about it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
suggesting that there are literally

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.830 
suggesting that there are literally
thousands<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.650> unnecessary<00:02:51.650> regulations

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
that are unnecessary that government can

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.250 

I<00:07:05.430> believe<00:07:06.389> that<00:07:06.600> there<00:07:06.750> is<00:07:06.870> a<00:07:06.900> fundamental

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:07.260 
I believe that there is a fundamental

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.900 
I believe that there is a fundamental
difference<00:07:07.680> and<00:07:08.190> I<00:07:08.400> think<00:07:08.430> it<00:07:08.699> has<00:07:08.790> been

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
difference and I think it has been

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.850 
difference and I think it has been
evident<00:07:09.300> in<00:07:09.360> most<00:07:09.540> of<00:07:09.720> the<00:07:09.780> answers<00:07:10.139> that<00:07:10.169> mr.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
evident in most of the answers that mr.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.580 
evident in most of the answers that mr.
Carter's<00:07:11.160> given<00:07:11.400> tonight<00:07:11.639> that<00:07:12.540> he<00:07:12.750> seeks<00:07:13.080> the

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
Carter's given tonight that he seeks the

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.890 
Carter's given tonight that he seeks the
solution<00:07:14.160> to<00:07:14.280> anything<00:07:14.639> as<00:07:15.030> another

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
solution to anything as another

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.480 
solution to anything as another
opportunity<00:07:16.530> for<00:07:16.560> a<00:07:16.740> federal<00:07:17.280> government

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
opportunity for a federal government

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.480 
opportunity for a federal government
program<00:07:17.790> I<00:07:18.740> happen<00:07:19.740> to<00:07:19.800> believe<00:07:19.919> that<00:07:20.130> the

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
program I happen to believe that the

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.159 
program I happen to believe that the
federal<00:07:20.850> government<00:07:21.210> has<00:07:21.300> usurped<00:07:21.660> powers
