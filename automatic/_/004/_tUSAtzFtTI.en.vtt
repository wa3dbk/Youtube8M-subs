00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.340
 hello today we are going to talk about how 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.450
 dress up if you have a body shaped like 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.880
 But this type of body is characterized 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.380
 for having hips wider than 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.320
 shoulders 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.770
 usually the back is thin and the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.329
 waist is marked as seen in the 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.000
 photo on the left 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.450
 Jennifer Love-Hewitt has this kind of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.710
 she is 35 years old and is more like 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.560
 short is about 57 but it does not look like 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.840
 now let's see some looks of her 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.360
 that favor you and some examples of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.150
 things that it is better to avoid if you have a 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.850
 body with this shape I would love to read 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.070
 your comments on the video and about 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.680
 this section of the channel on how to say 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.720
 according to your body type do not forget to give 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.120
 like to know if you are liking the 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.730
 channel and subscribe so you do not 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.710
 lose any of my videos at the end 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.229
 of this video is the link to the videos 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.020
 earlier of this series are not 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.539
 lose Jennifer moves a lot in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.960
 dresses and skirts even more than in 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.080
 Jean 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.360
 I think she uses a lot this type of 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.030
 Studies that are adjusted at the waist 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.880
 and then they fall with flight on the hips 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.979
 like women with a pear- like body 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.440
 they have wider hips than 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.259
 shoulders and unbalance the body 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.690
 highlighting the top but this 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.700
 type of dress that draws attention in 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.550
 the lower part of the body also 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.399
 it can work because your clothes are a 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.830
 double- edged weapon if the 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.710
 appropriate model can be given even more 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.950
 volume in the hips to make you see 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.190
 more kilos than you have those 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.340
 red and black dresses are also a 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.820
 example of what clothes you should not wear if 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.850
 you are overweight if you wear very large clothes 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.230
 trying to hide some kilos you 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.050
 you will see bigger 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.270
 in carving the body is not bad there are only 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.330
 to avoid too tight dresses 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.640
 or tight 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.770
 with these dresses the attention goes 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.710
 directly to the top of the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.980
 body although not necessarily by the 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.110
 white color of the black and white dress 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.950
 but that's the idea to leave in sight 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.140
 of the hips to not highlight the most 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.140
 according to your taste you can mark the hips 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.650
 if you want anyway this kind of 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.650
 body is very beautiful 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.640
 the lilac dress send the look to the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.909
 waist the neckline and tail of the dress 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.739
 and the hips move to the background 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.750
 the volume at the bottom 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.840
 also balances the width of the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.239
 hips 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.959
 Black dresses like these are very 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.489
 flatters mark the waist 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.700
 they lose weight and make you look with less 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.550
 volume in the hips sleeves and 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.440
 details on the shoulders show that the 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.860
 width of the top and bottom 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.770
 of the body leveling 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.110
 clear that color dresses like these 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.680
 that stand out very much their legs are 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.680
 very good 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.380
 Another example of things to avoid is to take 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.670
 this style garment on garment or what 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.590
 it seems like they do not favor much 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.440
 Blouses that fall to the hips is better 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.850
 edit them and if you like this style 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.280
 better opt for lightweight blouses 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.640
 these are some styles with skirts with 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.610
 those who have succeeded 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.100
 Straight skirts are better than 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.010
 stopped the black part of the 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.100
 hips gives the illusion that that area is 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.890
 smallest the blue skirt has boleros 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.620
 but in this case the volume is confused 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.740
 of the hips with that of the skirt and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.959
 he cheats at sight she is seen a lot 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.780
 with this kind of very tight styles 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.720
 they have many colors with some 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.569
 modifications as seen with it looks 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.489
 more fall or na if you like this kind of 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.609
 styles best wear them in colors 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.669
 dark like this blue or black with 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.880
 opt for styles 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.830
 Fitted but not super tight with 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.520
 a style of the black dress of the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.070
 right that also has a straight cut 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.900
 as for jeans and pants to this 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.380
 body type is very useful 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.720
 wide-boot jeans and loose or type 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.480
 elephant 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.180
 if you do not like to wear that kind of boots 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.350
 You can choose jeans or pants 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.570
 straight boot 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.720
 have faith usually wear pants very 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.150
 long as we saw earlier this 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.330
 It serves to lengthen your legs and make it 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.490
 see higher perhaps but this few 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.220
 Sometimes you see him with this type of jeans 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.080
 like paul frey jean that are worn by 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.750
 above the ankle or even higher 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.330
 the skinny jeans that are not too 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.689
 adjusted at the ankle can also 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.689
 function 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.930
 the light colors and prints on the 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.200
 lower part of the body is not 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.170
 advise it is better to highlight the torso with 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.360
 light colors prints and necklaces 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.909
 striking 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.879
 Jennifer must know because rarely 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:39.969
 wear light colored jeans like this 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:43.949
 pink and usually seen with jeans 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:43.949
 black and dark blue 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:50.110
 the jackets and blazer are allies for 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.009
 the pear-shaped body with both 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.619
 dressed as with jeans or pants 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.839
 the blazers of light colors and 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:01.319
 structured on the shoulders are the 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.319
 Better option 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:07.519
 pregnant woman used a lot of europe 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.739
 marked the tummy was seen with 

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:12.519
 casual clothes usually jeans and 

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:12.519
 Tshirts 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.520
 she also wore many tight dresses 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.520
 like these 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.229
 this is a some of the dresses of 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.810
 long gala sit very well of 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:31.580
 Brand new your waist and wear dresses 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.580

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.330
 on the red carpet he has also used 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:40.420
 short dresses with volume in the part 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.540
 inferior but confused when doing 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.240
 think if the volume in the hips is 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.410
 caused by the dress model or by 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.410
 your body shape 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:56.089
 Jennifer lives in california maybe because 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:58.240
 that does not go away much with coats those 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:07:00.469
 are some examples of those who have used 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.110
 she usually wears coats with 

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:05.160
 structure on the shoulders and in color 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.380
