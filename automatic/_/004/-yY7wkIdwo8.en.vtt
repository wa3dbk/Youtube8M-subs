00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.730
 Speak, people, beauty , welcome, but 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.710
 Brazilians who speak to you is rafa 9 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.869
 that had the first game play a 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.460
 commented here of the code channel or if 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.830
 Okay, so I'll say some things 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.140
 that I found the mp you are seeing 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.269
 I 've been playing in the background, it's not 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 video that you may be noticing is 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.840
 that what to pass some information as 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.369
 bad for who is wondering then 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.260
 the next company will bring 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.840
 comment live do not worry 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.239
 with that as was the code goals in my 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.090
 opinion they did a lot of 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.579
 made it kind of like chirping a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.770
 I got stuck with the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.460
 very high expectations in relation to the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.879
 game 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.879
 only that she simply did not answer the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.230
 these expectations are public in the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.170
 Overall I can say that it's cool 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.699
 certain only that it did not come in a way 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.739
 I thought he was teaching video 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.329
 some very negative things in the game 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.580
 as for example the thing that I can 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.900
 being from the beginning was a graphic is 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.880
 As soon as I entered the game 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.979
 my group was completely isolated 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.869
 it was all foggy I spent a lot 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.640
 time to try to find out how 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.860
 I was going to fix it and I just finished 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.049
 stirring woods federations including 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.659
 video card and after very trying 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.689
 finally getting there I got the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.640
 fps drop to the game gave stopped 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.829
 answer several times so I do not know if 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.350
 this is actually related to somebody game 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.579
 fifa or whether we are going to be related to 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.520
 video cards to computers 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.189
 Personally, its the first point I found 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.530
 that was not very cool is the other 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.290
 thing for you is about the way 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.740
 game is the game, it's very dynamic, I 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.869
 I can speak for the fun cj to choose 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.880
 complex but is pleasant is playable 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.590
 only we have the very strange maps 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.899
 maps that I was not accustomed to. 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.860
 maps have many routes has several 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.270
 different levels 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.369
 so you get a little lost in the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.880
 start until you know the side where the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.189
 map 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.320
 only on the other hand is also a point 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.210
 very positive since you film a degree 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.860
 of greater complexity you have several 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.110
 posts for getting you then have the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.450
 encounters over long range versus medium 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.970
 range encounters at close range then 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.190
 in general I liked the game he 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.810
 has different modes of battle like 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.430
 for example the star of what if you 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.840
 kidnap you have a time to be able to 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.580
 kill another but you die 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.830
 also has a bridges mode I have not played 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.120
 very much these molds still only that I can 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.400
 tell you that there are enough people 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.440
 playing code is we have there I think 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.430
 today hit today 5th in fact to 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.010
 yesterday you right 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.140
 yesterday hit around 23 24 thousand people 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.349
 simultaneously playing the game he 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.370
 let's also say the same respect 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.230
 curiosity in the galley 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.349
 we have a good legal system that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.030
 entrance to the neighborhood we have characters 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.269
 right feminine we have several weapons 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.250
 different because there is the with the code or 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.440
 or from the developer of the 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.510
 infinity ward already black ops 2 is a 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.190
 different developer and treyarch 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.019
 I'm not going to stay here talking about 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.700
 developers and such but I think the 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.150
 episode could have added one more 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.790
 game 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.299
 the turkey was 401 sensational way to 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.600
 spectacular way of graphics form 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.549
 sensational 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.130
 already the code if I thought it was missing 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.380
 something you hear talking to you 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.600
 I have not played much yet and for what 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.389
 I played I liked the game is the game that 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.359
 I found it very consistent, very precise. 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:26.549
 in spite of having well there is a difference 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.380
 big in relation to the podium black ops 2 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.630
 that was the game is enough so I took 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.239
 in an adaptation phase the cases that have 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.299
 they played modern f3a probably good 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.400
 have an easier time getting used to 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.540
 who already has a standard that the sale 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.750
 of the edict 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.180
 But I'm particularly in the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.639
 stage of adaptation to this range and 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.069
 I also found a little bit different 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.239
 No, I was quite surprised by the game, but it 's a 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.609
 legal game has a support system 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.519
 physique was that the strike was so cool 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.109
 here we have three types of fixed cut 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.620
 in which offensive to the defensive 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:04.280
 that you pick up the accumulation that cpc 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.410
 in which the followed where followed 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.750
 the system of specialists of the 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.190
 recent are a stop or complex 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.870
 I'm going to study hard and I'm going to train. 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.069
 I 'm going to play, I'll meet to try. 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.810
 to bring you good information 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.519
 I'm good, I know you 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.669
 there are many of you already know enough 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.709
 thing of the code but the channel and whether it is for 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.389
 those who do not know very well, right? 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.889
 the channel is actually more based on the 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.080
 episode as real deviation for example 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.970
 only there the people who are interested 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.080
 Quite the subject do not worry that 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.820
 I'll try to bring you a 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.530
 way but if a more purified law 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.060
 explaining showing riding 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.340
 base configuration 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.440
 including the system of patios and even 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.690
 that dragged us pretty cool from this game 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.610
 we have several giants made there 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.680
 you can combine each since 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.960
 will give a certain kind of point you can 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.480
 lose the spirit of flexa chosen 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.430
 each pump to static equipment and 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.560
 mentally listen to how much you use 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.300
 weapons techniques do not count as 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.780
 pigs with neither one nor with a technique 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.700
 right 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.960
 we allow the way to disqualify a 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.180
 way co op 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.220
 we already have the campaign mode the game is well 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.010
 even though it has some 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.320
 my view is not a technical analysis 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.750
 because he practically knew how to ask 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.610
 analyze the unit only so 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.710
 the general I thought it might have been 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.910
 a little better but at least that was it 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.740
 I wanted to tell you this first one. 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.680
 first video of the code then 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.539
 more videos will come and I hope you guys 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.910
 I liked beans I liked my favorite 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.950
 comment with shares write there 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.840
 Your next video I hope you are 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.200
 enjoying a hug 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.200
 went
