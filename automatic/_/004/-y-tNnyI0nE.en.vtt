00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:05.890
 a survey conducted by ibge revealed the index follows above 30% by at 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.959

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.780
 been a victim of violence at school was registered in Brasilia with a 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.939
 percentage 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:19.210
 thirty-five comma 6% belo horizonte ranked second and 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.129
 third, the number of students who declared themselves victims of 

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.429
 bullying was higher in private schools than in public schools 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.349
 between boys because between girls to discuss this problem is with us to 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.989
 psychiatrist ana beatriz barbosa silva author of the book bullying minds 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.399
 dangerous in school the side will have later okay to tie here interpreted 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.199
 through the 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:42.879
 you do not need that 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.940
 In this way normal adolescent children imply a cost and it is 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.879
 in these olympics sometimes even very powerful fighting 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.900
 the mineral sector this problem that can be characterized as bullying 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.710
 it's what counts is a very crazy technical thing why 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.570
 really when it's a joke 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.270
 everybody has fun 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.250
 however this does not occur 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.030
 can not expect the other person to 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.610
 practiced the fight of violence against another 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.650
 I always see 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.939
 type an obligation of the person who sometimes died suffering 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.270
 end up here 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.890
 only who is amused is the person is the aggressor who practiced punishing a car 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.790
 of the victims 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.159
 In jest rules jp created no more 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.680
 there is no delay 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.740
 this negative charge than the landmark entity of a fantasy 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.740
 and not however always visit the custom of seeing that healthy joke 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.160
 is one that nobody has a good and that everyone has fun when it is good nor 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.450
 surely someone will have fun at the expense of another's suffering 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.700
 girl 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.330
 I did two phases of identifying lessons put to a vote in the sitting 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.620
 following which it is occurring 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.050
 She looks like Pepe de Braga as the protector is much weaker than me because she is 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.000
 occurring within the classroom 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.950
 in general may occur more in the playground or in the very surroundings of the school 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.200
 not necessarily within the school territory 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.549
 or out of school 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.809
 in the cti adult buuren that occurs today through the internet press 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.869
 ned social networking sites we call cyber bullying 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.069
 the technical question 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.200
 without creating in day 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.060
 if you are studying all of purim practitioners like those who are 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.819
 suffering because for example 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.449
 a child or teenager who is playing politics he will have a 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:39.089
 very typical behavior in school and also in the home environment 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.100
 That's why I wasted not only the teachers 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.100
 by the staff of the school itself 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:49.999
 but also that the people who were close to home 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:54.479
 the contractor's employees arrested him all the people who are living 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.669
 the parents who live with the child also face 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:03.799
 for example in school you will always be the victim of the prudent is still the 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.069
 usually in the playground so much that awlaki has to have a posture to have 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.510
 afraid to appear 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.189
 do not want another victim yet 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.999
 You're catching her, she says she's usually sad, depressed, with a flaw. 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:20.769
 and lots of fries start to have lack of frequency glue glues 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.489
 in games on TV in collective activities are usually children who end up 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.949
 being excluded 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:32.499
 ends up developing should lose that child starts the audience was a 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.649
 child who had normal grades begins to drop out 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.790
 Air all complete 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.240
 the speed stops the tasks 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.159
 I tried to protect and no more body and that the school itself a good thing 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.390
 and in the last case to go in the most serious cases 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.510
 she literally presents bruises scratching signs of physical violence 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.079
 really to act 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.770
 So we have to be very attentive to this in school. 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.410
 in the middle of a letter 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.650
 in general the debut of lovers of head closed various tortures 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.909
 symptoms 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.259
 always had an organ 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.899
 Christmas on the eve of school Sunday night 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.429
 or on the way to school 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:16.760
 about 30 men inside her facebook 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.910
 also has mood swings inside the home bursts of anger rage 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.100
 because this child has no way to react at school on the cover 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.390
 reacting at home disproportionately receives few 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.700
 phone calls 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.320
 she is little sought after to have so many school friends 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.330
 and several others I try but discarded saying that we have to always have 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.289
 very attentive 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.529
 because it's a cap and it was not taken 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:44.830
 even because what we expect gives them a power 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.930
 it's a role made then hertha 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.300
 violence it has to have a repetitive character 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.770
 because in the case of this ibge research in about 30% of the students in this 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.720
 sense 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.120
 the vietnam of violence in the school they mentioned above that being a 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.680
 which occurred at one time or another, but about 5 percent said that 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.819
 frequently found this kind of aggression in 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:16.439
 school yet 5% is a very reasonable number what you can do for 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.729
 example Morumbi in this school to reduce this type of situation 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.980
 first thing is because you want to stay with the stones and black 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.539
 nowadays what is an intricate 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.309
 and punctual the three-time recurring theme only when there is such a recurrent 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:36.759
 that we can talk about bullying out of this can be an isolated fact 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:39.900
 the classic occurs that today 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.780
 we must combat this 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.289
 this is the palm trees, but it is not a phenomenon today. 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.750
 it's the different tributary phenomenon 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.760
 It's what happens is that today we're studying we have 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.279
 identified is researching and quantifying 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:55.979
 to any school having an order 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.520
 such as the difference is the posture that this school will have 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.749
 against good name 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:05.899
 and when you have a posture in front of the opponent we have to unite 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:06.919
 school 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.000
 family 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.830
 and the whole society in us does not get anywhere 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.920
 I think the first thing is to qualify the professionals and the parents have 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.419
 identified the bullying phenomenon 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.840
 the second race 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.949
 identified the phenomenon 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:22.249
 we can identify 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:26.239
 what role is it that the children and so much faith in the pt who are the aggressors 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.990
 who are the victims and who are the black spectators those children who 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.059
 comes 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.139
 It's life, punishment, the fellow suffered bullying. 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.530
 but here yao ming time to protect themselves from matter was with the 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.639
 these children also suffer from 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.219
 for the omission 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:48.169
 So we have to first qualify. 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.970
 in the sense of informing is exactly how to identify the signs who are the 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:56.189
 other children who have penta classes 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:59.649
 and from there pre-salt a form the campaign
