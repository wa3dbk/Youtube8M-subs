about exposure I mean there's I can't
think<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.030> very<00:03:36.060> many<00:03:36.330> events<00:03:36.840> where<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.200> can

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
think of very many events where you can

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.420

have exposure to this many people in
that<00:03:40.819> are<00:03:40.939> a<00:03:40.969> lot<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.329> have<00:03:41.480> fun<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.349> I<00:03:42.379> think

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
that are a lot to have fun so I think

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.770 
that are a lot to have fun so I think
it's<00:03:42.799> great<00:03:42.950> exposure<00:03:43.280> for<00:03:43.459> what<00:03:44.329> a<00:03:44.359> generally

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
it's great exposure for what a generally

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.410 
it's great exposure for what a generally
reasonable<00:03:45.379> sponsorship<00:03:45.890> piece<00:03:49.390> well<00:03:50.390> I

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
reasonable sponsorship piece well I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.890 
reasonable sponsorship piece well I
think<00:03:51.219> it's<00:03:52.219> a<00:03:52.400> tremendous<00:03:53.000> impact<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.719> mean

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
think it's a tremendous impact I mean

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.080 
think it's a tremendous impact I mean
it's<00:03:54.409> it's<00:03:54.769> good<00:03:55.069> for<00:03:55.340> anybody<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:56.060> be

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
it's it's good for anybody to be

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.780 
it's it's good for anybody to be
associated<00:03:56.870> with<00:03:57.260> an<00:03:57.439> event<00:03:57.590> like<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.370> that

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
associated with an event like this that

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.649 
associated with an event like this that
has<00:03:59.480> run<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.079> successfully<00:04:01.010> for<00:04:01.370> so<00:04:01.579> long<00:04:01.819> and

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
has run so successfully for so long and

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.640 
has run so successfully for so long and
I<00:04:03.530> think<00:04:03.859> it's<00:04:04.659> clear<00:04:05.659> well<00:04:05.959> I<00:04:05.989> mean<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.439> see

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
I think it's clear well I mean you see

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.920 
I think it's clear well I mean you see
how<00:04:06.680> many<00:04:07.040> sponsors<00:04:07.670> there<00:04:07.849> are<00:04:08.090> not<00:04:08.569> only<00:04:08.840> in

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
how many sponsors there are not only in

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.440 
how many sponsors there are not only in
Birmingham<00:04:09.469> but<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.859> other<00:04:10.010> communities<00:04:10.700> and

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
Birmingham but the other communities and

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.289 
Birmingham but the other communities and
I<00:04:11.840> think<00:04:12.079> there's<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:13.040> real<00:04:13.310> payback<00:04:13.549> in<00:04:14.060> terms

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
I think there's a real payback in terms

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.839 
I think there's a real payback in terms
of<00:04:14.599> getting<00:04:15.230> your<00:04:15.379> name<00:04:15.620> out<00:04:15.650> there<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:16.519> being

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849
