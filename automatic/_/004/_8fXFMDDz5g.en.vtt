00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
possible repetition is the key

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.790 
possible repetition is the key

30,000 tasks anything we do that we

30,000 tasks anything we do that we
practically<00:02:42.890> get<00:02:43.070> better<00:02:43.250> at<00:02:43.489> but<00:02:44.180> there's

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
practically get better at but there's

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.570 
practically get better at but there's
also<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.690> theory<00:02:45.080> within<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.980> brain<00:02:46.190> where

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
also a theory within the brain where

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.870 
also a theory within the brain where
when<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:46.959> process<00:02:47.959> information<00:02:48.640> over<00:02:49.640> time

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
when you process information over time

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.759 
when you process information over time
over<00:02:50.269> reading<00:02:50.570> many<00:02:50.810> repetitions<00:02:51.230> your<00:02:51.560> brain

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
over reading many repetitions your brain

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.560 
over reading many repetitions your brain
processes<00:02:52.370> information<00:02:52.519> better<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.390> because

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
processes information better so because

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.000 
processes information better so because
your<00:02:53.690> brain<00:02:53.840> has<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.140> plasticity<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.920> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
your brain has the plasticity and the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.910 
your brain has the plasticity and the
ability<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.370> learn<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.420> change<00:02:56.920> your

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
ability to learn and change your

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.730 
ability to learn and change your
alternate<00:02:58.670> yeah

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
alternate yeah

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.700

challenged<00:03:06.700> Courtney<00:03:07.150> according<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.080> the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170

computer she missed the expected beat by

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.860 
computer she missed the expected beat by
300<00:03:11.530> millisecond<00:03:12.420> millisecond<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.570> it's<00:03:13.750> not

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
300 millisecond millisecond so it's not

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.360 
300 millisecond millisecond so it's not
that<00:03:14.110> significant<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:14.530> significant<00:03:15.190> enough

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
that significant but significant enough

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.450 
that significant but significant enough
that<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:17.440> know<00:03:17.560> she<00:03:17.620> was<00:03:17.890> pretty<00:03:18.100> far<00:03:18.250> up<00:03:18.370> the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
that you know she was pretty far up the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.490 
that you know she was pretty far up the
beat<00:03:18.670> so<00:03:19.060> she's<00:03:19.720> definitely<00:03:19.840> had<00:03:20.110> difficulty

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
beat so she's definitely had difficulty

weeks of IM therapy ahead of her and
only<00:03:41.530> one<00:03:41.830> goal<00:03:42.130> get<00:03:42.910> closer<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.870> beads

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
only one goal get closer to the beads

she<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.150> her<00:03:46.300> mom<00:03:46.480> hopes<00:03:46.900> all<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.440> clapping

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
she and her mom hopes all the clapping
