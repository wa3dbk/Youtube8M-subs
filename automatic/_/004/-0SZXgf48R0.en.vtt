especially<00:03:24.859> when<00:03:24.980> they're<00:03:25.099> vegan<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.549> that

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
especially when they're vegan is that

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.099 
especially when they're vegan is that
you<00:03:25.819> want<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.150> make<00:03:26.299> them<00:03:26.450> stick<00:03:26.629> together<00:03:26.810> and

you want to make them stick together and

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.209 
you want to make them stick together and
it's<00:03:27.200> really<00:03:27.409> hard<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.769> do<00:03:27.889> that<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.099> you<00:03:28.189> don't

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:28.219 
it's really hard to do that if you don't

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.129 
it's really hard to do that if you don't
have<00:03:28.519> egg<00:03:28.760> in<00:03:28.790> there<00:03:29.060> but<00:03:29.599> instead<00:03:29.840> of<00:03:29.959> those

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
have egg in there but instead of those

processor<00:03:39.919> pulse<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.819> a<00:03:40.879> few<00:03:41.000> times<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.450> they

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
processor pulse it a few times and they

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.080 
processor pulse it a few times and they
become<00:03:41.870> like<00:03:42.019> this<00:03:42.459> so<00:03:43.459> add<00:03:43.700> three

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
become like this so add three

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.830 
become like this so add three
tablespoons<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.719> this<00:03:44.900> make<00:03:45.230> sure<00:03:46.629> looks<00:03:47.629> warm

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
enough and it's clumping together so i

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.830

and what I love about this dish is that

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.460 
and what I love about this dish is that
you<00:04:16.910> can<00:04:17.060> actually<00:04:17.209> see<00:04:17.420> the<00:04:17.780> large<00:04:17.959> chunks

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
and for that reason we didn't cut any of

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.090 
and for that reason we didn't cut any of
the<00:04:20.660> vegetables<00:04:21.110> too<00:04:21.290> small<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:21.739> I've<00:04:21.860> shaped
