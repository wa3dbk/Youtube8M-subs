00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
until you get to this point where this

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.379 
until you get to this point where this
is<00:02:40.859> how<00:02:41.099> far<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.459> made<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:44.040> how<00:02:44.430> far<00:02:44.849> we

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
is how far we made it this is how far we

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.039 
is how far we made it this is how far we
made<00:02:45.629> it

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
made it

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.679 
made it
during<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.220> glitch<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:48.030> will<00:02:48.180> take<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.569> about

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
during the glitch it will take you about

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.110 
during the glitch it will take you about
20<00:02:49.200> minutes<00:02:49.590> even<00:02:50.129> more<00:02:50.340> if<00:02:50.609> you<00:02:50.760> want<00:02:50.939> to<00:02:51.000> get

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
20 minutes even more if you want to get

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.569 
20 minutes even more if you want to get
this<00:02:51.359> far<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:52.169> just<00:02:52.530> running<00:02:52.950> straight<00:02:53.189> out

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
this far of just running straight out

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.849 
this far of just running straight out
into<00:02:53.760> nothing<00:02:53.970> but<00:02:54.470> you'll<00:02:55.470> get<00:02:55.650> there

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
into nothing but you'll get there

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.919 
into nothing but you'll get there
eventually
