00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
Xin it as a midi controller to make

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.900 
Xin it as a midi controller to make
music<00:00:24.599> inside<00:00:24.900> FL<00:00:25.290> Studio<00:00:25.710> I've<00:00:26.640> seen

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
music inside FL Studio I've seen

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.640 
music inside FL Studio I've seen
hundreds<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.390> hundreds<00:00:27.690> of<00:00:27.810> video<00:00:28.050> with<00:00:28.320> DJ's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
hundreds and hundreds of video with DJ's

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.310 
hundreds and hundreds of video with DJ's
using<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.070> too<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.910> know<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.270> DJ<00:00:30.930> controller

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
using it too you know as a DJ controller

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
using it too you know as a DJ controller
and<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.369> know<00:00:32.460> that's<00:00:32.669> great<00:00:32.910> now<00:00:33.150> but<00:00:33.360> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and you know that's great now but I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.580 
and you know that's great now but I
haven't<00:00:33.570> seen<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> single<00:00:34.199> video<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:34.530> there

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
haven't seen a single video out there

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.820 
haven't seen a single video out there
and<00:00:34.830> I<00:00:34.890> looked<00:00:35.160> um<00:00:35.629> you<00:00:36.629> know<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> use<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
and I looked um you know to use it to

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.250 
and I looked um you know to use it to
make<00:00:37.949> music<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> make<00:00:38.519> beads<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> midi

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
make music to make beads as a midi

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.560 
make music to make beads as a midi
controller<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:42.350> what<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.650> so

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
controller for you know what have you so

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.910 
controller for you know what have you so
the<00:00:45.570> pads<00:00:45.809> using<00:00:46.229> it<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> midi<00:00:46.769> controller

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the pads using it as a midi controller

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.520 
the pads using it as a midi controller
they<00:00:47.400> are<00:00:47.519> really<00:00:47.879> responsive<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
they are really responsive one of the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.140 
they are really responsive one of the
things<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> was<00:00:50.010> disappointed<00:00:50.309> about<00:00:50.850> was

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
things that I was disappointed about was

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.810 
things that I was disappointed about was
the<00:00:51.360> jog<00:00:51.629> wheels<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.290> you<00:00:53.220> know<00:00:53.339> you<00:00:53.400> can<00:00:53.640> use

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the jog wheels and you know you can use

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.729 
the jog wheels and you know you can use
it<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> scratch<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> controller<00:00:55.229> but<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.650> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it to scratch as a controller but in the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.649 
it to scratch as a controller but in the
MIDI<00:00:55.920> world<00:00:56.220> it<00:00:56.519> doesn't<00:00:56.760> necessarily

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
MIDI world it doesn't necessarily

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:04.280 
MIDI world it doesn't necessarily
function<00:00:58.110> that<00:00:58.260> way<00:00:58.530> um<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:02.930> eight<00:01:03.930> pads

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
function that way um and the eight pads

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.969 
function that way um and the eight pads
on<00:01:04.739> each<00:01:04.949> side<00:01:05.190> they<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> same

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
on each side they are you know the same

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.740 
on each side they are you know the same
on<00:01:08.130> both<00:01:08.159> sides<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.299> hit<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.540> eight

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
on both sides so if you hit the eight

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.539 
on both sides so if you hit the eight
pads<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.350> side<00:01:10.590> you're<00:01:10.860> essentially

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
pads on one side you're essentially

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.250 
pads on one side you're essentially
hitting<00:01:11.790> pads<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> other<00:01:12.330> side<00:01:12.600> which

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
hitting pads on the other side which

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.930 
hitting pads on the other side which
kind<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.590> sucks<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> good<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
kind of sucks but it is good in the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.969 
kind of sucks but it is good in the
sense<00:01:15.150> if<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> needed<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> roll<00:01:16.770> or

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
sense if you needed to do like a roll or

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
sense if you needed to do like a roll or
something<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.399> that<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.820> could<00:01:17.969> use<00:01:18.180> both

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
something like that you could use both

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
something like that you could use both
pads<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.740> things<00:01:20.009> really<00:01:20.280> fast<00:01:20.549> in

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
pads and really do things really fast in

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.319 
pads and really do things really fast in
real<00:01:20.969> time<00:01:21.270> um<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> here's<00:01:23.609> a<00:01:23.670> quick<00:01:23.880> sample<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
real time um so here's a quick sample of

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.690 
real time um so here's a quick sample of
me<00:01:24.479> using<00:01:24.689> AZ<00:01:24.899> controller<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.369> let

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
me using AZ controller and you know let

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:46.750 
me using AZ controller and you know let
me<00:01:26.759> know<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> guys<00:01:27.240> think

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.219 

so<00:01:47.760> as<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.110> good

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
so as you can see this is a really good

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.070 
so as you can see this is a really good
controller<00:01:49.650> for<00:01:50.479> doing<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:51.870> making

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
controller for doing you know making

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.080 
controller for doing you know making
music<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.550> really<00:01:53.760> good<00:01:53.850> option

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
music in and it's a really good option

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.550 
music in and it's a really good option
to<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.900> I'm<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.260> proud<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
to have you know I'm really proud of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.750 
to have you know I'm really proud of
pioneering<00:01:56.070> what<00:01:56.190> they<00:01:56.310> did<00:01:56.520> with<00:01:56.670> this

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
pioneering what they did with this

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.670 
pioneering what they did with this
you're<00:01:56.970> able<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.810> know<00:01:57.900> do<00:01:58.080> rolls<00:01:58.409> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
you're able to you know do rolls and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.109 
you're able to you know do rolls and
stuff<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.310> into<00:01:59.550> your<00:01:59.670> music<00:01:59.790> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
stuff really get into your music the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.670 
stuff really get into your music the
pads<00:02:00.360> are<00:02:00.570> sensitive<00:02:00.990> they're<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> lot<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.560> fun

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
pads are sensitive they're a lot of fun

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.719 
pads are sensitive they're a lot of fun
um<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:03.720> know<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.290> did<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.280> bit<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.580> MIDI

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
um you know I did a little bit of MIDI

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.719 
um you know I did a little bit of MIDI
mapping<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.330> mapped<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.170> faders<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> couple

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
mapping I mapped the faders to a couple

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.880 
mapping I mapped the faders to a couple
mics<00:02:08.970> inside<00:02:09.330> FL<00:02:09.720> Studio<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.320> I<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.560> control

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
mics inside FL Studio so I can control

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.010 
mics inside FL Studio so I can control
some<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> mixer<00:02:11.580> settings<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.810> really

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
some of the mixer settings so it really

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.650 
some of the mixer settings so it really
eliminated<00:02:13.980> my<00:02:14.160> other<00:02:14.370> need<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.819> have<00:02:15.030> some

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
eliminated my other need to have some

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.600 
eliminated my other need to have some
other<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.500> know<00:02:16.530> controller<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.220> normally

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
other you know controller like normally

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.210 
other you know controller like normally
I<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.209> Nano<00:02:19.110> control<00:02:19.590> set<00:02:19.830> up<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.070> do

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
I have the Nano control set up to do

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.800 
I have the Nano control set up to do
that<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> got<00:02:20.820> rid<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.150> Nano<00:02:21.330> control

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
that so I got rid of the Nano control

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.350 
that so I got rid of the Nano control
and<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.380> can<00:02:22.530> use<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.920> my<00:02:23.070> DD<00:02:23.370> JSX<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.239> use

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
and I can use just my DD JSX and use

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.949 
and I can use just my DD JSX and use
that<00:02:24.540> USB<00:02:25.080> input<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:25.830> something<00:02:26.130> else<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.720> it

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
that USB input for something else and it

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.210 
that USB input for something else and it
really<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.380> freed<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.800> little<00:02:28.950> bit<00:02:29.130> of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
really just freed up a little bit of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.509 
really just freed up a little bit of
space<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.640> couple<00:02:29.790> options<00:02:31.280> another<00:02:32.280> thing

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
space and a couple options another thing

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.030 
space and a couple options another thing
that<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.700> was<00:02:32.880> disappointed<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.600> was<00:02:34.040> recording

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that I was disappointed in was recording

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.300 
that I was disappointed in was recording
audio<00:02:35.519> from<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.420> DD<00:02:36.690> JSX<00:02:37.290> into<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.830> computer

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
audio from the DD JSX into the computer

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.620 
audio from the DD JSX into the computer
I<00:02:38.340> really<00:02:38.580> thought<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.880> would<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.120> better<00:02:39.330> but

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
I really thought it would be better but

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.930 
I really thought it would be better but
again<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.650> know<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.220> could<00:02:41.459> be<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.670> user

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
again you know this could be a user

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.790 
again you know this could be a user
error<00:02:42.180> my<00:02:42.630> hand<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.200> will<00:02:43.380> try<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.650> again

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
error my hand and I will try it again

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.680 
error my hand and I will try it again
and<00:02:44.130> maybe<00:02:44.220> post<00:02:44.519> another<00:02:44.730> video<00:02:44.940> doing<00:02:45.540> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
and maybe post another video doing it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.449 
and maybe post another video doing it
but<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> really<00:02:46.500> had<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> hard<00:02:46.860> time<00:02:46.890> getting<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
but I really had a hard time getting the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.550 
but I really had a hard time getting the
audio<00:02:47.730> into<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> computer<00:02:49.049> through<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.290> DD

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
audio into the computer through the DD

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.830 
audio into the computer through the DD
jack<00:02:49.799> JSX<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:50.820> know<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.090> came<00:02:51.239> off<00:02:51.450> kind<00:02:51.480> of

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
jack JSX you know it came off kind of

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.090 
jack JSX you know it came off kind of
muddy<00:02:52.049> digital<00:02:52.829> glitchy<00:02:53.280> um<00:02:54.320> but<00:02:55.320> again<00:02:55.560> it

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
muddy digital glitchy um but again it

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.590 
muddy digital glitchy um but again it
was<00:02:56.190> probably<00:02:56.489> one<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.670> my<00:02:56.820> computer<00:02:57.390> settings

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
was probably one of my computer settings

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.030 
was probably one of my computer settings
because<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.049> was<00:02:58.200> having<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.560> lot<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.769> problems

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
because I was having a lot of problems

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.940 
because I was having a lot of problems
with<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.640> arm<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:01.410> know<00:03:01.500> trying<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.829> get

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
with the arm you know trying to get

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.620 
with the arm you know trying to get
things<00:03:02.190> recorded<00:03:02.519> in<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.970> day<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.269> we're

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
things recorded in that day so we're

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.140 
things recorded in that day so we're
most<00:03:04.110> likely<00:03:04.440> my<00:03:04.590> ignorance<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:05.280> that's

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
most likely my ignorance but that's

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.430 
most likely my ignorance but that's
something<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.660> want<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.959> mention<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.290> maybe

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
something that I want to mention I maybe

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.840 
something that I want to mention I maybe
I'll<00:03:07.620> explore<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.100> little<00:03:08.250> bit<00:03:08.400> later

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
I'll explore it a little bit later

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.330 
I'll explore it a little bit later
I<00:03:08.880> do<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.630> an<00:03:09.780> audio<00:03:10.320> interface<00:03:10.680> which<00:03:11.160> I'm

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
I do have an audio interface which I'm

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.500 
I do have an audio interface which I'm
actually<00:03:11.459> using<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.940> record<00:03:12.299> this<00:03:12.450> tutorial

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
actually using to record this tutorial

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.160 
actually using to record this tutorial
right<00:03:13.170> now<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.700> primarily<00:03:15.090> use<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.989> for

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
right now so I primarily use that for

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.850 
right now so I primarily use that for
audio<00:03:16.760> but<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:18.450> know<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.690> DD<00:03:18.959> jxx<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.620> wanted

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
audio but you know the DD jxx I wanted

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.560 
audio but you know the DD jxx I wanted
to<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.160> see<00:03:20.310> if<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.519> can<00:03:20.549> do<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.329> I<00:03:21.360> think

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
to just see if I can do it so I think

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.240 
to just see if I can do it so I think
there's<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.989> way<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.170> do<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.799> think<00:03:22.860> my

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
there's a way to do it but I think my

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.160 
there's a way to do it but I think my
computer<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:23.940> not<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.540> good<00:03:24.810> for<00:03:25.049> that

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
computer is just not that good for that

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.289 
computer is just not that good for that
I'm<00:03:25.380> running<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.709> lot<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:26.070> mini<00:03:26.220> software<00:03:26.790> I've

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
I'm running a lot of mini software I've

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.690 
I'm running a lot of mini software I've
got<00:03:27.540> keyboard<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.170> got<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.440> ddgs<00:03:28.950> X<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.400> got<00:03:29.579> the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
got keyboard I got the ddgs X I got the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.449 
got keyboard I got the ddgs X I got the
m-audio<00:03:30.030> interface<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.680> had<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.160> Nano

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
m-audio interface and I had the Nano

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.120 
m-audio interface and I had the Nano

controllers you're going to have

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.979 
controllers you're going to have
problems<00:03:40.799> but<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.549> know<00:03:41.670> if<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.690> pull<00:03:42.870> it

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
problems but you know if you can pull it

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.050 
problems but you know if you can pull it
off<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.410> makes<00:03:43.650> for<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.250> really<00:03:44.310> sweet<00:03:44.700> setup

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
off it makes for a really sweet setup

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.960 
off it makes for a really sweet setup
and<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:46.350> makes<00:03:46.590> making<00:03:46.950> music<00:03:47.250> easy<00:03:47.430> can<00:03:47.850> do

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
and it makes making music easy can do

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.430 
and it makes making music easy can do
everything<00:03:48.239> in<00:03:48.480> real<00:03:48.630> time<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.200> don't<00:03:49.350> have

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
everything in real time you don't have

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.990 
everything in real time you don't have
to<00:03:49.560> stop<00:03:49.799> think<00:03:50.100> about<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.640> take<00:03:50.850> your

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
to stop think about it you take your

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.970 
to stop think about it you take your
hands<00:03:51.269> off<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.540> mic<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.080> you<00:03:52.319> just<00:03:52.800> get<00:03:52.950> a

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
hands off the mic and you just get a
