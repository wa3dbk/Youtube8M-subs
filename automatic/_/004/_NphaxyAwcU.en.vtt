00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.599
 hi all at all levels rather high they surely have that chanel 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.199
 today we will see together again 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.500
 an article called activating the features and multi-sites of 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.060
 mortal 3 0 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.699
 this network mode a few rounds previous the state TV in 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.660
 preparation 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.520
 energy for press 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.980
 she did not have the right to video podcasts and if over the comments there 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.250
 was planned so 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 that I make you a little bit of a break today we must understand 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.110
 stanley fight now the portraitists 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.440
 a network of sites with press that starts 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.370
 a first order 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.809
 through 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.230
 the wpt file and confides that for the tfc 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.830
 so copied glued this light 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.100
 cover an ftp client 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.400
 so the agent that is transmitted under mac os also hopes to keep the focus on 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.950
 mac 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.720
 and I pc I also believe 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.240
 and of course the traditional festival 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.260
 so here I am at the root of good 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.320
 this test site 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.240
 I also notice it at 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.150
 wpp 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.210
 it was complicated for the psg 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.300
 so says that this one 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.270
 a record is booming lower related costs 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.380
 of the animal 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 iphone or oil in mexico 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.620
 checked under command s gets out in the file 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.980
 the wind has turned 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.640
 his other test site 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.100
 so I admitted that I was connected to my administration 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.070
 I am updating the site 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.070
 alas I'm going to have for the same purpose 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.750
 the news was she's called reason 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.710
 past the line 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.470
 who is democrat and who appears on a day which allows to activate the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.750
 functionality 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.160
 indeed apart - you're going to set up the network could not come back 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.720
 easily at the back there will be no knives back to fashion our 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.970
 networks for press 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.399
 that's why this function is relatively 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.210
 hidden 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.259
 neophytes 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.969
 so there in doubt said that the steps the place first 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.900
 is 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.599
 to create a folder blocks to say it 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.649
 which will be in your file wp contact 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.039
 so it's very simple 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.239
 return to the file 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.239
 in the folder a year all the constraints on celebrating 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.879
 you create a folder 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.369
 people11 to say it 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.710
 j stockholm the different sites 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.710
 on the other side of the other press 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:47.329
 then add the following lines to the entrusted wpt so we will still return 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.159
 in the decayed wpt 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.269
 below the coast above the line it's all the time it's because 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.529
 that came from my blog 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.869
 so you follow the site 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:01.239
 it displays the window dulull been complicated 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.430
 and there you go 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.870
 it's all the touch step by step what's going on over it 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.769
 kohler 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.119
 4 bows 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:13.089
 we can define it 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.089
 the locations of the network sites 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.879
 return again 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:19.929
 sure 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:22.709
 the network creation wizard 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.709
 one last thing to do is copy paste 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.259
 line 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:32.629
 in the file hp access retrour press so report to turn in loop 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.589
 on the TVs 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.249
 we go back to phase 5 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.689
 who are there the dead flaw braids 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.339
 he admits to the posted that starts with a point 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:42.539
 buy access 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:43.880
 if does not show up 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.429
 it's a hidden file 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:47.219
 so you have to display them 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.900
 in my case it is about 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.709
 the mask is here 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.709
 so the new president of the cei show the hidden files 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.939
 enough to make you proud 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.719
 you just need flowers 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.479
 will control or dry at all elite to replace all that 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.239
 in my case elsewhere casino the pmu fr given that 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.839
 the site is already there 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:10.829
 properly configured 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.269
 close the window 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.219
 resuming the browser 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.180
 the community here 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.180
 to reset everything we will do to connect 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:26.249
 you are new contracts but still press 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:27.949
 at first sight what changes 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.949
 well when we notice the appearance of a super fast bubble 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.099
 beautiful in the dashboard 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.069
 so be careful in the place so that his own impotence a few days 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.840
 the city it is possible that the case some visual changes are 

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:44.659
 brought by this underground world 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.339
 anyway whatever it may be during the functions that are the 

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:48.039
 same 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.009
 to know 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.460
 she occupies himself 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.430
 I like to create the chain 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.490
 for the user 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.870
 and your sites 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.830
 the list of sites 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.029
 as we could directly administered 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:03.449
 and so it will come back 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:04.280
 the same 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.759
 than the left bar 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.499
 we do not know what's going on 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:11.139
 so at the federal council beware of that miss if you are what site or 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:11.949
 manage 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.099
 happy to make mistakes 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.430
 the user 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.719
 so to create 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.000
 new users 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.879
 the chain 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.029
 the theme 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:26.689
 the theme so that will allow you to ski here you will be able to say if yes or 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.800
 no such or such theme is available 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.949
 for the different sites of the network 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.949
 and go flyers dad goes on show 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.680
 a voltage module 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.770
 so the options very interesting to manage your network 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.610
 with for example 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.610
 limitation of file types 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.110
 the end of the work 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.020
 the master playing the piano 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.199
 when you want to apply automatic updates to the entire 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:05:59.879
 network 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.119
 the fund would have nothing to do sit-ins and three days alone 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:07.139
 what it is it can be useful in the extent could for example end to 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.389
 35 years a hundred sites 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:10.389
 that turn 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.860
 only the station debourg press 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.939
 another thing advance the name of super league 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:17.969
 the version for person 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:20.289
 the network the network for cause 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.289
 it is that two Cameroonians for extensions 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.169
 all in it the potential of bad is precisely advanced and 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.469
 extensions on the entire network 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:32.569
 so no impact on his note 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:33.960
 on them 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.690
 the brand new site we do not know anymore that he is on the 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.809
 network 

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:41.109
 so for me understood that their calls would only have to change once 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:43.619
 the options 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:45.659
 or then site by site 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.590
 like anyway you can turn it on 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.189
 in this tale 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.409
 be careful also its employees are networked 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.899
 if it's not the case then you need to do this enabled 

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:59.339
 for each of your sites through the site 

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:01.360
 so you'll understand the network 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.069
 has many advantages 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:05.949
 I grant you activated from three or four sites 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:08.759
 sometimes if it's not really useful 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:12.669
 - also ask the cards there are specificities it offers 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:13.939
 network 

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:16.219
 this experience you will progress 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:17.569
 others 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:18.949
 she does not have a pot 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:19.610
 they can 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.360
 a professional edition 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.690
 the year that begins 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.550
 in strength
