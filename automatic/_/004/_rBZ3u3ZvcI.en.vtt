00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.910
 anchovies spicy green olives and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.900
 tomato or lined oven plate 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.330
 with baking paper at this point 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:34.079

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:50.789
 of oven as you see they got up to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:55.670
 this point we put in each a 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.670
 teaspoon of tomato pulp 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:07.310
 now we add the mozzarella 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.479
 trying to squeeze a little bit 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:15.439
 crush it a little bit inside the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.439
 tomato and we do it all those 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.230

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:38.030
 with the anchovy we take a half fillet 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:45.330

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:03.090
