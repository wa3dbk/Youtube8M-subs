00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.510
Whatoplay presents the Top 10 PS Vita games
of 2015 So Far.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.029
Our ranking is not a personal opinion.

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.070
It's based on a 1 to 10 score that aggregates
gamers and critics' reviews into a unique

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.830
score called playscore.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.360
10th on the ranking is Kick &amp; Fennick.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.020
This Vita-exclusive is a new take on classic
puzzle platformers.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.800
Instead of jumping around, you use a gun to
launch yourself across obstacles.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.620
Forget the story, this game is all about the
gameplay.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.000
It starts a bit slowly.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.989
The fun begins halfway through it.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.280
I found the puzzle very creative.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.829
And its 3D graphics on the Vita is a breath
of fresh air.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.680
Kick &amp; Fennick has a playscore of 8.1.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.950
Ranked number 9 is Hyperdevotion Noire: Goddess
Black Heart.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.379
Noire is a spin-off of the popular Neptunia
franchise.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.650
It's the first to star a new protagonist and
is the first strategy-RPG of the series.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.440
The character designs are very detailed but
the environment lacks a lil bit of that oomph

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.440
factor.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.290
Combat is good, I just hope there was more
variety to it.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.670
But overall, Noire has kept the same energy
that is loved and adored of Neptunia games.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.650
It holds a playscore of 8.2.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.200
Eight is La-Mulana Ex.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.640
This is a remake of a 2D platformer released
in 2005, serving as a throwback to the 80s

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.220
Castlevania games.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.869
It follows the adventures of Lemeza Kosugi
as he explores the ancient ruins guarded by

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.340
terrible creatures, puzzles and traps.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.990
It's a difficult game, also very addictive.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.490
And surviving a level is so rewarding.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.810
It may not appeal to most gamers but it sure
is a perfect fit for the Vita.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.540
A playscore of 8.4.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.509
Ranked number 7 is Oreshika: Tainted Bloodlines.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.670
This is curious Japanese RPG that centers
around a cursed clan searching for redemption.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.250
You play as the head of a family and your
mission is to avenge the death of your ancestors.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.440
Oreshika stands on a complicated RPG system
that's is equally fascinating and demanding.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.250
And I adore the fusion of anime and traditional
art style - especially during combat!

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.470
It earns a playscore of 8.4.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.630
6th is Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2:
Sisters Generation.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.519
This is a remake of the PS3 original Hyperdimension
Neptunia MK2.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.780
It comes with a new &amp; better battle system,
improved visuals and revamped music &amp; voice

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.060
acting.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.500
Sisters Generation is solid role-playing game
with charm and depth.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.700
There are of lot of things that will keep
you busy on top of following the main plot.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:11.460
There's crafting, completing side-quests to
exploring its huge number of dungeons!

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.090
A playscore of 8.6.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.709
Number 5 is OlliOlli 2: Welcome to OlliWood.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.739
This is a sequel to OlliOlli released about
a year ago.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.880
It plays - more or less - the same, except
for the addition of manual controls.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.139
You're a skateboarder on a ride to get the
highest score.

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.299
The graphics is smooth and colorful!

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.299
It's easy to pick-up.

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.430
Frustrating, at times, but when you hit that
landing or do some awesome tricks, it's so

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.579
satisfying!

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.669
It has a playscore of 8.6.

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:51.950
Fourth in the ranking is Hotline Miami 2:
Wrong Number.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.500
This is a long-awaited sequel to the top-down
shooter classic Hotline Miami.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.600
And it improves in almost every way:

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.340
It plays, control and look better.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.660
The story is much more interesting.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.120
Battles are as brutal and intense, but the
gameplay and levels are now more varied than

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.260
on the original.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.700
And much like the first game, the soundtrack
is amazing!

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.000
A playscore of 8.8.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.280
Third is Grim Fandango Remastered.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.759
More than 10 years after its release, Grim
Fandango is still one of the finest adventure

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.300
games ever made.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.450
And this remaster is a successful Vita port.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.330
Except for some updates on the graphics, this
remaster brings little changes to the core

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.830
of the game.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.560
Puzzles are just as hard.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.500
Characters and their dialogues still feel
natural and funny.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.539
It's a game that has aged well.

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:52.970
It receives a playscore of 9 out of 10.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.870
Second is Helldivers.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.979
This is an incredible shooter.

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.350
Your mission is to protect 'Super Earth' from
alien threats.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.110
Story-wise, that's about as deep as you get
and the graphics is average at best.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.050
But when it comes to gameplay, Helldivers
shines bright!

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.509
Coop is at the heart of the game and it's
so much fun to play with strangers online.

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:20.539
It's one of the most enjoyable squad shooters
I've played in a long time.

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.990
A playscore of 9.0.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.229
And Number 1 is Atelier Ayesha Plus: The Alchemist
of Dusk.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.550
This is a solid port of a PS3 original released
in 2012.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.639
It follows the adventure of alchemist Ayesha
as she journeys to find out if her sister

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.949
is really dead.

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.849
It's a great value for your buck.

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.870
It comes with most DLCs and a new hard mode
with extra boss monsters to beat!

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.080
Gathering and crafting is so much fun.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.720
And the turn-based combat is challenging!

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.060
A playscore of 9.1.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:11.289
To recap, here are the 10 highest-rated PS
Vita games of 2015 as of March 30.
