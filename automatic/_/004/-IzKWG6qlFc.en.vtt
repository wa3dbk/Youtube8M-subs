00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.450
 a finance minister more among these classics 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.599
 hides the Pocketbook 360 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.789
 that is just imagine 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.080
 I can do that 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.739
 that reveals a 5 inches there is none 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.249
 with 16 shades of gray 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.929
 No resolution of 800 by 600 pixels 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.939
 which corresponds to the resolution of a 6 inches that and then that results 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:24.759
 just 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.869
 on the 5 inch display 4 overall everything is shown a bit smaller 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.400
 is shown as a 6-inch display 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.560
 but also a bit sharper 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.380
 Nestmann relation to put 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.190
 Daum had stopped 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.440
 Sony Reader prs-505 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.630
 brought and you can see very clearly the different sizes the 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.140
 two devices in front 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.180
 what makes that also 000 show 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.630
 in particular him also that works first scarcely 5 4 although calls 80 grams 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.830
 By the way, he weighs the same amount of beer, he is 600 after I trade 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.440
 becomes 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.610
 and the pocketbook 360 ° brings 150 grams is already a big one 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.630
 Difference of only 30 grams, that's about the same as an iPhone and 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.630
 that made Rosenthal already noticeable 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.710
 with the Pocket Book 3 60 m 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.530
 m carton 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.090
 was what i found very good 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.120
 the majority 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.660
 Prof that is probably not the case 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.120
 Pound a tighten the US Fed have with them the device with the dancing computer 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.850
 Connected that 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.340
 the pocketbook can actually be expired 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.620
 So you have the alternative if you believe it puts last attach 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.980
 was in points 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.850
 synchronized on the PC and 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.840
 abroad 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 I manage devices instead, moment 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.290
 the main navigation there with this 4 Gia navigation cross here 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.190
 with percentages of Toscana meters 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.770
 in addition, I have her second lumbering shoulder buttons but 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.920
 relatively rarely used 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.920
 the composite with which very little weight percent 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.180
 Niklas Ehrhardt's Usability made it easy to use the device 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.420
 for several hours also Dr 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.009
 So the problem is one hand hold with a subsequent one 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.539
 and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.529
 can handle it well 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.459
 the army relative to the main menu 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.370
 to big also with relatively many functions 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.559
 on Tuesday 1 that's bitter 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.039
 even notes that's all at almost seven minutes in length 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.829
 Other leg news from among themselves than rss-feed will be the ones with the 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.729
 Pocketbook software can be downloaded to the device 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.729
 and then, so to speak, stay can be read on the go 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.079
 that wants the modules or w-lan capability brings the pocketbook 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.329
 actually not anymore 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.450
 that means I have to be percent like the news daily from the PC 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.139
 Poland and 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.019
 with the device are not theirs 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.779
 there but still redevelop Dictionary 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:47.619
 that I would have come to speak 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.439
 have a calendar 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.729
 and then they also advertise what for example send calculator Resta 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:54.969
 drove 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.779
 and what percent forbid 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.789
 another term for bookmarks, so to speak 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.789
 and 20 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.259

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.219
 Called Andy Kapp 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.819
 get the document is a medium font size that shows you 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.960
 easily adjust percent can also be almost 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.589
 Dr stepless 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:28.379
 In addition, one can apply the script to the appropriate know-how of the document 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.250
 to adjust 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.629
 then what happened also percent 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.010
 who wants to have sex 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.999
 or percent left are now revenges are worth 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:37.859
 Adapt Michaelis 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.709
 and then beyond that 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.919
 Dieckmann the leading a full document with English words 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.759
 if I had read or read a complex English book there now 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.059
 Book where from time to time sometimes that English occurs 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:51.369
 and some foreign language spoken better 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:55.109
 Apple's percent to the stock market works well to hear dry food 60 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.739
 I earn one buys 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.739
 to grow as a future shape 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.340
 and had already selected a little company Dictionary before 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.989
 Gmunden fell almost five percent in Aachen 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.969
 Gartemann painted husband I come on 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.019
 complete complete navigation hereby 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.680
 Tax enforcement 1 so one word per click can be said by Procap up 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.719
 Zeiler 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.919
 What we are not good substitute again if represented 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.520
 in the year the program 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.000
 that never brings 600 again and and learn just as a function 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.290
 which allows right when frolicking something that works in principle as well 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.949
 Do not ask any further questions 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.319
 I'm going out again 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.389
 click next we see 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.229
 to scroll is noticeably faster than the Sony again 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.270
 from the hand as the old to never again the prs-600 percent singing club 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.270
 Level with the British 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.879
 I'll tell you what the 360 ​​has a pocketbook 360 different varieties 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.879
 The device is responsible for this 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.759
 as shown here to offer text displayed 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.819
 Call Rapids 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.789
 Actors broad, so to speak 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.280
 and percent what the navigation he is displaying open is that I stay 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.660
 Contex in principle Nobili can get displayed in the direction of a and percent that 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.960
 Device then, so to speak 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.939
 with the left hand 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:35.759
 can serve 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.249
 in six percent even let ads 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.229
 I've seen it all with percent in the menu made this menu item 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.760
 Percent though it's one with a so-called the sensor 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.470
 in the on-board program 60 gives 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.700
 who actually has the text against people automatically but only sporadically 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.580
 and never works as well as today 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.120
 So the function is not mature yet 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.610
 He did not say that, but he drove the point 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.659
 there and with one two two clicks percent can align with a text like 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:07.889
 I need him 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.909
 okay Pocketbook confuses much of my mistakes 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.009
 No easy-to-use device records and usage even more 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:15.710
 a bit more 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.760
 costing 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.220
 250 euros will be reduced 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.190
 October are to be had without professional sales in 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.460
 Germany 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.650
 that is the device 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.409
 Percent gives that far over the world 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.409
 mainly with a Russian one billion 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:34.509
 with the Russian men Russian packaging also us there 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.509
 to the German unit as a pdf file 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.790
 I would be happy if the pocketbook is also a bit bigger 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.599
 Dissemination takes place 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:48.619
 we really have in Germany percent also in the process at bare 5 inches 

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:52.009
 Readers could get as a big choice could come 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.849
 embarrassing to find such a 5 inch June that already 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.690
 yes, another target group also appeals to suddenly 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.659
 enable more mobility 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:04.309
 compared to 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:07.439
 Bruni again, for example, can make such a 6 inch Sony Reader 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.460
 So with running back to bigger 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.409
 Dr 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:14.629
 Zones as I said before I know the fifth pole of the St 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:18.509
 why did it miss Hungary's Caputher See? 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.949
 Pocketbook so the name says it already 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:23.949
 I also wake up Yusen bag what Professor Becker 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:27.960
 to have to always have it with you 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.360
 who is there too I wish him to be this 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.370
 Any devices spread quickly and that too is actually open in 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.589
 Germany 

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:37.580
 to be available will be on a larger scale
