response a free air frequency response

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.569 
response a free air frequency response
around<00:03:18.049> 40<00:03:18.500> Hertz<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:19.340> we're<00:03:19.430> going<00:03:19.519> to

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
strap them right there it's got a master

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.150 
strap them right there it's got a master
slave<00:05:06.210> input<00:05:06.660> so<00:05:07.169> say<00:05:07.380> if<00:05:07.440> you<00:05:07.590> have<00:05:07.710> just<00:05:07.950> one

slave input so say if you have just one

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.980 
slave input so say if you have just one
voice<00:05:08.400> coil<00:05:08.790> but<00:05:09.060> you<00:05:09.150> want<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.360> put<00:05:09.570> two<00:05:09.810> of

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.140 
voice coil but you want to put two of
these<00:05:10.380> amplifiers<00:05:10.830> on<00:05:11.220> them<00:05:11.370> well<00:05:11.729> guess<00:05:11.940> what

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
these amplifiers on them well guess what

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.460 
these amplifiers on them well guess what
you're<00:05:12.300> all<00:05:12.419> set<00:05:12.690> because<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.110> topology

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
you're all set because the topology

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.320 
you're all set because the topology
calls<00:05:13.919> for<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.280> you<00:05:14.580> can<00:05:14.729> go<00:05:14.850> ahead<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.150> wire

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
calls for it you can go ahead and wire

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.790 
calls for it you can go ahead and wire
it<00:05:15.479> like<00:05:15.660> that<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.080> strap<00:05:16.320> your<00:05:16.470> answer<00:05:16.740> I

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
it like that and strap your answer I

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.100 
it like that and strap your answer I
also<00:05:16.979> hear<00:05:17.370> some<00:05:17.580> great<00:05:17.729> things<00:05:18.060> about<00:05:18.870> his
