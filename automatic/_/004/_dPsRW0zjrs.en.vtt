plastic really written notice and
allocate<00:02:03.649> onto<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.039> two<00:02:04.310> eyes<00:02:05.000> in

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.020 

for<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.110> last<00:02:09.289> section<00:02:09.860> here<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:10.340> did<00:02:10.729> have<00:02:10.849> to

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
for the last section here I did have to

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.199 
for the last section here I did have to
use<00:02:11.209> this<00:02:11.450> model<00:02:11.780> crowbar<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:13.370> should<00:02:13.970> imagine

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
use this model crowbar I should imagine

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.729 
use this model crowbar I should imagine
in<00:02:14.989> time<00:02:15.459> these<00:02:16.459> canvases<00:02:17.150> will<00:02:17.599> slowly<00:02:18.200> start

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
in time these canvases will slowly start

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.680 
in time these canvases will slowly start
to<00:02:18.890> stretch<00:02:19.250> making<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.879> easier<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.239> clip<00:02:20.540> on

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
to stretch making it easier to clip on

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.190 
to stretch making it easier to clip on
um<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.250> can<00:02:22.400> use<00:02:22.519> anything<00:02:22.730> really<00:02:22.910> as<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.019> said

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
um you can use anything really as I said

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.650 
um you can use anything really as I said
all<00:02:24.349> online<00:02:24.530> we<00:02:25.459> just<00:02:25.489> use<00:02:25.849> that<00:02:25.940> inside<00:02:26.420> there

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
all online we just use that inside there

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.589 
all online we just use that inside there
just<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.500> leave<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:28.010> pop<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:29.450> can

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
just to leave it to pop it on you can

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.880 
just to leave it to pop it on you can
use<00:02:29.720> anything<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:30.110> like<00:02:30.200> really<00:02:30.319> just<00:02:30.769> to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
use anything you like really just to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.800 
use anything you like really just to
leave<00:02:31.069> bring<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.430> on<00:02:31.549> I<00:02:31.849> think<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.540> sort<00:02:32.750> of

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
leave bring it on I think this sort of

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.190 
leave bring it on I think this sort of
design<00:02:33.760> things<00:02:34.760> like<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.390> needed<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:36.019> do

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
design things like this I needed to do

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.410 
design things like this I needed to do
it<00:02:36.319> it's<00:02:36.620> always<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.980> last<00:02:37.129> one<00:02:37.400> spare<00:02:38.269> for

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
it it's always the last one spare for

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.330 
it it's always the last one spare for
pain<00:02:38.629> now<00:02:39.590> it's<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.829> only<00:02:39.950> compromise

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
pain now it's the only compromise

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.300 
pain now it's the only compromise
atmosphere<00:02:40.849> essentially<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:42.310> let's

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
atmosphere essentially so let's

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.280 
atmosphere essentially so let's
summarize<00:02:47.019> it's<00:02:48.019> just<00:02:48.410> under<00:02:48.709> 27<00:02:49.519> inches<00:02:49.790> wide

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
summarize it's just under 27 inches wide

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.110 
summarize it's just under 27 inches wide
so<00:02:51.700> ideal<00:02:52.700> for<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:53.000> large<00:02:53.329> guy<00:02:54.250> perfect<00:02:55.250> white

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
so ideal for a large guy perfect white

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.270 
so ideal for a large guy perfect white

boys your 18 inches it's a foot 1/2 off
the<00:03:01.459> ground<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:06.290> for<00:03:06.530> me<00:03:07.120> measurement<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:10.269> 37

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
the ground and for me measurement is 37

it's<00:03:16.819> like<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:16.970> 6<00:03:17.299> foot<00:03:19.720> 6<00:03:20.720> foot<00:03:20.870> 5<00:03:21.519> total<00:03:23.620> there

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
it's like a 6 foot 6 foot 5 total there

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.960 
it's like a 6 foot 6 foot 5 total there
was<00:03:24.739> information<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.519> couldn't<00:03:25.819> seem<00:03:25.940> to

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
was information that I couldn't seem to

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.400 
was information that I couldn't seem to
find<00:03:26.090> online

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
find online

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.349 
find online
now<00:03:27.859> I've<00:03:28.010> measured<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.430> set<00:03:28.880> therefore<00:03:29.269> if

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
now I've measured it set therefore if

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.449 
now I've measured it set therefore if
want<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.540> see<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:30.560> exact<00:03:30.889> measurement<00:03:31.370> to

want to see the exact measurement to
this<00:03:31.900> so<00:03:32.900> let's<00:03:33.650> get<00:03:33.799> a<00:03:33.859> set<00:03:34.099> up<00:03:34.190> how<00:03:34.819> you<00:03:34.880> would

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
this so let's get a set up how you would

00:03:35.150 --> 00:04:19.319 
this so let's get a set up how you would
out<00:03:35.299> in<00:03:35.389> the<00:03:35.480> field

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329
