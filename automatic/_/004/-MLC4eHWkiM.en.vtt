the<00:00:46.260> results<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.120> we'll<00:00:48.120> probably<00:00:48.210> do

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the results and then we'll probably do

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.930 
the results and then we'll probably do
an<00:00:48.570> in-depth<00:00:48.960> review<00:00:49.430> just<00:00:50.430> show<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.640> some<00:00:50.879> of

has quite a few attachments you could

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.210 
has quite a few attachments you could
say<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> antenna<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.830> like<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.129> an

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
say as the antenna and like this is an

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.010 
say as the antenna and like this is an
RF<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> remote<00:01:06.600> control

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
RF for this like for the remote control

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.980 
RF for this like for the remote control
receiver<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> again<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.900> have

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
receiver so again this is the we have

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.539 
receiver so again this is the we have
some<00:01:10.170> other<00:01:10.430> RK<00:01:11.430> 3288<00:01:12.380> cpu<00:01:13.380> devices<00:01:13.920> whether

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
some other RK 3288 cpu devices whether

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.760 
some other RK 3288 cpu devices whether
all<00:01:14.760> TV<00:01:15.119> boxes<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> first<00:01:16.320> dongle

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
all TV boxes so this is the first dongle

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.880 
all TV boxes so this is the first dongle
device<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.689> may<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:18.990> cheaper<00:01:19.680> than<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890

a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution screen
now<00:02:34.939> this<00:02:35.090> does<00:02:35.299> have<00:02:35.510> root<00:02:35.719> access<00:02:35.900> within<00:02:36.409> us

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
now this does have root access within us

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.589 
now this does have root access within us
that<00:02:36.889> does<00:02:37.159> not<00:02:37.280> mean<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:37.519> comes<00:02:37.819> rooted<00:02:38.209> you

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
that does not mean that comes rooted you

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
looks like it's the a key they could go

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.119 
looks like it's the a key they could go
