00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that's not why I'm there I'm providing a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 
that's not why I'm there I'm providing a
service<00:01:00.440> they<00:01:01.440> don't<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> feed<00:01:02.160> me<00:01:02.309> I

service they don't have to feed me I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.920

tell<00:01:02.640> them<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> meeting<00:01:03.180> J<00:01:03.359> Brennan<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
tell them in the meeting J Brennan is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
tell them in the meeting J Brennan is
one<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> those<00:01:04.500> people<00:01:04.830> he<00:01:05.309> strongly<00:01:05.670> believes

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
one of those people he strongly believes

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.130 
one of those people he strongly believes
in<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:06.330> eating<00:01:06.600> eight<00:01:06.720> gigs<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.549> I<00:01:09.049> kind<00:01:10.049> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
in not eating eight gigs and I kind of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.940 
in not eating eight gigs and I kind of
think<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.650> both<00:01:11.310> those<00:01:12.140> extremes<00:01:13.140> are<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
think that both those extremes are a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
think that both those extremes are a
little<00:01:14.340> misguided<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> first<00:01:16.290> one

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
little misguided and in the first one

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.890 
little misguided and in the first one
for<00:01:16.920> example<00:01:17.060> yeah<00:01:18.060> well<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.570> don't<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
for example yeah well you don't want to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.899 
for example yeah well you don't want to
demand<00:01:19.229> things<00:01:19.619> at<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.860> gig<00:01:20.130> except<00:01:20.759> what<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
demand things at a gig except what you

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.100 
demand things at a gig except what you
need<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.420> your<00:01:21.570> job

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
need to do your job

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
need to do your job
unless<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.979> course<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.729> said<00:01:23.759> before

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
unless of course like I said before

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
unless of course like I said before
you're<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.780> several<00:01:25.140> hours<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you're there for several hours and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.580 
you're there for several hours and
you're<00:01:26.159> missing<00:01:26.430> meals<00:01:26.869> but<00:01:27.869> saying<00:01:28.110> no<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you're missing meals but saying no to a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
you're missing meals but saying no to a
meal<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.009> could<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.420> damaging

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
meal I think could be just as damaging

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.690 
meal I think could be just as damaging
and<00:01:31.619> I'll<00:01:32.040> explain<00:01:32.549> why<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.560> feel<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.829> that

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and I'll explain why I feel like that

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.950 
and I'll explain why I feel like that
food<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:37.670> important<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.790> means<00:01:39.030> something<00:01:39.720> if

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
food is important it means something if

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960 
food is important it means something if
you<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> little<00:01:41.009> bit<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.310> research<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.850> this

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you do a little bit of research on this

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.050 
you do a little bit of research on this
and<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.240> google<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.770> food<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.220> social

not
what<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.490> am<00:03:47.640> suggesting<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.750> maybe<00:03:49.200> if

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
what I am suggesting is that maybe if

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.590 
what I am suggesting is that maybe if
your<00:03:49.860> policy<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.610> not<00:03:50.790> eat<00:03:50.940> at<00:03:51.060> gigs<00:03:51.300> and

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
your policy is to not eat at gigs and

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.960 
your policy is to not eat at gigs and
the<00:03:52.380> client<00:03:52.709> offers<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.340> food<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.700> you

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
the client offers you food and you

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.320 
the client offers you food and you
refuse<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.770> that<00:03:55.770> might<00:03:56.070> be<00:03:56.100> rude<00:03:56.490> and<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:57.120> also

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
refuse it that might be rude and it also

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.040 
refuse it that might be rude and it also
may<00:03:58.320> be<00:03:58.380> somehow<00:03:59.010> psychologically

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
may be somehow psychologically

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.780 
may be somehow psychologically
separating<00:04:01.050> yourself<00:04:01.140> more<00:04:01.770> and<00:04:01.920> more<00:04:02.160> from

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
separating yourself more and more from

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.630 
separating yourself more and more from
the<00:04:02.820> client<00:04:03.270> and<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.480> guests<00:04:04.280> just<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.430> thought

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
the client and the guests just a thought

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.370 
the client and the guests just a thought
