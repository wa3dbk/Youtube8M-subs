awareness<00:03:05.780> drops<00:03:06.290> off<00:03:06.530> then<00:03:06.769> I<00:03:06.859> might<00:03:07.069> fall

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
awareness drops off then I might fall

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.539 
awareness drops off then I might fall
out<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.849> the<00:03:07.909> trees<00:03:08.239> so<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.689> tree<00:03:08.989> is<00:03:09.109> like<00:03:09.260> a

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
out of the trees so this tree is like a

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.830 
out of the trees so this tree is like a
facilitates<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:10.639> high<00:03:10.879> level<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.359> awareness<00:03:11.480> so

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
facilitates a high level of awareness so

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.780 
facilitates a high level of awareness so
as<00:03:12.079> he's<00:03:12.200> meditating<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:13.220> can<00:03:13.400> be<00:03:13.549> in<00:03:13.639> that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
as he's meditating it can be in that

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.949 
as he's meditating it can be in that
level<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:16.040> then<00:03:16.159> probably<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.700> nolde<00:03:17.060> almost

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
level and then probably a nolde almost

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.900 
level and then probably a nolde almost
towards<00:03:18.169> the<00:03:18.290> end<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.739> stay<00:03:19.010> where<00:03:19.250> you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
towards the end of the stay where you

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.309 
towards the end of the stay where you
know<00:03:20.000> sing<00:03:20.269> around<00:03:20.389> the<00:03:20.510> fire<00:03:20.780> one<00:03:20.989> night<00:03:21.199> we

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
know sing around the fire one night we

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.619 
know sing around the fire one night we
just<00:03:21.470> finished<00:03:21.859> eating<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.489> there's<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.269> group

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
just finished eating and there's a group

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.920 
just finished eating and there's a group
of<00:03:23.750> us<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.260> he<00:03:24.590> started<00:03:24.889> sharing<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:25.459> story

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
of us and he started sharing this story

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.899 
of us and he started sharing this story
about<00:03:26.930> this<00:03:27.169> journey<00:03:27.470> we<00:03:27.680> take<00:03:27.980> as<00:03:28.250> human

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
about this journey we take as human

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.789 
about this journey we take as human
being<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.389> actually<00:03:29.690> our<00:03:29.780> souls<00:03:30.169> in<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.560> sense

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
being is actually our souls in a sense

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.009 
being is actually our souls in a sense
and<00:03:31.099> it's<00:03:31.849> this<00:03:32.060> journey<00:03:32.329> we<00:03:32.510> take<00:03:32.810> that

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
and it's this journey we take that

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.860 
and it's this journey we take that
consists<00:03:33.859> of<00:03:34.010> traveling<00:03:34.669> across<00:03:35.090> seven

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
consists of traveling across seven

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.099 
consists of traveling across seven
planets<00:03:36.379> and<00:03:36.620> earth<00:03:37.609> being<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.239> first<00:03:38.599> planet

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
planets and earth being the first planet

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.680 
planets and earth being the first planet
and<00:03:39.349> then<00:03:40.220> so<00:03:40.430> as<00:03:40.579> we're<00:03:40.819> on<00:03:40.970> earth<00:03:41.209> we<00:03:41.510> go

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
and then so as we're on earth we go

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.330 
and then so as we're on earth we go
through<00:03:41.930> our<00:03:42.019> spiritual<00:03:42.620> journey<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.979> as<00:03:43.159> our

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
through our spiritual journey and as our

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.129 
through our spiritual journey and as our
soul<00:03:43.699> evolved<00:03:44.239> as<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.479> consciousness

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
soul evolved as the consciousness

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.740 
soul evolved as the consciousness
expands<00:03:45.889> when<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.579> expands<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.419> certain

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
expands when it expands to a certain

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.589 
expands when it expands to a certain
level<00:03:47.870> we<00:03:48.079> go<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.650> next<00:03:48.889> planet<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.790> then

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
level we go to the next planet and then

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.210 
level we go to the next planet and then
you<00:03:50.720> go<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.229> next<00:03:51.470> planet<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:51.799> continue

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
you go to the next planet you continue

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.280 
you go to the next planet you continue
this<00:03:52.340> expansion<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.449> then<00:03:53.690> finally<00:03:54.139> you<00:03:54.260> end

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
this expansion and then finally you end

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.099 
this expansion and then finally you end
up<00:03:54.650> on<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:55.069> largest<00:03:55.519> planet<00:03:55.940> in<00:03:56.150> universe<00:03:56.780> and

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
up on the largest planet in universe and

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.830 
up on the largest planet in universe and
on<00:03:57.739> this<00:03:58.129> planet<00:03:58.699> is<00:03:58.849> the<00:03:58.879> largest<00:03:59.389> mountain

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
on this planet is the largest mountain

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.949 
on this planet is the largest mountain
in<00:04:00.229> the<00:04:00.319> universe

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
in the universe

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.630 
in the universe
and<00:04:01.379> as<00:04:01.530> soon<00:04:01.709> as<00:04:01.830> he<00:04:01.920> said<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.400> largest

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
and as soon as he said the largest

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.449 
and as soon as he said the largest
mountain<00:04:03.180> universe<00:04:03.780> was<00:04:04.590> like<00:04:04.769> Chaves

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
mountain universe was like Chaves

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.089 
mountain universe was like Chaves
transported<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:06.569> was<00:04:06.720> standing<00:04:07.440> on<00:04:07.530> the

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
transported and I was standing on the

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.850 
transported and I was standing on the
side<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.150> mountain<00:04:09.440> when<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.470> first

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
side of this mountain when I first

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.900 
side of this mountain when I first
looked<00:04:11.099> around<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.430> kind<00:04:11.580> of<00:04:11.610> got<00:04:11.760> my

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
looked around and kind of got my

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.190 
looked around and kind of got my
bearings<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:12.480> seemed<00:04:12.660> like<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.870> was<00:04:12.989> about

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
bearings it seemed like I was about

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.559 
bearings it seemed like I was about
halfway<00:04:13.500> up<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.489> yet<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.970> mountain<00:04:15.269> was<00:04:15.360> so

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
halfway up and yet this mountain was so

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.990 
halfway up and yet this mountain was so
high<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:15.989> was<00:04:16.380> so<00:04:16.650> high<00:04:16.949> up<00:04:17.190> in<00:04:17.340> elevation<00:04:17.579> that

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
high I was so high up in elevation that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.030 
high I was so high up in elevation that
I<00:04:18.180> was<00:04:18.389> could<00:04:18.780> actually<00:04:18.900> see<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.620> planet

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
I was could actually see the planet

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.860 
I was could actually see the planet
rotating<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.669> space<00:04:21.060> like<00:04:21.299> I<00:04:21.479> was<00:04:21.600> in<00:04:21.720> low

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
rotating in space like I was in low

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.590 
rotating in space like I was in low
orbit<00:04:22.139> and<00:04:22.919> this<00:04:23.040> planet<00:04:23.400> was<00:04:23.520> pure<00:04:23.940> white<00:04:24.270> and

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
orbit and this planet was pure white and

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.510 
orbit and this planet was pure white and
it<00:04:24.690> was<00:04:24.720> vibrating<00:04:25.350> with<00:04:25.590> such<00:04:25.919> intensity

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
it was vibrating with such intensity

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.490 
it was vibrating with such intensity
that<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:27.150> know<00:04:27.240> chunks<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.900> planet<00:04:28.410> were

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
that you know chunks of the planet were

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.490 
that you know chunks of the planet were
flying<00:04:28.919> off<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.370> into<00:04:29.580> space<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.690> was<00:04:30.870> could

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
flying off it into space and I was could

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.680 
flying off it into space and I was could
sense<00:04:31.919> it<00:04:32.130> feel<00:04:32.520> it<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:32.699> I<00:04:32.820> was<00:04:32.970> on<00:04:33.090> this

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
sense it feel it and I was on this

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.900 
sense it feel it and I was on this
mountain<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.650> know<00:04:34.740> rotating<00:04:35.490> in<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.700> sense

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
mountain you know rotating in a sense

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.270 
mountain you know rotating in a sense
watching<00:04:36.389> and<00:04:36.510> rotating<00:04:36.870> space<00:04:37.139> and<00:04:37.470> then<00:04:38.100> I

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
watching and rotating space and then I

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.360 
watching and rotating space and then I
was<00:04:38.790> back<00:04:38.940> at<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.180> fire<00:04:39.419> again<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:40.340> when<00:04:41.340> I

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
was back at the fire again and when I

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.610 
was back at the fire again and when I
had<00:04:41.580> this<00:04:41.700> experience<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:42.570> was<00:04:42.750> like<00:04:42.960> I'd<00:04:43.169> you

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
had this experience it was like I'd you

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.400 
had this experience it was like I'd you
know<00:04:43.680> had<00:04:44.100> my<00:04:44.600> traveled<00:04:45.600> in<00:04:45.810> sense<00:04:46.080> like<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:46.229> had

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
know had my traveled in sense like I had

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.110 
know had my traveled in sense like I had
an<00:04:46.530> out-of-body<00:04:46.740> experience<00:04:47.070> that's<00:04:47.700> a<00:04:47.820> real

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
an out-of-body experience that's a real

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
externally it was an internal expansion

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.360 
externally it was an internal expansion
and<00:05:47.360> then<00:05:48.360> how<00:05:48.720> my<00:05:48.960> body<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:49.680> how<00:05:49.800> my<00:05:49.950> brain

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.180 
and then how my body and how my brain
interpreted<00:05:51.330> this<00:05:51.510> experience<00:05:52.289> is<00:05:52.440> deep

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
interpreted this experience is deep

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
shift this deep internal shift was it

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.339 
shift this deep internal shift was it
created<00:05:56.190> as<00:05:56.460> visual<00:05:57.060> because<00:05:57.840> he<00:05:57.960> was<00:05:58.080> sharing

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.810 
created as visual because he was sharing
that<00:05:58.380> story<00:05:58.560> that's<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.039> visual<00:05:59.340> it<00:05:59.669> was

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
that story that's the visual it was

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.350 
that story that's the visual it was
matching<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.990> try<00:06:01.260> and<00:06:01.580> you<00:06:02.580> know<00:06:02.639> simulate

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
matching to try and you know simulate

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.920 
matching to try and you know simulate
what<00:06:03.570> it<00:06:03.660> was<00:06:03.810> I<00:06:03.930> was<00:06:04.020> experiencing

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
what it was I was experiencing

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.700 
what it was I was experiencing
so<00:06:05.320> I<00:06:05.350> had<00:06:05.470> this<00:06:05.530> profound<00:06:06.310> spiritual<00:06:07.240> shift

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
so I had this profound spiritual shift

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.100 
so I had this profound spiritual shift
when<00:06:08.710> I<00:06:08.800> was<00:06:08.949> in<00:06:09.070> India<00:06:09.490> that<00:06:09.669> really<00:06:10.210> has

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
when I was in India that really has

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.140 
when I was in India that really has
grounded<00:06:11.710> me<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:12.009> rest<00:06:12.250> of<00:06:12.400> my<00:06:12.460> life<00:06:12.610> since

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
grounded me the rest of my life since

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.300 
grounded me the rest of my life since
then<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:13.930> even<00:06:14.169> though<00:06:14.229> I've<00:06:14.350> been<00:06:14.380> had

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
then and even though I've been had

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.520 
then and even though I've been had
episodes<00:06:15.850> with<00:06:16.060> the<00:06:16.120> ego<00:06:16.539> since<00:06:17.199> then<00:06:17.350> also

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
episodes with the ego since then also

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.840 
episodes with the ego since then also
because<00:06:17.830> I've<00:06:18.009> been<00:06:18.160> through<00:06:18.370> this<00:06:18.460> divorce

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
because I've been through this divorce

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.480 
because I've been through this divorce
but<00:06:19.630> it<00:06:19.750> really<00:06:19.990> was<00:06:20.139> such<00:06:20.350> a<00:06:20.380> profound<00:06:20.889> shift

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
but it really was such a profound shift

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.120 
but it really was such a profound shift
and<00:06:22.449> a<00:06:22.570> profound<00:06:23.169> shift<00:06:23.440> at<00:06:23.650> the<00:06:23.680> deepest

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
and a profound shift at the deepest

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.310 
and a profound shift at the deepest
level<00:06:24.550> of<00:06:24.610> who<00:06:24.699> I<00:06:24.759> was<00:06:25.030> that<00:06:25.600> that<00:06:25.780> is<00:06:25.960> still
