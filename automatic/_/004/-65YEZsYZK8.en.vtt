competition in the voice squad and they
sort<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.730> think<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.000> quite<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> bit

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
sort of think that quite a bit

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.290 
sort of think that quite a bit
being<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> first<00:01:10.920> girls<00:01:11.460> rowing<00:01:11.940> spotter<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
being the first girls rowing spotter it

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.030 
being the first girls rowing spotter it
shows<00:01:12.510> me<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.140> kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.800> made<00:01:13.920> them

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
shows me I think it's kind of made them

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.950 
shows me I think it's kind of made them
sort<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.490> alphabet<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.270> realize<00:01:15.930> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
sort of like alphabet and realize that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.750 
sort of like alphabet and realize that
girls<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.680> too<00:01:16.830> well<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> think<00:01:17.460> in

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
girls can do it too well I think in

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.190 
girls can do it too well I think in
terms<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.120> numbers<00:01:18.540> looking<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.050> Boat

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
terms of numbers looking at the Boat

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.980 
terms of numbers looking at the Boat

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
years ago the bow pipe had to a train

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.240 
years ago the bow pipe had to a train
out<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.660> fifth<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:24.990> sixth<00:01:25.260> form<00:01:25.470> at<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
out of the fifth and sixth form at the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.890 
out of the fifth and sixth form at the
moment<00:01:26.280> we've<00:01:26.640> got<00:01:26.670> five<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.240> half<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
moment we've got five and a half and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.200 
moment we've got five and a half and
next<00:01:28.200> year<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.470> should<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.770> six<00:01:29.070> there's<00:01:29.790> not

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
next year we should have six there's not

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.330 
next year we should have six there's not
as<00:01:30.330> many<00:01:30.480> girls<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.170> are<00:01:31.260> boys<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.800> think

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
as many girls as there are boys I think

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.100
