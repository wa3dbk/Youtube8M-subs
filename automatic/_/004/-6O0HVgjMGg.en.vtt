00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.529
 after two years of tasting that more 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.210
 is of opinion about our selections did 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.830
 offered a beer that fit the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.189
 end of the community from these 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.960
 criteria 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.670
 our community wants a beer 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.290
 well hopped one of the last 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.330
 tasting is noted by our members 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.890
 were galibier so we are 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.990
 closer to the highest brewery 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.619
 craft of France to find the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.480
 good recipe 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.859
 a little news or an American war 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.230
 what is a good 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.460
 American it's a dry beer at this 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.210
 mark is at the level of yeast 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 we use neutral yeasts we use 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.160
 two blondes either it's clear and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.540
 a lot of hops a war 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.420
 American is something very 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.649
 marked in iv him very marked at the level 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.180
 aromatic high level in what 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.640
 regards the color for this beer on 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.360
 chose to work on a basis of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.270
 pils also used a little bit of 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.860
 peeled and we also worked with 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.840
 coffee malt we see the right color 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.520
 orange so in terms of alcohol it's a 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.670
 beer that will be if these lines in alcohol 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.189
 and 45 who pay in bitterness whatever 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 something a little sweet potato but are too 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.189
 so with a little foam in that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.159
 hops we chose to 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.450
 work with three types of bolts 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.540
 preponderant therefore to know that we have but 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.990
 reason the warrior in laye topping the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.000
 site rah and andrei opine will quote with a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.650
 small mosaic addition 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.259
 so with regard to the bitterness the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.909
 warrior is a bitterness pump have 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.939
 something that has a pretty good return 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.470
 exceptional site rah we chose to 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.000
 add it in laye topping all 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.579
 just because it's also a 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.350
 aromatic combe and its hood according to 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.140
 that they really use very well at 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.090
 hot as cold and we also 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.530
 used this same hops the site rah 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.830
 andrei at ping or his side really very 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.290
 increased mango 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.200
 in addition to a mosaic that will 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.050
 bring a little fruity intruder stain 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.250
 which mixes tropical which means we 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.060
 to do an hour the time it's 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.590
 that it's a war that's going to be 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.940
 available one week only after 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.740
 to have been bottled is a beer 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.680
 which is going to be really grassy coniferous 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.240
 really focused on the good fees but this 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.900
 same beer taste two three months 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.090
 after will develop fruity tastes on 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.880
 herbaceous side will fall and the money and goes 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.220
 to develop to nest galibier one is 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.740
 young one exists since 2010 on started 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.000
 fifth year of existence 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.950
 after we are passionate kills not makes 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.410
 even the beer we love the factory and we 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.990
 do not feel me touch it and we're going 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.580
 search for the best materials 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.890
 four corners of the globe if it is necessary but 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.980
 without stopping we will success we will try to 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.780
 find the right products that 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.280
 We also matches that ended 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.740
 uses the glacier sounds 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.350
 booster she is untreated gone 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.990
 beat of great purity and we are the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.880
 has been drinking since we are kids tap tpa 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.269
 his fight is not too bad 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.220
 it's happiness so we're going to bring down 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.590
 our malta in the water first step 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.420
 to extract the sugars we will do 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.700
 cook it will gradually be next 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.440
 once boiling added that 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.450
 google for conservation behind 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.470
 so this double is then cold tell to 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.750
 send it to the fermentation tanks 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.480
 in what we will add the yeast 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.260
 because the brewer does the minent the 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.040
 yeast makes war is there we expect it 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.689
 So it's the hard work 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.180
 emma was going on roughly four weeks 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.329
 of Picardy fermentation before 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.159
 could consider filtering and therefore 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.480
 public conditioners to a water well 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.129
 this well in the recipe was 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.170
 developed aside from the community 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.150
 will be present in the selections of the 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.859
 month of May and to allow for 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.569
 share this little moss with his friends 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.340
 it will also be available in low 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.200
 it's now up to our members to 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.909
 decide in which cities will put 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.010
 this blonde's drums well double 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.310
 in the recipe was developed by 10000 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.310
