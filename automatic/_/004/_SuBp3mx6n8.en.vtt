part<00:02:38.129> attached<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> ball<00:02:39.150> joint<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:40.379> we're

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
part attached to the ball joint so we're

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:57.129 
part attached to the ball joint so we're
going<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.620> try<00:02:40.799> this<00:02:41.060> hopefully<00:02:42.060> it'll<00:02:42.180> work

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:02.229 

that's<00:02:58.139> our<00:02:58.290> ball<00:02:58.410> joint<00:02:58.440> F<00:02:59.810> isn't<00:03:00.810> too<00:03:01.019> hard

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
that's our ball joint F isn't too hard

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.580 
that's our ball joint F isn't too hard
now<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.299> most<00:03:03.510> important<00:03:03.930> thing<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.139> check<00:03:04.290> is

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
now the most important thing to check is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.460 
now the most important thing to check is
that<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.609> inner<00:03:06.269> diameter<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.049> same<00:03:07.079> on

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
that this inner diameter is the same on

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.259 
that this inner diameter is the same on
your<00:03:07.590> new<00:03:07.680> one<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:11.609> have<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.910> surface

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
your new one so now have this surface

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.420 
your new one so now have this surface
clean<00:03:12.480> -<00:03:12.660> if<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.680> very<00:03:13.859> raw<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.310> give

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
clean - if it's very raw so you can give

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.990 
clean - if it's very raw so you can give
them<00:03:14.579> life<00:03:15.090> sound

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.860 

we're<00:03:18.270> gonna<00:03:18.830> we're<00:03:19.830> not<00:03:19.950> just<00:03:20.160> tap<00:03:20.870> ball

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
we're gonna we're not just tap ball

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.570 
we're gonna we're not just tap ball
joints<00:03:22.140> on<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.350> back<00:03:22.500> gently<00:03:23.310> under<00:03:23.490> the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
joints on the back gently under the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:41.600 
joints on the back gently under the
hammer<00:03:36.200> let's<00:03:37.200> see<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:40.310> see<00:03:41.310> it's<00:03:41.430> fully

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
hammer let's see it's see it's fully

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.650 
hammer let's see it's see it's fully
seated<00:03:46.610> these<00:03:47.610> ball<00:03:47.910> joints<00:03:48.210> don't<00:03:48.480> have<00:03:48.600> a

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
seated these ball joints don't have a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.140 
seated these ball joints don't have a
c-clip<00:03:48.990> or<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> circle<00:03:49.610> their<00:03:50.610> designs<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
c-clip or a circle their designs the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.560 
c-clip or a circle their designs the
pressure<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.680> flange<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.450> designed<00:03:54.450> to

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
pressure of the flange is designed to

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.970 
pressure of the flange is designed to
hold<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:54.930> by<00:03:55.080> itself

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.500 

so<00:03:58.980> now<00:03:59.160> ever<00:03:59.459> lower<00:03:59.640> controller<00:04:00.000> are<00:04:00.120> back<00:04:00.330> in

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
so now ever lower controller are back in

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.680 
so now ever lower controller are back in
with<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.810> new<00:04:00.930> ball<00:04:01.110> joints<00:04:01.380> in<00:04:01.470> place<00:04:02.660> so<00:04:03.660> I

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
with the new ball joints in place so I

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.449 
with the new ball joints in place so I
can<00:04:03.870> position<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.350> in<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.070> hole<00:04:07.190> push<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.280> up

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
can position it in the hole push it up

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:24.860 
can position it in the hole push it up
and<00:04:08.610> put<00:04:08.730> on<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.940> knot<00:04:23.300> so<00:04:24.300> stop<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.720> ball

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
and put on the knot so stop the ball

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.159 
and put on the knot so stop the ball
spinning<00:04:26.000> we<00:04:27.000> can<00:04:27.180> use<00:04:27.330> put<00:04:27.510> a<00:04:27.540> jack<00:04:27.780> under<00:04:27.960> the

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
spinning we can use put a jack under the

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.000 
spinning we can use put a jack under the
control<00:04:28.470> arm<00:04:28.650> lift<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.490> up<00:04:29.580> then<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:30.800> will<00:04:31.800> seek

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
control arm lift it up then I will seek

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.820 
control arm lift it up then I will seek
the<00:04:32.160> ball<00:04:32.280> joint<00:04:32.520> into<00:04:32.700> place<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:34.620> we<00:04:34.710> can

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
the ball joint into place and we can

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.820 
the ball joint into place and we can
tighten<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.130> up<00:04:35.250> using<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.580> spanner<00:04:39.650> so<00:04:40.650> that's

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
tighten it up using a spanner so that's

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.950 
tighten it up using a spanner so that's
our<00:04:41.040> new<00:04:41.160> ball<00:04:41.340> joint<00:04:41.610> place<00:04:41.880> now<00:04:42.120> obvious

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
our new ball joint place now obvious

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.150 
our new ball joint place now obvious
videos<00:04:43.229> are<00:04:43.440> some<00:04:43.590> use<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.770> you

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
videos are some use to you

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.690 
videos are some use to you
thanks<00:04:44.910> all<00:04:45.660> right
