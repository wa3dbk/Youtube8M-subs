00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.929 
see how it how it is it smells pretty
guess<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.299> should<00:01:21.540> smell<00:01:21.780> before<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.290> taste<00:01:22.500> it

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
guess I should smell before I taste it

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:36.170 
guess I should smell before I taste it
it<00:01:23.939> smells<00:01:24.330> pretty<00:01:26.119> very<00:01:27.119> pretty

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.690 

it<00:01:36.780> tastes<00:01:37.230> pretty<00:01:37.410> good<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:38.160> not<00:01:38.400> very

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
it tastes pretty good it's not very

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.360 
it tastes pretty good it's not very
strong<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:40.110> online<00:01:40.290> they<00:01:40.890> say<00:01:41.160> it's

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
strong I think online they say it's

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.590 
strong I think online they say it's
about<00:01:42.890> four<00:01:43.890> percent<00:01:44.100> alcohol<00:01:44.850> by<00:01:45.570> volume

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
about four percent alcohol by volume

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.580 
about four percent alcohol by volume
steps<00:01:46.470> sound<00:01:47.250> very<00:01:47.550> strong<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.590> it's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
steps sound very strong and it's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.550 
steps sound very strong and it's
actually<00:01:50.100> kind<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.640> worried<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.560> when

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
actually kind of worried because when

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.180 
actually kind of worried because when
you<00:01:52.710> hold<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.130> bottle<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:54.060> light

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
you hold the bottle up to the light

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.980 
you hold the bottle up to the light
there's<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.280> lot<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.490> sediment<00:01:56.910> sliding<00:01:57.690> around

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
there's a lot of sediment sliding around

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.670 
there's a lot of sediment sliding around
but<00:01:58.610> there's<00:01:59.610> none<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.630> glass<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.650> I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
but there's none in this glass that I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.590 
but there's none in this glass that I
guess<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.250> when<00:02:02.550> when<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.330> further

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
guess it's when when you get further

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.850 
guess it's when when you get further
down<00:02:03.840> it'll<00:02:04.740> come<00:02:04.920> out<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.190> tastes<00:02:11.670> fruity

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
down it'll come out but it tastes fruity

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.440 
down it'll come out but it tastes fruity
it<00:02:13.860> actually<00:02:14.400> doesn't<00:02:14.670> taste<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:17.450> alcohol

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
it actually doesn't taste like alcohol

fragrant and it's really lightweight so

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.199 
fragrant and it's really lightweight so
it's<00:03:43.510> not<00:03:43.780> heavy<00:03:44.230> it's<00:03:44.760> got<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> slight

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
it's not heavy it's got a slight

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.630 
it's not heavy it's got a slight
bitterness<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.140> but<00:03:47.500> not<00:03:47.680> not<00:03:48.130> too<00:03:48.400> bad

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
bitterness to it but not not too bad

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.050 
bitterness to it but not not too bad
i'll<00:03:48.910> probably<00:03:49.180> let<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.860> other<00:03:51.100> bottle<00:03:51.459> sit<00:03:52.030> a

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
i'll probably let the other bottle sit a

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.740 
i'll probably let the other bottle sit a
while<00:03:52.330> at<00:03:52.780> them<00:03:52.959> aged<00:03:53.230> a<00:03:53.260> while<00:03:54.300> before<00:03:55.300> i<00:03:55.540> even

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
while at them aged a while before i even

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.699 
while at them aged a while before i even
then<00:03:56.200> but<00:03:56.770> um<00:03:57.550> they<00:03:58.510> did<00:03:58.780> this<00:03:58.989> one<00:03:59.320> in<00:03:59.530> the

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
then but um they did this one in the

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.320 
then but um they did this one in the
mystery<00:04:00.430> beer<00:04:00.610> kit<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.390> then<00:04:01.780> i<00:04:03.060> guess<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.300> was
