00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.819
 continuing with changes in the matrix 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:06.770
 energy in the country 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.690
 technically using the term of 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.879
 induction transforming kitchens 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.680
 gas to energy the same process still 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.320
 is implementing in the pots and everything 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.210
 Useful utensil for kitchen in basin 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.099
 the industry has proceeded to change the 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.380
 aluminum for the steel to manufacture 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.390
 induction cookers that adapt to the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.759
 new burners that will work based 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.070
 of electricity us as industry 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.769
 we are already preparing with this new 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.800
 project we have to use a steel 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.500
 Stainless that works with kitchens 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.120
 of induction because not any steel 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.010
 stainless a kitchen can be used 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.750
 of induction if it has to be a 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.489
 material that activates the magnetic field 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.960
 of the induction cooker with 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.609
 millionaire investments one of the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.710
 manufacturing companies among pots of 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.410
 induction claims that monthly wait 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.510
 make 150 thousand kits obviously this 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.309
 number would represent a low production 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.660
 for the amount of investment but 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.460
 explains that it is due to the difference 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.829
 between the soft aluminum and the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.109
 robustness of stainless steel in the 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.530
 utensil making the set 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.000
 we will make 250 thousand units 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.539
 and practically with the intention that 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.969
 let's do it would be very little is not so 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.820
 easy because the steel has a greater 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.740
 hardness then the designs the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.750
 pot structures will change 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.490
 where possible they rejoice with the state 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.229
 Ecuadorian so that with the purchase of 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.539
 induction cooker is acquired 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.450
 also the pot kit then the idea 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.979
 is to generate strategic alliances with the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.469
 industries that are developing the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.270
 cook and send me for pots kit 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.950
 together with them the new 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.810
 induction shores present some 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.390
 advantages for the user however 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.090
 It also has certain disadvantages inside 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.369
 of the advantages would be that consumption 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.700
 energy will be lower within the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.799
 disadvantages is the time is not 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.720
 acculturated to the people what will be 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.270
 really use the difference in that 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.729
 use a stainless steel utensil and 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.450
 of an aluminum utensil we keep 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.119
 foods that require frying and that 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 generally in stainless steel there 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.970
 they will have the same degree of cooking 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.530
 despite these post and cons the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.330
 Cuenca industry has large 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.940
 expectations with this new system of 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.550
 steel production called induction to 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.880
 Export with our product 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.100
 and increase the induction product 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.660
 in stainless steel set inside 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.030
 of the plant in the coming days the 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.380
 Minister of Industries and Productivity 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.750
 will visit these factories with the objective 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.060
 to incentivize them and translate some 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.360
 agreements that benefit the producer and 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.959
 of course to the Ecuadorian state 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.959
 repaired the informative
