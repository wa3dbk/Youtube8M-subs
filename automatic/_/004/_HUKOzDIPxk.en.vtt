00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.620
 the galaxy 3 12 the smallest smartphone of the 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.140
 line still saints with only 4.5 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.530
 inch screen as the name already indicates 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.330
 it supports two sim-like chips 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.920
 other smartphones in this line 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.840
 The finishing of this device is all done 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.449
 a quality that is a great 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.880
 advantage for some users 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.740
 it comes with Dragon Step 410 as well as 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.109
 the other devices in the line but 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.600
 only 1 GB of RAM 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:36.190
 the rear camera ends up getting a bit 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.070
 protruding what is a negative point 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.750
 in the design of the device the screen of the galaxy to 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.850
 3 your best quality as well as 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.590
 all devices on this line 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.020
 relying on super-amoled technology 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.600
 you can see the colors as soon as the colors 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.899
 are much more vivid and sometimes even 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.840
 little supersaturated the brightness is excellent 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.550
 and a configuration this here allows 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.010
 you put it on automatic but 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.989
 defines a gain a loss of brightness in 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.560
 of this pattern that will leave here in the 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.450
 maximum to show well is a sized screen 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.619
 the colors are very bright and you can 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.560
 especially when people are 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:16.440
 is playing ultra-colored games 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.440
 in case it can saturate the colors a little 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.230
 as we already commenting from 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.610
 design are 4.5 inches with resolution 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.080
 qhd but the size and a resolution that 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.900
 not as large as some of the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.820
 competitors is easily compensated for 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.070
 technology that is the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.970
 differential of this device can be seen 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.400
 in the image with the colors stay alive 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.220
 and the intense brightness to any light in the 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.220
 video is the connection is not a smartphone tÃ¡ 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.900
 talking on lego smartphone opera 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.510
 quietly most of the time 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.910
 way without overloading with the 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.980
 your processor cualcomm snapdragon 410 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.020
 into this segment has already shown 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.420
 which is more than enough what 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.340
 happens here the most problematic is the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.190
 Ram memory is reduced when you 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.950
 running only one game it works without 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.860
 problems and you will be able to operate without 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.210
 delay and without wear but how are you 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.300
 to show in the video he is 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:23.920
 overwhelmed because many applications 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.709
 open at the same time this situation 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.560
 saturates the device because it 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.790
 has only 1 GB of ram and ends up 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.070
 being the most negative point of the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.720
 performance ratio that generally works 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.000
 very well with just a little more 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.840
 and it would be easier to recommend 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.720
 this appliance 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.489
 the camera of the galaxy to 3 is not a big one 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.340
 but it is also not a point 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:49.830
 negative, it does not take as much shelter and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.739
 she has the advantage of taking quick pictures 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.180
 the photos are quickly beaten and with a 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.190
 speed higher than others 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.190
 smartphones within this segment 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.950
 only that the final quality of them 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.270
 It does not differ much 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.280
 because of this device does not have a 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.380
 differential camera is a problem because 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.270
 the intermediate segment where people 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.730
 against the bike he second generation or 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.880
 symphony 5 really lacks cameras 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.110
 best and for the galaxy case to 3 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.350
 she ends up losing more points to 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.150
 get ready ready behind him 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.790
 the front camera that features 5 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:30.520
 megapixels or with this self function 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.990
 They detect face and lipstick alone. 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.210
 with a beautifying feature that also 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.250
 That thing that fogs your face to 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.500
 You look more beautiful being 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.110
 smartphone samsung galaxy a 3 comes also 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.850
 with the touchwiz the interface of the 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.490
 android that there are many people who do not 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.680
 likes and has people who prefer what 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.300
 happens is that samsung has been more 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.060
 the implementation of this system. 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.000
 and taking away much of the famous bloody well 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.250
 used to put on the smartphone that only 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.260
 overburdened his performance in 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.750
 our complete analysis in text exist 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.550
 benchmark with comparative charts for 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.690
 you see the performance on the galaxy at 3 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.640
 not far behind your 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.770
 competitors and sometimes even wins from them 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.450
 then uses that it does not become a 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.800
 problem as much as the lack of 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.990
 ram memory for example 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.450
 in fact the changes that we find 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.670
 in this device may even be welcome 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.040
 which is the case for example the brightness 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.570
 additional extra in automatic in others 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.490
 functions aside 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.650
 it also has 4g connection also 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.300
 known as it is and radio that only 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.490
 when it was turned off as in the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.920
 most of the appliances where it is here that 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.740
 We will do it for the autonomy. 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.590
 samsung has been able to optimize the 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.320
 system and with a much smaller battery 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.420
 he almost empathizes with the bike and that even 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.620
 moment is our champion of autonomy 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.830
 no adrenaline 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.000
 also thanks to twitter that much 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.980
 people do not like 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.350
 it comes with low mode feature 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.240
 consumption because it should be used in 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.650
 semmer you 're not on the street. 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.460
 You can be without the phone. 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.890
 none 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.010
 it practically turns the smartphone 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.410
 on a gang phone by restricting access to 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.240
 most applications restricting the 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.290
 most connectivity features 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.680
 of the device but estimating the consumption of 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.259
 Pro battery min 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.880
 much autonomy it is a matter more 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.600
 emergency because no one deserves 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.780
 a super amoled black and white screen 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.910
 concluded 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.580
 the galaxy to three from the south is an excellent 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.770
 Mars phone and deliver what it promises 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.650
 only it has a slightly salty value 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.229
 samsung suggests 1,200 reais what is 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.210
 totally absurd for this device but 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.550
 is very easy even most of the 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.530
 stores is already selling for 850 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.360
 eight hundred and seventy, what is more 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.150
 within what we find in this segment 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.099
 but still slightly above average then 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.530
 this value will compensate for who 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.660
 prefers a metal finish that 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.669
 really looks very beautiful and of course the 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.590
 his screen which is amazing the super amoled 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.180
 makes all the difference 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.250
 not to mention the autonomy that is a 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.289
 another major advantage per device 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.870
 other than that which makes more intensive use 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.610
 your smartphone will probably prefer 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.610
 a larger screen already with its five 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.039
 inches and of course more RAM than 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.820
 ends up being a system bottleneck in use 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.820
 more intensive 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.120
 this one is the lg g 4 currently the top 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.770
 of the lg line in the Brazilian market in 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.840
 an appliance with suggested price in the house 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.540
 of the three thousand and three hundred reais that 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.030
 some innovations in relation to g 3 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.530
 these revolutions are very punctual 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.500
 in general terms it is a device that 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.330
 even reminiscent of g 3 itself 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.280
 one of the characteristics in common is the 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.070
 5.5-inch screen with resolution 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.230
 four hds is what we had besides 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.240
 g3 the difference now is that lg 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.900
 implemented display technology 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.900
 quantum
