want<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:47.040> move<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.430> vert<00:02:48.880> then<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.870> have<00:02:50.470> to

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
want to move that vert then I have to

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.040 
want to move that vert then I have to
decrease<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.700> fall-off<00:02:53.790> sometimes

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
decrease the fall-off sometimes

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.110 
decrease the fall-off sometimes
selecting<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.170> bit<00:02:56.380> difficult<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.870> range

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
selecting is a bit difficult the range

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.449 
selecting is a bit difficult the range
and<00:03:01.120> that's<00:03:01.360> as<00:03:01.630> I've<00:03:02.230> explained<00:03:03.220> that

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
and that's as I've explained that

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.789 
and that's as I've explained that
already<00:03:03.790> when<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.720> right-click<00:03:05.079> you<00:03:05.470> can<00:03:05.530> do

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
already when you right-click you can do

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.039 
already when you right-click you can do
it<00:03:05.890> interactively<00:03:06.459> in<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.760> viewport

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.410 

connectives<00:03:11.049> when<00:03:12.040> it's<00:03:12.190> set<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.370> ignore<00:03:12.910> it's

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
connectives when it's set to ignore it's

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.530 
connectives when it's set to ignore it's
going<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:14.040> ignore<00:03:15.040> any<00:03:15.370> connection<00:03:16.209> so<00:03:16.510> that

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
going to ignore any connection so that

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.699 
going to ignore any connection so that
means<00:03:16.930> when<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.700> select<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.970> face<00:03:19.570> near<00:03:20.200> the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
means when I select a face near the

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.710 
means when I select a face near the
under<00:03:21.010> mesh<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.610> mesh<00:03:21.880> will<00:03:22.060> also<00:03:22.450> get

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
under mesh that mesh will also get

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.350 
under mesh that mesh will also get
deformed<00:03:23.519> but<00:03:24.519> when<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.880> said<00:03:25.120> use

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
deformed but when I said use

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.539 
deformed but when I said use
connectivity<00:03:26.140> then<00:03:26.470> only<00:03:29.250> geometry<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.400> is

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
connectivity then only geometry that is

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.690 
connectivity then only geometry that is
connected<00:03:31.120> will<00:03:32.110> get<00:03:32.320> deformed<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:33.459> I'm

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
connected will get deformed so I'm

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.990 
connected will get deformed so I'm
selecting<00:03:34.209> a<00:03:34.660> face<00:03:34.950> close<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.459> geometry

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
selecting a face close to this geometry

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.210 
selecting a face close to this geometry
but<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.570> is<00:03:37.720> not<00:03:37.930> connected<00:03:38.200> so<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:38.769> will<00:03:38.980> leave

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
but it is not connected so it will leave

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.520 
but it is not connected so it will leave
that<00:03:39.579> geometry<00:03:39.850> untouched<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.870> same<00:03:41.170> when<00:03:41.500> I

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
that geometry untouched the same when I

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.170 
that geometry untouched the same when I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
select geometry over here this geometry

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.099 
select geometry over here this geometry
will<00:03:46.720> be<00:03:47.019> transformed<00:03:47.920> but<00:03:48.100> not<00:03:48.310> this<00:03:48.790> one

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
will be transformed but not this one

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.509 
will be transformed but not this one
when<00:03:50.109> I<00:03:50.200> set<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.470> ring<00:03:50.829> it<00:03:50.980> connections

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
when I set it to ring it connections

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.920 
when I set it to ring it connections
then<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.420> whole<00:03:52.660> mesh<00:03:53.530> item<00:03:54.010> will<00:03:54.220> be

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
then the whole mesh item will be

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.770 
then the whole mesh item will be
transformed<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:57.370> when<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.209> set<00:03:58.390> it<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.510> each

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
transformed and when I set it to each

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.819 
transformed and when I set it to each
loop<00:03:59.079> then<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.829> can<00:04:00.160> select<00:04:00.959> entire<00:04:01.959> edge<00:04:02.470> loops

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
loop then I can select entire edge loops

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.909 
loop then I can select entire edge loops
and<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.459> course<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.880> fall-off<00:04:04.120> also<00:04:04.870> plays<00:04:05.620> a

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
and of course the fall-off also plays a

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:11.030 
and of course the fall-off also plays a
part<00:04:06.459> in<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.840> transform

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.150 

and<00:04:12.040> then<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.370> have<00:04:12.520> mixed-mode<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:14.920> an

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
and then you have mixed-mode this is an

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.460 
and then you have mixed-mode this is an
interesting<00:04:15.520> one<00:04:15.850> this<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.480> if<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.930> for

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
interesting one this is if you for

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.910 
interesting one this is if you for
instance<00:04:17.500> would<00:04:18.300> also<00:04:19.300> use<00:04:20.140> an<00:04:20.410> extra

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
instance would also use an extra

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.390 
instance would also use an extra
fall-off<00:04:21.430> I'm<00:04:21.640> going<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.830> add<00:04:23.830> a<00:04:24.190> linear

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
fall-off I'm going to add a linear

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.990 
fall-off I'm going to add a linear
fall-off<00:04:25.950> going<00:04:26.950> to<00:04:27.100> select<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.490> here<00:04:27.790> I'm

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
fall-off going to select it here I'm

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.470 
fall-off going to select it here I'm
going<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.680> drag<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:30.010> fall-off<00:04:30.250> now<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.030> have<00:04:31.330> to

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
going to drag the fall-off now I have to

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:42.210 
going to drag the fall-off now I have to
select<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.840> transform<00:04:32.290> again<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:33.780> set<00:04:41.220> let

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
select the transform again and set let

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:52.090 
select the transform again and set let
me<00:04:42.460> see

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.750 

I'm<00:04:52.610> going<00:04:52.880> to<00:04:53.030> pass<00:04:53.270> for<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.630> moment<00:04:54.340> okay<00:04:55.340> I'm

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
I'm going to pass for a moment okay I'm

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.520 
I'm going to pass for a moment okay I'm
back<00:04:56.440> made<00:04:57.440> a<00:04:57.980> mistake<00:04:58.810> when<00:04:59.810> I<00:04:59.840> selected<00:05:00.410> a

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
back made a mistake when I selected a

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.730 
back made a mistake when I selected a
fall-off<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:01.160> did<00:05:01.580> not<00:05:02.020> had<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:03.200> choose<00:05:03.440> this

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
fall-off I did not had to choose this

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.850 
fall-off I did not had to choose this
one<00:05:03.950> but<00:05:04.220> at<00:05:04.610> fall<00:05:05.600> off<00:05:05.750> I'm<00:05:06.050> going<00:05:06.350> to<00:05:06.470> add<00:05:06.620> a

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
one but at fall off I'm going to add a

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.550 
one but at fall off I'm going to add a
linear<00:05:07.070> fall-off<00:05:07.660> now<00:05:08.660> when<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:08.960> choose<00:05:09.290> that

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
linear fall-off now when I choose that

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.190 
linear fall-off now when I choose that
fall<00:05:09.830> off<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:10.310> can<00:05:10.550> interact<00:05:11.390> that's<00:05:11.660> fall<00:05:12.080> off

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
fall off I can interact that's fall off

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.550 
fall off I can interact that's fall off
in<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.220> viewport<00:05:13.670> I<00:05:13.960> have<00:05:14.960> to<00:05:15.110> select<00:05:15.380> my

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
in the viewport I have to select my

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.440 
in the viewport I have to select my
transform<00:05:16.190> tool<00:05:16.400> again

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
transform tool again

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.550 
transform tool again
and<00:05:17.540> now<00:05:18.580> you<00:05:19.580> have<00:05:19.790> a<00:05:20.090> linear<00:05:20.660> fall-off<00:05:21.110> in

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
and now you have a linear fall-off in

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.420 
and now you have a linear fall-off in
mixed<00:05:22.280> mode<00:05:22.570> now<00:05:23.570> it's<00:05:23.930> set<00:05:24.170> to<00:05:24.200> ad<00:05:24.590> when<00:05:25.280> it's

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
mixed mode now it's set to ad when it's

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.090 
mixed mode now it's set to ad when it's
set<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.790> multiply<00:05:26.030> you<00:05:26.840> get<00:05:27.050> a<00:05:27.350> different

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
set to multiply you get a different

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.790 
set to multiply you get a different
result<00:05:31.330> something<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.540> have<00:05:32.690> to<00:05:32.930> experiment

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
result something you have to experiment

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.880 
result something you have to experiment
what<00:05:34.040> you<00:05:34.490> want<00:05:34.820> when<00:05:35.240> it's<00:05:35.390> set<00:05:35.780> to<00:05:35.810> add<00:05:37.780> this

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
what you want when it's set to add this

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.040 
what you want when it's set to add this
mode<00:05:39.890> makes<00:05:39.920> more<00:05:40.490> sense<00:05:40.850> probably<00:05:41.300> when<00:05:41.930> you

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
mode makes more sense probably when you

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.960 
mode makes more sense probably when you
add<00:05:42.260> a<00:05:42.470> linear<00:05:42.620> fall-off<00:05:43.150> you<00:05:44.150> can<00:05:44.360> subtract

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
add a linear fall-off you can subtract

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.700 
add a linear fall-off you can subtract
then<00:05:46.970> some<00:05:47.210> elements<00:05:47.750> move<00:05:47.990> in<00:05:48.260> the<00:05:48.410> opposite

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
then some elements move in the opposite

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.890 
then some elements move in the opposite
direction<00:05:50.020> max<00:05:51.310> not<00:05:52.310> really<00:05:52.970> sure<00:05:53.270> what<00:05:53.570> Max

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
direction max not really sure what Max

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.080 
direction max not really sure what Max
and<00:05:54.230> min<00:05:54.710> are<00:05:55.120> really<00:05:56.120> doing<00:05:57.700> just<00:05:58.700> something

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
and min are really doing just something

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:05.980 
and min are really doing just something
you<00:05:59.660> have<00:05:59.840> to<00:05:59.870> experiment<00:06:00.800> with<00:06:04.270> so<00:06:05.270> a<00:06:05.510> short

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
you have to experiment with so a short

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.620 
you have to experiment with so a short
introduction<00:06:06.530> to<00:06:06.680> the<00:06:06.890> elements<00:06:07.790> move<00:06:08.180> tool<00:06:08.420> I

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
introduction to the elements move tool I

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.330 
introduction to the elements move tool I
hope<00:06:08.810> you<00:06:08.960> enjoyed<00:06:09.260> it<00:06:09.470> or<00:06:09.680> find<00:06:10.100> it<00:06:10.190> useful
