00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.529
 mike phillips and biya kept from crossing 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.059
 his former partners before the match 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.250
 Welsh who by the way was like 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.969
 sexton replacing tonight for this 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.469
 meet 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.089
 mike phillips that we see here at 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.009
 the maxime image machenaud and so was 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.660
 incumbent in the scrum also to note 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.610
 the tenure of dimitri szarzewski 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.350
 and luc ducalcon all three 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.640
 convened tomorrow on the side of marcoussis 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.380
 to find the team of France 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.600
 lydia potting soil cradles the Welsh they have 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.430
 already joined their selection in this 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.590
 match well it's the bayonnais in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.880
 orange who will put themselves first to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.250
 the fault the racing has perfectly 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.600
 attacked the meeting david roumieu here 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.910
 sanctioned for a foul on the ground s 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.040
 maxime machenaud try this first 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.390
 penalty and therefore open the mark for 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.920
 racing after ten minutes 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.270
 good start of the match from the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.800
 sky and white who are going all my friends on 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.960
 penalty before seeing dimitri 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.520
 szarzewski six escaped the relays with 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.260
 the third they will be well organized 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.970
 and it's here krueger who raises this 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.320
 krueger balloon that goes through the ground 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.640
 machenaud followed a pass 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.649
 decisive to dambielle who crossed the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.170
 line and flattened the referee then asks 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.210
 the video is not the instruction of the 10 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.890
 blain is in slow motion we see 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.390
 actually at the moment of percussion 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.249
 of kruger that benjamin dambielle prevents 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.170
 a little vaka who was celebrating his first 

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:08.789
 tenure to defend on the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 ball carrier left so can not 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:15.030
 be validated part of these areas part 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.409
 discount for the metro racing that will be 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.539
 to launch the assault of the defense 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.100
 bayonnaise by multiplying the times of 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.749
 game here we see the domineering front 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.270
 in this sector and pound the line 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:25.560
 opponent's goal and dimitri szarzewski a 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.619
 can be flattened sir's answer 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.299
 walk to a red 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.850
 effectively prevented dimitri szarzewski 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.200
 to score the scrum will not give anything if 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.219
 this is a penalty we asked them 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.259
 three points on the side of laurent through 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.020
 and maxime machenaud assures a third 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.459
 penalty the racing leads 9 to 0 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 mike phillips pursues him 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.670
 warming up he's obviously impatient 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.170
 to return but he will have to wait 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.060
 because at the beginning of the second period 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.950
 bayonnais finally get bolder and get 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.109
 launches the tacc attack of the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.299
 defense of racing is here felt 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:57.240
 fernandez who attacked well 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.899
 provoke the defense of racing that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.999
 blame 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.280
 stephen brett then comes in and 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.840
 offers the holes 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.310
 first point to his team the beginning 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.440
 a good time for this team 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.630
 Bayonnaise which registers more than 50% of 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.130
 these tests between the 30th and the 60th minute 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.230
 the evidence in pictures with seven 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.060
 interceptions desanti fernandez person 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.830
 will not resume the Argentine maxim machenaud 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.110
 is a little short and santi fernandez without 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.120
 opposition and well flattened this test a 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.290
 test gag a test cap a little 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.880
 little because look at the lack of 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.370
 Adrien's success planted the ball 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.110
 bounces on his hip and then feels 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.550
 fernandez is well placed no longer 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.450
 than to lengthen his race anti ferrandez 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.650
 that she will not be the effort to go 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.540
 flatten between the poles 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.100
 immediate consequence the transformation 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.440
 is much more difficult and she is 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.360
 mostly missed by santi fernandez the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.220
 racing then keeps a small point 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.540
 advanced only on bayonne the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.209
 problems and worries will accumulate 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.890
 on the shoulders bayonnaise with here 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.650
 adrien planted severely plated 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.780
 severely shaken by Julian Puricelli 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.370
 Valais referee is the rule to rabies 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.980
 it will not give anything so we go there this 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.959
 fault and blew the cage do the no 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.080
 really academic julien puricelli 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.790
 planted adrien falls and receives himself 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.019
 on the head we were very worried for 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.329
 adrien planted happily he stands 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.250
 will raise without injury he will 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.019
 revenge will not recover from this 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.180
 fall of this gesture dangerous plating 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.120
 for julien puricelli bayonne is so 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.260
 reduced to 15 against 14 the turn of the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.880
 match maybe because machenaud 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.430
 then add three new points 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.769
 before leaving his place to mike 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.570
 phillips the long-awaited entry at the end of 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.090
 the old bayonnais just facing the 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.320
 Basque players who are going into this 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.420
 second period and in this end of 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.250
 match and well suffer the assaults of the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.750
 part of racing if luc ducalcon in his 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.820
 22 meters trying to revive luc 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.420
 ducalcon who will get hurt on this 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.340
 action 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.290
 the advantage will not give anything a few 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.359
 seconds later luc ducalcon hit 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.220
 left knee will have to leave his 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.980
 partners at szarzewski and machenaud 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.510
 they were left at rest they have in 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.340
 anyway leave their partners 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.390
 just before the end of the match everything is fine 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.890
 for them but they showed themselves 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.170
 obviously a little bit worried for 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.880
 their partner luc ducalcon at the end of 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.410
 match the racing a match won and go 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.970
 try to get a try he does not 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.170
 will never come because bayonne goes to the 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.880
 fault and jonathan sexton 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.350
 after a first not first penalty 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.350
 double 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.520
 final score 18 to 8 for the racing that 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.990
 stay in the race for the dams 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.890
 but mike phillips we've seen him forget 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.080
 not going to greet his elders 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.910
 partners who remained on two 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.920
 victories bad news on the other hand 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.959
 for luc ducalcon the pillar suffers 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.250
 sciatica Delajoux his left leg 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.480
 presence tomorrow in marcoussis is at 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.520
 the time I'm talking to you a lot 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.790
 much more than uncertain isabelle 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.840
 yeah we talked after two there 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.010
 chambering no it's not already 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.020
 equipped compositions we do not know if we 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.390
 will play against each other anyway 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:37.490
 yes it will be weird to play against a 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:42.890
 teammate non vote is pretty weird 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.080
 always against big max one day the 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.780
 star 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:53.020
 the vote is the team of france his name 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:57.620
 is nice guy very nice I hope and the 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.300
 bad matches I'm kidding I'm kidding 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.740
 hope to play his matches anyway I 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.160
 to know the thousandth stadium of 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.450
 cardiff 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.490
 because it's going to be a mood 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.380
 great and especially here I hope 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.910
 we can go for a drink 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.570
 together after after a victory over 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.570
 this is
