00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
honestly at this point and he could be

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
honestly at this point and he could be
scarfed<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.260> well<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.770> turn<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.219> I

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
going to set up hazards he probably

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.350 
going to set up hazards he probably
won't<00:01:25.979> go<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> durable<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> power<00:01:27.180> whip

straightaway<00:01:27.840> has<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.560> seem<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:28.799> apt<00:01:29.159> for

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
straightaway has it seem more apt for

straightaway has it seem more apt for
him<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.420> decided<00:01:30.930> with

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
him to do and so I decided with

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.359 
him to do and so I decided with
terrakion<00:01:31.530> seeing<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.130> probably

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
terrakion seeing like probably

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.560 
terrakion seeing like probably

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
threatened out the fairest one quite a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.810 
threatened out the fairest one quite a
bit<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> substitute<00:01:34.820> unfortunately

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820

he<00:01:36.090> stays<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.840> goes<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> power<00:01:37.259> whip

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470

he stays in and goes for the power whip
I<00:01:37.619> guess<00:01:37.829> perhaps<00:01:38.040> predicting<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.200> it's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200

a<00:01:40.290> bit<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.560> ballsy<00:01:40.890> play<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.400> allows<00:01:41.610> him

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
a bit of a ballsy play but it allows him

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.039

something to take a hit and scarf Teeter
seems<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.900> be<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.050> perfect<00:02:34.290> thing<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.680> do<00:02:34.980> that

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
seems to be the perfect thing to do that

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.790 
seems to be the perfect thing to do that
simply<00:02:35.730> because<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.180> larios<00:02:36.650> could<00:02:37.650> be

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
simply because this larios could be

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.699 
simply because this larios could be
potentially<00:02:38.459> choice<00:02:38.849> or<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> isn't<00:02:40.200> then

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
potentially choice or if it isn't then

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.559 
potentially choice or if it isn't then
