at<00:02:29.090> things<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.540> close<00:02:29.780> again<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.200> Cooper

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
at things that close again the Cooper

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.560 
at things that close again the Cooper
gets<00:02:30.650> smaller<00:02:30.950> under<00:02:31.640> control<00:02:31.970> what<00:02:32.239> division

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
gets smaller under control what division

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.960 
gets smaller under control what division
of<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.900> nervous<00:02:33.170> system<00:02:33.620> or<00:02:33.739> motor<00:02:33.950> who<00:02:34.310> don't

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
of the nervous system or motor who don't

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.030 
of the nervous system or motor who don't
they<00:02:35.090> oculomotor<00:02:35.600> Strix<00:02:36.200> but<00:02:36.380> what<00:02:36.530> dilates

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
they oculomotor Strix but what dilates

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.970 
they oculomotor Strix but what dilates
it<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:38.200> dilator<00:02:39.200> muscles

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.320 

ok<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.460> sphincter<00:02:43.790> muscles<00:02:44.090> making<00:02:44.270> it

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
ok so the sphincter muscles making it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.780 
ok so the sphincter muscles making it
smaller<00:02:44.620> find<00:02:45.620> your<00:02:45.770> muscles<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.520> aqua

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
smaller find your muscles so the aqua

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.840 
smaller find your muscles so the aqua
moto<00:02:46.970> only<00:02:47.450> constricts<00:02:48.230> yeah<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:51.260> that's<00:02:51.850> what

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
moto only constricts yeah so that's what

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.750 
moto only constricts yeah so that's what
part<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.240> nervous<00:02:53.450> system<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.840> that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
part of the nervous system is that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.390 
part of the nervous system is that
cranium<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:56.030> mean<00:02:56.420> oculomotor<00:02:57.130> my<00:02:58.130> part<00:02:58.340> of

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
cranium I mean oculomotor my part of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.110 
cranium I mean oculomotor my part of
that<00:02:58.520> nervous<00:02:59.150> system<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.510> somatic<00:03:00.050> autonomic

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
that nervous system is somatic autonomic

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.380 
that nervous system is somatic autonomic
well<00:03:02.120> its<00:03:02.300> audit<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.900> little<00:03:03.140> bit<00:03:03.260> great

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
well its audit a little bit great

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.870 
well its audit a little bit great
parasympathetic<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.870> don't<00:03:06.230> know<00:03:06.290> me<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.880> is

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
parasympathetic I don't know me and is

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.640 
parasympathetic I don't know me and is
part<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.770> apartment<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:11.530> butt<00:03:12.530> of

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
part of that that apartment and butt of

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.490 
part of that that apartment and butt of
the<00:03:12.800> Ottoman<00:03:13.450> really<00:03:14.450> focus<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.050> focus<00:03:15.080> yeah

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
the Ottoman really focus the focus yeah

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.650 
the Ottoman really focus the focus yeah
yeah<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.220> Paris<00:03:16.550> probably<00:03:17.060> would<00:03:17.540> be

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
yeah that Paris probably would be

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.060 
yeah that Paris probably would be
semantic<00:03:18.110> yeah<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:18.470> guys<00:03:18.650> at<00:03:18.830> care<00:03:19.010> of

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
semantic yeah you guys at care of

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.040 
semantic yeah you guys at care of
something<00:03:19.430> parasympathetic<00:03:20.300> yes<00:03:20.750> okay

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
something parasympathetic yes okay

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.800 
something parasympathetic yes okay
that's<00:03:21.320> for<00:03:21.560> look<00:03:22.430> good<00:03:22.670> things<00:03:22.850> up<00:03:23.000> hopes<00:03:23.270> ok

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
that's for look good things up hopes ok

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.960 
that's for look good things up hopes ok
so<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.470> pupil<00:03:24.830> gets<00:03:24.860> smaller<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.460> get<00:03:25.580> rid<00:03:25.880> of

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
so the pupil gets smaller to get rid of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.890 
so the pupil gets smaller to get rid of
those<00:03:26.120> divergent<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.810> raised<00:03:28.450> in<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.570> concise

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
those divergent I raised in a concise

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.420 
those divergent I raised in a concise
when<00:03:30.320> you're<00:03:30.440> trying<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.770> see<00:03:30.950> things<00:03:31.100> post

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
when you're trying to see things post

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
when you're trying to see things post
when<00:03:31.610> you're<00:03:31.730> kind<00:03:31.880> of<00:03:32.000> good<00:03:32.210> things<00:03:32.420> about

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
when you're kind of good things about

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.390 
when you're kind of good things about
folks<00:03:32.840> okay<00:03:33.200> it's<00:03:33.470> fast<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:33.980> lens<00:03:34.220> gets

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
folks okay it's fast and the lens gets

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.310 
folks okay it's fast and the lens gets
fatter<00:03:34.700> because<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.330> silvery<00:03:35.660> muscles<00:03:36.110> also

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
fatter because the silvery muscles also

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.190 
fatter because the silvery muscles also
constraints<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.660> looses<00:03:39.170> the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
constraints and that looses the

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.200 
constraints and that looses the
ligaments<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:39.980> then<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.670> lens<00:03:40.850> can<00:03:41.090> get<00:03:41.210> that

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
ligaments and then the lens can get that

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:52.860 
ligaments and then the lens can get that
okay<00:03:44.210> so<00:03:44.380> what<00:03:45.380> makes<00:03:45.590> aqueous<00:03:46.040> humor

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:01.420 

it's<00:03:53.870> from<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.290> blood<00:03:54.500> from<00:03:55.159> the<00:03:55.340> quarry<00:04:00.430> it's

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
it's from the blood from the quarry it's

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:09.009 
it's from the blood from the quarry it's
from<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.939> celery<00:04:02.599> processes<00:04:04.989> we<00:04:05.989> always<00:04:08.019> take

from the celery processes we always take

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.500 
from the celery processes we always take
Mishima<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:09.829> then<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.609> helps<00:04:10.970> cleanse<00:04:11.299> the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
Mishima and then it helps cleanse the

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.080 
Mishima and then it helps cleanse the
eye<00:04:11.540> goes<00:04:12.049> through<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.890> pupil<00:04:13.040> you'll<00:04:13.700> from

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
eye goes through the pupil you'll from

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.960 
eye goes through the pupil you'll from

the posterior chamber to the antechamber

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.469

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
in half that pitchers humor came out

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.840 
in half that pitchers humor came out
made<00:05:42.970> a<00:05:43.030> little<00:05:43.150> puddle<00:05:43.390> and<00:05:43.830> then<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:45.610> gist

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
made a little puddle and then the gist

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.730 
made a little puddle and then the gist
heroes<00:05:46.120> helps<00:05:46.480> hold<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.900> retina<00:05:47.230> against<00:05:47.560> the

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
heroes helps hold the retina against the

heroes helps hold the retina against the
call<00:05:47.980> right<00:05:48.130> so<00:05:48.970> sometimes<00:05:49.450> the<00:05:49.780> retro<00:05:50.080> will

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
call right so sometimes the retro will

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.700 
call right so sometimes the retro will
detach<00:05:50.560> then<00:05:50.950> oh<00:05:51.130> okay<00:05:51.910> and<00:05:52.470> so<00:05:53.470> a<00:05:53.500> lot<00:05:53.650> of

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
detach then oh okay and so a lot of

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.250 
detach then oh okay and so a lot of
people<00:05:53.950> had<00:05:54.070> a<00:05:54.100> detached<00:05:54.460> retina<00:05:54.930> yeah<00:05:55.930> and

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
people had a detached retina yeah and

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.510 
people had a detached retina yeah and
it's<00:05:56.380> kind<00:05:56.560> of<00:05:56.590> whitish<00:05:56.860> gray<00:05:57.100> stuff<00:05:57.340> with

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
it's kind of whitish gray stuff with

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.900 
it's kind of whitish gray stuff with
regular<00:05:57.790> little<00:05:57.880> tissue<00:05:58.240> tissue<00:05:58.690> paper<00:05:58.990> okay

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
regular little tissue tissue paper okay

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.630 
regular little tissue tissue paper okay
okay<00:06:00.910> now<00:06:01.120> let's<00:06:01.300> look<00:06:01.420> inside<00:06:01.600> here<00:06:02.460> this<00:06:03.460> is

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
okay now let's look inside here this is

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.700 
okay now let's look inside here this is
called<00:06:03.670> what<00:06:07.200> this<00:06:08.200> is<00:06:08.290> the<00:06:08.350> optic<00:06:08.680> nerve

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
called what this is the optic nerve

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.080 
called what this is the optic nerve
what's<00:06:09.460> this<00:06:09.580> area<00:06:09.910> of<00:06:10.060> the<00:06:10.180> I<00:06:10.360> call<00:06:11.460> yes<00:06:12.460> optic

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
what's this area of the I call yes optic

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.120 
what's this area of the I call yes optic
disc<00:06:13.330> also<00:06:13.540> known<00:06:13.870> as<00:06:14.020> line<00:06:14.590> fly<00:06:14.770> stopped

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
disc also known as line fly stopped

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.740 
disc also known as line fly stopped
because<00:06:15.430> we<00:06:15.580> don't<00:06:15.760> have<00:06:15.850> any<00:06:16.090> photoreceptors

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
because we don't have any photoreceptors

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.220 
because we don't have any photoreceptors
are<00:06:16.980> ok<00:06:17.980> and<00:06:18.400> then<00:06:19.300> this<00:06:19.480> little<00:06:19.720> area<00:06:19.870> here<00:06:20.020> is

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
are ok and then this little area here is

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.730 
are ok and then this little area here is
supposed<00:06:20.530> to<00:06:20.590> be<00:06:20.680> a<00:06:20.710> problem<00:06:20.920> though<00:06:21.070> the

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
supposed to be a problem though the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.110 
supposed to be a problem though the
macula<00:06:23.740> lutea<00:06:23.770> within<00:06:24.610> the<00:06:24.700> middle<00:06:24.910> is<00:06:25.090> the

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
macula lutea within the middle is the

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.030 
macula lutea within the middle is the
fovea<00:06:25.540> centralis<00:06:25.570> or<00:06:26.200> central<00:06:26.500> fovea<00:06:26.860> that

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
fovea centralis or central fovea that

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.100 
fovea centralis or central fovea that
the<00:06:27.130> yellow<00:06:27.340> sticky<00:06:27.880> add<00:06:28.150> a<00:06:28.180> yellow<00:06:28.420> spot<00:06:28.540> and

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
the yellow sticky add a yellow spot and

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.390 
the yellow sticky add a yellow spot and
that's<00:06:29.770> where<00:06:29.950> you<00:06:29.980> had<00:06:30.190> the<00:06:30.220> highest

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
that's where you had the highest

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.420 
that's where you had the highest
concentration<00:06:31.120> of<00:06:31.380> cones<00:06:32.380> and<00:06:32.740> very<00:06:32.950> few<00:06:33.160> rods

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
concentration of cones and very few rods

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.460 
concentration of cones and very few rods
so<00:06:34.180> when<00:06:34.360> we<00:06:34.450> look<00:06:34.600> at<00:06:34.750> things<00:06:34.930> we<00:06:35.200> tend<00:06:35.350> to

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
so when we look at things we tend to

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.150 
so when we look at things we tend to
make<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.740> light<00:06:35.890> fall<00:06:36.190> right<00:06:36.460> on<00:06:36.490> that<00:06:36.900> ok

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
make the light fall right on that ok

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.120 
make the light fall right on that ok
and<00:06:39.600> then<00:06:40.600> at<00:06:40.690> nighttime<00:06:41.170> comes<00:06:41.770> are<00:06:41.980> not<00:06:42.100> a
