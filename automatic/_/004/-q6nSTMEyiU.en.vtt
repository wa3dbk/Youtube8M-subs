00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:05.960
 welcome to be straight 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.720
 here in my kitchen 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.690
 good what we are going to do today is 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.440
 basically teach how to make a 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.449
 small good tutorial 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.449
 noodle 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 how many more 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.620
 here you can appreciate it 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.820
 this is basically a ramen 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.820
 what 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.130
 that you can cook with 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.370
 with water and 32 instant minutes here 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.840
 we are cooking it beforehand 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.840
 we have barely two minutes 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.730
 is actually noodles can be made 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.730
 A) Yes 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.830
 but I call it ramen because they are noodles 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.830
 that contain water 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.150
 and we are reopening a little bit 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.320
 meanwhile boil a little more 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.299
 well basically the first one is boiled 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.590
 I have an exterior 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.270
 I put the complete water because it gets 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.460
 0 2% 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.320
 with very few 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.750
 then here he placed it to liter 15 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.280
 and later 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.530
 half the water 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.200
 he puts her in this little fence 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.610
 the one that finally 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.610
 among the acquaintances 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.990
 it opens 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.260
 and it's where they contain these noodles that 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.100
 they are here 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.100
 until the video 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.329
 we are not going to put out the fire 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.750
 and we are going to place the nador grass 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.500
 we put this area 2 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.510
 and we stir everything together 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.630
 then since we have these services it 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.190
 can serve directly 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.190
 that is a small portion 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.840
 but I eat otaku I liked to serve me 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.840
 in this little dish 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.190
 it is served 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.190
 and so the chopsticks 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.190
 and the ramen is ready 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.480
 in three minutes it is done 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.480
 to know how to live so long 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.720
 but it is something that can be enjoyed 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.720
 much 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.950
 the video 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.310
 comes with 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.520
 with the sachet bag inside more 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.750
 the square where the noodles come 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.750
 in a single package 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.739
 for example from this 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.350
 in the preparation mode 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:27.140
 so basically let's say 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.960
 a pot a kettle and this for 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.790
 cook it a little faster though 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.880
 the water is boiled 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.600
 It is also good to heat it a little more in 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.660
 the kitchen 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.660
 so it's that succulent 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.050
 there we have the ramen let's give a 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.050
 taste why not 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.510
 very good 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.620
 the bad chances are the easiest 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.050
 do and here also says how it's done 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.199
 good 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.990
 apart from making me really 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:23.250
 they are taken out of it 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.250
 certain type of people 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.770
 good 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.930
 this was instantaneous it is done in three 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.530
 minutes and that 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.530
 nothing more to add 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.090
 so guys here I say goodbye and they have 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.820
