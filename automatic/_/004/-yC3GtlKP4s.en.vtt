00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.890
 round 24 thousand 259 for the hundred more 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.049
 next 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.599
 you will realize that resolving these 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.519
 problems is quite simple but what 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.589
 I want to do is just think about the 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.000
 which means round to hundreds 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.050
 nearest 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.550
 so I 'm going to draw the line of nuclei 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.980
 let me draw the line here 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.040
 I'll mark the hundreds soon after. 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:41.630
 about the then supposedly we have 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:45.430
 we have 24,100 here the 24,200 then we 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:50.020
 we have 24,300 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.750
 and we have 24 thousand and 400 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.760
 I think you understand what I did 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.930
 by simply marking the positions of the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.040
 hundreds 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:05.590
 I'm increasing from 100 now in this 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.270
 number line where there is 24 thousand 259 case 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.270
 we look at the number line we will see 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.040
 more than 24 and 200 and less than 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.070
 24 thousand three hundred and to 259 then 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.649
 distance here is without the 59 stays 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.750
 approximately here then it is here that the 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.700
 Our number is here is the 24 thousand 259 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.009
 so when someone asks you to 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.380
 round to nearest hundreds 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.380
 this person is saying to redon give 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.960
 until one of those 100 hundred numbers or 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.800
 any of these without being more 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.619
 next 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.789
 if you look directly if only 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:50.760
 focus will see that it is closer or 24,300 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:53.860
 of what is for the 24 thousand and 200 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.100
 so when you round round 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.140
 for 24 and 300 if you round to 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.540
 hundreds, the answer will be 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.130
 really 24,300 that is the understanding 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.820
 conception of why it is called 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.750
 hundreds to the nearest hundred 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.940
 next is 24,300 but every time you 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.190
 solve a problem so you do not need 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.209
 to draw a merry-go-round and follow 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.100
 these steps 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.330
 although you may want to think 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.910
 about 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.910
 an easier process perhaps more 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.560
 mechanic are you literally looking at 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.390
 the number 24 thousand 259 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.640
 we want to round to the hundred 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.079
 closer then you look at the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.570
 hundreds of houses 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.220
 here is the house of hundreds and when 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.470
 rounding means we do not want to 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.209
 nothing more 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.290
 we just want mistakes after the house 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.720
 of the hundreds 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.489
 so what you do is look at a 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.600
 home after what you want 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.450
 round 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.880
 here is the house of hundreds 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.180
 so you look at the 5 right here and 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.140
 if this number is 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.709
 5 largest or five six seven eight 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:12.700
 or nine you round up 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.700
 repeating 5 or greater age up 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.420
 earl round up in this situation 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.750
 is 15 is 5 larger then round to 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.700
 up means that we are going to 24 thousand 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.900
 and since we're rounding up 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.600
 we changed the 2 for 1 3 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:37.600
 we implemented a hundred round 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:39.190
 up then it gives 24 thousand and 300 is that 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.570
 we mean by rounding to 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:47.590
 above and only as an example if I 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.570
 had 24 thousand 249 and wanted round ' 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.300
 for hundreds closer I would say 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.230
 Okay, I want to round to hundreds 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.590
 nearest 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.350
 Let me see the house of the tens in this 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.190
 home here right is not 5 or 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.960
 bigger 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:08.020
 so I round down and round 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.750
 down careful not mean 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.060
 what you will decree and if we 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.420
 This means that you really only 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.470
 have two if only get rid of everything 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:24.130
 that it has afterwards it becomes 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:27.160
 24,200 this is the process that you 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.940
 round down to round to 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:35.530
 up then turns 24,300 and that makes 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.580
 meaning 24 000 249 will be around here 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.100
 somewhere 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.780
 then it will be closer to 24,200 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.470
 24,200 would be closer to 100 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:52.180
 round down in this case to the 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:56.380
 case initial question on 24 000 259 to 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:59.340
 nearest hundred or 24,300 ready 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.340
 rounded
