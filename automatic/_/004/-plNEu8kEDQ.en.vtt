the<00:01:09.430> built<00:01:09.640> up<00:01:09.790> shoulders<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:10.720> you<00:01:10.810> get<00:01:10.960> a

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
the built up shoulders so you get a

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.890 
the built up shoulders so you get a
softer<00:01:11.470> flex<00:01:11.800> soccer<00:01:12.700> torsion<00:01:13.270> it's<00:01:13.480> an

softer flex soccer torsion it's an

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.380 
softer flex soccer torsion it's an
easier<00:01:14.200> going<00:01:14.409> ski<00:01:14.890> floats<00:01:15.610> better<00:01:15.909> it's

lighter and generally speaking feels

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.940 
lighter and generally speaking feels
more<00:01:19.000> maneuverable<00:01:19.540> now<00:01:19.690> you<00:01:20.200> do<00:01:20.350> sacrifice<00:01:20.920> a

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
more maneuverable now you do sacrifice a

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.980 
more maneuverable now you do sacrifice a
little<00:01:21.190> bit<00:01:21.430> of<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.580> grip<00:01:21.760> and<00:01:21.940> power<00:01:22.120> of<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
little bit of the grip and power of the

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.930 
little bit of the grip and power of the
other<00:01:23.200> style<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.710> 5050<00:01:24.159> but<00:01:24.580> you'd<00:01:24.760> gain

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
other style of 5050 but you'd gain

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.790 
other style of 5050 but you'd gain
something<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.720> that<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.350> makes<00:01:26.530> your<00:01:26.680> life

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
something and that is it makes your life

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.580 

another<00:01:36.130> example<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.970> that<00:01:37.210> type<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.660> 5050<00:01:38.170> ski

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
another example of that type of 5050 ski

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.520 
another example of that type of 5050 ski
is<00:01:38.980> this<00:01:39.250> new<00:01:39.460> snoop<00:01:39.700> daddy<00:01:40.000> from<00:01:40.240> atomic<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
is this new snoop daddy from atomic this

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.970 
is this new snoop daddy from atomic this
is<00:01:41.710> wide<00:01:42.150> flat<00:01:43.350> sovereign<00:01:44.350> flex<00:01:44.650> so<00:01:44.830> it's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
is wide flat sovereign flex so it's

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.330 
is wide flat sovereign flex so it's
definitely<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.580> soft<00:01:45.910> snow<00:01:46.150> bias<00:01:46.450> key<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:48.190> also

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
definitely a soft snow bias key it also

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.430 
definitely a soft snow bias key it also
has<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.640> twin<00:01:48.910> tip<00:01:49.120> now<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.990> shouldn't<00:01:50.320> think

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
has a twin tip now you shouldn't think

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.170 
has a twin tip now you shouldn't think
of<00:01:50.590> this<00:01:50.710> as<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.950> park<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.400> pipe<00:01:51.550> specialty

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
of this as a park and pipe specialty

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.240 
of this as a park and pipe specialty
scheme<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:53.229> is<00:01:53.470> definitely<00:01:54.070> an

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
scheme this is definitely an

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.250 
scheme this is definitely an
all-mountain<00:01:54.760> ski<00:01:55.150> but<00:01:55.510> what<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.840> twin<00:01:56.050> tip

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
all-mountain ski but what the twin tip

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.290 
all-mountain ski but what the twin tip
does<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:57.430> gives<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.910> ability<00:01:58.000> to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
does is it gives you the ability to

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.750 
does is it gives you the ability to
break<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:58.810> turnoff<00:01:59.020> smear<00:01:59.800> it<00:01:59.920> make<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:00.520> more

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
break the turnoff smear it make it more

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.150 
break the turnoff smear it make it more
maneuverable<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.510> moguls<00:02:01.930> so<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:02.979> do

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
maneuverable and moguls so you do

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.380 
maneuverable and moguls so you do
sacrifice<00:02:03.760> a<00:02:03.790> little<00:02:03.970> bit<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.270> running

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
sacrifice a little bit of running

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.240 
sacrifice a little bit of running
surface<00:02:04.869> it's<00:02:05.140> not<00:02:05.380> quite<00:02:05.649> as<00:02:05.800> grippy<00:02:06.130> and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
surface it's not quite as grippy and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.550 
surface it's not quite as grippy and
stable<00:02:06.670> as<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:06.940> others<00:02:07.240> but<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:08.170> gives<00:02:08.350> you

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
stable as the others but it gives you

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.370 
stable as the others but it gives you
some<00:02:08.739> benefits<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.429> off<00:02:09.580> trail<00:02:10.140> 5050<00:02:11.140> ski

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
some benefits in the off trail 5050 ski
