00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
you can like I I just thought of this

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.980 
you can like I I just thought of this
right<00:00:22.289> now<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:22.769> maybe<00:00:22.980> like<00:00:23.570> aim<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
right now but maybe like aim at the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.359 
right now but maybe like aim at the
bottom<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> stairs<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:26.039> press<00:00:26.220> up

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
bottom of the stairs and then press up

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.259 
bottom of the stairs and then press up
on<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> d-pad<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:28.580> make<00:00:29.580> them<00:00:29.820> run<00:00:30.029> their

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
on the d-pad to make them run their

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.840 
on the d-pad to make them run their
under<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.019> would<00:00:31.170> assume<00:00:31.610> walks<00:00:32.610> over

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
under which I would assume walks over

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.370 
under which I would assume walks over
that<00:00:33.000> visible<00:00:33.360> trip<00:00:33.570> line<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.989> activates

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
that visible trip line that activates

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.060 
that visible trip line that activates
them<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.140> we're<00:00:37.140> gonna<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.410> fighting<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
them and now we're gonna be fighting a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.560 
them and now we're gonna be fighting a
ton<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> these<00:00:38.969> Krogan<00:00:39.590> berserkers<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:42.270> they

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
ton of these Krogan berserkers so they

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.680 
ton of these Krogan berserkers so they
have<00:00:42.750> armor<00:00:43.200> shield<00:00:43.770> they<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.700> shields

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
have armor shield they have shields

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.450 
have armor shield they have shields
pantaloons<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:46.739> shields<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.370> they

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
pantaloons they have shields and they

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.970 
pantaloons they have shields and they
have<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> shitload<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.149> health<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.230> they

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
have a shitload of health so and they

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.709 
have a shitload of health so and they
don't<00:00:50.160> come<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.640> at<00:00:50.789> once<00:00:50.969> they<00:00:51.180> come<00:00:51.329> kind<00:00:51.629> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
don't come all at once they come kind of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.610 
don't come all at once they come kind of
staggered<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> found<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> best

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
staggered so what I found is the best

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.740 
staggered so what I found is the best
strategy<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.489> usually<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:57.270> good

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
strategy for this is usually one good

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.580 
strategy for this is usually one good
head<00:00:57.960> shot<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> sniper<00:00:58.739> rifle<00:01:00.590> will

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
head shot from the sniper rifle will

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.189 
head shot from the sniper rifle will
take<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.129> their<00:01:02.340> armor<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.019> can

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
take out their armor and then you can

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.010 
take out their armor and then you can
use<00:01:04.559> fish<00:01:04.890> sticks<00:01:05.299> to<00:01:06.299> lift<00:01:06.689> them<00:01:06.960> when<00:01:09.020> their

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
use fish sticks to lift them when their

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.560 
use fish sticks to lift them when their
armor<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.380> down<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> kind<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
armor is down and this is kind of a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.640 
armor is down and this is kind of a
weird<00:01:12.750> area<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> lot<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:14.869> um<00:01:15.869> like

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
weird area there's like a lot of um like

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.160 
weird area there's like a lot of um like
gaps<00:01:17.009> there's<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.060> two<00:01:18.270> long<00:01:18.570> platforms

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
gaps there's like two long platforms

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.420 
gaps there's like two long platforms
they<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.439> walk<00:01:19.560> across<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.040> usually<00:01:20.340> when

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
they can walk across and usually when

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.820 
they can walk across and usually when
fish<00:01:20.670> sticks<00:01:20.909> list<00:01:21.240> them<00:01:21.450> they<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.530> dropped

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
fish sticks list them they get dropped

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.620 
fish sticks list them they get dropped
right<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> pit<00:01:23.430> oh<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> only<00:01:24.360> shitty

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
right in the pit oh not the only shitty

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.140 
right in the pit oh not the only shitty
part<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.729> when<00:01:26.729> they<00:01:26.909> die

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
part about that is is that when they die

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.050 
part about that is is that when they die
they<00:01:27.450> drop<00:01:27.720> ammo<00:01:28.110> mm-hmm<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.670> miss<00:01:29.850> out

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
they drop ammo mm-hmm so so you miss out

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.359 
they drop ammo mm-hmm so so you miss out
you<00:01:30.390> probably<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> miss<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.189> some

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you probably going to miss out on some

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.200 
you probably going to miss out on some
ammo<00:01:32.930> but<00:01:34.070> by<00:01:35.070> far<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.610> easiest<00:01:35.640> way<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> kill

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
ammo but by far the easiest way to kill

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.700 
ammo but by far the easiest way to kill
these<00:01:36.329> guys<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.780> by<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.170> using<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.530> eyes

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

these guys is by just using your eyes
saving<00:01:38.159> ammo<00:01:38.310> by<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:39.049> wasting<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.210> having

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
saving ammo by not wasting it and having

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210 
saving ammo by not wasting it and having
fish<00:01:42.420> sticks<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.229> very<00:01:44.130> true

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
fish sticks to that is very true

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.390 
fish sticks to that is very true
actually<00:01:45.030> Oh

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
actually Oh
