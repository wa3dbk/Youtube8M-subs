00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.019
 Oh 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.500
 good 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.900
 e 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.320
 yo everybody these shocks that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.880
 how are you gonna tell me it's going nickel 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.960
 and today we find ourselves for 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.970
 new video so simply 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.350
 as you saw at the beginning of the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.000
 video I made a little parody of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 my character so it's not me who 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.300
 revamped it like that it's roots late in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.680
 this moment there is a little bug that is 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.210
 appeared on gta 5 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.040
 in fact there are quite a few players their 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.950
 characters to catch simply 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.000
 a bug either their characters change 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.830
 skin color for example 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.660
 before he was white and now 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.830
 he becomes black otherwise he is black he 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.229
 becomes white etc 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.370
 Ben me for my part my character is 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.140
 stayed the same color 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.090
 except that he became bald he had 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.590
 no more beard then sounded and menus 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.780
 very small it looks like he has even more 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.390
 Nose it moves it is pretty weird 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.830
 and his eyes are half- bridled so that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.600
 wolf really hp while my 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.800
 character 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.060
 I worked a lot on it for 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.830
 that they look like that so I tried 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.890
 to do it's ray etc for it to me 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.030
 looks like a maximum but good rockstar 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.550
 I do not know what they have in 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.200

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.180
