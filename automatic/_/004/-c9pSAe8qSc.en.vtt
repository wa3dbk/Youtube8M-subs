 the virtual follicle and it came out 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.050
 Felix was better in order to do this 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.480
 interview in the spinning of the equestrian cable 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.480
 very sensitized football all free 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.920
 for jiménez the autonomous head of yuste 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.920
 cross and chad hedrick evil 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.730
 the question of the talk then in that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.160
 part was on Tuesday a carbon cell and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.160
 let her go as she says 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:17.290
 with the disk 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.290

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.610

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.410

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:55.360
 you are the one in the mobile in the message 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.360
 adds a cable demo of the xerez briani 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.470
 d 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.009
 easy 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.780
 to line up a lot of people we carry is 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.230
 It is obvious that we have many games in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.300
 very few days but in this same week 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.830
 in seven days we had played three 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.930
 parties and in the third party the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.930
 team showed that he was physically 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.850
 well he could hold up well well 90 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.830
 minutes at a very intense intensity level 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.140
 high as required by the tie of the 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.600
 champions we see the team well we have 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.190
 given rest and physical work 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.200
 enough to get the best 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.730
 possible to the party we have all the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.470
 trust deposited in a party that 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.660
 for us it is very important because 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.360
 to win it we could put seconds 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.459
 and so we face it, I do not think that 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.580
 have to be an excuse the fact of 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.989
 have played many games and what is 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.220
 important is that tactically we are 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.930
 well and we are with the level of 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.120
 intensity and attitude we had in 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.100
 the last good home game I hope 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.720
 that the players arrive at the best 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.700
 possible state we have worked during 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.680
 the last weeks to get right to 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.209
 these as we discussed makes 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.840
 week when I was lucky enough to talk 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.010
 with you again and good we hope 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.290
 that the team arrives in the best 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.969
 conditions is difficult 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.400
 there are very few days of recovery for 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.349
 to be able to be at the best level but I 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.400
 I think the work we have done and the 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.349
 work that had been done with 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.060
 previously from good from the 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.510
 beginning of the season will allow 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.510
 the players 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.129
 of partners and vélez 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.020
 the thaw of the pill and then it's 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.020
 now 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:53.229
 but the result
