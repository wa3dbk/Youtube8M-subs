it on 3d ok you said yes we saw it in 3d

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.130 
it on 3d ok you said yes we saw it in 3d
um<00:01:41.350> it's<00:01:41.800> not<00:01:41.950> very<00:01:42.250> like<00:01:42.670> I<00:01:42.909> popping<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:43.990> the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
um it's not very like I popping is the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.930 
um it's not very like I popping is the
only<00:01:44.260> downfall<00:01:44.710> better<00:01:45.130> is<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.400> think<00:01:45.610> if<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.820> is

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
only downfall better is I think if it is

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.310 
only downfall better is I think if it is
coming<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.360> a<00:01:46.390> theater<00:01:46.720> near<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.170> you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
coming to a theater near you and you

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.020 
coming to a theater near you and you
can't<00:01:47.590> get<00:01:47.770> those<00:01:47.979> special<00:01:48.460> tickets<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.880> see

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
can't get those special tickets to see

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.820 
can't get those special tickets to see
it<00:01:49.120> in<00:01:49.240> 3d<00:01:49.600> it's<00:01:50.020> not<00:01:50.229> going<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.440> hurt<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:50.620> the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
it in 3d it's not going to hurt you the

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.830 
it in 3d it's not going to hurt you the
eye-popping<00:01:51.460> 3d<00:01:52.030> isn't<00:01:52.210> really<00:01:52.540> out<00:01:52.659> there

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
eye-popping 3d isn't really out there

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.480 
eye-popping 3d isn't really out there
until<00:01:53.020> like<00:01:53.320> maybe<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.710> stuff<00:01:54.190> thrown<00:01:54.370> the

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
until like maybe the stuff thrown the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.039 
until like maybe the stuff thrown the
credits<00:01:54.850> they<00:01:55.030> might<00:01:55.180> have<00:01:55.270> done<00:01:55.420> special<00:01:55.690> for

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
credits they might have done special for

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.020 
credits they might have done special for
the<00:01:56.110> 3d<00:01:56.440> yeah<00:01:56.830> but<00:01:57.490> other<00:01:57.610> than<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:57.909> think

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
the 3d yeah but other than that I think

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.050 
the 3d yeah but other than that I think
it's<00:01:58.240> mostly<00:01:58.600> just<00:01:58.690> you<00:01:59.530> know<00:01:59.650> it<00:01:59.880> enhances<00:02:00.880> it

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
it's mostly just you know it enhances it

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.120 
it's mostly just you know it enhances it
and<00:02:01.210> it's<00:02:01.330> very<00:02:01.510> close<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.870> a<00:02:02.350> lot<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:03.010> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
and it's very close to a lot of the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.490 
and it's very close to a lot of the
other<00:02:03.250> animated<00:02:03.850> cg<00:02:04.570> films<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:05.200> have<00:02:05.350> come

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
other animated cg films that have come

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
it i want to say other than like I just

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.110 
it i want to say other than like I just
think<00:06:10.040> the<00:06:10.100> advertising<00:06:10.610> campaign<00:06:10.940> was<00:06:11.090> a

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
think the advertising campaign was a

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.930 
think the advertising campaign was a
little<00:06:11.330> too<00:06:11.450> in-your-face<00:06:12.220> uh<00:06:13.220> but<00:06:13.700> but<00:06:13.730> I've

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
little too in-your-face uh but but I've

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.670 
little too in-your-face uh but but I've
it<00:06:14.120> really<00:06:14.150> touched<00:06:14.660> on<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.020> plot<00:06:15.320> at<00:06:15.530> all

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
it really touched on the plot at all

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.740

which<00:06:16.070> I<00:06:16.250> kind<00:06:16.580> of<00:06:16.640> like<00:06:17.060> I<00:06:17.270> guess<00:06:17.450> because<00:06:17.600> I

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
which I kind of like I guess because I

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.850 
which I kind of like I guess because I
didn't<00:06:17.990> know<00:06:18.080> what<00:06:18.260> this<00:06:18.380> yeah<00:06:18.560> I<00:06:18.590> didn't<00:06:18.800> know
