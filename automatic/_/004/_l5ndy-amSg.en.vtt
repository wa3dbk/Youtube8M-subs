00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
hopefully not the problem all season I

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.180 
hopefully not the problem all season I
think<00:05:03.720> has<00:05:03.900> been<00:05:04.050> defensive<00:05:04.350> and<00:05:04.889> have<00:05:05.070> given

think has been defensive and have given

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.700 
think has been defensive and have given
way<00:05:05.460> too<00:05:05.520> many<00:05:05.880> goals<00:05:06.120> all<00:05:06.780> runs<00:05:07.139> teams<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.650> the

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
way too many goals all runs teams in the

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.830 
way too many goals all runs teams in the
past<00:05:07.919> can<00:05:08.130> score<00:05:08.430> goals<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:08.940> in<00:05:09.240> Dublin<00:05:09.720> and

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
past can score goals and in Dublin and

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.719 
past can score goals and in Dublin and
Wieland<00:05:10.289> they've<00:05:10.740> got<00:05:10.919> players<00:05:11.160> that<00:05:11.460> really

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
Wieland they've got players that really

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.490 
Wieland they've got players that really
can<00:05:11.910> do<00:05:12.030> that<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.389> I<00:05:12.510> think<00:05:12.539> over<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.470> next

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
can do that and I think over the next

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.320 
can do that and I think over the next
four<00:05:13.830> games<00:05:13.860> if<00:05:14.340> they<00:05:14.370> can<00:05:14.610> put<00:05:14.760> that<00:05:14.880> defense

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
four games if they can put that defense

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.390 
four games if they can put that defense
stays<00:05:15.960> solid<00:05:16.229> and<00:05:16.530> have<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.680> good<00:05:16.889> run<00:05:17.099> of<00:05:17.250> the
