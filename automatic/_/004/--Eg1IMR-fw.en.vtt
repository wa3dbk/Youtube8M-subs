00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
I think that's a little bit less than

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.719 
I think that's a little bit less than
the<00:01:54.840> live<00:01:55.140> sessions<00:01:55.740> he<00:01:55.890> was<00:01:56.009> offering<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.549> few

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the live sessions he was offering a few

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.160 
the live sessions he was offering a few
years<00:01:56.939> ago<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.180> think<00:01:57.479> those<00:01:57.630> were<00:01:57.810> set<00:01:58.049> at

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
years ago I think those were set at

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.350 
years ago I think those were set at
about<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.680> don't<00:01:59.549> remember<00:01:59.759> exactly<00:02:00.149> maybe

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
about I don't remember exactly maybe

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.429 
about I don't remember exactly maybe
about<00:02:00.570> $800<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.670> 495<00:02:03.229> dollars<00:02:04.229> does

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
about $800 or so and so 495 dollars does

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.119 
about $800 or so and so 495 dollars does
seem<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.159> great<00:02:05.969> opportunity<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.600> learn

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
seem like a great opportunity to learn

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:10.210 
seem like a great opportunity to learn

out<00:02:34.200> how<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:34.410> develop<00:02:34.739> as<00:02:35.069> an<00:02:35.220> architect

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
out how to develop as an architect

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.630 
out how to develop as an architect
number<00:02:36.599> two<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.930> titled<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.379> big<00:02:37.560> idea<00:02:37.980> he's

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
number two is titled the big idea he's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.670 
number two is titled the big idea he's
gonna<00:02:38.879> review<00:02:39.299> seven<00:02:39.690> prototypes<00:02:40.230> which<00:02:40.500> I

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
gonna review seven prototypes which I

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.800 
gonna review seven prototypes which I
guess<00:02:40.890> will<00:02:41.099> be<00:02:41.160> seven<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.299> projects<00:02:42.750> that

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
guess will be seven of the projects that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.120 
guess will be seven of the projects that
mr.<00:02:43.319> Segal<00:02:43.650> has<00:02:43.799> done<00:02:44.750> number<00:02:45.750> three<00:02:46.130> you're

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
mr. Segal has done number three you're

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.350 
mr. Segal has done number three you're
gonna<00:02:47.220> dive<00:02:47.519> into<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.940> development

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
gonna dive into the development

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.449 
gonna dive into the development
strategies<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.260> different<00:02:49.459> development

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
strategies and different development

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.370 
strategies and different development
types<00:02:50.730> now<00:02:51.450> I'm<00:02:51.599> hoping<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.079> there<00:02:52.230> will<00:02:52.349> be

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
types now I'm hoping that there will be

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.050 
types now I'm hoping that there will be
a<00:02:52.500> little<00:02:52.769> bit<00:02:52.890> more<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.519> little<00:02:53.819> bit<00:02:53.970> of

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
a little bit more of a little bit of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.660 
a little bit more of a little bit of
market<00:02:54.420> research<00:02:54.569> here<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.200> how<00:02:55.860> an<00:02:56.250> architect

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
market research here to how an architect

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.460 
market research here to how an architect
goes<00:02:56.760> about<00:02:57.030> figuring<00:02:57.450> out<00:02:57.630> what<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.049> market

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
goes about figuring out what the market

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.309 
goes about figuring out what the market
is<00:02:58.590> looking<00:02:58.920> for<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.400> terms<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.760> development

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
is looking for in terms of development

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.839 
is looking for in terms of development
number<00:03:01.319> four<00:03:01.560> looks<00:03:01.799> extremely<00:03:02.280> important

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
number four looks extremely important

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.970 
number four looks extremely important

architects

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.090 
architects
we<00:04:26.790> have<00:04:26.940> an<00:04:27.060> amazing<00:04:27.600> skill<00:04:28.380> set<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.919> lends

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
we have an amazing skill set that lends

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.890 
we have an amazing skill set that lends
itself<00:04:29.400> well<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.810> increasing<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.560> value<00:04:32.190> and

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
itself well to increasing the value and

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.120 
itself well to increasing the value and
bettering<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.080> built<00:04:34.290> environment<00:04:34.949> and<00:04:35.010> I

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
bettering the built environment and I

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.770 
bettering the built environment and I
think<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:35.550> what<00:04:35.669> mr.<00:04:35.820> Siegel's<00:04:36.330> done<00:04:36.540> is

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
think that what mr. Siegel's done is

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.409 
think that what mr. Siegel's done is
something<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:37.860> could<00:04:38.310> be<00:04:38.520> applied<00:04:39.210> on<00:04:39.389> a

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
something that could be applied on a

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.900 
something that could be applied on a
smaller<00:04:39.810> scale<00:04:40.139> across<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.740> US<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.370> just

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
smaller scale across the US and just

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.730 
smaller scale across the US and just
make<00:04:42.060> our<00:04:42.240> cities<00:04:42.540> more<00:04:42.570> beautiful<00:04:43.110> places<00:04:43.350> so

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
make our cities more beautiful places so
