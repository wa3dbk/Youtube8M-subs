 and the peculiarity of this casio model and how to integrate also sensors 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.570
 of movement that allow to track the position 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.840
 if gps signal should be people we think of all the times 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.570
 come into a museum how many when we turn on the car we're bernva 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.490

 the machine traceability movement and once we are outside through 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.800
