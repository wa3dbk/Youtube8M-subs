00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
MALE SPEAKER: Today on Urban
Gardener, a Manhattan

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.520
foundation planting.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.280
One of the things that leaps
out at me about this

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.740
particular design is the
control and release.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.980
You have a really controlled
border all the way around.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.270
It's very square.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.140
And then you have the release
of this grass right here.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.760
So this tree is a lot smaller.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.570
It's most likely that one of the
trees just didn't make it,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.775
and so they've had
to replace it.

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:00.590
But that offers us an
opportunity, because there's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.130
not as much of a root
ball here, and

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.430
there's not as much shade.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.390
You can put flowers in
here that need a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.640
little bit more light.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.240
There's one last feature
down here, which is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.310
this elevated garden.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.480
We've made these plants that
we might have seen before

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.450
appear new, because they're
at eye level right here.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.270
So for this river birch, we get
to see the bark instead of

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.520
just the foliage.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.730
FEMALE SPEAKER: This one
is four years old.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.910
The very first planting we
did was the most gorgeous

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.041
rhododendron.

00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:39.325
It was so symmetrical,
and it was in bloom.

00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:40.700
It was gorgeous.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.145
The day after we put it in,
the whole plant was gone.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:44.850
MALE SPEAKER: Somebody just--

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: They
took it, yeah.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.800
MALE SPEAKER: --ripped it out?

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: People come by,
and they take a flower or

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.360
two or three.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.870
You can get crazy about that, or
you could just say, that's

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.860
because they love it.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.105
This is our best area, because
we have this window of light.

00:01:59.105 --> 00:01:59.890
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's really
tricky because different parts

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.680
of the garden are more
sunny than others.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.500
Years ago, it was much more
light, and as the tall

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.380
buildings came, the more
shading everything out.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.275
We tried to compensate.

00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:13.210
We pruned some of these trees.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.870
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.606
FEMALE SPEAKER: And that
helped a little bit.

00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:15.360
MALE SPEAKER: To let
some-- yeah.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: To let
some more light in.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.310
For me, the keyword
is pleasure.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.915
Everybody is really happy
that they see this.

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:29.440
When they leave and when
they come back.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.570
It's a counterweight to living
in the Big Apple.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.660
MALE SPEAKER: Well, thank you so
much for walking me through

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.290
the garden.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.260
It's been such a pleasure
to meet you.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.700
OK, great.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.950
Same here.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.232
MALE SPEAKER: See you next
time on Urban Gardener.

00:02:51.232 --> 00:02:53.200

that we have more subscribers

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.713

00:02:54.713 --> 00:02:55.460
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: No.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.460
