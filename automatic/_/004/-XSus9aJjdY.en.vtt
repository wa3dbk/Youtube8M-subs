the things you want to do with them you

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.620 
the things you want to do with them you
can<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.599> layers<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.439> quite<00:00:31.710> nice<00:00:32.630> so

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
can do layers on this is quite nice so

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.790 
can do layers on this is quite nice so
you<00:00:33.719> might<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.989> character's<00:00:34.350> got<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> very

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you might have a character's got a very

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.069 
you might have a character's got a very
round<00:00:35.280> belly<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.329> might<00:00:36.540> find<00:00:36.570> that

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
round belly that you might find that

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.010 
round belly that you might find that
when<00:00:37.770> you're<00:00:37.920> looking<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:38.190> your<00:00:38.309> character

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
when you're looking at your character

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.540 
when you're looking at your character
walking<00:00:40.020> along<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> hands<00:00:40.950> are<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.129> for

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
walking along the hands are going for

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.770 
walking along the hands are going for
decided<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.120> his<00:00:43.789> stomach<00:00:44.789> or<00:00:44.940> hips<00:00:45.600> or

decided if his stomach or hips or

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
decided if his stomach or hips or
whatever<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.469> need<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> sort<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.039> move

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
whatever so you need to sort of move

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.779 
whatever so you need to sort of move
with<00:00:47.940> arms<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.660> might<00:00:49.460> have<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> good

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
with arms out now you might have a good

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.750 
with arms out now you might have a good
motion<00:00:51.000> capture<00:00:51.539> file<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:53.160> basic<00:00:53.610> walk

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
motion capture file or this basic walk

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
motion capture file or this basic walk
cycle<00:00:54.090> might<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> good<00:00:54.570> starting<00:00:55.020> point<00:00:55.230> do

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
cycle might be a good starting point do

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.229 
cycle might be a good starting point do
you<00:00:55.710> want<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> keep<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.100> arm<00:00:56.370> swings<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.969> there

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you want to keep the arm swings in there

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
you want to keep the arm swings in there
all<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.020> want<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> do<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.469> move<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
all you really want to do is move the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.630 
all you really want to do is move the
arms<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.309> but<00:01:00.059> keep<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> swings<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:02.489> an

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
arms out but keep the swings going so an

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.359 
arms out but keep the swings going so an
easy<00:01:02.789> way<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.390> would<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.250> jump<00:01:05.250> out

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
easy way to do that would be to jump out

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.060 
easy way to do that would be to jump out
of<00:01:05.570> footstep<00:01:06.570> mode<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:07.770> layers

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
of footstep mode and go and use layers

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.190 
of footstep mode and go and use layers
so<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:08.880> we're<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.570> we're<00:01:10.080> going

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.250 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.380> say<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> new<00:01:11.460> layer<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.330> call<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.689> arms

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
to go say a new layer and call this arms

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.280 
to go say a new layer and call this arms
a<00:01:13.439> rms<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:15.000> our<00:01:15.180> new<00:01:15.299> arms<00:01:15.689> let's<00:01:15.930> switch<00:01:16.110> off

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
a rms so our new arms let's switch off

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.580 
a rms so our new arms let's switch off
caps<00:01:16.560> lock<00:01:16.820> actually<00:01:17.930> don't<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.140> caps<00:01:19.380> lock

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
caps lock actually don't not caps lock

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.730 
caps lock actually don't not caps lock
on<00:01:19.680> okay<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.840> see<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.409> red

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
on okay and what you can see now in red

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.789 
on okay and what you can see now in red
is<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.270> original<00:01:24.320> animation<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
is the original animation of the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.249 
is the original animation of the
previous<00:01:26.640> layer<00:01:26.939> which<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.720> footstep

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
previous layer which is the footstep

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.499 
previous layer which is the footstep
driven<00:01:28.560> liar<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> layer<00:01:29.880> above<00:01:30.299> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
driven liar this is a layer above that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.990 
driven liar this is a layer above that
called<00:01:30.869> arms<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.579> we're<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:32.970> back

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
called arms and we're going to go back

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.130 
called arms and we're going to go back
to<00:01:33.299> zero<00:01:33.930> turn<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.710> AutoKey<00:01:35.810> collect<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.020> of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to zero turn on AutoKey collect one of

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.649 
to zero turn on AutoKey collect one of
the

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
the

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.240 
the
upper<00:01:39.659> arms<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.500> basically<00:01:40.680> organ<00:01:41.130> do

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
upper arms and then basically organ do

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.539 
upper arms and then basically organ do
is<00:01:41.310> rotate<00:01:41.760> it<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.299> frame<00:01:42.540> 0<00:01:43.310> slightly<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
is rotate it out in frame 0 slightly and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.149 
is rotate it out in frame 0 slightly and
grab<00:01:45.330> this<00:01:45.479> guy<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.990> take<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.920> guy<00:01:47.130> out

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
grab this guy I take that guy out

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.999 
grab this guy I take that guy out
slightly<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:48.030> well<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.990> switch<00:01:49.290> auto<00:01:49.500> k<00:01:49.830> off

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
slightly as well as switch auto k off

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.430 
slightly as well as switch auto k off
and<00:01:50.640> now<00:01:50.820> we've<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.330> is<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:52.080> have<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.259> same

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
and now we've got is you have the same

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.320 
and now we've got is you have the same
walk<00:01:52.740> cycle<00:01:54.350> but<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.560> arms<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.009> now<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.640> but

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
walk cycle but the arms are now out but

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.680 
walk cycle but the arms are now out but
they<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:57.479> still<00:01:57.800> animated<00:01:59.149> yeah<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.390> again

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
they are still animated yeah and again

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.630 
they are still animated yeah and again
you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.049> add<00:02:01.259> another<00:02:01.740> layer<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.520> as

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you can add another layer to that as

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.030 
you can add another layer to that as
well<00:02:02.670> go<00:02:03.270> back<00:02:03.420> down<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.659> here<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.799> that

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
well go back down to here and that

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.559 
well go back down to here and that
another<00:02:05.250> layer<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.880> we'll<00:02:06.149> call<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.570> head

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
another layer and we'll call this head

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.690 
another layer and we'll call this head
okay<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.869> return<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.250> select<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
okay and return on that and select the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.280 
okay and return on that and select the
head<00:02:11.970> would<00:02:12.330> make<00:02:12.510> sense<00:02:12.690> wouldn't<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.050> it's

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
head would make sense wouldn't it it's

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.710 
head would make sense wouldn't it it's
cool<00:02:13.500> head<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:13.950> we'll<00:02:14.640> hit<00:02:14.790> auto<00:02:15.060> key<00:02:15.420> again

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
cool head and we'll hit auto key again

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.070 
cool head and we'll hit auto key again
then<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:16.769> can<00:02:16.890> sort<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.160> make<00:02:17.600> him<00:02:18.600> look<00:02:18.780> over

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
then we can sort of make him look over

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.890 
then we can sort of make him look over
there<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:20.820> make<00:02:21.030> him<00:02:21.060> look<00:02:21.650> over<00:02:22.650> there

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
there and then make him look over there

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.960 
there and then make him look over there
there<00:02:24.900> we<00:02:24.959> go<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.380> sort<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.370> making<00:02:26.700> sort<00:02:26.910> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
there we go I sort of making sort of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.890 
there we go I sort of making sort of
there<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:28.050> go<00:02:28.640> okay<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.209> what<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.630> now<00:02:30.840> we

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
there we go okay so what we have now we

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.570 
there we go okay so what we have now we
have<00:02:31.110> three<00:02:31.410> layers<00:02:31.769> running<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.489> he's

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
have three layers running so he's

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.020 
have three layers running so he's
looking<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:34.019> he's<00:02:34.080> looking<00:02:34.260> over<00:02:34.590> there<00:02:35.030> okay

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
looking and he's looking over there okay

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.509 
looking and he's looking over there okay
right<00:02:37.019> what<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:37.860> very<00:02:38.250> similar<00:02:38.430> to

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
right what you can do very similar to

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.130 
right what you can do very similar to
photoshop<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.300> actually<00:02:39.480> merge<00:02:39.840> these

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
photoshop you can actually merge these

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.750 
photoshop you can actually merge these
layers<00:02:40.200> down<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.010> we're<00:02:41.190> going<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.370> do<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.640> with

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
layers down so we're going to do it with

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.240 
layers down so we're going to do it with
that<00:02:41.880> we<00:02:42.540> we<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.440> use<00:02:43.829> a<00:02:43.860> tool<00:02:44.220> called

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
that we we can use a tool called

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.300 
that we we can use a tool called
collapse<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:45.750> going<00:02:45.959> collapse<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.440> now<00:02:46.709> I'll

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
collapse so going collapse this now I'll

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.479 
collapse so going collapse this now I'll
go<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.549> collapse<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.000> down<00:02:49.130> but<00:02:50.130> we<00:02:50.250> end<00:02:50.370> up

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
go and collapse that down but we end up

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.470 
go and collapse that down but we end up
now<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:51.030> we<00:02:51.390> end<00:02:51.480> up<00:02:51.690> with<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:52.140> walk<00:02:53.070> cycle<00:02:53.610> which

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
now is we end up with a walk cycle which

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.770 
now is we end up with a walk cycle which
is<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.430> single<00:02:56.640> bit<00:02:56.940> phone<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.329> one<00:02:57.510> layer

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
is just a single bit phone on one layer

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.319 
is just a single bit phone on one layer
move<00:02:58.530> them<00:02:58.829> merge<00:02:59.430> those<00:02:59.640> layers<00:02:59.910> down<00:03:00.120> into

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
move them merge those layers down into

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.000 
move them merge those layers down into
one<00:03:00.480> layer<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.110> quite<00:03:01.440> easy<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.709> running

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
one layer so it's quite easy to running

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.830 
one layer so it's quite easy to running
right<00:03:02.130> now<00:03:02.160> simple<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.660> that's

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
right now simple as that so that's

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.970 
right now simple as that so that's
basically<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.650> quick<00:03:05.340> look<00:03:05.519> at<00:03:05.640> layers
