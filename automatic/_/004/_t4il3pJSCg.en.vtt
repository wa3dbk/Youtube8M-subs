00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
that you can make your own so those are

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.280 
that you can make your own so those are
the<00:01:57.860> tools<00:01:58.160> and<00:01:58.520> we're<00:01:59.510> going<00:01:59.930> to<00:01:59.990> go<00:02:00.140> about

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
the tools and we're going to go about

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.090 
the tools and we're going to go about
just<00:02:01.280> getting<00:02:02.150> down<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:02.870> the<00:02:03.020> bottom<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.620> it's

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
just getting down in the bottom and it's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.520 
just getting down in the bottom and it's
good<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.610> get<00:02:04.760> around<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.660> back<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.350> the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
good to get around the back of the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.700 
good to get around the back of the
bobbin<00:02:07.070> all<00:02:08.060> those<00:02:08.479> hard-to-reach<00:02:08.960> places

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
bobbin all those hard-to-reach places

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.790 
bobbin all those hard-to-reach places
because<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.520> lint<00:02:10.820> really<00:02:11.420> piles<00:02:11.990> up<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.530> it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
because that lint really piles up and it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.960 
because that lint really piles up and it
takes<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.430> oil<00:02:13.670> out<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.060> your<00:02:14.360> sewing<00:02:14.720> machine
