00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.460
 Hi, girls, how are you doing? 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.170
 it's good this time I come to do it 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.090
 it's a gnocchi recipe I do not know if all 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.740
 they know what is but good in this case 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.400
 let's make my x of potatoes 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.500
 I hope you try this recipe and then 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.930
 tell me how are you doing and the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.450
 ingredients are very few and basic 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:46.510
 use one potato per person and here we have 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.790
 three potatoes in this case we serve it and 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.760
 when they are already soft when they already 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.640
 comes easy fork or knife and 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.339
 is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.149
 these three potatoes we removed the water by 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.789
 course and we're going to make a puree without 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:08.100
 milk without milk or water or anything we're going 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:12.490
 to add an egg a hole and let's 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.280
 step on the preparation once you already 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.890
 have stepped in this way without 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.710
 add milk or water I repeat is only 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.509
 with the egg we are going to flavor it with 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.130
 what you want me in this case 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.229
 I'm going to put a little salt 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.170
 little because he already had the potatoes when 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.170
 Servis and I will add a little 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.720
 4 condiments that are this pepper 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.720
 it is not moscada 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.150
 The more sought after 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.700
 I do not remember, I'm going to leave them in the 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.710
 screen but the envelope is already sold 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.720
 so here 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.310
 once we season well we continue 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.050
 stepping for this to be integrated 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:05.150
 and we are going to add two cups 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.580
 of leavening flour 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.490
 two cups of homemade leavening flour that 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.690
 is the one that I have open two cups to the 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.030
 preparation and then we integrate the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.150
 flour we stir a little bit we overturn it 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.070
 on the counter and start kneading 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.730
 good I show you this has been my cup 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.080
 a cup normal size medium 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.930
 add two cups of rising flour 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.300
 it has to be it if it can not be 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.209
 common flour with a teaspoon of 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.780
 royal powder but has to make flour 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.370
 leaner so they are lighter if 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.610
 we make with common flour in what is left 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.410
 heavier and tends to stick too 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.150
 however if we do it with him with 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.030
 leavening flour we have much more 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.450
 capable envelope that you can take 20 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.500
 dishes instead of 5 because if the truth 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.390
 that is spectacularly good we mix 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.470
 so 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.650
 of the flour with the mash that was 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.900
 I was already in the pot 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.210
 and now it's preparation we're going to 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.430
 dump over the counter and we're going to 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.470
 knead until when it is formed 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.150
 a compact mass that I'm going to 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.100
 show there are many good girls the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.860
 consistency of slats is this you are going 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.780
 adding lina obviously as you 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.420
 they are progressing because they need because 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.890
 the same humidity of the potato is going 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.050
 asking for more salt 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.690
 they add it and they form this mass that 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.090
 you do not have to stick to see perfect then 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.100
 they are cutting small pieces of dough 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.450
 for example like this and we're going 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.690
 making a band-aid 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.740
 Band-aid we're going to cut pieces 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.230
 to eyes depends on the size you want 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.510
 I do not recommend children to do it 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.360
 too big but the size that 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.110
 Let's say 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.940
 and others think 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.750
 It has four and a half centimeters 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.750
 no more than that 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.080
 we are cutting the whole strip 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.769
 prior to this we must have a 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.989
 roaster that we are going to place a 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.030
 little bit of flour in the background because 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.220
 these blocks have to rest 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.010
 We can not put them in the pot 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.409
 directly because they stick well 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.239
 what 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:34.600
 I advise you to put them in a 

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:37.870
 asadera 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.200
 and let them rest how much and the minimum 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.810
 15 minutes minimum 15 minutes and you're done 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.090
 what are they going to do now that I do not know if what 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.380
 I will be able to 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:54.610
 is to slide the child by the fork to 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.889
 that is a certain way now I think 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.350
 that there we go well what we do is 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.670
 this is what we have, we make it roll 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.670
 and it just falls 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.900
 we simply support a little 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.620
 we passed it with the fork so that it has 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.830
 We can also leave this form as 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.470
 this but the Yaquis have this form 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.490
 At least here in Argentina they see them 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.030
 the fork marks 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.410
 and on the other side as a small gap 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:31.050
 they say that this is what takes away the 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.050
 air to the dough and makes them even softer 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.560
 there are others who say that only 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.830
 tradition I like to do it so 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.970
 I learned and I learned them how to do it 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.220
 He taught my mom and my grandmother also my 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.840
 Grandma made them from pumpkin but to me 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.930
 I do not like pumpkin I like 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.419
 father 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.630
 I seem much richer much more 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.770
 tasty this is mine kiss the can 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:01.710
 accompany if they want only with cheese 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.930
 grated cheese on top and if you like 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.270
 some sauce the sauce that you 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.340
 want me in this case I'm going to 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.970
 accompany with a tomato sauce 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:15.509
 simply but you can put 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:17.729
 I do not know four cheeses the sauce that 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:20.160
 you like it I will continue 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.250
 completing the wood I think I have 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.759
 dough for other broiler more and then they 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.759
 I'm going to show 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:34.080
 the things girls here more open two 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.880
 full trays for and I have one 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.360
 little more mass but it is to 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.770
 order that for us three is fine 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.440
 but I'm going to let you rest a little bit 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.610
 then and then 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.539
 we are going to have to place a pot with 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:53.090
 and water of course a handful of a 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.840
 handful not a tablespoon more or 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.840
 less coarse salt 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.450
 and two tablespoons of oil 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.910
 we let it boil and when the water 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.880
 be boiling 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:10.130
 we throw the yucca if they want they can 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.810
 do all together if you can not do it 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.030
 in two batches for example a tray 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.730
 first and the other tray after and to 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:20.600
 touch when the only thing that comes up is because 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:23.480
 it is already going to take nothing is a minute a 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.970
 minute and a half and they are going to be 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.129
 the sauce that you choose or otherwise 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:32.309
 simply with grated cheese 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:36.319
 and there I'll show you the theme of 

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:36.319
 the cooking and the finished dish 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:55.830
 i 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.830
