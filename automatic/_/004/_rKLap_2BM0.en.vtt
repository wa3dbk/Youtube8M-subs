00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.770
 a very nice biennial with my grandfather 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.959
 farruco with my father my mother my people 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.570
 where I was lucky to share not 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:15.119
 only with them but with all the people of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.390
 triana pure much that even today no 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.939
 is it so 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.500
 and if not half each and in the 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.960
 last dance for loneliness of my grandfather 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 that I dance with him after they left 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.430
 all the old ones of pure triana 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.410
 you live in my experience when you 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.650
 together with the treatment as a 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.650
 experience 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.070
 ah 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:53.050
 as if what we sing to what each 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.050
 year gets 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.570
 here 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.860
 Hahaha 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.070
 but also with what man shows 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.070
 that's why I try to feel like fighting 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.040
 that above the genre is the boss and 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.740
 the capacity of the human being that all 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.860
 we recognize since man is 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.860
 man 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.990
 the biennial of flamenco in my career 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.490
 It has been very important because 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.890
 I was born there as a dancer because 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.360
 they have created the shows for me 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.360
 flourishes as a bailaora 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.160
 I was from Zela with my father for me 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
 a 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.730
 a very big emotion is not the 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:29.030
 whole family on stage a very city 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.590
 important the guitar flamenco dancer 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.590
 all art 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.459
 to 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.250
 and sevilla in followed in triana for me 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.890
 it's my land here there are great artists 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.810
 the same as there is in Andalusia but in 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.990
 sevilla I think there is a flavor 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.990
 special 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.390
 flavio nall for me when I was 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:12.689
 young lady meant a lot meant 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.010
 a lot because a one was held 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.010
 wonderful performance 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.420
 where was the lebrijano shrimp 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.500
 and I also dance of course and to 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.190
 I was impressive but that to the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.280
 young people cause you the same 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.020
 and the same feeling when you work 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.410
 with people since we are already 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.410
 consecrated 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.750
 do not 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.810
 The final of Seville is undoubtedly the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.480
 showcase perfect and desired by all 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.610
 those that we have the great luck of 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.040
 devote ourselves functionally to the world of 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.060
 flamenco with sevilla is the stone 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.860
 angle of flamenco a city that has 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.860
 given a lot to flamenco and to me 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.900
 personally also and every time 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.940
 I have the opportunity to be in this 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.940
 I try to take advantage of them
