00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
thing to do I keep your head down I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.119 
thing to do I keep your head down I
think<00:02:10.170> keep<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.379> from<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.649> slamming<00:02:11.039> your

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
think keep you from just slamming your

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.930 
think keep you from just slamming your
head<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> ground

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
head on the ground

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.589 
head on the ground
so<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:13.080> full<00:02:13.500> pull<00:02:13.920> pull<00:02:14.599> it's

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
so like this a full pull pull it's

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.440 
so like this a full pull pull it's
pretty<00:02:16.370> pretty<00:02:17.370> easy<00:02:17.670> easier<00:02:18.120> than<00:02:18.329> it<00:02:18.390> looks

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
pretty pretty easy easier than it looks

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.900 
pretty pretty easy easier than it looks
but<00:02:19.440> only<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.680> far<00:02:19.860> part<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.280> actually<00:02:20.370> grabbing

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
but only a far part is actually grabbing

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.420 
but only a far part is actually grabbing
that<00:02:21.000> leg<00:02:21.209> now<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:21.989> me<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.739> still
