00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.109 
Street comm today let's have a look at
the<00:00:23.720> line<00:00:23.990> 6<00:00:24.380> and<00:00:24.560> 9<00:00:25.040> and<00:00:25.400> what<00:00:25.700> you<00:00:25.820> can<00:00:25.970> do

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
the line 6 and 9 and what you can do

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.679 
the line 6 and 9 and what you can do
with<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.390> looper<00:00:26.779> that's<00:00:27.080> built<00:00:27.290> into<00:00:27.560> them<00:00:27.800> 9

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
with the looper that's built into them 9

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.420 
with the looper that's built into them 9
so<00:00:29.689> what<00:00:30.050> I'm<00:00:30.110> going<00:00:30.290> to<00:00:30.349> do<00:00:30.529> here<00:00:30.830> is<00:00:31.040> to

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
so what I'm going to do here is to

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.790 
so what I'm going to do here is to
create<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.090> loop<00:00:32.269> based<00:00:33.050> on<00:00:33.230> a<00:00:33.260> simple<00:00:33.530> base

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
create the loop based on a simple base

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.820 
create the loop based on a simple base
line<00:00:34.129> and<00:00:34.600> then<00:00:35.600> I<00:00:35.629> will<00:00:35.840> layer<00:00:36.050> some<00:00:36.500> guitars

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
line and then I will layer some guitars

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.450 
line and then I will layer some guitars
on<00:00:37.040> top<00:00:37.190> of<00:00:37.370> that<00:00:37.930> so<00:00:38.930> I<00:00:38.960> have<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:39.440> have<00:00:39.769> my<00:00:39.800> basic

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
on top of that so I have I have my basic

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.290 
on top of that so I have I have my basic
sound<00:00:41.030> selected<00:00:41.750> for<00:00:41.930> my<00:00:42.080> bass<00:00:42.830> guitar

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
sound selected for my bass guitar

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.390 
sound selected for my bass guitar
imitation<00:00:44.300> I'll<00:00:44.960> press<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.650> hold<00:00:45.890> for<00:00:46.070> looper

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
imitation I'll press the hold for looper

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.310 
imitation I'll press the hold for looper
button<00:00:46.670> over<00:00:46.879> here<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.989> enter<00:00:48.379> looper<00:00:49.190> mode

over here and when I press this button
the<00:01:00.079> second<00:01:00.500> time<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:01.670> will<00:01:02.000> create<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:02.539> end

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
the second time it will create the end

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.689 
the second time it will create the end
point<00:01:03.289> for<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.710> loop<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.399> loops<00:01:04.580> it

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
point for the loop and in the loops it

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.620 
point for the loop and in the loops it
will<00:01:04.820> start<00:01:05.089> playing<00:01:05.619> so<00:01:06.619> let's<00:01:06.770> try<00:01:07.039> out<00:01:07.190> I

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
will start playing so let's try out I

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.880 
will start playing so let's try out I
will<00:01:08.630> need<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.960> practice<00:01:09.410> a<00:01:09.470> little<00:01:09.680> bit<00:01:09.770> by

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
will need to practice a little bit by

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.529 
will need to practice a little bit by
rhythm<00:01:10.750> before<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:12.020> actually<00:01:12.440> hit<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.100> button

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
a bit of delay to that time and then

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.850 
a bit of delay to that time and then
I'll<00:02:11.250> add<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> third<00:02:11.910> or<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.660> second<00:02:13.080> guitar<00:02:13.769> on
