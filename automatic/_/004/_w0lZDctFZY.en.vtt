of acoustic plane how do you go about

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.909 
of acoustic plane how do you go about
achieving<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.790> tone<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.480> desire<00:00:06.930> on<00:00:07.290> an

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
that for me personally what the problem

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.749 
that for me personally what the problem
is<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:23.159> been<00:01:23.310> currently

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
is is that I'm I have been currently

is is that I'm I have been currently
over<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.030> last<00:01:24.150> number<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.570> years<00:01:24.630> working

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
over the last number of years working

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.069 
over the last number of years working
hard<00:01:25.439> at<00:01:25.830> trying<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.530> impersonate<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.860> vocalist

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
hard at trying to impersonate a vocalist

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.300 
hard at trying to impersonate a vocalist
so<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.549> am<00:01:32.549> singing<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.810> playing<00:01:34.220> into<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
so I am singing and playing into the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.890 
so I am singing and playing into the
same<00:01:35.549> harmonica<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.970> very<00:01:39.600> little

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
same harmonica and I have very little

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.950 
same harmonica and I have very little
volume<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> very<00:01:41.369> muffled<00:01:42.360> voice<00:01:42.570> at

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
volume I I have a very muffled voice at

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.359 
volume I I have a very muffled voice at
least<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.290> think<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.729> happens<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
least I think so and so what happens is

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.810 
least I think so and so what happens is
if<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.729> microphone<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.659> EQ<00:01:49.590> differently<00:01:50.520> if

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
if the microphone is EQ differently if

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.819 
if the microphone is EQ differently if
it's<00:01:50.970> eq'd<00:01:52.909> darker<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.210> bright<00:01:55.020> treble<00:01:55.680> is

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
it's eq'd darker the bright treble is

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.039 
it's eq'd darker the bright treble is
rolled<00:01:56.070> off<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:57.060> when<00:01:57.270> I'm<00:01:57.390> trying<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.750> sing

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
rolled off then when I'm trying to sing

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.719 
rolled off then when I'm trying to sing
and<00:01:58.259> talk<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.770> wrong

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and talk it's wrong

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.959 
and talk it's wrong
there's<00:02:00.540> no<00:02:00.689> clarity<00:02:01.229> whatsoever<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.549> my

there's no clarity whatsoever in my
voice<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.719> that's<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.990> really<00:02:04.259> big<00:02:04.409> problem<00:02:04.619> so

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
voice and that's a really big problem so

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.029 
voice and that's a really big problem so
when<00:02:06.719> I'm<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:06.930> stage<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.860> make<00:02:08.009> sure

when I'm on stage I have to make sure

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.669 
when I'm on stage I have to make sure
that<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.459> sound<00:02:08.759> man<00:02:09.030> does<00:02:09.360> not<00:02:09.390> try<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.050> EQ

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
that the sound man does not try to EQ

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
harmonica and I'm trying to expose as

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.150 
harmonica and I'm trying to expose as
much<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.329> harmonica<00:03:59.959> on<00:04:00.079> the<00:04:00.200> high<00:04:00.380> end<00:04:00.410> is

much of the harmonica on the high end is

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.970 
much of the harmonica on the high end is
possible<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.299> what<00:04:02.780> happens<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.380> that<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.620> find

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
possible and what happens is that I find

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.970 
possible and what happens is that I find
that<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:05.359> treble<00:04:06.139> e<00:04:06.609> raspiness<00:04:08.980> suppressed

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
that the treble e raspiness suppressed

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.589

and<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:11.200> fundamental<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.380> beef<00:04:12.650> is

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
and the fundamental the beef is

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:21.090 
and the fundamental the beef is
exaggerated<00:04:14.599> and<00:04:15.099> between<00:04:16.099> playing

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.370 

and<00:04:22.100> then<00:04:22.370> me<00:04:22.550> try<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:22.970> sing<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.780> it's<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.170> real

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
and then me try and sing and it's a real

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.150 
and then me try and sing and it's a real
good<00:04:24.650> balance<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:26.020> being<00:04:27.020> able<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.290> get<00:04:27.890> some

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
good balance of being able to get some

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.700 
good balance of being able to get some
crispness<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:29.210> clarity<00:04:29.990> out<00:04:30.200> of<00:04:30.350> my<00:04:30.470> voice

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
the brightness of the harmonica let me

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.150 
the brightness of the harmonica let me
grab<00:04:42.260> a<00:04:42.290> microphone<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:44.920> they<00:04:45.920> can<00:04:46.040> get

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.720 
squashing the high end
I'm<00:05:10.970> squashing<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:11.990> trebly<00:05:12.560> quality<00:05:13.400> of<00:05:13.610> the

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
I'm squashing the trebly quality of the

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.310 
I'm squashing the trebly quality of the
harmonica<00:05:14.180> what<00:05:14.300> you've<00:05:14.480> got<00:05:14.690> to<00:05:14.810> be<00:05:14.870> careful

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
harmonica what you've got to be careful

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.490 
harmonica what you've got to be careful
with<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:15.710> that<00:05:16.160> if<00:05:16.370> you<00:05:16.580> if<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.420> cover<00:05:18.050> up<00:05:18.260> too

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
with is that if you if you cover up too

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.230 
with is that if you if you cover up too
much<00:05:18.740> of<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:19.010> harmonica<00:05:19.550> like<00:05:19.760> this<00:05:20.000> with

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
much of the harmonica like this with

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.730 
much of the harmonica like this with
more<00:05:20.480> of<00:05:20.540> a<00:05:20.600> full<00:05:20.840> cup<00:05:23.170> then<00:05:24.170> you're<00:05:24.350> cutting

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
more of a full cup then you're cutting

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.190 
more of a full cup then you're cutting
down<00:05:24.950> the<00:05:25.190> volume<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:26.780> have<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:27.080> be

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
down the volume and you have to be

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.800 
down the volume and you have to be
careful<00:05:27.650> that<00:05:28.390> people<00:05:29.390> are<00:05:29.480> not<00:05:29.600> gonna<00:05:29.720> be

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
careful that people are not gonna be

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.180 
careful that people are not gonna be
able<00:05:29.930> to<00:05:29.990> hear<00:05:30.200> you<00:05:30.380> when<00:05:30.590> you're<00:05:30.740> doing<00:05:31.040> this

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
able to hear you when you're doing this

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.740 
able to hear you when you're doing this
and<00:05:31.580> then<00:05:31.760> you<00:05:31.850> go<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.000> sing<00:05:32.330> and<00:05:32.510> you're<00:05:32.570> too

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
and then you go to sing and you're too

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.990 
and then you go to sing and you're too
loud<00:05:32.960> so<00:05:33.800> it's<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.100> matter<00:05:34.310> of<00:05:34.520> getting<00:05:34.790> a

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
loud so it's a matter of getting a

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.060 
loud so it's a matter of getting a
balance<00:05:35.480> between<00:05:35.690> your<00:05:35.930> singing<00:05:36.530> voice<00:05:36.740> and

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
balance between your singing voice and

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.850 
balance between your singing voice and
how<00:05:38.000> you're<00:05:38.240> playing<00:05:38.450> harmonica<00:05:38.900> and<00:05:39.350> right

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
how you're playing harmonica and right

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.950 
how you're playing harmonica and right
now<00:05:40.070> this<00:05:40.340> is<00:05:40.520> kind<00:05:40.760> of<00:05:40.820> where<00:05:41.030> where<00:05:41.450> I'm<00:05:41.720> at

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
now this is kind of where where I'm at

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.430 
now this is kind of where where I'm at
if<00:05:42.170> I<00:05:42.350> play<00:05:42.650> um<00:05:43.550> where<00:05:44.450> I'm<00:05:44.570> not<00:05:44.810> using<00:05:45.200> both

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
if I play um where I'm not using both

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.100 
if I play um where I'm not using both
hands<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:45.980> I<00:05:46.010> do<00:05:46.070> this<00:05:46.430> a<00:05:46.670> lot<00:05:46.940> on<00:05:47.270> certain

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
hands and I do this a lot on certain

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.550 
hands and I do this a lot on certain
tunes

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
tunes

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.650 
tunes
I<00:05:48.590> will<00:05:49.160> generally<00:05:49.850> hold<00:05:50.060> it<00:05:50.210> in<00:05:50.300> a<00:05:50.360> way<00:05:50.480> where

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
I will generally hold it in a way where

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.450 
I will generally hold it in a way where
I'm<00:05:50.810> covering<00:05:51.380> up<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.680> whole<00:05:51.830> back<00:05:52.100> of<00:05:52.400> the

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
I'm covering up the whole back of the

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.030 
I'm covering up the whole back of the
harmonica<00:05:53.090> so<00:05:53.570> I'm<00:05:53.720> trying<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.110> minimize<00:05:54.410> that

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
harmonica so I'm trying to minimize that

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.210 
harmonica so I'm trying to minimize that
treble<00:05:55.640> II<00:05:55.760> bite<00:05:56.090> so<00:05:56.870> that<00:05:56.990> I'm<00:05:57.110> not<00:05:57.220> killing

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
treble II bite so that I'm not killing

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.250 
treble II bite so that I'm not killing
people
