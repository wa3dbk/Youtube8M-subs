00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.709
 the memory is fragile 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.589
 and few remember everything that was said in 1986 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.750
 when we begin with a clear political decision that yes pay to build 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.630
 hope aguirre lete but the period January-April social demand 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.199
 how much is the victory of the people who are no longer in sight 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.720
 we are going to get all those interested in Argentina managed to give the 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.180
 turn everything 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.930
 all that happened said 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.260
 and the train started to be built 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
 painful started for the last six years 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.680
 the first ponce kilometers that were 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
 built entirely with 30 wagons 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.140
 from villa el salvador to the high bridge noa 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.959
 they were forced down 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:05.160
 as a subordinate to Machu Picchu 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.410
 and the weeds of memory 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.840
 it grew in itself and inclusive 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.980
 3 the abyss 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.020
 of the train 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.789
 I would give him werbowy or brad with it from the movie 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.119
 and in the middle of escalating violence at the top do not go to vote blank 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.639
 by pronaa those are the topics they speak and criticize 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.890
 we have had at least recover that lost time 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.680
 because it's always good to do what ends well as his former skin said in 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 some of his works today the young man in his web 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.030
 everything is fine when it ends well 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.740
 then here 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.920
 I forget about 10 years 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.720
 in which lakes insulted me and those who recovered a lot without knowing what 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.759
 Talk about anything you have done before playing the ball 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.800
 camanÃ¡ m here did not forget support 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.320
 everything is fine 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.370
 when it was good
