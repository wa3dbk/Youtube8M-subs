00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
a judgment call on whether or not it

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
in the last video I thought it'd be a

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.770 
in the last video I thought it'd be a
good<00:00:16.219> idea<00:00:16.520> to<00:00:16.700> go<00:00:16.850> back<00:00:16.880> and<00:00:17.300> put<00:00:17.630> some

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 
good idea to go back and put some

good idea to go back and put some

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
the same height and then well that would

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.560 
the same height and then well that would
just<00:02:02.500> be<00:02:02.740> bad<00:02:02.770> unless<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:04.030> course<00:02:04.090> you're

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
that will make up the bulk of the top

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.040 
that will make up the bulk of the top
I've<00:03:06.520> cut<00:03:06.820> some<00:03:06.850> strips<00:03:07.210> of<00:03:07.390> solid<00:03:07.720> oak

I've cut some strips of solid oak
for<00:03:08.290> which<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.560> will<00:03:08.620> use<00:03:08.830> for<00:03:08.860> nosing<00:03:09.520> so<00:03:09.760> that

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
for which I will use for nosing so that

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.520 
for which I will use for nosing so that
I<00:03:09.940> can<00:03:10.120> shape<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.420> edges<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:10.900> just<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.170> moment

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
I can shape the edges in just a moment

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.740 
I can shape the edges in just a moment
but<00:03:12.460> first<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.910> need<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.120> trim<00:03:13.360> this<00:03:13.480> front

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
but first I need to trim this front

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:33.839 
but first I need to trim this front
piece<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.020> link

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.220 

the<00:03:34.849> dowels<00:03:35.209> worked<00:03:35.390> out<00:03:35.540> pretty<00:03:35.750> well<00:03:35.870> for

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
the dowels worked out pretty well for

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.020 
the dowels worked out pretty well for
the<00:03:36.319> drawers<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.830> they<00:03:37.370> looked<00:03:37.550> pretty<00:03:37.640> good

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
the drawers and they looked pretty good

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.449 
the drawers and they looked pretty good
so<00:03:38.300> I<00:03:38.810> thought<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.290> would<00:03:39.440> bring<00:03:39.770> that<00:03:39.980> look<00:03:40.280> to

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
so I thought I would bring that look to

00:03:40.459 --> 00:04:08.100 
so I thought I would bring that look to
a<00:03:40.489> more<00:03:40.670> prominent<00:03:41.209> place<00:03:41.390> on<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.630> dresser

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.710 

now<00:04:08.860> here<00:04:09.220> is<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.580> seam<00:04:09.820> I<00:04:09.970> just<00:04:10.180> created<00:04:10.600> when

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
now here is the seam I just created when

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.480 
now here is the seam I just created when
I<00:04:10.750> added<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.170> nosey<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:11.830> can<00:04:12.010> see<00:04:12.280> the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
I added a nosey you can see the

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.970 
I added a nosey you can see the
imperfections<00:04:13.180> quite<00:04:13.480> clearly<00:04:13.930> thin<00:04:14.680> strips

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
imperfections quite clearly thin strips

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.620 
imperfections quite clearly thin strips
of<00:04:15.100> veneer<00:04:15.370> of<00:04:15.400> torn<00:04:15.820> away<00:04:15.940> in<00:04:16.150> places<00:04:16.510> leaving

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
of veneer of torn away in places leaving

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.810 
of veneer of torn away in places leaving
bigger<00:04:16.959> gaps<00:04:17.230> in<00:04:17.470> some<00:04:17.739> areas<00:04:18.130> all<00:04:18.400> around<00:04:18.730> the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
bigger gaps in some areas all around the

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.050 
bigger gaps in some areas all around the
edge<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.330> top<00:04:19.540> it<00:04:19.900> just<00:04:20.170> looks<00:04:20.500> raw<00:04:21.489> we're

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.500 
complete unit because of its size and
its<00:06:03.740> design<00:06:04.100> vanity<00:06:04.550> dressers<00:06:04.910> of<00:06:05.060> this<00:06:05.180> style

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
its design vanity dressers of this style

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.240 
its design vanity dressers of this style
tend<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:05.990> have<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.139> weak<00:06:06.320> point<00:06:06.350> if<00:06:06.830> you<00:06:07.010> have<00:06:07.160> to

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
tend to have a weak point if you have to

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.510 
tend to have a weak point if you have to
move<00:06:07.430> them<00:06:07.720> the<00:06:08.720> center<00:06:09.050> now<00:06:10.040> oftentimes

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
move them the center now oftentimes

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.860 
move them the center now oftentimes
you'll<00:06:10.669> see<00:06:10.699> them<00:06:11.030> connected<00:06:11.449> in<00:06:11.540> the<00:06:11.630> back

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
you'll see them connected in the back

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.840 
you'll see them connected in the back
but<00:06:12.260> I'm<00:06:12.830> not<00:06:13.040> convinced<00:06:13.550> that<00:06:13.610> that<00:06:13.699> will

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
but I'm not convinced that that will

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.520 
but I'm not convinced that that will
completely<00:06:14.270> mitigate<00:06:14.690> the<00:06:14.780> risk<00:06:14.960> of<00:06:15.110> damaging

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
completely mitigate the risk of damaging

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.500 
completely mitigate the risk of damaging
the<00:06:15.590> dresser<00:06:16.070> when<00:06:16.729> it<00:06:16.820> comes<00:06:17.000> time<00:06:17.150> to<00:06:17.210> move

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
the dresser when it comes time to move

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.629 
the dresser when it comes time to move
it<00:06:17.660> so<00:06:17.960> I've<00:06:18.169> decided<00:06:18.350> to<00:06:18.740> not<00:06:18.919> permanently

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
it so I've decided to not permanently

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.450 
it so I've decided to not permanently
connect<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:20.270> base<00:06:20.510> units<00:06:20.990> to<00:06:21.139> each<00:06:21.169> other<00:06:21.590> nor

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
connect the base units to each other nor

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.250 
connect the base units to each other nor
the<00:06:22.699> top<00:06:22.940> so<00:06:23.479> when<00:06:23.570> it<00:06:23.690> needs<00:06:23.840> to<00:06:23.930> be<00:06:24.020> moved

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
the top so when it needs to be moved

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.320 
the top so when it needs to be moved
I've<00:06:24.590> elected<00:06:24.830> to<00:06:25.100> have<00:06:25.190> it<00:06:25.340> broken<00:06:25.580> down<00:06:25.970> to

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
I've elected to have it broken down to

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.150 
I've elected to have it broken down to
its<00:06:26.449> individual<00:06:26.900> pieces<00:06:27.050> but<00:06:27.650> that<00:06:27.800> means<00:06:27.979> I'm

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
its individual pieces but that means I'm

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.980 
its individual pieces but that means I'm
gonna<00:06:28.280> need<00:06:28.370> a<00:06:28.520> quick<00:06:28.820> way<00:06:29.000> to<00:06:29.030> reference<00:06:29.510> one

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
gonna need a quick way to reference one

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.290 
gonna need a quick way to reference one
piece<00:06:30.229> to<00:06:30.530> another<00:06:30.560> for<00:06:31.340> reassembly

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
piece to another for reassembly

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.640 
piece to another for reassembly
