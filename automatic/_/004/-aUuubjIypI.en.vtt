00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
hatching oh quick note while doing this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.570 
hatching oh quick note while doing this
you<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> remember<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.740> female<00:01:23.220> is

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
you have to remember that the female is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
you have to remember that the female is
going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> species<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> male

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
going to be the species and the male

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.310 
going to be the species and the male
will<00:01:25.890> pass<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.090> move<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.750> don't<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.170> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
will pass the move so don't get that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.920 
will pass the move so don't get that
mixed<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.880> there<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.060> an<00:01:30.210> exception<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
mixed up there is an exception to this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.100 
mixed up there is an exception to this
genderless<00:01:31.650> Pokemon<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.400> beldum<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.299> I

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
genderless Pokemon like beldum and I

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.109 
genderless Pokemon like beldum and I
think<00:01:34.320> Magnemite<00:01:34.979> they<00:01:35.369> don't<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.729> genders

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
think Magnemite they don't get genders

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.060 
think Magnemite they don't get genders
so<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> can't<00:01:37.049> breed<00:01:37.350> egg<00:01:37.560> moves<00:01:37.829> down<00:01:38.040> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
so you can't breed egg moves down to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.749 
so you can't breed egg moves down to
them<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.860> know<00:01:40.979> kind<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.520> sucks

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
them so it it's you know kind of sucks

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.249 
them so it it's you know kind of sucks
that<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.970> can't<00:01:42.150> do<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.659> whatever<00:01:44.149> also

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
that you can't do that but whatever also

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.139 
that you can't do that but whatever also
some<00:01:46.259> Pokemon<00:01:46.710> don't<00:01:47.070> get<00:01:47.460> any<00:01:47.670> egg<00:01:47.909> mousse

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149

later<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.310> one<00:02:17.490> thing<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.880> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
later on so the one thing I have to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.700 
later on so the one thing I have to
remember<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.080> batch<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.680> I

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
remember is that in this batch and I

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.420 
remember is that in this batch and I
have<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.610> make<00:02:20.760> sure<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:22.440> male

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
have to make sure that I have a male

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.910 
have to make sure that I have a male
Mudkip<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.870> pass<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.320> should<00:02:25.740> be<00:02:25.890> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
Mudkip to pass so that should be a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.850 
Mudkip to pass so that should be a
breeze<00:02:26.520> considering<00:02:27.240> it's<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.740> like<00:02:28.740> an

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
breeze considering it's like a like an

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.860 
breeze considering it's like a like an
85<00:02:29.220> or<00:02:29.700> 83.5%<00:02:30.600> male<00:02:31.320> ratio<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.920> think<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:33.120> when

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
85 or 83.5% male ratio I think but when

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.230 
85 or 83.5% male ratio I think but when
you<00:02:33.990> do<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.430> you're<00:02:35.430> going<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:36.000> super

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240
