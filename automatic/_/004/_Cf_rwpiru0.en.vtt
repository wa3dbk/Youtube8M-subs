00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.210
 safe tiebreak unit so you still drive 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.590
 sure bpw is the leading provider of 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.799
 Suspension systems for towed vehicles 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.000
 the subsidiary bpw 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.640
 Vehicle technology has for the area up 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.520
 28 tons the safety break unit 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.650
 It develops the advantages of the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.859
 bpw at table linger clutch the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.080
 overrun brake and electronic 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.400
 stabilization system cbc 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.769
 each system acts on another 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.660
 therefore, each is physical 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.800
 component important for the increase of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.820
 safety the bpw overrun brake offers 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.980
 many advantages 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.350
 safe and smooth opening of the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.420
 Park brake through the muted 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.370
 Handbrake lever the casserole device 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.020
 has an integrated damper 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.910
 for gentle emergence 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.100
 The trailer will automatically with 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.570
 slowed down when the towing vehicle slowed down 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.940
 becomes 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.620
 and that's the way it works 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.380
 towing vehicle braking pushes the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.000
 trailer in the direction of the towing vehicle 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.760
 the brake of the trailer is through the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.680
 wpd overrun brake triggered automatically 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.740
 as soon as the towing vehicle slows down 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.970
 and the trailer runs crosswind 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.590
 ruts or sudden 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.060
 evasive maneuvers belong to the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.430
 dreaded situations 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 driving for the driving dynamics of the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.290
 caravan skan conditioned by the high 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.450
 Construction and unfavorable loading to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.220
 lead and rock and lead 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.090
 bring the whole team into flinging 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.009
 with the dci ag wpg vehicle technology 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.350
 patented security system for one 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.660
 axa and tandems develops the new one 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.660
 in terms of safety offers 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.659
 the clou of the trailer is not from the car 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.310
 but directly regulated by the egt that 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.380
 located directly on the overrun device 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.150
 the trailer is the ic is that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.520
 intelligent light control and will be in 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.410
 used caravan and is a 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.100
 electronic stabilization system for 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.460
 the caravan 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.009
 the system then engages electromechanically 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.140
 in the brake rod parallel and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.509
 then the caravan rat brakes closed 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.069
 which the caravans then directly 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.459
 slows down and so a stabilization 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.190
 enables the functional principle of edc 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.720
 is as ingenious as a simple on the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.060
 axle attached sensor detected 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.280
 permanently lowest lateral accelerations 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.950
 and sends signals to the electronic 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.510
 central unit of the edc sound 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.550
 not occurring vibrations 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.390
 alone is off via an electric motor 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.130
 the trailer's brake system is activated 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.450
 The trailer pulls like on one 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.269
 rail in seconds 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.220
 independently back in the trail of the 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.670
 the driver almost feels the entire process 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.870
 Nothing 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.040
 the result recognizes the bdc 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.140
 dangerous situations early and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.050
 intervenes automatically before it becomes one 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.170
 critical situation come 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.340
 Of course, the edc of bpw 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.060
 Vehicle technology easily retrofitted 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.920
 become 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.570
 The installation should, however, of a 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.570
 professional workshop 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.180
 with the bpw anti schlinger clutch 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.790
 you are guaranteed a comfortable 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.650
 and relaxed driving feeling that notice 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.769
 especially with uneven floors and 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.510
 Dodge maneuvers the bpw anti schlinger 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.430
 Clutch suppresses dangerous 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.120
 lapses and nodding already in the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.739
 approach 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.040
 that's why the clutch is too 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.260
 allowed for 100 tempo 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.209
 the bpw on tischlinger clutch is the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.400
 single clutch with a one-handed 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.989
 system that makes the coupling and uncoupling 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.359
 process even safer 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.250
 by the large impact protection offers 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.560
 They give you maximum protection for your legs 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.950
 and the bumper no injuries 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.810
 no scratches or damage to the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.069
 yellow-green pin on the front of the coupling 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.139
 confirms the correct coupling 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.290
 the bpb on tischlinger clutch is included 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.290
 All commercially available overrun brake 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.290
 upgradeable
