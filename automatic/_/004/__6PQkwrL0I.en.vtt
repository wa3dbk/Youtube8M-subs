00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.060 
I recommend Google Chrome because it's
faster<00:00:33.629> easy<00:00:33.900> and<00:00:34.760> not<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:36.000> laggy<00:00:36.300> right<00:00:37.070> for

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
faster easy and not as laggy right for

your<00:01:08.760> sake<00:01:08.940> so<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.270> can't<00:01:09.570> put<00:01:10.320> three<00:01:10.500> ports<00:01:10.799> in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
your sake so I can't put three ports in

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.130 
your sake so I can't put three ports in
because<00:01:11.070> though<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.850> match<00:01:12.510> together<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
because though they match together and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380 
because though they match together and
then<00:01:13.260> I'll<00:01:13.409> screw<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.920> my<00:01:14.280> original<00:01:14.850> port<00:01:15.090> so

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
then I'll screw up my original port so

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.350 
then I'll screw up my original port so
once<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.260> is<00:01:16.560> done<00:01:16.970> you'll<00:01:17.970> come<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.330> a
