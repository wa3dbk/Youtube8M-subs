play with this and it's a really neat

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.779 
play with this and it's a really neat
kind<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.120> scientific<00:00:15.770> experiment<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.369> a

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
kind of scientific experiment and a

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.960 
kind of scientific experiment and a
plaything<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.830> demonstrates<00:00:19.830> how<00:00:20.460> some

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
plaything that demonstrates how some

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.750 
plaything that demonstrates how some
fluids<00:00:21.510> actually<00:00:22.199> come<00:00:22.890> thicker<00:00:23.220> when<00:00:23.580> you

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
fluids actually come thicker when you

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.970 
fluids actually come thicker when you
put<00:00:24.029> them<00:00:24.150> under<00:00:24.330> stress<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.560> wanted<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
put them under stress but I wanted to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.890 
put them under stress but I wanted to
show<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:27.090> sequence<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.599> how<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
show you this little sequence here how I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.109 
show you this little sequence here how I
got<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.470> inside<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> balloon<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.760> go<00:00:29.880> put

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
got it inside the balloon you go put

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.790 
got it inside the balloon you go put
almost<00:00:30.300> anything<00:00:30.689> inside<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.109> balloon<00:00:31.289> with

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
almost anything inside a balloon with

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.970 
almost anything inside a balloon with
this<00:00:31.949> method<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:34.020> today<00:00:34.739> we're<00:00:34.890> gonna

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this method here but today we're gonna

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.549 
this method here but today we're gonna
shoot<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> 22<00:00:36.000> long<00:00:36.210> rifle

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
shoot it with a 22 long rifle

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.810 
shoot it with a 22 long rifle
hollow-point<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.739> round<00:00:38.430> nose<00:00:40.610> all<00:00:41.610> right

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
hollow-point and round nose all right

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.190 
hollow-point and round nose all right
hit<00:00:42.030> her<00:00:42.149> oh<00:00:42.739> nice<00:00:44.480> non-newtonian<00:00:45.480> fluids

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
hit her oh nice non-newtonian fluids

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.040 
hit her oh nice non-newtonian fluids
change<00:00:46.950> their<00:00:47.219> viscosity<00:00:47.940> when<00:00:48.570> they're<00:00:48.750> put

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
change their viscosity when they're put

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.830 
change their viscosity when they're put
under<00:00:49.260> stress<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> if<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.730> hit<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.750> with

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
under stress so if you hit it with

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.250 
under stress so if you hit it with
something<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:53.070> becomes<00:00:53.160> hard<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.170> when<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
something it becomes hard and when you

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.090 
something it becomes hard and when you
let<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.469> rest<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.219> becomes<00:00:56.610> very<00:00:56.910> liquidy<00:00:58.100> if

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
let it rest it becomes very liquidy if

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.540 
let it rest it becomes very liquidy if
we<00:00:59.370> drop<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.160> how<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
we drop it then you can see how it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.700 
we drop it then you can see how it
becomes<00:01:03.149> rock-hard<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> becomes

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
becomes rock-hard and then it becomes

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.270 
becomes rock-hard and then it becomes
very<00:01:05.010> elastic<00:01:05.610> after<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.890> isn't<00:01:07.890> under<00:01:08.070> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
very elastic after it isn't under so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.420 
very elastic after it isn't under so
much<00:01:08.400> stress<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:10.470> we'll<00:01:10.650> drop<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.920> 12

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
much stress and now we'll drop it 12

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.609 
much stress and now we'll drop it 12
feet<00:01:11.640> off<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.060> ladder<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.600> put<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> plastic

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
feet off of a ladder I put a plastic

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
feet off of a ladder I put a plastic
tray<00:01:13.920> there<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.580> nice<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.030> smooth<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
tray there which is nice and smooth and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.620 
tray there which is nice and smooth and
there's<00:01:16.530> no<00:01:16.680> sharp<00:01:17.040> points<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:18.270> balloon

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
there's no sharp points that balloon

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.679 
there's no sharp points that balloon
would<00:01:18.780> would<00:01:19.170> snag<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.130> pop<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
would would snag on and pop but this is

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.050 
would would snag on and pop but this is
a<00:01:21.720> good<00:01:21.960> demonstration<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.830> how<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.549> behaves

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
a good demonstration on how it behaves

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.340 
a good demonstration on how it behaves

little different velocities on each one
so<00:02:16.540> let's<00:02:17.410> see<00:02:17.560> what<00:02:17.680> they'll<00:02:17.799> do

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.770 

well<00:02:31.099> it<00:02:31.189> definitely<00:02:31.549> did<00:02:32.090> not<00:02:32.269> stop<00:02:32.599> the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
well it definitely did not stop the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.160 
well it definitely did not stop the
bullet<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.860> continued<00:02:34.430> on<00:02:34.610> through<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.689> milk

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
bullet it continued on through the milk

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.110 
bullet it continued on through the milk
carton<00:02:36.530> blowing<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.010> milk<00:02:37.189> carton<00:02:37.519> apart<00:02:37.879> and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
carton blowing the milk carton apart and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.679 
carton blowing the milk carton apart and
into<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.200> wooden<00:02:39.500> block<00:02:39.739> behind<00:02:40.069> it<00:02:40.629> now<00:02:41.629> I

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
into the wooden block behind it now I

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.149 
into the wooden block behind it now I
made<00:02:41.870> these<00:02:42.019> balloons<00:02:42.409> about<00:02:42.620> three<00:02:42.890> or<00:02:42.980> four

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
made these balloons about three or four

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.339 
made these balloons about three or four
days<00:02:43.370> ago<00:02:43.579> and<00:02:44.000> that's<00:02:44.420> not<00:02:44.629> a<00:02:44.689> good<00:02:44.930> idea<00:02:45.230> to

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
days ago and that's not a good idea to

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.140 
days ago and that's not a good idea to
store<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.799> because<00:02:46.189> this<00:02:46.459> stuff<00:02:46.760> becomes

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
store it because this stuff becomes

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.670 
store it because this stuff becomes
really<00:02:47.750> rotten<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.439> stinky<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:50.290> when<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.319> shot

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
really rotten and stinky and when I shot

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.229 
really rotten and stinky and when I shot
this<00:02:51.920> thing<00:02:52.129> it<00:02:52.250> actually<00:02:52.519> sprayed<00:02:52.879> on<00:02:53.060> me

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
this thing it actually sprayed on me

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.190 
this thing it actually sprayed on me
next<00:02:54.079> up<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.620> slower<00:02:55.159> heavier<00:02:56.200> solid

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
next up is the slower heavier solid

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.339 
next up is the slower heavier solid
point<00:02:57.470> or<00:02:57.620> round<00:02:57.859> nosed<00:02:58.129> bullet<00:03:02.290> now<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
point or round nosed bullet now the

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.580 
point or round nosed bullet now the
first<00:03:03.650> shot<00:03:03.859> was<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.099> hollow<00:03:04.549> point<00:03:04.909> which<00:03:05.060> is

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
first shot was a hollow point which is

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.319 
first shot was a hollow point which is
designed<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.650> mushroom<00:03:07.220> out<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.730> cause<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.030> lot

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
designed to mushroom out and cause a lot

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.009 
designed to mushroom out and cause a lot
more<00:03:08.359> damage

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
more damage

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.069 
more damage
now<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.709> round<00:03:10.040> nose<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.579> can<00:03:10.609> see<00:03:10.940> just<00:03:11.810> for

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
now this round nose you can see just for

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.629 
now this round nose you can see just for
it<00:03:12.139> a<00:03:12.200> hole<00:03:12.440> through<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:12.799> without<00:03:13.040> as<00:03:13.430> much

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
it a hole through it without as much

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.730 
it a hole through it without as much
explosive<00:03:16.639> effect

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.950 

I<00:03:20.830> actually<00:03:21.460> thought<00:03:22.000> there<00:03:22.300> was<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.510> good

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
I actually thought there was a good

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.290 
I actually thought there was a good
possibility<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.580> would<00:03:24.820> actually

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
possibility that this would actually

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.990 
possibility that this would actually
stop<00:03:25.660> one<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.710> these<00:03:26.830> bullets<00:03:27.280> if<00:03:27.520> not<00:03:27.700> both<00:03:27.940> of

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
stop one of these bullets if not both of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.470 
stop one of these bullets if not both of
them<00:03:28.350> with<00:03:29.350> our<00:03:29.590> tests<00:03:30.280> with<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.610> giant<00:03:31.240> gummy

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
them with our tests with the giant gummy

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.620 
them with our tests with the giant gummy
bear<00:03:31.600> I<00:03:32.110> guess<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.770> get<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:32.980> sense<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.790> almost

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
bear I guess you get a sense that almost

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.030 
bear I guess you get a sense that almost
anything<00:03:35.200> will<00:03:35.380> stop<00:03:35.500> it

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
anything will stop it

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.370 
anything will stop it
especially<00:03:36.700> since<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:37.000> gummy<00:03:37.300> bear<00:03:37.330> in<00:03:37.870> its<00:03:38.170> own

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
especially since a gummy bear in its own

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.000 
especially since a gummy bear in its own
right<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:38.950> non-newtonian<00:03:39.670> fluid<00:03:40.210> too<00:03:41.010> even

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
right is a non-newtonian fluid too even

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.150 
right is a non-newtonian fluid too even
though<00:03:42.100> we<00:03:42.250> didn't<00:03:42.850> really<00:03:43.000> have<00:03:43.180> any<00:03:43.390> real

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
though we didn't really have any real

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.520 
though we didn't really have any real
surprising<00:03:45.160> results<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:46.390> still<00:03:47.020> wanted<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.350> do

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
surprising results I still wanted to do

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.440 
surprising results I still wanted to do
this<00:03:47.680> simply<00:03:48.070> because<00:03:48.520> so<00:03:48.820> many<00:03:48.910> people<00:03:49.030> had

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
this simply because so many people had

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.910 
this simply because so many people had
wanted<00:03:50.050> to<00:03:50.110> see<00:03:50.410> it

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.080 

anyway<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:57.950> hope<00:03:58.099> you<00:03:58.160> guys<00:03:58.400> thought<00:03:58.730> this<00:03:58.910> was

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
anyway I hope you guys thought this was

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.839 
anyway I hope you guys thought this was
interesting<00:03:59.239> still<00:04:00.700> definitely<00:04:01.700> want<00:04:01.819> to

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
interesting still definitely want to

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.479
