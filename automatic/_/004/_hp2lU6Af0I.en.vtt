00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
was wrong there was no es port for gta4

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.750 
was wrong there was no es port for gta4
and<00:05:32.840> that<00:05:33.620> doesn't<00:05:33.920> of<00:05:34.070> course<00:05:34.100> necessarily

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
and that doesn't of course necessarily

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.400 
and that doesn't of course necessarily
mean<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:34.910> there<00:05:35.120> is<00:05:35.210> a<00:05:35.240> gt540<00:05:35.990> f<00:05:36.970> GTA<00:05:37.970> 5<00:05:38.410> for

mean that there is a gt540 f GTA 5 for
pc<00:05:39.740> because<00:05:40.220> just<00:05:40.460> because<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.300> retailers

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
pc because just because the retailers

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.760 
pc because just because the retailers
that<00:05:41.780> said<00:05:41.990> it's<00:05:42.110> coming<00:05:42.350> out<00:05:42.440> doesn't<00:05:42.740> mean

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
that said it's coming out doesn't mean

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.310

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
word that were looking for so fingers

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:48.790 
word that were looking for so fingers
crossed<00:05:47.480> they<00:05:47.750> can<00:05:47.900> release<00:05:48.080> a<00:05:48.140> decent<00:05:48.560> port

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
crossed they can release a decent port

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.080 
crossed they can release a decent port
because<00:05:49.100> of<00:05:49.250> course<00:05:49.400> at<00:05:49.520> this<00:05:49.669> point<00:05:49.910> it<00:05:50.060> is
