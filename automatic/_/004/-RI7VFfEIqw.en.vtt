00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
I've done this a bunch of times and uh

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.069 
I've done this a bunch of times and uh
it's<00:00:33.090> really<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> fastest<00:00:33.719> way<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.870> break

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
it's really the fastest way to break

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.270 
it's really the fastest way to break
food<00:00:34.230> aggression<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.739> thankfully<00:00:35.130> they're

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
food aggression and thankfully they're

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
food aggression and thankfully they're
young<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.270> they're<00:00:36.420> older<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:36.899> much<00:00:37.110> much

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
young and they're older it's much much

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.799 
young and they're older it's much much
harder<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.680> break<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> food<00:00:38.100> aggression<00:00:38.809> so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
harder to break the food aggression so

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.790 
harder to break the food aggression so
