okay so the most important thing to

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.539 
okay so the most important thing to
realize<00:00:06.770> when<00:00:06.980> you're<00:00:07.190> when<00:00:07.520> you're

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:07.549 
realize when you're when you're

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.180 
realize when you're when you're
sharpening<00:00:08.120> and<00:00:08.559> lots<00:00:09.559> of<00:00:09.740> different

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
sharpening and lots of different

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.129 
sharpening and lots of different
woodworkers<00:00:11.059> will<00:00:11.450> give<00:00:11.630> you<00:00:11.750> lots<00:00:12.019> of

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
woodworkers will give you lots of

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.950 
woodworkers will give you lots of
different<00:00:12.530> advice<00:00:12.920> but<00:00:13.250> all<00:00:13.429> of<00:00:13.610> those

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
different advice but all of those

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.240 
different advice but all of those
sharpening<00:00:14.960> systems<00:00:15.469> are<00:00:15.650> doing<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:16.040> same

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
sharpening systems are doing the same

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.889 
sharpening systems are doing the same
thing<00:00:16.700> and<00:00:17.180> all<00:00:17.390> of<00:00:17.540> these<00:00:17.660> different

00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:17.899 
thing and all of these different

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.690 
thing and all of these different
abrasives<00:00:18.680> do<00:00:18.829> the<00:00:18.980> same<00:00:19.189> thing<00:00:19.489> they

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
abrasives do the same thing they

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.810 
abrasives do the same thing they
scratched<00:00:20.149> their<00:00:20.329> metal<00:00:20.689> away<00:00:21.520> so<00:00:22.520> whatever

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
scratched their metal away so whatever

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.850 
scratched their metal away so whatever
abrasives<00:00:23.509> we<00:00:23.689> use<00:00:23.899> that<00:00:24.169> all<00:00:24.439> doing<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:24.829> same

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
abrasives we use that all doing the same

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.260 
abrasives we use that all doing the same
thing<00:00:25.309> they're<00:00:26.079> scraping<00:00:27.079> away<00:00:27.410> metal<00:00:28.270> so

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
thing they're scraping away metal so

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.929 
thing they're scraping away metal so
when<00:00:29.689> we<00:00:29.809> use<00:00:29.960> a<00:00:29.989> abrasives<00:00:30.980> then<00:00:31.279> they<00:00:31.520> create

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
when we use a abrasives then they create

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.260 
when we use a abrasives then they create
a<00:00:31.969> scratch<00:00:32.570> pattern<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.290> a<00:00:34.160> thousand<00:00:34.940> Gretch

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
a scratch pattern and a thousand Gretch

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.050 
a scratch pattern and a thousand Gretch
is<00:00:35.720> quite<00:00:35.990> a<00:00:36.020> coarse<00:00:36.500> abrasive<00:00:37.250> leaves<00:00:37.850> a

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
is quite a coarse abrasive leaves a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.060 
is quite a coarse abrasive leaves a
scratch<00:00:38.390> pattern<00:00:38.750> in<00:00:39.080> the<00:00:39.500> metal<00:00:39.800> something

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
scratch pattern in the metal something

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.090 
scratch pattern in the metal something
like<00:00:40.400> this<00:00:40.580> then<00:00:41.510> we<00:00:41.600> use<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:41.780> finer<00:00:42.440> abrasive

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
like this then we use a finer abrasive

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.640 
like this then we use a finer abrasive
something<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:43.580> a<00:00:43.610> 5,000<00:00:44.330> or<00:00:44.480> 6,000<00:00:45.170> grit<00:00:45.410> and

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
something like a 5,000 or 6,000 grit and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.350 
something like a 5,000 or 6,000 grit and
that<00:00:46.640> leaves<00:00:46.880> a<00:00:47.329> scratch<00:00:48.079> pattern

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
that leaves a scratch pattern

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:58.569 
that leaves a scratch pattern
it<00:00:50.360> removes<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.290> peaks<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.780> grooves<00:00:57.579> coarser

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
it removes the peaks and grooves coarser

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:59.979 
it removes the peaks and grooves coarser
grit<00:00:58.790> and<00:00:58.910> leaves<00:00:59.090> a<00:00:59.210> scratch<00:00:59.480> pattern<00:00:59.720> like

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
grit and leaves a scratch pattern like

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.410 
grit and leaves a scratch pattern like
this<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:01.220> now<00:01:01.399> we<00:01:01.430> come<00:01:01.700> along<00:01:01.940> with<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.149> really

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
this and now we come along with a really

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.600 
this and now we come along with a really
fine<00:01:02.720> abrasive<00:01:03.020> something<00:01:03.800> like<00:01:03.980> Auto<00:01:04.220> Sol

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
fine abrasive something like Auto Sol

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.380 
fine abrasive something like Auto Sol
metal<00:01:04.970> polish<00:01:05.329> or<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.200> or<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:07.000> 15,000<00:01:08.000> grit<00:01:08.210> stone

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
metal polish or a or a 15,000 grit stone

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.250 
metal polish or a or a 15,000 grit stone
and<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:09.500> leaves<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:10.190> scratch<00:01:10.850> pattern<00:01:11.260> like

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
and that leaves a scratch pattern like

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.960 
and that leaves a scratch pattern like
this<00:01:14.350> now<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:15.620> to<00:01:15.920> them<00:01:16.040> to<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.430> naked<00:01:16.610> eye

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
this now this to them to the naked eye

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.450 
this now this to them to the naked eye
will<00:01:17.450> look<00:01:17.479> like<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.020> complete<00:01:18.590> mirror<00:01:18.950> polish

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
will look like a complete mirror polish

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.360 
will look like a complete mirror polish
but<00:01:20.330> under<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.080> microscope<00:01:21.590> it's<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.100> very

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
but under the microscope it's a very

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.180 
but under the microscope it's a very
fine<00:01:22.729> scratch<00:01:23.240> pattern<00:01:23.630> like<00:01:23.840> this<00:01:24.130> okay<00:01:25.130> so

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
fine scratch pattern like this okay so

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.270 
fine scratch pattern like this okay so
the<00:01:25.520> types<00:01:25.880> of<00:01:26.060> edges<00:01:26.479> we<00:01:26.840> use<00:01:28.390> woodworking

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
the types of edges we use woodworking

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.800 
the types of edges we use woodworking
what<00:01:31.280> we<00:01:31.369> call<00:01:31.520> zero<00:01:31.549> gram<00:01:32.150> they<00:01:32.330> come<00:01:32.510> right

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
what we call zero gram they come right

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.140 
what we call zero gram they come right
to<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.020> point<00:01:33.409> of<00:01:33.680> two<00:01:34.040> flat<00:01:34.340> surfaces<00:01:34.610> coming

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
to a point of two flat surfaces coming

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.660 
to a point of two flat surfaces coming
right<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.570> point<00:01:35.810> when<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:37.130> edges<00:01:37.490> become

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
right to a point when the edges become

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.810 
right to a point when the edges become
damaged<00:01:38.330> then<00:01:39.140> it's<00:01:39.710> this<00:01:40.040> bit<00:01:40.280> at<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.640> end

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
damaged then it's this bit at the end

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.600 
damaged then it's this bit at the end
here<00:01:41.180> generally<00:01:41.869> you've<00:01:42.710> broken<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.490> edge

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
here generally you've broken the edge

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.760 
here generally you've broken the edge
there<00:01:43.909> somehow<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.450> could<00:01:44.689> be<00:01:44.810> just<00:01:45.080> a<00:01:45.200> chip<00:01:45.500> or

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
there somehow it could be just a chip or

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.580 
there somehow it could be just a chip or
the<00:01:45.799> edge<00:01:46.130> rolled<00:01:46.520> over<00:01:46.760> or<00:01:47.030> whatever<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:48.320> get

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
the edge rolled over or whatever to get

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.149 
the edge rolled over or whatever to get
a<00:01:48.890> new<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:50.659> new<00:01:51.380> edge

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
a new a new edge

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.310 
a new a new edge
we've<00:01:52.280> got<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.640> remove<00:01:53.030> metal<00:01:53.540> from<00:01:54.020> both

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
we've got to remove metal from both

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.429 
we've got to remove metal from both
these<00:01:54.590> surfaces<00:01:55.600> till<00:01:56.600> we<00:01:56.720> get<00:01:56.869> down<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.290> this

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
these surfaces till we get down to this

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.300 
these surfaces till we get down to this
point<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.920> view<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:59.810> get<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.170> a<00:02:00.200> new<00:02:00.530> edge<00:02:00.770> the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
point of view to get to a new edge the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.249 
point of view to get to a new edge the
most<00:02:01.490> common<00:02:01.909> fault<00:02:02.210> with<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.990> with

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
most common fault with that with

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.999 
most common fault with that with
sharpening<00:02:03.830> is<00:02:04.280> people<00:02:05.350> remove<00:02:06.350> metal<00:02:06.799> but

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
sharpening is people remove metal but

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.999 
sharpening is people remove metal but
don't<00:02:07.369> remove<00:02:07.640> enough<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:09.140> get<00:02:09.349> right<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.889> way

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
don't remove enough to get right the way

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.399 
don't remove enough to get right the way
back<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.549> new<00:02:10.819> edge<00:02:11.029> view<00:02:11.389> and<00:02:11.659> leave<00:02:12.049> a

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
back to a new edge view and leave a

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:12.850 
back to a new edge view and leave a
little

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
little

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.940 
little
of<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.220> damaged<00:02:13.820> edge<00:02:14.060> still<00:02:14.510> behind<00:02:15.410> so

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
of the damaged edge still behind so

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.650 
of the damaged edge still behind so
you've<00:02:16.190> dropped<00:02:16.460> with<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.790> coarsest<00:02:17.330> stone

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
you've dropped with the coarsest stone
