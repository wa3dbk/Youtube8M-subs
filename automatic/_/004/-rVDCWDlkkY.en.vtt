00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.020
 enough books we are going to enter a 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.310
 departure and how they see the whole be the floor 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.910
 is played there is nothing 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.150
 we are almost practically floating but 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.650
 well there is an invisible floor yes but 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.040
 good people let's go let's wait and see 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.500
 if a game starts and good as they 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.349
 I say there's only one game mode that 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.580
 be in the clod but what I saw that 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.069
 Now I was checking between a 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.120
 game and it 's like bustle or not you 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.640
 you can move you stay like you are 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.280
 stopped you do not move good is one of 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.500
 the books people that here as they 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.830
 I say it's a beta phase soon I think that 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.959
 they are going to fix that this but good only 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.700
 I wanted to show you the server people by 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.190
 yes because here I will be taking 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.099
 games when I 'm a little longer 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.599
 when they fix the bucs that nothing like that 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.269
 good anyway I'm going to leave you 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.990
 the ip in the description so that because 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.150
 have it ready there when 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.480
 then when they are already fixed 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.140
 all these eggs there are also quite 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.600
 which I hope it is ok and soon solved 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.090
 because the truth is quite enough 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.310
 This books is that there now 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.250
 but when we hope that soon soon 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.810
 fix this ok this one so when we go to 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.440
 wait for the game to start I think 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.890
 until they enter 8 the game starts 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.930
 this and fit 16 to the map 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.150
 but good people I leave their twitters 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.860
