well basically the Perseids are a meteor
shower<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.710> write<00:00:16.920> them<00:00:17.160> this

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
shower and I have to write them this

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.279 
shower and I have to write them this
time<00:00:17.520> every<00:00:17.880> year<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.779> basically<00:00:19.020> when

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
time every year and it's basically when

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.160 
time every year and it's basically when
the<00:00:19.710> Earth<00:00:19.890> passes<00:00:20.279> through<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.970> cloud<00:00:21.359> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the Earth passes through the cloud of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.080 
the Earth passes through the cloud of
particles<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:23.130> were<00:00:23.279> emitted<00:00:23.670> from<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
particles that were emitted from the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.599 
particles that were emitted from the
Comet<00:00:24.449> swift-tuttle<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:26.010> keep<00:00:26.220> seeing<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
Comet swift-tuttle we keep seeing the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.000 
Comet swift-tuttle we keep seeing the
same<00:00:26.869> Perseid<00:00:27.869> meteor<00:00:28.170> shower<00:00:28.199> year<00:00:28.710> after

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
same Perseid meteor shower year after

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.040 
same Perseid meteor shower year after
year<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> only<00:00:29.820> annual<00:00:30.720> meteor

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
year is this the only annual meteor

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.550 
year is this the only annual meteor
shower

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
shower

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.080 
shower
there<00:00:31.949> are<00:00:32.099> many<00:00:32.340> showers<00:00:32.610> actually

there are many showers actually

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.569 
there are many showers actually
throughout<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> year<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:34.860> pass<00:00:35.340> through

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
throughout the year and we pass through

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.549 
throughout the year and we pass through
quite<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> few<00:00:36.390> times<00:00:36.840> because<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> lot

of comics out there that pass through
the<00:00:38.940> inter-service<00:00:39.300> system<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.989> our<00:00:40.739> earth

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the inter-service system and our earth

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.979 
the inter-service system and our earth
goes<00:00:41.250> through<00:00:41.550> their<00:00:41.760> tails<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.780> like

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
goes through their tails like just like

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.650 
goes through their tails like just like
the<00:00:43.260> Perseus<00:00:43.829> meets<00:00:44.399> shower<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.180> my<00:00:45.300> personal

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the Perseus meets shower but my personal

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.720 
the Perseus meets shower but my personal
favorite<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.379> Geminids<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.190> she<00:00:47.399> happens

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
favorite the Geminids that she happens

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.430 
favorite the Geminids that she happens
around<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:48.210> December<00:00:48.570> time<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.170> where<00:00:49.320> does

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
around about December time so where does

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.209 
around about December time so where does
it<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.620> these<00:00:49.770> names

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
it get these names

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.830 
it get these names
Perseids<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.149> then<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.420> mentioned<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
Perseids and then you mentioned the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.799 
Perseids and then you mentioned the
Geminids<00:00:52.350> where<00:00:52.620> where<00:00:53.010> does<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.219> come<00:00:53.520> from

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
Geminids where where does that come from

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.900 
Geminids where where does that come from
well<00:00:54.809> basically<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.949> connected<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
well basically it's all connected to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
well basically it's all connected to
Greek<00:00:57.270> mythology<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.469> course<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
Greek mythology and of course the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.250 
Greek mythology and of course the
constellations<00:00:59.520> basically<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.270> Perseids

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
constellations basically the Perseids

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.439 
constellations basically the Perseids
are<00:01:01.469> they<00:01:02.190> actually<00:01:02.550> seem<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.789> emanate<00:01:03.059> from

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
are they actually seem to emanate from

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.890 
are they actually seem to emanate from
the<00:01:04.339> Perseus<00:01:05.339> constellation<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the Perseus constellation which is a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.630 
the Perseus constellation which is a
Northern<00:01:07.260> Hemisphere<00:01:07.770> constellation<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
Northern Hemisphere constellation so you

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.980 
Northern Hemisphere constellation so you
can<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> night<00:01:09.360> sky<00:01:09.390> too<00:01:09.659> among

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
can see in the night sky too among

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.560 
can see in the night sky too among
northern<00:01:10.200> hemisphere<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.240> basically<00:01:12.240> all

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
northern hemisphere and basically all

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.490 
northern hemisphere and basically all
the<00:01:12.869> meteors<00:01:13.830> from<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:15.000> pursuit<00:01:15.840> appear<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the meteors from the pursuit appear to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.649 
the meteors from the pursuit appear to
radiate<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.759> called<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> radiant<00:01:18.450> so

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
radiate and is called a radiant so

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.030 
radiate and is called a radiant so
basically<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.470> appear<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> be

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
basically if they all appear to be

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.520 
basically if they all appear to be
shooting<00:01:20.700> from<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.270> part<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.720> sky<00:01:22.020> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
shooting from that one part in sky so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560 
shooting from that one part in sky so
does<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.979> space<00:01:23.250> debris<00:01:23.520> eventually<00:01:24.240> after

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
does this space debris eventually after

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.789 
does this space debris eventually after
we<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.810> around<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.350> through<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> bunch<00:01:25.740> of

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
we go around and through it a bunch of

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.990 
we go around and through it a bunch of
times<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> gonna<00:01:26.250> burn<00:01:26.460> out<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> mean<00:01:26.909> of

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
times is it gonna burn out I mean of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.260 
times is it gonna burn out I mean of
course<00:01:27.270> there's<00:01:28.110> only<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.350> certain<00:01:28.590> number<00:01:28.740> of

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
course there's only a certain number of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.609 
course there's only a certain number of
particles<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.420> cloud<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.990> some<00:01:31.320> kind

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
particles in this cloud and some kind

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.039 
particles in this cloud and some kind

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
dust that grungy gets eaten up over time

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.300 
dust that grungy gets eaten up over time
and<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.079> colonies<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.530> died<00:01:43.770> there

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and because the colonies that died there

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.440

is<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.759> these<00:01:44.820> very<00:01:45.030> long<00:01:45.240> duration

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
is one of these very long duration

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.999 
is one of these very long duration
comments<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.229> flown<00:01:46.619> through<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
comments that just flown through the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.609 
comments that just flown through the
inner<00:01:47.220> service<00:01:47.549> from<00:01:47.820> ejected<00:01:48.600> out<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.380> leaves

so<00:01:52.189> eventually<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.000> earth<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.420> other

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
so eventually just the earth and other

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.880 
so eventually just the earth and other
planets<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:55.020> keep<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.409> through<00:01:55.740> this

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
planets we keep on going through this

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.620 
planets we keep on going through this

cloud burning up all articles and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.300 
cloud burning up all articles and
eventually<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.259> will<00:01:58.380> get<00:01:58.530> depleted<00:01:58.890> you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
eventually they will get depleted you

hemisphere<00:02:01.170> constellation<00:02:02.159> does<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.430> mean

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
hemisphere constellation does that mean

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.010 
hemisphere constellation does that mean
the<00:02:02.759> southern<00:02:03.030> hemisphere<00:02:03.479> won't<00:02:03.719> get<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the southern hemisphere won't get to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.719 
the southern hemisphere won't get to
spot<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.250> constellation

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
spot this one the the constellation

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.029 
spot this one the the constellation
Perseus<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.479> below<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> horizon<00:02:07.409> if<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
Perseus will be below the horizon if you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.320 
Perseus will be below the horizon if you
say<00:02:08.220> Australia<00:02:08.789> or<00:02:08.910> anywhere<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.270> the

southern hemisphere

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.830 
southern hemisphere
so<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.830> very<00:02:11.039> difficult<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:12.209> see<00:02:12.480> any

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
so it's very difficult to see any

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.839 
so it's very difficult to see any
leaders<00:02:13.470> there<00:02:13.709> will<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:13.890> there<00:02:14.670> will<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:14.790> a

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
leaders there will be there will be a

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.790 
leaders there will be there will be a
few<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.330> will<00:02:15.540> probably<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:16.620> probably

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
few that will probably you can probably

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.620 
few that will probably you can probably
see<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.489> very<00:02:17.700> very<00:02:17.910> bright<00:02:18.120> ones<00:02:18.360> when<00:02:18.540> they

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
see it's very very bright ones when they

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.350 
see it's very very bright ones when they
come<00:02:18.840> overhead<00:02:19.140> from<00:02:19.560> horizon<00:02:20.280> there's<00:02:21.090> very

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
come overhead from horizon there's very

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.670 
come overhead from horizon there's very
difficult<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:21.870> southern<00:02:22.140> hemisphere<00:02:22.530> so

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
difficult in southern hemisphere so

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.949 
difficult in southern hemisphere so

just do not know anything you don't need
a<00:02:56.430> telescope<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.970> don't<00:02:57.209> need<00:02:57.330> binoculars

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
a telescope you don't need binoculars

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.990 
a telescope you don't need binoculars
you<00:02:57.959> can<00:02:58.049> just<00:02:58.319> lay<00:02:58.650> down<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.860> spot<00:02:59.340> them<00:02:59.489> you

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
you can just lay down and spot them you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.850 
you can just lay down and spot them you
need<00:03:00.180> no<00:03:00.630> equipment<00:03:00.930> apart<00:03:01.350> from<00:03:01.560> your<00:03:01.709> eyes

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
need no equipment apart from your eyes

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.259 
need no equipment apart from your eyes
so<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.280> make<00:03:02.610> sure<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.819> get<00:03:02.970> some<00:03:03.150> good

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
atmosphere radio waves will banks off of

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.039 
atmosphere radio waves will banks off of
them<00:03:26.100> so<00:03:26.430> what<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.030> need<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.299> do<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.690> try<00:03:28.019> and

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
them so what you need to do is try and

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.110 
them so what you need to do is try and

and<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.049> may<00:03:49.260> well<00:03:49.500> hear<00:03:49.799> little<00:03:50.100> pins<00:03:50.430> and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
and you may well hear little pins and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.490 
and you may well hear little pins and
you<00:03:51.090> may<00:03:51.239> well<00:03:51.390> suddenly<00:03:51.630> hear<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.320> radio

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
you may well suddenly hear the radio

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.530 
you may well suddenly hear the radio
station<00:03:53.069> come<00:03:53.310> into<00:03:53.609> focus<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.299> then

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
station come into focus and then

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.330 
station come into focus and then
disappear<00:03:55.049> because<00:03:55.739> that's<00:03:55.950> basically<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
disappear because that's basically the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.800 
disappear because that's basically the
radio<00:03:56.609> waves<00:03:56.790> bouncing<00:03:57.269> off<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.600> upper

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
radio waves bouncing off the upper

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.110 
radio waves bouncing off the upper
atmosphere<00:03:57.950> linking<00:03:58.950> back<00:03:59.069> bank<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.880> your

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
atmosphere linking back bank to your

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.449 
atmosphere linking back bank to your
radio<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.200> can<00:04:01.350> actually<00:04:01.440> do<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.829> think

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
radio and you can actually do it I think

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.289 
radio and you can actually do it I think
I'll<00:04:02.549> be<00:04:02.640> trying<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.940> this<00:04:03.060> year

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
I'll be trying it this year

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.180 
I'll be trying it this year
that's<00:04:03.750> quite<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.989> fun<00:04:04.230> little<00:04:04.650> thing<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.040> do

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
that's quite a fun little thing to do

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.650 
that's quite a fun little thing to do
