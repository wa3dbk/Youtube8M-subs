 but the gameplay of seeing the end of 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.320
 four and in this game play I want 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.840
 talk to you a little about 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.970
 one of the doubts you have about 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.590
 Questions have you asked me there? 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 example but ask why you play 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.300
 in the sesi goal and so on so let's go 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.980
 I'm going to talk about a lot of things. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.990
 finally I want to send a thank you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.850
 special is for us there are shops that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
 help the channel that is king and pixar 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.660
 The store links are on the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.090
 description for you to take a look at the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.290
 that they come digital and stay tuned to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.450
 promotions that staff are missing 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.329
 in ikea stores is worth attending 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.190
 So it's okay, the next folks are there. 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.100
 first I want to answer advanced 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 because I played the Lord personally 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.129
 of my club was playing and I 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.649
 invited to play and I thought it was good 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.660
 Come on, let's go play a game, see how it is. 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.280
 that works there that I have is second 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.960
 This had been a long time 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.850
 but I played very little I 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.680
 simply had not given much much 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.270
 year to play I went there is a bigger one 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 sharing than another and finished finished 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.850
 That was my god, but I'm going now. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.110
 with the clan staff 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.720
 they showed me how you play type 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.000
 most competitive mode of the game and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.770
 I really liked it, dude, I found it. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.180
 too interesting 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.549
 I started watching a lot of video from 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.950
 cs go big cantata championship 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.229
 you can look for and some clans that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.049
 for example unmin days in 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.750
 pajamas that more that there is another there 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.200
 playarte that is the other Brazilian people 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.140
 clown a quantiq game guy has a lot of clan 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.110
 big cs and I stopped to give a 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.390
 Look at this spam go out to record like this 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.759
 how were the competitive games and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.439
 I really do not have to say 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.570
 cs go competitively is a monster and I 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.770
 I really liked that, I started to play. 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.119
 that I want to play 100% 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.270
 competitively 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.149
 but of course 99% 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.799
 so I started playing the game is obvious 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.000
 already saying here I will not leave 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.509
 never in the field 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.300
 but playing cs go dude with the staff 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.970
 but in the most competitive way 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.470
 really see how the game 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.870
 after that many videos of the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.910
 guys playing dude I was scared 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.370
 There's a guy called screaming, I think the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.140
 His name is his nickname that he plays. 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.110
 week video games he plays not know 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.620
 what is the name is a european plan of cs 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.050
 go 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.870
 the guy I saw a video of him there guy is 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.520
 incredible old the way she plays and it's 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.360
 Of course it's one in million that plays 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.740
 that way 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.750
 but just thinking that you can give a 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.610
 time and really want something 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.770
 with the game you can reach a level 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.780
 next I say close because they are 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.910
 people who have played for more than ten years 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.960
 years so it really is difficult for you 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.060
 get to the level of a guy who plays 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.530
 since 1.6 and never stopped access to 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.140
 play on another fps 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.450
 but I still found it interesting and 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.430
 having a very cool performance even in the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.320
 collectively game playing against clay 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.030
 such thing that I thought I would not have 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.610
 so I'm having a performance 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.370
 interesting and I want to continue 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.470
 playing and talking about competitive too 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.990
 of the neighborhood of four I'm not playing 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.239
 plus 75 is because we can not 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.100
 I just do not like 5 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.380
 good part of the clan also think that after 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.010
 that ending the campaigns of 5 is able to 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.020
 staff also half that in the mid 5 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.640
 We're complaining about 50 because that way. 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.320
 not funny 58 points 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.140
 This is what I'm seeing. No one was a 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.120
 domain chan is a rush is a mistake 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.120
 You simply have to run kill and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.520
 catching the flag is not like the 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.709
 competitive bf3 where you had to 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.750
 to build a very big tactic is like this. 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.970
 You have to get two ways out and 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.560
 try to block answer the guys and 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.239
 pray that no one give answers 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.180
 You, because I respond to the domain and 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.470
 kicked it wrong then simply 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.940
 domination is there 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.250
 not to mention the various problems that 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.739
 game has to be hit cherry a week to 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.330
 You videos of how are you here to play? 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.340
 well at the end of four and this is one of the 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.620
 things that are bothering me a lot 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.500
 and I'll show you a video tomorrow 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.959
 in a match I played in letting 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.610
 My name is Ray at the resort where I played at 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.760
 Brazilian observer against a club 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.100
 Brazilian and the face the difference is glaring 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.220
 difference if you play at least my 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.620
 performance in a match against a 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.510
 and a Brazilian server of 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.220
 biotype by making a comparison 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.380
 normal matches than on server 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.410
 American even against Brazilian is 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.070
 yelling at the rich text is yelling 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.210
 too much 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.230
 so it really is I liked to play c 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.060
 of the Brazilian, but it is not the reality 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.290
 will not play never left Brazil 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.630
 official match is very rare this 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.610
 it happens because it's just one time and look there 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.050
 because no gringo that the young c 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.200
 but also complains about our 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.560
 pib american server will understand 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.910
 so it really gets complicated and with 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.750
 all the problems that my son has 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.400
 currently face then I can not see 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.860
 give this one by improving the game 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.510
 some one moment i just saw pete tha the 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.910
 Guys are trying so far nothing 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.250
 better the pace until the end of the game 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.840
 so it's really complicated for a 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.070
 game is very good I do not have to say the 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.530
 end of four is very good to play 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.490
 When does it work for you to play? 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.140
 when the hashtag is good when the game 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.210
 does not crash when server does not crash 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.100
 very good to play but rarely 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.530
 that it happens that it is then 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.380
 complicated I really like watching the movie 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.360
 but just as you are sure that 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.040
 So you have a little sadness with the 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.600
 what is happening with the series and 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.920
 also the price level playing 30 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.480
 too complicated 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.110
 Oh my god, I think the others 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.390
 big problems in the game but really 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.520
 It's complicated, I want to talk about it but 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.650
 The game that I really like is me. 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.990
 buying there now the new monitor I 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.280
 I'm getting there in the contacts are 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.110
 achieving a 144-hertz monitor and 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.330
 This will improve a lot in the game. 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.390
 also field number no code and cody no 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.460
 Sorry for the cs and such and I'll tell 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.880
 you a cs gameplay and goal 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.530
 probably later there at 6 and 6 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.870
 7 hours do not know 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.520
 explaining a little about the game one 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.870
 bit about what else is a dispute 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.580
 of the parts that I said here speaking a 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.440
 little about something else that I 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.090
 interested in the game and also 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.580
 because many of you cries asking 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.410
 For me to continue doing videos dcs gol 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.150
 I'll try to see more videos for you guys. 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.620
 there in the future without any doubt since it is 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.330
 a game playing a lot I'm enjoying it 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.640
 to play it because it 's a fun game 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.110
 It's a game when I die, I know I 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.660
 I died because I screwed up and did not 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:40.950
 why some ethical problem happens 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.780
 where the backrest to the side or something of the type 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.210
 it's really very interesting very good 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.500
 play nice to play until only 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.790
 of course it's very difficult so I'm going 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.560
 explain to you there in the next game 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.750
 play is like bringing a thing at least 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.730
 this goal and the reasons the other reasons 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.330
 Who can not in this video I'm 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.070
 Playing 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.200
 so if you like sugar and 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.760
 who are beautiful and will not leave, I hope 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.620
 you enjoyed the increase 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.530
 Thereafter competitive to see the son of 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.060
 four for you to leave with the ping 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:10.490
 I think you do not like the game very much 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.490
 a hug even more and spoke ah
