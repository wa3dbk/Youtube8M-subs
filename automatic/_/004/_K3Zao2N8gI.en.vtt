00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.089
 the welcome here to all unboxing 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.210
 another device, namely one 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.769
 printer is the print is the epson connect 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.719
 l 355 dined from epson thanks to such 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.490
 wise to provide and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.220
 the special feature of the eco tech is like 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.230
 the name already says the ink cartridges 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.760
 should stop for two years there are for 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.430
 any color or of course for 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.910
 black a cartridge that I know so much 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.750
 I have to go 70 meters 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.520
 It has all the capacity 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 neat and think times highways 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.700
 so maybe ten millimeters maybe or 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.690
 maybe 15 too 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:48.239
 but 70 is quite huge now 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:01:00.109
 let's see what is not opened 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:01:00.109
 very fresh hp printer is unfortunately 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:09.119
 black no more i do not and no 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:14.460
 that's why now not from epson either 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:19.870
 By the way, bad enough costs 100 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:26.220
 euro vp also website 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.220
 Team a less paper 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.960
 So once we have the packaging needs 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.500
 markus , of course, everything here 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.300
 it may look the other way 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.310
 we already have a picture of the 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.400
 printer's our 31 that means you can 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.210
 copy and print as normal 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.770
 here are a few hints yourself 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.330
 then the dimensions of the otherwise 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.920
 maybe for some, too 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.060
 interesting if you are in the game 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.220
 on a desk currency on one 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.520
 regal provide world so is it with 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.759
 740 times two inches wide 30 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.310
 centimeters deep and 14 5 inches high 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.380
 works so sx with windows 7 windows 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.370
 8 and so on with everything possible and 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.970
 time again beautiful 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.880
 this printer is synonymous times 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.100
 the eco function of home law 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.550
 if there is a lot of space, of course 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.140
 and siesta outside the printer 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.220
 attached and now such parts 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.910
 I believe it then directly to 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.250
 refill 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.320
 So I'm curious how the whole thing 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.810
 works and you can, of course 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.920
 from the smartphone via an appropriate 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:51.060
 app here print smartphone and tablet 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.060
 pc about this epson connect website yes 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:09.870
 on the packaging of this 355 so everything 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.290
 inside is a normal one 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.110
 power cable here what we have then 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.180
 once any hints cds and such 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.260
 on and on 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.150
 quick start instructions how to do the whole thing 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.150
 like a tree 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.290
 and I already find these surfaces 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.910
 Actually , the lure comes then 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:52.790
 somehow, one rainer four back 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:52.790
 piece but black yellow red blue off 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:15.209
 and when I thought of course up here 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.780
 is still a foil and that respect 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.359
 just against this because of this tank 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:41.760
 never right here but this previous year 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:44.430
 or away 201's something out so what you 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.169
 sometimes even the flap to scan feels 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.910
 now steal something else steak 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.979
 you have bigger ones here too 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.780
 Can scan books and rather to 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:58.160
 except for that the way flexible 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.080
 cultivated have now soft 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.320
 previously putted directly to it 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.610
 exactly no one can make it as high 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.200
 components are fed into the paper 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.960
 then forward, we have to different 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.100
 key relations yes sometimes a few 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.120
 Do not put glue away 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:22.810
 and each still throw the daddy like you 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.160
 Looks of course then drive the 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.980
 Of course, different fits once 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.350
 another led if it continues to invite 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:34.210
 off button further caste here more 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.450
 network information printing button the 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.710
 probably copies colored and button 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.780
 black and white and then another here 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.180
 caste where I somehow a test page 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.830
 or something that all sounds out 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.330
 for and what it even particularly 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:54.210
 Interesting is clear now 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:06:04.650
 These are the covers for the course 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:07.650
 colors the whole country moored like 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.650
 none 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.780
 dear little ones 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.190
 then probably the days are here 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.990
 just how can it be so now 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.280
 also do that now in one 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.810
 bit closer if it's me 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.180
 especially interesting because here 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.669
 Can you change the color? 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.169
 according to a movie and then 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.840
 no one probably even me 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:40.600
 Of course if the driver a 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.650
 filtered and then the printer 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.349
 accordingly take operational just yet 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.870
 a thing you have to ask someone 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:52.330
 the drug transports that 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.250
 probably the color is not straight ahead 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.919
 runs right here and could 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.789
 make the whole thing that then the 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:07.900
 color as I said not from the printer 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:09.630
 an offshoot of a say that 's it then 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:14.919
 first in the heart of unboxing the 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:16.960
 Epson thinks I 355 printer as said that 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.970
 color the energy transition should be up to two 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.220
 I think I was twelve years old 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.560
 for this deal then costs ten each 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.289
 euro so really cheap what 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.639
 You can print here with this printer 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:28.620
 With the new techniques we will then 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:31.570
 So overlook 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.010
 ultimately the print quality then 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.470
 Overall, how long are you looking 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:38.220
 here on the youtube channel and up to 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.220
 next time bye
