00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
robotics competition has just been

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.720 
robotics competition has just been
unveiled<00:00:33.660> we're<00:00:34.660> talking<00:00:34.840> about<00:00:35.110> our

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
unveiled we're talking about our

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.450 
unveiled we're talking about our
reactions<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.059> game<00:00:37.710> yeah<00:00:38.710> I<00:00:38.980> mean<00:00:39.250> I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
reactions to the game yeah I mean I

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.280 
reactions to the game yeah I mean I
think<00:00:39.489> it's<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.600> frisbees<00:00:40.989> are<00:00:41.110> pretty

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
think it's the frisbees are pretty

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.140 
think it's the frisbees are pretty
awesome<00:00:41.350> right<00:00:41.830> it's<00:00:42.280> going<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.730> be<00:00:42.820> hard<00:00:43.030> it's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
awesome right it's going to be hard it's

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.700 
awesome right it's going to be hard it's
a<00:00:43.269> hard<00:00:43.300> it's<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.900> hard<00:00:43.930> game<00:00:44.260> piece<00:00:44.559> to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
a hard it's a hard game piece to

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.140 
a hard it's a hard game piece to
manipulate<00:00:45.220> you<00:00:45.400> know<00:00:45.519> picking<00:00:45.730> them<00:00:45.910> up<00:00:45.970> off

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
manipulate you know picking them up off

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.549 
manipulate you know picking them up off
floor<00:00:46.449> there's<00:00:46.900> there's<00:00:47.199> a<00:00:47.260> potential

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
floor there's there's a potential

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.930 
floor there's there's a potential
they're<00:00:47.739> gonna<00:00:47.830> be<00:00:47.949> upside<00:00:48.250> down<00:00:48.400> right<00:00:48.430> side

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
they're gonna be upside down right side

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.729 
they're gonna be upside down right side
up<00:00:49.090> having<00:00:49.449> to<00:00:49.510> turn<00:00:49.660> them<00:00:49.809> over<00:00:49.900> yeah<00:00:50.320> orite

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
up having to turn them over yeah orite

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.439 
up having to turn them over yeah orite
and<00:00:50.980> orienting<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.670> device<00:00:51.940> is<00:00:52.150> going<00:00:52.330> to<00:00:52.390> be

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
and orienting the device is going to be

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.869 
and orienting the device is going to be
really<00:00:52.570> difficult<00:00:52.930> just<00:00:53.890> which<00:00:54.370> way<00:00:54.579> gets

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
really difficult just which way gets

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.490 
really difficult just which way gets
sucked<00:00:55.149> up<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.570> shooting<00:00:55.840> &amp;<00:00:56.140> boos<00:00:56.290> easy

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
sucked up and shooting &amp; boos easy

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.290 
sucked up and shooting &amp; boos easy
shooting<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.160> ball<00:00:57.309> that's<00:00:57.879> for<00:00:58.059> sure<00:00:58.180> we've

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
shooting the ball that's for sure we've

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.150 
shooting the ball that's for sure we've
never<00:00:58.329> shot<00:00:58.719> a<00:00:58.750> disc<00:00:59.440> or<00:00:59.649> anything<00:00:59.980> like<00:01:00.010> this

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
never shot a disc or anything like this

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.279 
never shot a disc or anything like this
before<00:01:00.520> so<00:01:00.969> shouldn't<00:01:01.750> be<00:01:01.809> tough<00:01:01.989> than<00:01:02.200> the

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
before so shouldn't be tough than the

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.380 
before so shouldn't be tough than the
lifting<00:01:02.680> right<00:01:02.980> everything's<00:01:03.910> cool<00:01:04.149> we've

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
lifting right everything's cool we've

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.480 
lifting right everything's cool we've
done<00:01:04.570> that<00:01:04.750> but<00:01:04.989> it's<00:01:05.830> kind<00:01:06.039> of<00:01:06.070> cool<00:01:06.250> it's

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
done that but it's kind of cool it's

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.430 
done that but it's kind of cool it's
it's<00:01:06.759> a<00:01:06.970> it's<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.479> triangle<00:01:08.050> it's<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.200> pyramid

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
it's a it's a triangle it's a pyramid

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.050 
it's a it's a triangle it's a pyramid
it's<00:01:08.710> not<00:01:08.830> just<00:01:09.039> straight<00:01:09.310> up<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:09.670> you<00:01:09.729> can't

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
it's not just straight up so you can't

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.359 
it's not just straight up so you can't
just<00:01:10.810> go<00:01:10.930> under<00:01:11.229> it<00:01:11.289> and<00:01:11.350> hang<00:01:11.530> necessarily<00:01:12.220> i

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
just go under it and hang necessarily i

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.540 
just go under it and hang necessarily i
foresee<00:01:12.789> a<00:01:12.820> lot<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.119> tangled<00:01:13.450> robots<00:01:13.810> again

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
foresee a lot of tangled robots again

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.680 
foresee a lot of tangled robots again
it's<00:01:15.550> almost<00:01:15.729> like<00:01:16.060> teams<00:01:16.360> that<00:01:16.660> just

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
it's almost like teams that just

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.340 
it's almost like teams that just
consistently<00:01:17.590> hang<00:01:17.950> are<00:01:18.369> going<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.210> be<00:01:19.360> early

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
consistently hang are going to be early

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.920 
consistently hang are going to be early
on<00:01:20.530> out<00:01:20.740> scoring<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.399> lot<00:01:21.430> of<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.930> shooting

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
on out scoring a lot of the shooting

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.680 
on out scoring a lot of the shooting
options<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:24.190> then<00:01:24.340> your<00:01:24.490> good<00:01:24.700> score<00:01:25.390> three

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
options and then your good score three

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.419 
options and then your good score three
goals<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.319> you<00:01:26.440> don't<00:01:26.590> even<00:01:26.679> at<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.099> one<00:01:27.250> inch

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
goals and you don't even at the one inch

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:28.949 
goals and you don't even at the one inch
hang<00:01:27.670> yeah<00:01:28.240> if<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.479> have<00:01:28.569> to<00:01:28.660> be<00:01:28.750> really

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:28.959 
hang yeah if you have to be really

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:30.419 
hang yeah if you have to be really
confident<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.530> you're<00:01:29.619> able<00:01:29.709> to<00:01:29.950> score<00:01:30.160> three

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
confident and you're able to score three

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:31.650 
confident and you're able to score three
and<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.580> time<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.849> takes<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.119> hang<00:01:31.390> at<00:01:31.509> least

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
and the time it takes the hang at least

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.969 
and the time it takes the hang at least
frame<00:01:31.869> game<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.289> stuff<00:01:32.440> like<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.619> if<00:01:32.830> you're

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
frame game and stuff like that if you're

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.130 
frame game and stuff like that if you're
not<00:01:33.099> going<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.399> hang<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.420> hanging<00:01:34.630> is<00:01:34.840> actually

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
not going to hang so hanging is actually

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.620 
not going to hang so hanging is actually
a<00:01:35.200> pretty<00:01:35.560> big<00:01:35.860> point<00:01:36.700> value<00:01:37.030> there<00:01:37.240> about

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
a pretty big point value there about

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.999 
a pretty big point value there about
drivetrain<00:01:38.140> do<00:01:38.289> you<00:01:38.380> want<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.560> just<00:01:38.649> do<00:01:38.770> four

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
drivetrain do you want to just do four

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.389 
drivetrain do you want to just do four
wheel<00:01:39.130> drive<00:01:39.399> maybe<00:01:39.849> mecanim<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:41.280> think<00:01:42.280> we

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
wheel drive maybe mecanim I think we

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.400 
wheel drive maybe mecanim I think we
should<00:01:42.429> try<00:01:42.759> both<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.330> mean<00:01:43.539> if<00:01:43.840> we<00:01:44.080> want<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.349> be

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
should try both I mean if we want to be

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.080 
should try both I mean if we want to be
picking<00:01:44.709> them<00:01:44.830> off<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.220> floor<00:01:45.490> especially

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
picking them off the floor especially

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.880 
picking them off the floor especially
for<00:01:46.569> trying<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.810> track<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.200> target<00:01:47.380> we<00:01:47.830> want

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
for trying to track the target we want

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.290 
for trying to track the target we want
to<00:01:48.130> be<00:01:48.220> nimble<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:50.440> maybe<00:01:51.009> we<00:01:51.250> can<00:01:51.399> just<00:01:51.910> make

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
to be nimble so maybe we can just make

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.169 
to be nimble so maybe we can just make
our<00:01:52.479> drivetrain<00:01:52.959> interchangeable<00:01:54.030> where<00:01:55.030> we

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
our drivetrain interchangeable where we

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.370 
our drivetrain interchangeable where we
can<00:01:55.360> try<00:01:55.599> mcadams<00:01:56.440> a<00:01:56.590> hand<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:57.160> tank<00:01:57.459> drive

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
can try mcadams a hand a tank drive

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.660 
can try mcadams a hand a tank drive
probably<00:01:59.380> sit<00:01:59.530> with<00:01:59.679> four<00:01:59.890> wheels<00:02:00.039> both<00:02:00.369> ways

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
probably sit with four wheels both ways

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.609 
probably sit with four wheels both ways
yeah<00:02:01.209> so<00:02:01.450> we'll<00:02:01.810> build<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.140> as<00:02:02.259> four<00:02:02.470> wheel

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
yeah so we'll build it as four wheel

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.770 
yeah so we'll build it as four wheel
drive<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:02.979> we<00:02:03.099> can<00:02:03.250> swap<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.729> wheels<00:02:03.910> as<00:02:04.239> we

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
drive and we can swap the wheels as we

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.440 
drive and we can swap the wheels as we
see<00:02:05.020> fit<00:02:05.500> once<00:02:06.459> we're<00:02:06.670> there<00:02:06.700> we've<00:02:07.090> got<00:02:07.270> the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
see fit once we're there we've got the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.690 
see fit once we're there we've got the
cross<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.050> road<00:02:08.229> canopy<00:02:08.770> so<00:02:09.130> it's<00:02:09.580> just

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
cross the road canopy so it's just

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.979 
cross the road canopy so it's just
walking<00:02:10.000> between<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.390> two<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.690> should<00:02:10.720> just

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
walking between the two it should just

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.440 
walking between the two it should just
be<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.170> house<00:02:11.860> is<00:02:12.069> really<00:02:12.250> easy<00:02:12.459> we're<00:02:13.300> going

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
be the house is really easy we're going

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.850 
be the house is really easy we're going
to<00:02:13.510> think<00:02:13.690> about<00:02:13.720> making<00:02:14.110> trying<00:02:14.800> to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
to think about making trying to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.979 
to think about making trying to
prototype<00:02:15.130> some<00:02:15.430> designs<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.420> shoot<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.720> disc

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
prototype some designs to shoot a disc

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.290 
prototype some designs to shoot a disc
yep<00:02:17.590> I'm<00:02:18.069> probably<00:02:18.489> going<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.879> want<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.060> try<00:02:19.270> to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
yep I'm probably going to want to try to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.089 
yep I'm probably going to want to try to
figure<00:02:19.569> out<00:02:19.690> do<00:02:20.379> some<00:02:20.560> brain<00:02:20.739> something

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
figure out do some brain something

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.350 
figure out do some brain something
around<00:02:21.310> at<00:02:21.970> least<00:02:22.150> some<00:02:22.480> climbing

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
around at least some climbing

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.420 
around at least some climbing
