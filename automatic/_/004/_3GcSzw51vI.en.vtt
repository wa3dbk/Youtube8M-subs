intermediate level rather than the basic
level<00:00:17.410> and<00:00:18.190> as<00:00:18.310> we<00:00:18.460> explained<00:00:18.850> earlier<00:00:19.090> on<00:00:19.449> the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
level and as we explained earlier on the

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.779 
level and as we explained earlier on the
technique<00:00:19.960> of<00:00:20.109> the<00:00:20.170> straw<00:00:20.529> buck<00:00:21.250> starts<00:00:21.670> a

as much as a 90 degrees we possibly can

as much as a 90 degrees we possibly can
without<00:00:27.429> using<00:00:27.939> our<00:00:28.029> wrists<00:00:28.529> even<00:00:29.529> when<00:00:29.679> we

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
without using our wrists even when we

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.740 
without using our wrists even when we
get<00:00:29.920> into<00:00:30.070> intermediate<00:00:30.759> level<00:00:31.060> there's<00:00:31.509> no

little bit quicker than we did in the
earlier<00:00:46.809> explanation<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:48.699> action<00:00:49.090> is

the straw I'm looking to keep the bottom
with<00:00:58.870> me<00:00:58.989> but<00:00:59.170> at<00:00:59.410> table<00:00:59.829> level<00:01:00.129> wait<00:01:01.000> for<00:01:01.239> the

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
with me but at table level wait for the

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.759 
with me but at table level wait for the
ball<00:01:01.510> to<00:01:01.539> come<00:01:01.840> to<00:01:02.019> me<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.320> it<00:01:02.440> will<00:01:02.620> do

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
ball to come to me and it will do

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.610 
ball to come to me and it will do
because<00:01:03.010> it's<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.280> fastball<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:04.090> then<00:01:04.989> we<00:01:05.170> just

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
because it's a fastball and then we just

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.950 
because it's a fastball and then we just
extend<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.160> arm<00:01:06.340> from<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.730> elbow<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.570> we<00:01:07.810> go

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
extend the arm from the elbow and we go

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.480 
extend the arm from the elbow and we go
through<00:01:08.200> as<00:01:08.320> quick<00:01:08.590> as<00:01:08.680> we<00:01:08.710> possibly<00:01:09.190> can

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
through as quick as we possibly can

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.790 
through as quick as we possibly can
making<00:01:10.480> sure<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.960> angles<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.440> its<00:01:11.560> right

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
making sure the angles in its right

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.950 
making sure the angles in its right
plane<00:01:12.190> that<00:01:12.910> becomes<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:13.420> matter<00:01:13.840> of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
plane that becomes a matter of

plane that becomes a matter of
experience<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.830> practice<00:01:15.160> or<00:01:15.310> tell<00:01:15.520> us<00:01:15.640> what

experience and practice or tell us what

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.990 
experience and practice or tell us what
angle<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.360> is<00:01:16.980> but<00:01:17.980> at<00:01:18.100> this<00:01:18.190> stage<00:01:18.250> ascend

began<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.590> repeat<00:01:20.590> there's<00:01:21.220> no<00:01:21.460> urgency<00:01:22.030> to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
began a repeat there's no urgency to

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.260 
began a repeat there's no urgency to
start<00:01:22.960> looking<00:01:23.320> at<00:01:23.440> using<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.950> wrist<00:01:24.240> yes

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
start looking at using the wrist yes

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.840 
start looking at using the wrist yes
wrists<00:01:26.110> will<00:01:26.410> have<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:26.740> be<00:01:26.890> used<00:01:27.070> but<00:01:27.490> not<00:01:27.700> at

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
wrists will have to be used but not at

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.750 
wrists will have to be used but not at
this<00:01:28.000> stage<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:29.650> only<00:01:29.860> need<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.280> start<00:01:30.520> using

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
this stage we only need to start using

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.300 
this stage we only need to start using
it<00:01:31.060> when<00:01:31.660> we<00:01:31.810> get<00:01:31.960> into<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.380> next<00:01:32.500> phase<00:01:32.830> and

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
it when we get into the next phase and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.660 
it when we get into the next phase and
we'll<00:01:33.430> talk<00:01:33.610> about<00:01:33.790> that<00:01:33.940> in<00:01:34.120> a<00:01:34.300> little<00:01:34.420> while

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
we'll talk about that in a little while

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.040 
we'll talk about that in a little while
well<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.850> difference<00:01:37.240> between<00:01:37.330> this<00:01:37.690> the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
well the difference between this the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.050 
well the difference between this the
shot<00:01:38.290> we're<00:01:38.440> trying<00:01:38.680> to<00:01:38.800> look<00:01:39.010> at<00:01:39.130> now<00:01:39.340> that's

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
shot we're trying to look at now that's

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.940 
shot we're trying to look at now that's
against<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.510> first<00:01:40.750> one<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.440> onlooker

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
against the first one is to the onlooker

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.010 
against the first one is to the onlooker
it'll<00:01:45.220> look<00:01:45.340> very<00:01:45.610> very<00:01:45.910> this<00:01:46.120> very<00:01:46.180> much<00:01:46.840> the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
it'll look very very this very much the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.520 
it'll look very very this very much the
same<00:01:47.260> but<00:01:48.220> it's<00:01:48.430> not<00:01:49.020> because<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.170> bat<00:01:50.380> is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
same but it's not because the bat is

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.620 
same but it's not because the bat is
still<00:01:50.650> sighting<00:01:51.220> in<00:01:51.310> this<00:01:51.430> position<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.120> I'm

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
still sighting in this position and I'm

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.990 
still sighting in this position and I'm
just<00:01:52.840> waiting<00:01:53.350> for<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.160> right<00:01:54.340> ball<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.850> I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
just waiting for the right ball that I

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000 
just waiting for the right ball that I
think<00:01:55.330> I<00:01:55.450> can<00:01:55.630> accelerate<00:01:56.020> my<00:01:56.440> forearm

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
think I can accelerate my forearm

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.250 
think I can accelerate my forearm
through<00:01:57.340> you'll<00:01:57.730> see<00:01:58.000> at<00:01:58.120> this<00:01:58.270> line<00:01:58.540> here<00:01:59.110> I

through you'll see at this line here I

now I am now I am very very quick very
very<00:02:05.770> fast<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:07.660> that<00:02:07.930> gives<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.289> tremendous

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
very fast and that gives you tremendous

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.889 
very fast and that gives you tremendous
amount<00:02:09.129> of<00:02:09.250> Pierce<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:10.239> reasonable<00:02:10.720> amount

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
amount of Pierce and a reasonable amount

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.200 
amount of Pierce and a reasonable amount
of<00:02:11.110> topspin<00:02:11.590> you've<00:02:12.130> got<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.490> judge<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.000> line

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
of topspin you've got to judge the line

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.990 
of topspin you've got to judge the line
of<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.450> ball

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
those two were perfect examples so you

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.170 
those two were perfect examples so you
can't<00:02:22.010> do<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.370> every<00:02:22.640> time

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the concentration comes in so you make

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.600 
the concentration comes in so you make

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
correct if you hit it correct it should

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.370 
correct if you hit it correct it should
do<00:03:19.970> some<00:03:20.209> damage<00:03:20.570> on<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.840> other<00:03:20.959> side<00:03:21.230> you

do some damage on the other side you

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.380 
do some damage on the other side you
might<00:03:21.590> not<00:03:21.830> win<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.130> point<00:03:22.400> but<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.299> will

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
might not win the point but it will

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.509 
might not win the point but it will
certainly<00:03:23.600> put<00:03:24.019> your<00:03:24.170> opponent<00:03:24.260> in<00:03:25.070> some

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
certainly put your opponent in some

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.470 
certainly put your opponent in some
danger<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:28.250> angle<00:03:28.580> obviously<00:03:28.970> when<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.150> hit<00:03:29.330> in

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
danger the angle obviously when I hit in

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.720 
danger the angle obviously when I hit in
the<00:03:29.570> ball<00:03:29.780> very<00:03:30.110> very<00:03:30.470> quick<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.280> angle<00:03:31.640> will

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
the ball very very quick the angle will

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.690 
the ball very very quick the angle will
be<00:03:31.880> actually<00:03:32.269> called<00:03:32.510> more<00:03:32.690> claws<00:03:33.080> so

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
be actually called more claws so

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.740 
be actually called more claws so
exaggerating<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.850> instead<00:03:35.269> of<00:03:35.360> hitting<00:03:35.510> it

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
exaggerating it instead of hitting it

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.080 
exaggerating it instead of hitting it
through<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.860> will<00:03:37.010> then<00:03:37.190> close<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.549> angle

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
through you will then close the angle

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.930 
through you will then close the angle
more<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:39.019> hit<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.440> through<00:03:39.680> as<00:03:39.799> well<00:03:40.040> but<00:03:40.790> the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
more and hit it through as well but the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.819 
more and hit it through as well but the
angle<00:03:41.209> is<00:03:41.330> lower<00:03:41.570> so<00:03:41.750> consequently<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.650> ball

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
angle is lower so consequently the ball

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.080 
angle is lower so consequently the ball
was<00:03:43.070> aware<00:03:43.430> lawyer<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:44.030> gives<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.049> more<00:03:45.230> spin

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
was aware lawyer and gives it more spin

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.470 
was aware lawyer and gives it more spin
when<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.180> hit<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.450> ball<00:03:49.180> providing<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.269> buff

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
when you hit the ball providing the buff

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.150 
when you hit the ball providing the buff
is<00:03:50.690> starting<00:03:51.230> at<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.350> table<00:03:51.709> level<00:03:51.890> and

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
is starting at the table level and

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.140 
is starting at the table level and
coming<00:03:52.579> up<00:03:52.700> into<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.030> ball<00:03:54.579> so<00:03:55.579> we<00:03:55.730> pick<00:03:56.000> the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
coming up into the ball so we pick the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.180 
coming up into the ball so we pick the
right<00:03:56.299> one<00:03:56.570> each<00:03:57.320> from<00:03:57.560> there<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:59.810> one

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
right one each from there that one

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.580 
right one each from there that one
that's<00:04:01.190> feeding<00:04:01.510> that's<00:04:02.510> feeding<00:04:02.810> that's

that's feeding that's feeding that's

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.710 
that's feeding that's feeding that's
hitting<00:04:03.860> feeding<00:04:04.820> feeding<00:04:05.650> hitting<00:04:06.650> feed<00:04:07.459> in

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
hitting feeding feeding hitting feed in

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.830 
hitting feeding feeding hitting feed in
feed<00:04:08.720> in<00:04:09.040> hitting<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:11.360> it's<00:04:11.510> just<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.720> question

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
feed in hitting so it's just a question

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.569 
feed in hitting so it's just a question
of<00:04:12.019> an<00:04:12.170> attorney<00:04:12.470> turning<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.190> angles<00:04:13.519> you're

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
of an attorney turning the angles you're

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.039 
of an attorney turning the angles you're
quite<00:04:13.760> you're<00:04:13.880> just<00:04:14.150> turning<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.690> angle

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
quite you're just turning the angle

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.890 
quite you're just turning the angle
slightly<00:04:15.799> when<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.579> can<00:04:16.760> making<00:04:16.910> yourself<00:04:17.359> to

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
slightly when you can making yourself to

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.640 
slightly when you can making yourself to
the<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.769> hit<00:04:19.010> one<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.400> hard<00:04:19.700> one

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
the to the hit one the hard one

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.680 
the to the hit one the hard one
so<00:04:22.190> we<00:04:22.310> just<00:04:22.460> have<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.639> key<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.000> ball<00:04:23.270> go<00:04:23.660> in

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
so we just have to key the ball go in

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.470 
so we just have to key the ball go in
and<00:04:24.080> it's<00:04:24.199> there

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
and it's there

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.810 
and it's there
so<00:04:26.480> to<00:04:26.540> recap<00:04:26.860> it's<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.040> action<00:04:28.400> in<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.610> same

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
so to recap it's the action in the same

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.340 
so to recap it's the action in the same
as<00:04:29.000> before<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.630> bottom<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.139> bath<00:04:30.320> of

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
as before the bottom of the bath of

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.710 
as before the bottom of the bath of
turbo<00:04:30.770> level<00:04:31.190> we're<00:04:31.970> looking<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.389> keep<00:04:32.540> the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
turbo level we're looking to keep the

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.200 
turbo level we're looking to keep the
bat<00:04:32.900> arm<00:04:33.110> in<00:04:33.320> it's<00:04:33.440> 90<00:04:33.800> degrees<00:04:33.970> we're<00:04:34.970> looking

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
bat arm in it's 90 degrees we're looking

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.090 
bat arm in it's 90 degrees we're looking
to<00:04:35.330> play<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.660> ball<00:04:35.840> faster<00:04:36.410> from<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.770> elbow

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
to play the ball faster from the elbow

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.650 
to play the ball faster from the elbow
not<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.460> shoulder<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.030> shoulder<00:04:38.060> never

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
not the shoulder the shoulder never

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.650 
not the shoulder the shoulder never
brings<00:04:38.960> about<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.470> arm<00:04:39.680> into<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:40.070> at<00:04:40.340> all<00:04:40.660> the

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
brings about the arm into it at all the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.390 
brings about the arm into it at all the
bat<00:04:41.870> finishes<00:04:42.380> level<00:04:42.680> nor<00:04:42.860> higher<00:04:43.070> than<00:04:43.310> our

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
bat finishes level nor higher than our

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.400 
bat finishes level nor higher than our
face<00:04:43.729> and<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.510> certainly<00:04:44.840> doesn't<00:04:45.080> finish

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
face and it certainly doesn't finish

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.490 
face and it certainly doesn't finish
outside<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:46.010> body<00:04:46.190> line<00:04:46.570> in<00:04:47.570> fact<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.050> faster

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
outside the body line in fact the faster

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.770 
outside the body line in fact the faster
you<00:04:48.620> hit<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.889> ball<00:04:49.040> with<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.790> elbow<00:04:50.150> at<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.419> 90

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
you hit the ball with the elbow at a 90

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.469 
you hit the ball with the elbow at a 90
degrees<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.949> bat<00:04:52.160> on<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.850> bat<00:04:53.030> will<00:04:53.270> not

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
degrees the bat on the bat will not

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.420 
degrees the bat on the bat will not
finish<00:04:53.720> anywhere<00:04:54.229> near<00:04:54.410> your<00:04:54.560> face<00:04:54.800> it<00:04:55.280> will

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
finish anywhere near your face it will

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.850 
finish anywhere near your face it will
actually<00:04:55.790> be<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.240> slightly<00:04:56.870> shorter<00:04:57.560> stroke

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
actually be a slightly shorter stroke

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
actually be a slightly shorter stroke
but<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.490> will<00:04:58.610> be<00:04:58.790> a<00:04:58.940> quicker<00:04:59.419> strong
