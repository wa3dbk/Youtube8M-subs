and<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.539> built<00:00:22.430> ice<00:00:24.920> right<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.220> got

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and this is what I built ice right I got

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.029 
and this is what I built ice right I got
the<00:00:27.060> night<00:00:27.269> if<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:28.230> was<00:00:28.380> strong

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the night if it was strong

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.709 
the night if it was strong
well<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.640> thought<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:31.790> just<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.180> I

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
well I thought that just to see that I

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.530 
well I thought that just to see that I
built<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.410> cuz<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.040> wanted<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
built this cuz I wanted to see if it

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.810 
built this cuz I wanted to see if it
could<00:00:36.690> knock<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.899> down<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.829> could<00:00:38.040> that

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
could knock it down if it could that

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.470 
could knock it down if it could that
would<00:00:39.000> mean<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.719> strong<00:00:40.410> one<00:00:41.210> but<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
would mean it's a strong one but if the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.229 
would mean it's a strong one but if the
den<00:00:42.660> then<00:00:42.870> probably<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.730> meant<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.210> was

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
den then probably see it meant it was

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.889 
den then probably see it meant it was
weak<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:46.440> thing's<00:00:46.710> pretty<00:00:46.950> strong<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
weak that thing's pretty strong I

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.250 
weak that thing's pretty strong I
thought<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> heard<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.600> raining

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
thought I heard it and this it's raining

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:06.600 

and<00:00:58.600> on<00:00:59.600> these<00:00:59.870> I<00:01:00.230> missed<00:01:00.860> a<00:01:01.070> lot<00:01:01.220> of<00:01:01.280> wings

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.160 

it's<00:01:07.610> not<00:01:07.760> only<00:01:08.000> one<00:01:08.180> doing<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:08.479> now<00:01:08.630> it's<00:01:08.900> good

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
does um 45 to I think 30 40 whole - I

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.690 
does um 45 to I think 30 40 whole - I
gotta<00:01:14.900> get<00:01:15.050> in<00:01:15.229> somewhere<00:01:15.950> like<00:01:16.190> on<00:01:16.460> just

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
don't think just 40 40 to 50,000 hours

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.800 
don't think just 40 40 to 50,000 hours
of<00:01:24.619> winds<00:01:25.210> that's<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.540> wind<00:01:26.720> gusts<00:01:28.240> 40<00:01:29.240> and

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:42.980 

it's<00:01:32.810> really<00:01:33.110> cool
