at<00:00:05.470> the<00:00:05.680> new<00:00:05.800> Matterhorn<00:00:06.370> circuit<00:00:06.850> which<00:00:07.029> was

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
at the new Matterhorn circuit which was

at the new Matterhorn circuit which was
shown<00:00:07.420> this<00:00:07.600> week<00:00:07.810> at<00:00:08.019> e3<00:00:08.140> on<00:00:08.560> the<00:00:08.800> Gran

shown this week at e3 on the Gran
Turismo<00:00:09.690> circuit<00:00:10.690> will<00:00:10.809> be<00:00:10.990> looking<00:00:11.080> forward

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
Turismo circuit will be looking forward

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.950 
Turismo circuit will be looking forward
to<00:00:11.679> I<00:00:11.889> love<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:12.730> views<00:00:13.030> on<00:00:13.240> this<00:00:13.450> circuit<00:00:13.870> at

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
to I love the views on this circuit at

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.920 
to I love the views on this circuit at
the<00:00:14.080> moment<00:00:14.440> it's<00:00:14.620> lots<00:00:14.830> of<00:00:15.009> up<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:15.940> down<00:00:16.180> hill

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
the moment it's lots of up and down hill

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.300 
the moment it's lots of up and down hill
at<00:00:17.110> the<00:00:17.200> moment<00:00:17.560> and<00:00:17.650> it's<00:00:17.830> looking<00:00:18.130> really

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
at the moment and it's looking really

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.330 
at the moment and it's looking really
nice<00:00:18.550> lots<00:00:18.910> of<00:00:19.029> detail<00:00:19.449> I<00:00:20.230> think<00:00:20.949> the<00:00:21.010> graphics

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
nice lots of detail I think the graphics

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.099 
nice lots of detail I think the graphics
do<00:00:21.519> look<00:00:21.730> a<00:00:21.849> little<00:00:22.000> bit<00:00:22.210> improved<00:00:22.779> over<00:00:23.080> the

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
do look a little bit improved over the

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.900 
do look a little bit improved over the
previous<00:00:23.320> gran<00:00:24.220> turismo<00:00:24.400> I<00:00:24.580> think<00:00:24.789> they've

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
previous gran turismo I think they've

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.490 
previous gran turismo I think they've
been<00:00:25.090> refined<00:00:25.539> but<00:00:25.810> I'm<00:00:25.929> not<00:00:26.080> going<00:00:26.230> to<00:00:26.289> do<00:00:26.380> the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
been refined but I'm not going to do the

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.439 
been refined but I'm not going to do the
reflection<00:00:27.099> right<00:00:27.640> now<00:00:27.820> I'm<00:00:28.000> going<00:00:28.150> to<00:00:28.210> add<00:00:28.300> in

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
reflection right now I'm going to add in

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.390 
reflection right now I'm going to add in
a<00:00:28.509> lot<00:00:28.660> of<00:00:28.720> that<00:00:28.869> later<00:00:29.080> I'm<00:00:29.590> just<00:00:29.920> taking<00:00:30.250> in<00:00:30.340> a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
a lot of that later I'm just taking in a

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.280 
a lot of that later I'm just taking in a
lap<00:00:30.550> of<00:00:30.699> the<00:00:30.759> circuit<00:00:31.150> with<00:00:31.300> you<00:00:31.480> we<00:00:32.170> don't

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
lap of the circuit with you we don't

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.380 
lap of the circuit with you we don't
have<00:00:32.529> we<00:00:33.100> did<00:00:33.400> have<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.640> direct<00:00:33.970> feed<00:00:34.120> on<00:00:34.270> this

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
have we did have the direct feed on this

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.479 
have we did have the direct feed on this
video<00:00:34.690> don't<00:00:35.260> sound<00:00:35.530> should<00:00:35.680> I<00:00:35.770> say<00:00:35.980> but

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
video don't sound should I say but

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.040 
video don't sound should I say but
unfortunately<00:00:37.210> someone<00:00:37.450> accidentally

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
unfortunately someone accidentally

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.080 
unfortunately someone accidentally
turned<00:00:38.290> down<00:00:38.469> the<00:00:38.590> music<00:00:38.890> rather<00:00:39.340> so<00:00:39.910> they

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
turned down the music rather so they

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.940 
turned down the music rather so they
turn<00:00:40.270> down<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.450> car<00:00:40.899> engine<00:00:41.350> rather<00:00:41.649> than<00:00:41.860> the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
turn down the car engine rather than the

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.830 
turn down the car engine rather than the
music<00:00:42.070> which<00:00:42.430> is<00:00:42.460> ashamed<00:00:43.120> only<00:00:43.360> ever<00:00:43.570> ended

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
music which is ashamed only ever ended

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.660 
music which is ashamed only ever ended
up<00:00:43.930> and<00:00:44.050> put<00:00:44.170> all<00:00:44.559> my<00:00:44.590> silent<00:00:45.129> run<00:00:45.250> but<00:00:45.460> you<00:00:45.520> do

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
up and put all my silent run but you do

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.760 
up and put all my silent run but you do
hear<00:00:45.850> lots<00:00:46.059> of<00:00:46.210> sound<00:00:46.450> effects<00:00:46.770> apparently

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
hear lots of sound effects apparently

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.119 
hear lots of sound effects apparently
the<00:00:48.190> sound<00:00:48.699> effects<00:00:49.000> are<00:00:49.239> placeholders<00:00:49.949> so<00:00:50.949> we

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
the sound effects are placeholders so we

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.680 
the sound effects are placeholders so we
wait<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.670> see<00:00:51.699> if<00:00:51.850> that's<00:00:52.120> something<00:00:52.239> where

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
wait to see if that's something where

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.540 
wait to see if that's something where
they've<00:00:52.840> responded<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.739> criticisms<00:00:54.340> of

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
they've responded to the criticisms of

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.670 
they've responded to the criticisms of
this<00:00:54.760> week<00:00:54.969> or<00:00:55.510> whether<00:00:55.960> it's<00:00:56.140> something<00:00:56.469> that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
this week or whether it's something that

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.619 
this week or whether it's something that
is<00:00:57.550> actually<00:00:57.879> going<00:00:58.000> to<00:00:58.059> be<00:00:58.120> improved<00:00:58.510> upon

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
is actually going to be improved upon

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.389 
is actually going to be improved upon
radically<00:00:59.289> we<00:00:59.500> will<00:00:59.649> know<00:00:59.800> soon<00:00:59.829> there<00:01:00.309> is<00:01:00.340> a

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
radically we will know soon there is a

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.389 
radically we will know soon there is a
demo<00:01:00.760> coming<00:01:01.510> out<00:01:01.629> next<00:01:01.809> month<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:02.320> we<00:01:03.250> look

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
demo coming out next month and we look

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.770 
demo coming out next month and we look
forward<00:01:03.430> to<00:01:03.730> seeing<00:01:04.239> what<00:01:04.449> they<00:01:04.570> have<00:01:04.750> on

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
forward to seeing what they have on

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.030 
forward to seeing what they have on
there<00:01:05.080> let's<00:01:05.320> hope<00:01:05.470> they<00:01:05.620> don't<00:01:05.800> have<00:01:05.890> the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
there let's hope they don't have the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.350 
there let's hope they don't have the
placeholder<00:01:06.520> sound<00:01:06.730> effects<00:01:07.000> on<00:01:07.180> there

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
placeholder sound effects on there

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.910 
placeholder sound effects on there
because<00:01:07.510> if<00:01:07.690> they<00:01:08.110> are<00:01:08.230> placeholder<00:01:08.710> sound

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
because if they are placeholder sound

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.870 
because if they are placeholder sound
effects<00:01:09.190> then<00:01:09.400> they're<00:01:09.580> not<00:01:09.700> doing

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
effects then they're not doing

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.030 
effects then they're not doing
themselves<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.390> justice<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:11.470> track<00:01:11.770> looks

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
themselves to justice this track looks

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.170 
themselves to justice this track looks
nice<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.670> do<00:01:13.360> like<00:01:13.690> my<00:01:14.410> favorite<00:01:14.680> word

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
nice I do like my favorite word

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.610 
nice I do like my favorite word
undulation<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:17.050> there's<00:01:17.320> lots<00:01:17.440> of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
undulation and there's lots of

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.620 
undulation and there's lots of
undulation<00:01:18.040> on<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.760> circuit<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:22.180> it<00:01:22.420> you

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
undulation on this circuit I like it you

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.430 
undulation on this circuit I like it you
know<00:01:22.750> it's<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:23.310> got

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
know it's a got

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.840 
know it's a got
you'll<00:01:24.830> hear<00:01:25.040> that<00:01:25.190> you're<00:01:25.310> driving<00:01:25.700> off<00:01:25.820> the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
you'll hear that you're driving off the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.630 
you'll hear that you're driving off the
edge<00:01:26.030> down<00:01:26.630> there<00:01:27.020> most<00:01:27.920> feeling<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.370> depth

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
edge down there most feeling of depth

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.250 
edge down there most feeling of depth
and<00:01:28.790> everything<00:01:29.210> else<00:01:29.360> I've<00:01:29.930> seen<00:01:30.080> some

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
and everything else I've seen some

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.690 
and everything else I've seen some
people<00:01:30.530> being<00:01:30.650> critical<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.280> mountains

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
people being critical that the mountains

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.170 
people being critical that the mountains
in<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.880> background<00:01:31.940> aren't<00:01:32.860> rendered<00:01:34.180> I

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
in the background aren't rendered I

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.760 
in the background aren't rendered I
don't<00:01:36.110> think<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.350> would<00:01:36.440> make<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.560> huge

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
don't think it would make a huge

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.380 
don't think it would make a huge
difference<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.340> gameplay<00:01:37.490> experience<00:01:38.180> I

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
difference to the gameplay experience I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.380 
difference to the gameplay experience I
think<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.650> tarmac<00:01:40.010> detail<00:01:40.400> is<00:01:40.520> bland<00:01:40.820> though

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
think the tarmac detail is bland though

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.990 
think the tarmac detail is bland though
I<00:01:41.420> really<00:01:42.110> do<00:01:42.290> feel<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.670> it's<00:01:43.670> almost<00:01:43.820> a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
I really do feel that it's almost a

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.700 
I really do feel that it's almost a
little<00:01:44.180> bit<00:01:44.270> too<00:01:44.390> perfect<00:01:44.900> on<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.350> mountain

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
little bit too perfect on the mountain

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.770 
little bit too perfect on the mountain
side<00:01:45.740> like<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:46.160> you<00:01:46.610> know<00:01:46.730> get<00:01:47.090> battered<00:01:47.570> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.940

worn<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:49.450> don't<00:01:50.450> know<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.570> just<00:01:50.750> feel<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.230> it's

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
worn I don't know I just feel that it's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.250 
worn I don't know I just feel that it's
just<00:01:52.100> not<00:01:52.220> enough<00:01:52.430> life<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.660> tarmac<00:01:54.050> at

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
just not enough life to the tarmac at

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.450 
just not enough life to the tarmac at
the<00:01:54.350> moment<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:54.800> they<00:01:54.890> need<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.160> give<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.340> some
