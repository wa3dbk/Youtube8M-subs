00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to all mar cls last week 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.759
 I announced the release of a man 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.680
 free you are not made for me that it will be 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.480
 available from July 14th 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.480
 do not announce however to be the Madonna 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.790
 gear changed one from is last 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.949
 week I told you about the release of 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.560
 you are not my new for me 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.660
 novel from the best so better than the 7 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.000
 now there are only 9 days left 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.340
 week the star cacasotto and marzia 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 good at so many you asked me 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180
 how come I decided not to publish a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.040
 paper book since this will be 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.780
 available only in ebooks 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.489
 the first reason that this novel is 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.340
 I have been writing for some time but that is 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.390
 been a little improvised practically 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.590
 history is this 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.079
 he called me loved me and told me 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.719
 but there is a little that does not let out a 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.260
 true book and I answered yes mom you know 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.719
 what I tell you 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.949
 I do it on this one except for one 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.379
 story I felt I had to publish 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.670
 at this time also to close a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.680
 bit a chapter of my life 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.230
 so I said to myself why he doesn't 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.480
 a book so rotten to give you this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.909
 history and then letting go was one 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.010
 story lent to and sally I had 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.869
 already started but I finished by 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.610
 very little and therefore for the times 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.090
 paper publishing was a bit 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.890
 delay 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.450
 if I didn't really surprise her 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.850
 second reason is that writing books 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.799
 even if it doesn't look like it's a job 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.500
 so many sacrifices so much effort 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.330
 creativity nights spent thinking about who 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.860
 of you know me knows well that I think 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.380
 that any kind of creativity at bay 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.600
 paid should be paid in short as a 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.490
 normal work and we say unfortunately that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.560
 that wasn't the case with my first book 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.180
 and so I thought for those who entrust it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.920
 in the wrong hands when I can 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.829
 entrust it to this emanin and gilded e 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.570

 I was pleased and like a swarm 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.610
 I started making my way into mine 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.880
 head 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.560

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.110
 that obsessive the most dangerous of

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.190
 dangerously attracted began 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.270
 think about the less appropriate moments 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.640
 until I thought about it 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.890
 constantly I told you that 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.200

 wanting to see me because it was too early 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.569
 I don't know why but I found myself in 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.939
 this epistolary exchange of s 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.650
 if trying to convince you by alternating 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.840

 talking to you was wrong but 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.090
