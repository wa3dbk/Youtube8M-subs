00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.709
 g tv alfa romeo this exemplary 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.950

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.790
 in the most classic 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.980
 quite modern as we can see 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.980
 indeed it is practically new 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.980
 almost 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:12.220
 another fiat x1 9 and this is the one 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.400
 part of this circulating park 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:22.240
 rally and we look at the bottom there 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:26.200
 the matra simca bagheera that maybe a ma 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:30.130
 in between tells us to actually be a 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.500
 hicks version as we could 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.210
 see also if on the circulation card 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.140
 his own matra simca bagheera is indicated 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.580
 some hicks say that actually 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.030
 inside this car should 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:47.290
 belong to the s series to the s 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:51.280
 and this model tells us he told us the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:56.590
 race but between which the owner is 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.620
 a pseudonym what I mentioned says 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.680
 which clearly there are three versions of 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.660
 this model of car at the base the s 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.210
 and the ics that this would be he has 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.440
 however, the writing is canceled and here 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:17.290
 above was the word baghera hicks 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.160
 and he has his own linear 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.350
 recently but it's the version too 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.910
 on the card and situation is indicated as 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.370
 simca mother bagheera hicks and for how much 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.880
 regards the internal apparently the 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.860
 previous owner does not appear 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.900
 having changed it and therefore should be 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.030
 that actually of the 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.130
 car issue so there is 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.290
 enough to reason about it and 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.040
 to evaluate if this could be so 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.870
 actually an ics and as the. indicates 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.470
 car booklet the card of 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.320
 circulation we got to 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:59.950
 see in other comments in other posts 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.230
 of the sinca mania group and therefore there 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.080
 we reserve a little bit the doubt is 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.670
 to evaluate even if I repeat from 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.890
 circulation documents this car 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.639
 should actually be a matra 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.379
 simca bagheera hicks 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.289
 we see it is very beautiful a lot 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:21.499
 interesting as a model really 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.139
 something wonderful maybe in Malta 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:30.860
 keeps this car very well now 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:35.629
 let's get closer to the new samba book 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:40.249
 ls we see that people are going 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:42.319
 towards the castle to go and execute 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:46.189
 the visit in the meantime there will be refreshments 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:47.840
 at the bar and then we'll visit the museum 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:53.029
 air 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:56.930
 meanwhile we observe the talbot samba ls la 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:59.919

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.919
 after
