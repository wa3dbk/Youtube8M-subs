about externalizing the costs what that

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.750 
about externalizing the costs what that
means<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.349> real<00:00:28.590> costs<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.340> making

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
means is that the real costs of making

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.759 
means is that the real costs of making
stuff<00:00:29.970> aren't<00:00:30.480> captured<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> price<00:00:31.439> in

other<00:00:32.399> words<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:33.000> aren't<00:00:33.270> paying<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
other words we aren't paying for the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.319 
other words we aren't paying for the
stuff<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.410> buy<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.890> was<00:00:35.730> thinking<00:00:36.059> about<00:00:36.149> this

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
stuff we buy I was thinking about this

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270

the<00:00:36.510> other<00:00:36.540> day<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.020> was<00:00:37.410> walking<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.920> work<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the other day I was walking to work and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.530 
the other day I was walking to work and
I<00:00:38.309> wanted<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> listen<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> news<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.510> I

I wanted to listen to the news so I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.420 
I wanted to listen to the news so I
popped<00:00:39.870> into<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.170> Radio<00:00:40.469> Shack<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.950> buy<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> radio

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
popped into a Radio Shack to buy a radio

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.200 
popped into a Radio Shack to buy a radio
I<00:00:41.670> found<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.270> cute<00:00:42.540> little<00:00:42.629> green<00:00:43.079> radio<00:00:43.559> for

I found this cute little green radio for
$4.99<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.989> standing<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.559> line<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
$4.99 I was standing there in line to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.830 
$4.99 I was standing there in line to
buy<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.340> thing<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.760> was<00:00:47.910> thinking<00:00:48.270> how

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
buy this thing and I was thinking how

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.100 
buy this thing and I was thinking how
could<00:00:49.219> $4.99<00:00:50.219> possibly<00:00:51.030> capture<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> cost<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
could $4.99 possibly capture the cost of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.080 
could $4.99 possibly capture the cost of
making<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.710> radio<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.250> getting<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> into<00:00:53.820> my

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
