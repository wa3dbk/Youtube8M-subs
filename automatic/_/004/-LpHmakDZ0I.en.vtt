00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.720
 The last page of a torn fairy tale has been rewritten Now it's just a tragedy 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.640
 And the only person who believed in a happy ending Lost hope, she disappeared 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.320
 Love and dreams are nothing more fragile than a sand castle, windswept 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.840
 Ephemeral and useless even if we hope a little more of them 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.560
 But your voice still resonates in my mind and I still can not really forget you 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.640
 Neither the song that you sang, it is engraved in my heart and I return to this day 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.080
 Prisoner of a memory of which I want to free myself, chains prevent me from escaping 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.560
 Our two worlds are still connected 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.120
 The blue sea is the link that can not be cut 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.600
 It's sure "Love surpasses everything 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.640
 Of all the tests he overcomes 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.520
 Our destiny is written 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.640
 It's the stars who told me " 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.520
 These words must disappear 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.760
 Because lies are only told by traitors 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.920
 When you wake up, one morning 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.400
 That little waves make up your bed 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.280
 All over again, everything is over 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.680
 A new start 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.720
 In a soft light, you find the hope 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.520
 Warm and calm, you fall asleep 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.080
 And this hope that has matured 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.520
 Will change the sea finally 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.080
 You see the bells are ringing 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.240
 Happiness is here 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:59.600
 While the seven seas on all sides dazzle us 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.960
 This miracle of love 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.880
 Forever I cherish 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:20.800
 Because thanks to him you are there, without anyone around 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:35.760
 Gently and tenderly we kiss each other
