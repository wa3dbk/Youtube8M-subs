now<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:25.290> reason<00:03:25.590> I'm<00:03:25.680> showcasing<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:26.370> is

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
now the reason I'm showcasing this is

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.850 
now the reason I'm showcasing this is
that<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.239> neat<00:03:27.720> device<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.230> show<00:03:28.410> if<00:03:28.680> came

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
that it is a neat device to show if came

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.430 
that it is a neat device to show if came
across<00:03:29.100> my<00:03:29.130> path<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.940> leaving<00:03:30.780> my<00:03:30.900> part<00:03:31.200> today

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
across my path is leaving my part today

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.020 
across my path is leaving my part today
and<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.280> thought<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.640> would<00:03:32.670> be<00:03:32.820> worthwhile

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
and so I thought it would be worthwhile

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.390 
and so I thought it would be worthwhile
released<00:03:33.720> up<00:03:33.959> showing<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:34.860> off<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:34.980> little<00:03:35.190> bit

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
released up showing it off a little bit

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.460 
released up showing it off a little bit
while<00:03:35.730> we're<00:03:36.000> still<00:03:36.209> here<00:03:36.450> because<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.080> think

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
while we're still here because I I think

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.080 
while we're still here because I I think
the<00:03:37.530> future<00:03:37.770> has<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.220> lot<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.580> do<00:03:38.700> with<00:03:38.730> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
the future has a lot to do with the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.510 
the future has a lot to do with the
regularization<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.900> these<00:03:40.050> devices<00:03:40.520> protect

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
regularization of these devices protect

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.500 
regularization of these devices protect
this<00:03:41.640> out<00:03:41.820> there<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> really<00:03:42.270> cool

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510

see everything about these things are
designed<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.070> be<00:04:14.280> rugged<00:04:14.959> this<00:04:15.959> thing<00:04:16.169> is

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
designed to be rugged this thing is

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.480 
designed to be rugged this thing is
is<00:04:16.880> spring<00:04:17.240> loaded<00:04:17.470> so<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.560> clamp<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.250> device

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:19.490 
is spring loaded so you clamp the device

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.840 
is spring loaded so you clamp the device
down<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:20.030> in<00:04:20.360> to<00:04:20.450> release<00:04:20.750> down<00:04:20.990> you've<00:04:21.260> got<00:04:21.410> a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
down and in to release down you've got a

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.070 
down and in to release down you've got a
little<00:04:22.850> quick<00:04:23.000> release<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:23.510> let's<00:04:23.720> just<00:04:23.930> show

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
little quick release so let's just show

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.520 
little quick release so let's just show
you<00:04:24.140> how<00:04:24.290> that<00:04:24.320> works<00:04:25.750> place<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.870> device<00:04:26.990> into

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
you how that works place the device into

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.890 
you how that works place the device into
the<00:04:27.560> dock<00:04:28.130> like<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:28.700> leave<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.690> back

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
the dock like so leave it to the back

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.830 
the dock like so leave it to the back
and<00:04:30.110> then<00:04:30.860> give<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.730> rugged<00:04:32.420> sort<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.720> a

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
and then give it a rugged sort of a

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.070 
and then give it a rugged sort of a
clamp<00:04:33.350> motion<00:04:34.010> you<00:04:34.580> can<00:04:34.700> see<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:35.210> locks<00:04:35.930> it

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
clamp motion you can see that locks it

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.550 
clamp motion you can see that locks it
in<00:04:36.200> place<00:04:36.310> makes<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:37.400> extremely<00:04:37.610> rugged<00:04:38.090> and

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
in place makes it extremely rugged and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.980 
in place makes it extremely rugged and
you<00:04:39.560> can<00:04:39.710> have<00:04:39.830> this<00:04:39.980> mounted<00:04:40.370> in<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.520> vehicle

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
you can have this mounted in a vehicle

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.680 
you can have this mounted in a vehicle
when<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.110> look<00:04:42.290> at<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.500> machine<00:04:43.540> in<00:04:44.540> a

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
when you look at the machine in a

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.440 
when you look at the machine in a
vehicle<00:04:44.870> having<00:04:45.860> this<00:04:46.250> solid<00:04:46.790> state<00:04:47.090> disk

larger<00:04:52.870> but<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.990> main<00:04:54.170> benefit<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.220> having<00:04:55.310> a

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
larger but the main benefit of having a

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.800 
larger but the main benefit of having a
device<00:04:55.700> like<00:04:55.730> this<00:04:56.090> is<00:04:56.240> are<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:56.390> going<00:04:56.540> to<00:04:56.600> use

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
device like this is are you going to use

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.740 
device like this is are you going to use
it<00:04:56.960> in<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.200> in<00:04:57.500> an<00:04:57.710> ultra<00:04:58.250> rugged<00:04:58.970> environment

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
it in it in an ultra rugged environment

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.500 
it in it in an ultra rugged environment
right<00:05:00.200> by<00:05:01.040> doing<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.460> by<00:05:01.790> having<00:05:01.970> a<00:05:02.180> solid

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
right by doing that by having a solid

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.510 
right by doing that by having a solid
state<00:05:02.750> disk<00:05:03.080> as<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.410> main<00:05:03.590> hard<00:05:03.890> drive<00:05:03.980> you're

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
state disk as you main hard drive you're

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.490 
state disk as you main hard drive you're
taking<00:05:04.820> away<00:05:04.910> the<00:05:05.180> concerns<00:05:05.570> with<00:05:05.810> vibrations

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
taking away the concerns with vibrations

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.240 
taking away the concerns with vibrations
so<00:05:07.190> this<00:05:07.640> is<00:05:07.790> really<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.440> one<00:05:09.440> of<00:05:09.560> those<00:05:09.680> devices

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
so this is really a one of those devices

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.700 
so this is really a one of those devices
that<00:05:10.580> has<00:05:10.730> the<00:05:10.910> potential<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.450> to<00:05:12.320> really<00:05:12.500> be

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
that has the potential to to really be

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.520 
that has the potential to to really be
used<00:05:12.920> amongst<00:05:13.310> companies<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:13.880> so<00:05:14.030> on<00:05:14.530> the

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
used amongst companies and so on the

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.750 
used amongst companies and so on the
main<00:05:15.740> thing<00:05:15.770> you'll<00:05:16.040> notice<00:05:16.190> that<00:05:16.340> there<00:05:16.610> is<00:05:16.700> a

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
main thing you'll notice that there is a

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.450 
main thing you'll notice that there is a
touchscreen<00:05:17.030> on<00:05:17.330> there<00:05:17.650> but<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.740> favors<00:05:19.280> the

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
touchscreen on there but it favors the

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.030 
touchscreen on there but it favors the
pen<00:05:19.760> they<00:05:20.450> have<00:05:20.600> just<00:05:20.960> developed<00:05:21.260> redeveloped

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
pen they have just developed redeveloped

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.820 
pen they have just developed redeveloped
this<00:05:22.160> device<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:22.820> to<00:05:23.240> have<00:05:23.480> include<00:05:24.170> palm

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
this device to it to have include palm

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.280 
this device to it to have include palm
rejection<00:05:25.100> technology<00:05:26.000> which<00:05:26.570> means<00:05:26.930> that<00:05:27.110> we

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
rejection technology which means that we

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.210 
rejection technology which means that we
can<00:05:27.440> actually<00:05:27.610> use<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:29.660> machine<00:05:30.050> lean<00:05:30.980> on<00:05:31.130> the

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
can actually use the machine lean on the

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.700 
can actually use the machine lean on the
glass<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.820> move<00:05:32.660> the<00:05:32.810> cursor<00:05:33.340> yep<00:05:34.840> so<00:05:35.840> what

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
glass and move the cursor yep so what

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.960 
glass and move the cursor yep so what
you<00:05:36.830> need<00:05:36.980> to<00:05:37.100> do<00:05:37.250> with<00:05:37.400> this<00:05:37.490> device<00:05:37.820> is

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
you need to do with this device is

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.630 
you need to do with this device is
understand<00:05:38.540> that<00:05:38.750> it<00:05:38.900> is<00:05:38.960> rugged<00:05:39.710> it<00:05:40.130> is<00:05:40.310> built

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
understand that it is rugged it is built

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.630 
understand that it is rugged it is built
to<00:05:40.790> last<00:05:40.940> it<00:05:41.750> is<00:05:42.080> ultra<00:05:42.530> mobile<00:05:42.770> you<00:05:43.280> get<00:05:43.400> five

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
to last it is ultra mobile you get five

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.600 
to last it is ultra mobile you get five
hours<00:05:44.030> out<00:05:44.210> of<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.360> solid<00:05:44.720> state<00:05:44.900> disk<00:05:45.200> and<00:05:46.190> I

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
hours out of the solid state disk and I

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.120 
hours out of the solid state disk and I
guess<00:05:46.790> it<00:05:46.910> is<00:05:46.940> showing<00:05:47.360> in<00:05:47.750> showcasing<00:05:48.320> the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
guess it is showing in showcasing the

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.290 
guess it is showing in showcasing the
future<00:05:49.610> of<00:05:49.760> these<00:05:49.970> I<00:05:50.840> guess<00:05:51.500> semi<00:05:52.460> rugged<00:05:52.730> semi

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
future of these I guess semi rugged semi

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.490 
future of these I guess semi rugged semi
army<00:05:53.840> semi<00:05:55.060> durable<00:05:56.060> devices<00:05:56.630> pedal<00:05:57.260> more

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
army semi durable devices pedal more

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.540 
army semi durable devices pedal more
than<00:05:57.740> really<00:05:58.780> anything<00:05:59.780> else<00:06:00.250> with<00:06:01.250> these

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
than really anything else with these

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.460 
than really anything else with these

potentially you're on the road with

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.190 
potentially you're on the road with
something<00:06:04.070> less<00:06:04.970> rugged<00:06:05.210> potentially<00:06:05.960> you've

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
something less rugged potentially you've

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.410 
something less rugged potentially you've
