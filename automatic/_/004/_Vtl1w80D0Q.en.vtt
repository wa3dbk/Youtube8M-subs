00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.890
 There is such a shuttle here already a bit I'm 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:31.609
 Wound well, for example, let's take this 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.609
 rope thicker to be clearly visible 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.820
 what is the shuttle you already 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:48.020
 have seen in the past my videos here he is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.020
 Forms further that we need to take the rope and 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.100
 thrust here for this pin here you can see 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:06.780
 pulled 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:09.869
 and here further turned 180 degrees 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.820
 and again for this pin only with 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:23.060
 the other side pulled 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:23.060
 and this side pulled turned upside down 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.909
 and so 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:46.680
 pulled turned over and so on until the end for 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:51.060

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.600
