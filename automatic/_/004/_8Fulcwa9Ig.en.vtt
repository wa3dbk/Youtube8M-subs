00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:12.450
 reviewed how they are and how are you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:14.879
 Well, that's why they start me like that 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.039
 like nothing else they called me a lot 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.190
 the first attention is about the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.259
 most hostile cities in Mexico for the 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.300
 young people it turns out that a survey 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.589
 made by the inegi and government 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.689
 revealed that the lion is the most 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:33.000
 inhospitable because it has the first place 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.280
 in young people who have used drugs in the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.680
 15 percent and that of boys who have 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.520
 used weapons or have committed acts of 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.320
 vandalism with a typical 21 percent 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.580
 I thought the df was the worst but 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.620
 Well, it does not turn out that it's before 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.810
 example the area known as the lagoon 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.660
 that is there between Coahuila and 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.820
 durango also mecatepec and acapulco 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.320
 there in warrior hey good friends of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.990
 well here it's amazing to surprise me 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.270
 surprising is the repression and the mochery 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.550
 and the bass between the mass on Sundays and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.439
 such that generates more aggression the young 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.270
 very impressive because I have thought 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.609
 that the states with the highest index 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.590
 of danger for young people because they are for 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:13.609
 example the hottest states 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.009
 we arrived in the drug trafficking business 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:17.590
 that if you record what symptoms but if 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.570
 appears but then it turns out that 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.009
 querÃ©taro guanajuato coahuila that up 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.960
 a few years ago it turned out that it was one of 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.090
 the states where it was best lived makes 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.490
 just yesterday you do not but I do just barely 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.709
 yesterday as a young man and with young people 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.319
 worst policy that you can implement is 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.780
 that of prohibition and repression or 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.299
 be you want them to go crazy tell them 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.610
 do not do not do not do not do not do not 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.069
 it is the worst of the strange policies 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.110
 that you have mony the citizenship as 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.819
 I have tried, I know, that is, I have 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.399
 forbidden many things because they are very 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.130
 very very slack legs and wanted 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.590
 as they are is that there is no human power 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.030
 psychic that those who return them 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.500
 to the path of good 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.750
 there you have to say yes to everything 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.399
 and then later on they will pay the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.659
 consequences is associated with everything but 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:09.019
 alone continue to learn is my bed 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.280
 in Spain a woman who saw a patrol 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.140
 parked in a place to 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.970
 disabled 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.130
 and only now everyone is taking 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.530
 a picture the city facebook with the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.020
 legend that said where you get away 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.010
 of the balls and above they do not fine you 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.600
 again as you split where he gave you 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.750
 the hand where you get out of the balls 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.660
 and above you do not like me I love you 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.660
 spelling correction to speech over 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.170
 there is a very good citizen sac with a 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.720
 flowery language is that the agents 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.970
 they denounced this lady under a new 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.890
 law that is called the gag law so you 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.680
 they say gag that gags the gag law 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.420
 Tax to those who post photos or 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.640
 data that they can supposedly put in 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.330
 danger the integrity of the agents or 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.340
 of a mission so 7 went where 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.470
 they follow them as they say more expensive the broth 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.890
 that the meatballs had to pay a 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.340
 fine of 800 euros 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.379
 and in evidence to the patrollers what 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.390
 which they claimed were there 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.950
 that because there had been a reported 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.239
 vandalism in a park and I do not know what 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.939
 park it and why it was more 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.430
 fast what thing what thing because in 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.870
 effect when we say no good the boot 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.090
 they are throwing him again with the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.370
 prohibitions or they are throwing it 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.650
 to citizens in mexico is happening 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.120
 around the world and that can put in 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.209
 danger even the democratic system 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.790
 we have them in the West by 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.640
 secret mission was to go steal the chair 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.920
 of wheels to the poor but there was 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.139
 the drawer for the disabled I think that 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.720
 indeed indeed you can 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.859
 stand in a mission that are 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.990
 doing the cops and you're 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.520
 uploading your photos to facebook but 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.440
 whoever is not as they know it exists in 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.210
 a mission that is not please that 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.040
 Admiral's written children can not 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.560
 believe nothing they would have to prove what 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.280
 falsely a citizen of the first 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.400
 treated as a third-party felon 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.010
 where balls are used good the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.100
 third the dumbest and the most absurd of 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.630
 all was the mixed ska will not have this 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.780
 courage of yes because it is that freed 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.420
 only reveals human brutality a 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.320
 Russian bodybuilder was in a 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.320
 party this 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.530
 bragging about his supposed abdomen 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.050
 of steel and ensuring that it was so hard 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.659
 that no knife would go through 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.099
 he insisted so much that he saw someone yesterday 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:46.400
 nap will try to hurt him with a 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:48.110
 knife to demonstrate its hardness and 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.449
 well finally got someone 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.180
 even more stupid than the one who 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.139
 stab with a kitchen knife 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.060
 well once you had an account 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.740

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.629
 technique you 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.400

 the cemetery or not in the hospital does not 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.500
 it happened either not the same if it was more or 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:18.080
 less stupid stupid that is not 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.639
 possible in addition nor because one comes here 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.430

 so that the little guys that are 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.870
