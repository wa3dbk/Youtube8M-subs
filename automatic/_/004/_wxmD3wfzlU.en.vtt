looked really really nice but I yet for
49<00:06:39.949> cents<00:06:40.310> i<00:06:40.400> think<00:06:40.580> it<00:06:40.639> was<00:06:40.699> 99<00:06:41.180> cents<00:06:41.689> and

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
49 cents i think it was 99 cents and

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.929 
49 cents i think it was 99 cents and
then<00:06:42.349> she<00:06:42.469> got<00:06:42.590> half<00:06:42.830> off<00:06:43.069> so<00:06:43.310> she<00:06:43.370> paid<00:06:43.610> forty

then she got half off so she paid forty
nine<00:06:44.060> cents<00:06:44.419> for<00:06:44.599> which<00:06:44.810> i<00:06:44.900> think<00:06:44.960> is<00:06:45.169> an

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.289 
nine cents for which i think is an
