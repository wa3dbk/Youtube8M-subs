00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
but a passing chord just in general is a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.330 
but a passing chord just in general is a
core<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.599> playing<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.500> series<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.039> cores

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
core that is playing or series of cores

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
that are played between another chord so

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.130 
that are played between another chord so
say<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.200> example<00:00:34.610> you're<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.059> core<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
say for example you're on a core it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.130 
say for example you're on a core it
doesn't<00:00:37.469> matter<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> chord<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.140> say

court<00:00:43.290> doesn't<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.829> matter<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
court doesn't really matter what the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.660 
court doesn't really matter what the
core<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.690> there's<00:00:46.500> always<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.950> next<00:00:47.219> chord

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
core is and there's always a next chord
