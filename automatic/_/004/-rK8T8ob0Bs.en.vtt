00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.980
 but not 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.129
 something something that happened people welcome to 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.170
 a hundred is from the fuck tv you already know how it is 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.940
 this may explode the fuck like they 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.240
 I say if they do not have the fuck they are attacked 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.770
 one hundred percent that of dragon ball z 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.380
 Juanito is with all of you with 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.259
 new information because because if 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.460
 just revealed something epic nap of the 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.039
 night and had to do work tv 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.800
 because I just found out if you're finished 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.530
 to reveal at what temporary stage it is going to 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.690
 locate super dragon ball in the magazine 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.790
 davis although it is the number that comes out already 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.640
 same at this time is beginning to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.060
 be available in different places 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.240
 of the world starting with good japan what 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.370
 that they have reported is that if a data that 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.050
 many did not believe too much possible I 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.930
 neither does it believe anymore, it did not turn out that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.780
 had a sense of everything it was going to be that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.120
 if this super dragon ball story 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.890
 is located at a time that many do not 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.990
 We really believed that it would happen 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.659
 because because very super work is going to 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.310
 be located as soon as they finish beating 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.380
 to maximum what does this mean that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.240
 hook and then perfectly with 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.320
 Dragon Ball Kai as it is being broadcast 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.460
 in Japan 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.520
 that's why it makes all the sense in the world 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.400
 that its broadcast begins as soon as it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.320
 dragon ball kai Sundays at 9 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.550
 tomorrow from japan which means that in 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.229
 sometime on Sunday surely 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.180
 we will have fans 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.360
 of these new ones and another is to say that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.550
 they also explained a little in this 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.650
 magazine by the sign obviously is that 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.250
 in this series two characters that are going to 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.090
 be constantly present are bills 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.740
 and wish this is something that is interesting 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.860
 take into account and think in what way 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.410
 they're going to do it since bits are supposed to 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.140
 it's a character that was sleeping 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.259
 for some time until the stage of 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.180
 the movie where we met this is a 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.470
 hole that good let's understand more or 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.600
 less in what way are they going to human 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.620
 explain very soon when the series already 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.390
 be on tv and on the other hand in what way 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.210
 are going to interact these characters 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.640
 within what is the plot since it is 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.200
 supposes that according to the movie the battle 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.600
 of the gods all the other characters 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.430
 they were not entirely familiar with 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.930
 these two therefore if we now 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.520
 They explain that they knew not 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.600
 would make a lot of sense therefore they are going to 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.080
 have some kind of interference in 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.490
 history without being directly without 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.440
 relate directly by the others 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.570
 characters is something that we will also see 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.640
 four series on TV in what 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.130
 regards to japan almost all the voices 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.020
 originals are going to keep less 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.470
 that for some different reasons like 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.120
 being his death they will not be able to be 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.560
 present in this new series and we know 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.090
 and the synopsis of the first episode 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.750
 in the first episode what we're going to see 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.540
 basically it is the Lord to make a docu 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.060
 that is going to look for work because chichi 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.220
 2000 as you want to call it says that 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.700
 this can no longer continue so go to 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.930
 work a somewhat curious thing but 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.910
 above all we know that in this 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.860
 number of the magazine said is 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.860
 starting the 1st 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.970
 new manga episode that is based 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.430
 obviously in a super bowl so 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.680
 possibly tomorrow we have another video 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.600
 in this channel the fuck set in which 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.180
 be that you are in any of all with 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.130
 all information about it again 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.820
 manga and then obviously from the first 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.680
 part of this new series where we already 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.470
 we will put in context how it starts 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.970
 all this new story good people already 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.110

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.780
 my social networks can follow me 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.030

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.620
 yeah well just out there 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.390
 obviously they will find things that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.910
 do not see in these videos because we're 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.640
 always going up interesting things that 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.230
 as I tell you or information of 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.760
 dragonball many times we have it 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.130
 before and we do not have the possibility of 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.660
 make good video there you will find it 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.640

 I've got to get there 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.850
 What is it 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.090
 to the people who spent 40 6 here is late in 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.009
 the night I have to wash softly how 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.850
 is coming back but you know how it is 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.740
 this 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.889
 Now that I finish writing my first 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.690
 book entitled freak show and how good the 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.570
 TV show I'm already 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.940
 driving a little more quietly if 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.580
 go back to the news of dragon ball to 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.650
 first hour of the first moment or 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.940
 this is possible that it is a scoop in 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.940
 this instant on youtube
