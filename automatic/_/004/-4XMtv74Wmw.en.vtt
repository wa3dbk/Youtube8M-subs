00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
mine really doesn't lose any of the

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.899 
mine really doesn't lose any of the
quality<00:01:34.429> I<00:01:34.609> mean<00:01:35.030> maybe<00:01:35.689> a<00:01:35.780> little<00:01:36.079> bit<00:01:36.320> but<00:01:36.909> it

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
quality I mean maybe a little bit but it

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.429 
quality I mean maybe a little bit but it
really<00:01:38.149> doesn't<00:01:38.359> make<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.539> difference<00:01:38.780> but<00:01:39.350> if

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
really doesn't make a difference but if

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.209 
really doesn't make a difference but if
you<00:01:39.500> have<00:01:39.590> like<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.799> smaller<00:01:41.740> monitor<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:42.950> might

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
you have like a smaller monitor it might

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.270 
you have like a smaller monitor it might
not<00:01:43.429> be<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.789> best<00:01:43.999> decision<00:01:44.149> but<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:44.780> will

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
not be the best decision but this will

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.160 
not be the best decision but this will
let<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:46.399> record<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.939> fraps<00:01:47.270> much<00:01:47.630> easier
