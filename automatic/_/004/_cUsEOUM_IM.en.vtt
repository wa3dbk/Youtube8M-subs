about Star Trek do you think that makes
it<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:32.700> enduring<00:02:33.299> I<00:02:33.420> mean<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.840> know<00:02:33.959> 4050

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
it so enduring I mean you know 4050

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.119 
it so enduring I mean you know 4050
years<00:02:35.159> now<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.470> brand<00:02:37.829> is

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
years now and and and and the brand is

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.910

think<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.519> reason<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.940> because<00:02:42.120> Star<00:02:42.629> Trek

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
think the reason is because Star Trek

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.330 
think the reason is because Star Trek
was<00:02:43.079> about<00:02:43.470> people<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.159> relationships
