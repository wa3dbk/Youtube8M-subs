00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279

as<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> body<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.230> phone<00:00:34.500> itself<00:00:35.040> it's

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
as for the body of the phone itself it's

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.880 
as for the body of the phone itself it's
white<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.809> only<00:00:37.020> color<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.410> comes<00:00:37.680> in

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
white it's the only color it comes in

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
white it's the only color it comes in
it's<00:00:38.430> got<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> silvery<00:00:39.149> accents<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
it's got the silvery accents I think it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.740 
it's got the silvery accents I think it
looks<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:40.800> nice<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:42.030> feels<00:00:42.360> smooth

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
looks really nice and it feels smooth

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.020 
looks really nice and it feels smooth
and<00:00:42.960> silky<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> hand<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.340> perhaps<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.969> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and silky in the hand but perhaps it's a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.970 
and silky in the hand but perhaps it's a
little<00:00:45.300> too<00:00:45.539> silky<00:00:45.960> because<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.379> also<00:00:46.620> find

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
little too silky because I also find

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.700 
little too silky because I also find
that<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.309> rather<00:00:47.520> slippery<00:00:48.260> definitely<00:00:49.260> like

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
that is rather slippery definitely like

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
that is rather slippery definitely like
the<00:00:49.739> way<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> buttons<00:00:50.730> are<00:00:50.969> styled<00:00:51.750> on

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the way that the buttons are styled on

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.369 
the way that the buttons are styled on
here<00:00:52.199> though<00:00:52.410> you've<00:00:52.949> got<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.430> hardware<00:00:54.379> photo

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
here though you've got a hardware photo

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
here though you've got a hardware photo
button<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.949> well<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.239> press<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.809> hold

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
button as well so you can press and hold

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.260

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
to wake up the camera and also to take

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.869 
to wake up the camera and also to take
pictures<00:01:00.890> there's<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.190> front-facing<00:01:02.640> vga

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
pictures there's a front-facing vga

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.260 
pictures there's a front-facing vga
camera<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.530> rear<00:01:04.739> facing<00:01:04.769> 5<00:01:05.489> megapixel

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
camera and a rear facing 5 megapixel

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.140 
camera and a rear facing 5 megapixel
camera<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.500> flash<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.490> photo<00:01:08.729> taking

camera with a flash the photo taking

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
camera with a flash the photo taking
ability<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:10.170> nice<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.740> although

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
ability is pretty nice on this although

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.480 
ability is pretty nice on this although
my<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.520> gripe<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.200> photos<00:01:13.200> capture<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
my one gripe is that photos capture at a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.570 
my one gripe is that photos capture at a
medium<00:01:15.210> resolution<00:01:15.780> by<00:01:16.380> default<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> can

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
medium resolution by default so you can

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
medium resolution by default so you can
actually<00:01:17.909> make<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.240> much<00:01:18.390> sharper<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
actually make it much sharper if you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
actually make it much sharper if you
want<00:01:19.560> there's<00:01:20.520> also<00:01:20.759> support<00:01:21.540> for<00:01:22.189> 720p<00:01:23.189> HD

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
want there's also support for 720p HD

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.480 
want there's also support for 720p HD
video<00:01:24.330> capture<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.259> rear<00:01:25.560> facing<00:01:25.860> camera

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
video capture on the rear facing camera

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.219 
video capture on the rear facing camera
there<00:01:27.360> aren't<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.570> whole<00:01:27.720> lot<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.990> other

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
there aren't a whole lot of other

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.130 
there aren't a whole lot of other
surprises<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.369> phone<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.930> is

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
surprises with this phone because it is

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.200 
surprises with this phone because it is
a<00:01:31.530> Windows<00:01:31.890> Phone<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.369> Microsoft<00:01:32.820> pretty

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
a Windows Phone and Microsoft pretty

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.020 
a Windows Phone and Microsoft pretty
much<00:01:33.619> curtails<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.860> lot<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.220> experimentation

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
much curtails a lot of experimentation

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.270 
much curtails a lot of experimentation
with<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> exception<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.110> some<00:01:37.350> apps<00:01:37.619> from

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
with the exception of some apps from

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.700 
with the exception of some apps from
Samsung<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.000> from<00:01:39.180> 80<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> very

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
Samsung and from 80 so this is very

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.460 
Samsung and from 80 so this is very
standard<00:01:41.310> experience<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.570> good<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:42.960> but

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
standard experience it's a good one but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.550 
standard experience it's a good one but
one<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> things<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.430> makes<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.909> phone

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
one of the things that makes the phone

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.319 
one of the things that makes the phone
desirable<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.979> fact<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.610> got<00:01:47.729> 4g

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
desirable is the fact that it's got 4g

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.950 
desirable is the fact that it's got 4g
LTE<00:01:48.990> onboard<00:01:49.860> another<00:01:50.640> desirable<00:01:51.299> trait<00:01:51.750> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
LTE onboard another desirable trait is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.999 
LTE onboard another desirable trait is
the<00:01:52.320> price<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.950> costs<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.520> 49<00:01:54.270> 99<00:01:54.990> which<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the price it costs just 49 99 which is a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.340 
the price it costs just 49 99 which is a
budget<00:01:56.219> price<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.939> very<00:01:57.390> good<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> specs

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
budget price and very good for the specs

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.139
