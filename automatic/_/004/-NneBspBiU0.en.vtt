00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
a dope it's not recommended because you

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.740 
a dope it's not recommended because you
will<00:01:32.310> lose<00:01:32.340> all<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> Metro<00:01:33.060> interface<00:01:33.270> but

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
will lose all the Metro interface but

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.260 
will lose all the Metro interface but
there<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.590> works<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.100> whatever<00:01:35.790> I've<00:01:35.939> seen<00:01:36.150> is

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
there it works and whatever I've seen is

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.560 
there it works and whatever I've seen is
even<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.460> enable<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.579> disable<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.150> sometimes

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
even if I enable or disable it sometimes

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.870 
even if I enable or disable it sometimes
it<00:01:39.750> needs<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.079> restart<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.250> use<00:01:41.400> disable

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it needs a restart so if you use disable

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.270 
it needs a restart so if you use disable
all<00:01:42.030> works<00:01:42.570> nicely<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.619> let's<00:01:43.799> take<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.040> look<00:01:44.189> at
