of<00:04:45.110> early<00:04:45.380> stage<00:04:45.590> I<00:04:45.740> was<00:04:45.920> but<00:04:46.610> it's<00:04:47.060> made<00:04:47.210> me

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
of early stage I was but it's made me

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.910 
of early stage I was but it's made me
think<00:04:47.660> perhaps<00:04:48.170> it's<00:04:48.350> not<00:04:48.380> about<00:04:48.620> finding

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
think perhaps it's not about finding

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.100 
think perhaps it's not about finding
something<00:04:49.250> it's<00:04:49.970> symbolic<00:04:50.510> perhaps<00:04:50.780> it's<00:04:50.990> all

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
something it's symbolic perhaps it's all

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.410 
something it's symbolic perhaps it's all
about<00:04:51.460> something<00:04:52.460> within<00:04:52.640> the<00:04:52.940> journey<00:04:53.180> with

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
about something within the journey with

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730
