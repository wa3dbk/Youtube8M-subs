you're<00:04:53.540> going<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:53.900> have<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.169> run<00:04:54.380> this

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
you're going to have to run this

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.350 
you're going to have to run this
consistently<00:04:55.130> you're<00:04:55.790> going<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.030> have<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.240> run

with a lot and you're going to have to
struggle<00:04:58.850> with<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.270> at<00:04:59.390> first<00:04:59.419> because<00:04:59.780> it's

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
struggle with it at first because it's

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.240 
struggle with it at first because it's
one<00:05:00.320> of<00:05:00.410> those<00:05:00.470> things<00:05:00.530> that's<00:05:00.770> pretty<00:05:01.070> tough

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
one of those things that's pretty tough

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.800 
one of those things that's pretty tough
to<00:05:01.400> get<00:05:01.490> good<00:05:01.669> at<00:05:01.729> it's<00:05:02.330> not<00:05:02.510> going<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.720> be

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
to get good at it's not going to be

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.760 
to get good at it's not going to be
something<00:05:02.990> you're<00:05:03.080> going<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:03.320> be<00:05:03.470> able<00:05:03.500> to

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
something you're going to be able to

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.370 
something you're going to be able to
implement<00:05:04.280> immediately<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:05.419> have<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:06.260> work

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
implement immediately and have it work

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.740 
implement immediately and have it work
now<00:05:07.250> that's<00:05:07.640> not<00:05:07.729> to<00:05:07.790> say<00:05:08.000> this<00:05:08.180> this<00:05:08.510> setup

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
now that's not to say this this setup

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.090 
now that's not to say this this setup
doesn't<00:05:09.020> have<00:05:09.229> any<00:05:09.380> counters<00:05:09.740> because<00:05:10.010> the

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
doesn't have any counters because the

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.400 
doesn't have any counters because the
definitely<00:05:10.729> does<00:05:10.970> okay<00:05:11.810> now<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.229> way<00:05:12.380> you

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
definitely does okay now the way you

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.930 
definitely does okay now the way you
want<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.680> counter<00:05:12.979> this<00:05:13.130> is<00:05:13.370> two<00:05:13.640> different

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
want to counter this is two different

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.940 
want to counter this is two different
ways<00:05:14.060> you<00:05:14.360> have<00:05:14.990> a<00:05:15.020> counter<00:05:15.440> it<00:05:15.530> by<00:05:15.560> simply

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
ways you have a counter it by simply

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.280 
ways you have a counter it by simply
going<00:05:16.190> up<00:05:16.430> way<00:05:16.610> going<00:05:17.300> up<00:05:17.479> a<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:17.870> taking<00:05:18.169> it

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
going up way going up a and taking it

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.800 
going up way going up a and taking it
with<00:05:18.470> minimal<00:05:18.919> smokes<00:05:19.220> one<00:05:20.000> CT<00:05:20.270> spawn<00:05:20.479> smoke

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
with minimal smokes one CT spawn smoke

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.620 
with minimal smokes one CT spawn smoke
and<00:05:21.020> then<00:05:21.560> one<00:05:21.800> smoke<00:05:22.130> connector<00:05:22.760> and<00:05:22.910> then

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
and then one smoke connector and then

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.480 
catwalk
really<00:05:57.560> late<00:05:57.740> in<00:05:57.950> the<00:05:58.040> round<00:05:58.160> when<00:05:58.400> they're

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
really late in the round when they're

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.540 
really late in the round when they're
trying<00:05:58.670> to<00:05:58.730> just<00:05:59.450> killing<00:05:59.720> me<00:06:00.130> so<00:06:01.130> those<00:06:01.430> are

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
trying to just killing me so those are

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.730 
trying to just killing me so those are
the<00:06:01.580> two<00:06:01.640> ways<00:06:01.790> to<00:06:01.940> stop<00:06:02.360> this<00:06:02.630> setup<00:06:02.900> but<00:06:03.590> it's

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
the two ways to stop this setup but it's

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.620 
the two ways to stop this setup but it's
extremely<00:06:04.130> difficult<00:06:04.460> to<00:06:04.910> stop<00:06:05.150> this<00:06:05.360> setup

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
extremely difficult to stop this setup

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.780 
extremely difficult to stop this setup
and<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:05.990> reason<00:06:06.320> being<00:06:06.350> is<00:06:06.740> that<00:06:06.770> you<00:06:07.490> don't

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
and the reason being is that you don't

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.060 
and the reason being is that you don't
know<00:06:07.970> they're<00:06:08.150> playing<00:06:08.360> a<00:06:08.480> retake<00:06:08.780> a<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.920> know

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
a lot of time you might not think
