00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello, I'm bringing you the tutorial today 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:16.849
 of the song of weaving 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.849
 it's pretty good, by the way 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.640
 Today I bring you what is the intro 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.009
 I mostly can sometimes upload the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.010
 intro of some songs and this one 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:32.240
 here it is very easy 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.240
 the song is this 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.710
 good and this is what the book would be the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.710
 part of the guitar 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.680
 if you have a keyboard you can not touch the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.840
 piano on removing how do you know how it works 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.860
 the keyboard with the sound of the guitar 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.860
 what do i do 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.790
 let's start with this for the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.790
 he's going to do it slowly 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.550
 to see I'm sorry 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.820
 silly 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.189
 but everything that looks like this 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.590
 jazz is the song in the beginning a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.570
 bit weird but you can not catch it 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.570
 very easy but I repeat 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.910
 Y 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.460
 and this is the first part the second 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.460
 they are three is worth the second one is like this 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.769
 The only thing that changes is that in the end 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.769
 squeeze on touching it and not just if 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.769
 I repeat 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.019
 one 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.890
 and these two parts quickly because it would be like that 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:59.030
 and now the third part does not 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.030
 it's the whole principle 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.500
 and the first 789 keys are equal ' 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.810
 OK 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.690
 and then what changes is the end d 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.680
 of these parts and the last part that is 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.680
 the third would be like this 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.630
 I repeat it 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.210
 to 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.980
 and now the three parts together would be like that 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.980
 you 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.840
 notice that here I was wrong is in the 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.840
 last part here 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.289
 you have to continue with this pretend 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.289
 press the next 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.500
 it's the quick part for that a little bit 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.320
 our two to go 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.320
 this what has the good song that 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.129
 we have seen it is very easy surely that 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.379
 time will be the first 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.379
 and now I repeat it the last time 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.329
 one 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.020
 and it repeats 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.020
 i 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.219
 to me 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.599
 Y 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.740
 as a team that a little bit but 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:24.989
 and this is the good song I hope that you 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:28.319
 have liked this video tutorial and a 

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:32.329
 thing now I'm going to play the song with the 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.329
 true song is worth 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.080
 this is another song to start 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.810
 and now it's going to sound the same 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.390
 hope that with your attention 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.870
 no way 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.770
 Yes now 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.569
