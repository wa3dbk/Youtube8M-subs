00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.490
 hello i am lennart do you really want 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.440
 only know your heart rate in combination 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.570
 with time then the following models 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.639
 the perfect trainers coaches for you 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.539
 take a look with me at the sigma pc 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.539
 team point 11 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.770
 yes we have it in the color versions 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.970
 blue purple and the color version that 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.620
 we also have but still here 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.850
 missing is gray 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.119
 it all comes with one 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.259
 battery a chest strap that is this with 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.230
 the heart rate sensor 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.699
 so an elastic adjustable strap and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.699
 of course with the manual 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.179
 the PC 10 points 11 has an adjustable 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.710
 heart rate zone and calorie counter 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.210
 clock function stop sign and he is 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.679
 waterproof up to 30 meters 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.659
 That means you can swim but then 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.339
 he only does the heart rate measurement 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.350
 good if you get started with the device 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.839
 it is the first thing to do 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.850
 Open the settings menu to make the 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.920
 button at the bottom right to get press 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.989
 first the language or the language choice 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.659
 unfortunately there is no Dutch on it 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.490
 so you will select english 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.700
 least that is obvious to me and 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.740
 the other options are the date 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.960
 clock and what is important for calculation 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.490
 of your maximum heart rate are those jane 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.009
 do your gender well that's in this case 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.810
 so a man that is mail indeed 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.570
 so I choose that 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.320
 setting and you have to do the same 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.539
 decorated with your date of birth 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.670
 he then calculates a maximum heart rate 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.130
 and that maximum heart rate is then used up 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.130
 100% set and the zones there 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.079
 perform a certain percentage 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.969
 of that maximum heart rate and thereby 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.909
 personne becomes a lower limit and one 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:46.299
 upper limit determines that maximum heart rate 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.570
 and therefore stands at 190 in this case 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.090
 we will be fine for a while 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.679
 just to the next and there 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.130
 therefore follow certain training zones 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.109
 well that is a shame for the individual 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.499
 that is with a lower limit I have this 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:06.069
 set to 140 and that cube to the 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:09.460
 adjust to 145 move and higher 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.960
 limit is an upper limit of 165 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.220
 they do quite intensive training that will what 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.300
 intensive are there in average 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.120
 fitness training 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.330
 but fine 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.099
 garden settings and in addition to that individual 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.440
 So you also won the bike 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.879
 for condition and the furry sin and this 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.760
 is with a knife with a bit lower 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.790
 integrity but with a longer duration 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.500
 a moment to the next this is it 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.030
 total time in which you put it for example 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.110
 want to do a training 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.739
 you select it now stands for 22 minutes and 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.769
 a bit that's fine 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.799
 yes we continue to the next level 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.840
 also indicate the cake calories times 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.370
 the contrast to the let them give 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.930
 mean the test show animal 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.209
 plotted that I like better if not 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.280
 Time beeps which makes particular 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.280
 along those are important because that 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.609
 give a certain series typical as 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.569
 you come within a certain zone or the 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.980
 steps outside 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.760
 so that you do not constantly have to be lazy 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.209
 to see if you need training level 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.170
 adjust so I leave myself on 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.000
 and then you can reach again 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.709
 for a long time it really becomes all that 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.530
 have entered the printing we have 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.359
 again the button in the lower right then come 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.130
 we in your main screen it is the display 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.810
 who sees when you are training 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.609
 Henk heart rate sensor well done 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.310
 you see here at the top of the screen 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.340
 my heart rate here is the top the studs 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.049
 and that has my average heart rate 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.980
 when I want to start the training I press 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.359
 click the button at the top right like this then 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.129
 he starts to laugh you see that he is now 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.290
 even an average calculated 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:47.359
 so it will be right at the start 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.359
 walk when you stop training 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:53.120
 then press start or stop again 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:56.840
 but suppose you are still training now 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.269
 and you want to see if you like your training 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.650
 need to step up you should look at 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.299
 this arrow that indicate here that I 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.340
 must go up with my heartbeat or me 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.650
 must swim harder and a or harder 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.329
 whatever you want and then who will typically 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.280
 grabbed the moment I entered the zone 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.280
 I want to stop busy here so too 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.769
 and then you stand still I want to reset one 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.949
 then I get him pressed a few 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.850
 seconds and then returns 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.590
 if you know exactly what you are 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.180
 training goal is, for example, losing weight 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.410
 or improve your condition 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.600
 and you can also look in which 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.880
 heart rate zone you need to train for that 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.889
 the pc team point 11 which gives you exactly 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.389
 how long he has been in that specific 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.400
 are training and how much 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.389
 percent for your total training goal 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.130
 has been reached 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.169
 So from now on you want to go out and with 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.479
 the sigma pc team point 11 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.560
 then order it via sporthorlogecenter.nl 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.850
 or b 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.570
 thank you for looking and happy to see you 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.570
 the following review
