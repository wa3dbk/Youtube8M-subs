00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello how are you I hope you are super 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.940
 super good today I'm about 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.859
 to have a spa session at home and 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.019
 I want to share with you the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.840
 masks that I'm going to use and that's 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.820
 many times between school work and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.920
 other activities we forget for 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.560
 full of taking care of ourselves and feeling 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.420
 even if it's a couple of hours a week and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 that's super bad because we have to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.990
 dedicate time to de-stress 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.900
 our skin and our hair that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.580
 they always talk a lot about us like that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.679
 that today I bring you three recipes 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.660
 super simple and the first is a 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.030
 exfoliating for face the second one 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.250
 mask for your face and the third one 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.559
 mask for your hair all 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.110
 absolutely for all skin types and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.660
 hair so you have no excuse to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.090
 this weekend do not spoil yourself if you 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.649
 you want to know how a spa day is made 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.960
 at home as well as the one that I'm going to have 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.449
 stay in this video our first 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.030
 recipe will be a facial scrub and this 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.039
 It's very good because it cleans deep 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.840
 and apart it will give us a very bright 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.030
 healthy ingredients face 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.799
 will be in equal parts so what 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.909
 first that we will occupy will be two 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.340
 tablespoons of baking soda 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.740
 we will also occupy two tablespoons of 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.840
 extra virgin coconut oil let's remember 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.670
 that it tends to be solid in the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.259
 been cold so we have to 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.259
 melt it before adding it 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.360
 all we have to do is 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.520
 mix the two ingredients very well and 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.590
 then put this pill in our 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.470
 face giving a little massage for 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.600
 approximately two minutes after 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.140
 this we have to wash our face with 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.140
 warm water 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.470
 Y 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.500
 i 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.210
 Another of my favorite recipes is this 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.220
 mask for hair because it's for 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.590
 any type of hair that you have 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.200
 and it will give you intense hydration 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.979
 apart a super nice brightness we will occupy 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.350
 only half a banana half avocado and 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.300
 two tablespoons of extra coconut oil 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.569
 virgin that can also be oil 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.700
 olive 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.739
 all we have to do is carry 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.989
 all the ingredients to the processor 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.120
 food or your blender and look for a 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.010
 homogenous mix the application will 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.379
 recommend that it be with wet hair 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.209
 and let's act for 30 minutes to 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.209
 finish washing with cold water 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.800
 This facial mask is super good 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.720
 because it will give us a deep cleaning and 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.700
 so intense hydration 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.680
 we will occupy will be a quarter cup 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.060
 oat flakes a banana and a 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.860
 spoonful of honey bee 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.780
 procedure is very simple we are going to 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.280
 put the ingredients together and mix very 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.200
 well I did it in the processor 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.510
 food but you can do it even 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.370
 with a fork or spoon after 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.800
 this we are going to apply on the face and 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.690
 let's act for approximately 15 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.690
 minutes and remove with warm water 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.500
 which one 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.020
 remember that this is for all types of 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.720
 skin so I hope you enjoy it very much 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.880
