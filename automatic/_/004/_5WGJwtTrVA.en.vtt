00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.770
 for all and more to cover we are in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.270
 minecraft good I will teach in how 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.220
 Remove the peppers from here as such 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.020
 in how they remove the chili pepper how to make 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.580
 your computer 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.430
 bring to minecraft all the fps that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.250
 your computer can get better me 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.650
 explain whether your computer now 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.430
 same low for 20 fps but your 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:43.240
 computer runs 70 voucher is an example 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.220
 in these steps it serves to make your 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.130
 computer go as fluid as you can 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:53.500
 go your computer first we have to 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.160
 catch and go to one or three steps what 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.050
 they will do it 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.230
 one of the first pass vouchers 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.640
 We are not going to your peace and good position 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.740
 tupac for example this is an example this 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.780
 your peace because maybe those you do not 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.200
 it's going to be worth it because it has a lot 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.940
 detail or 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.610
 or whatever a row glass but 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.520
 seek to leave a pack in the description 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.350
 ok where you go 0 zero value the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.540
 because all shadows are removed 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.300
 and you do not have to load anymore good map goes 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.720
 to zero legacy ssd your peace once done 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.250
 that also you go to a view liza 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.310
 lost and fine I think I'll leave it below 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.920
 I was also going to that base tim and you put it 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.320
 in graphic fast render 0 fps limited to 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.510
 well this this after we go but what 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.090
 you put limited 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.980
 this is to change a nonsense not 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.550
 whatever we want because it gives less 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.950
 cval is this what a computer has 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.240
 more wrong and I recommend it to have this way 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.799
 ok but 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.640
 that does not matter too linear zero 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:14.210
 numbers nothing this way 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.470
 is all this on 2 and then chung on 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:21.680
 multicolored which is what gives less 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.670
 time as in multicolored such fps 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.200
 the cbs is more stable the animations 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:35.030
 all the details and everything takes to the minimum 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.400
 not as well as if it were out outside 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.880
 this in default 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.130
 This in 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.600
 in fast 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.720
 and then this does not touch anything this either 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.430
 touch nothing and it's already on structure 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.940
 because it's just wants to go with other 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.900
 textures 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.010
 and so our fps will go all the fluids 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:03.650
 that they always see me for example 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.530
 like me for example right now see 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.209
 20 200 and 400 peak and something but now 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.629
 When I do one thing, it's going to go 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.170
 what is the next thing we left the 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.680
 game worth 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.060
 and we go to the desk 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.040
 well once we are in the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.450
 desktop we give the start button and 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.550
 we give to team 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.340
 we click right and go to properties 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.920
 and then we go to our ram memory 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.260
 that we have installed is worth and as I 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.350
 you see here I have installed 12 and then 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.770
 let's take it and go to the che 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.290
 minecraft we give you to disperse the ok and 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.530
 here we have a section that puts j 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.970
 vm argument you see that I have or 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.680
 be this what gives of ram albain craft 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.910
 default so to speak 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.880
 we take and click we put on 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.720
 example puts 6 and you remove it again 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.970
 Valley remains that there are profiles and 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.670
 are already started in minecraft and already 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.530
 you will have the minecraft with all of you counted 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.530
 the ram that you have dedicated 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.440
 Well, I'm back here 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.960
 in my minecraft I had to restart 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.950
 and as I do not have how I do not have internet 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.980
 right now as you see then well 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.650
 steve good since you'll see that there have been 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.080
 a great improvement is worth as you see above 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.370
 the right ok put use memory is the 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.010
 memory you are using in memory 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.740
 that we have given him worth and for 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.990
 that reason goes to us as they are more 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.180
 designated are not going to be left to us 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.580
 as already and the fps it shows 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.040
 put as I put it already normal and you see 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.060
 what can I put in touch whatever I want 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.740
 I go and you also see 200 gps 400 because 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.690
 we have thus nothing memory as I go to 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.400
 put the ends then I get a 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.810
 little memory but still the same 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.810
 of fluid is worth for this reason 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.460
 for what we have done before it's worth it 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.280
 we have given him 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.050
 also assigned more ram and good memory 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.819
 with those three basic tricks, it's worth 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.390
 They are using for the face because I am a 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.490
 steve that are 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.250
 count a test or so that it does not produce 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.130
 the one remove all the effects to 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.870
 minecraft and put it in ram memory more 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.500
 assigned and your computer is 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.470
 reading will not reduce the fps drama 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.800
 as much as you can and nothing else before 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.540
 that you can tell me what you have 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.669
 some videos for the description and os 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:46.959
 I invite you to subscribe 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:49.379
 in my tv and other videos 

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.379
 goodbye
