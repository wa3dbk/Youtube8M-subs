00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
things I want to show you what I would

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.860 
things I want to show you what I would
recommend<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.859> do<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.940> start<00:00:09.269> off<00:00:09.510> by

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
recommend you do is to start off by

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.930 
recommend you do is to start off by
going<00:00:10.230> through<00:00:10.440> what's<00:00:10.950> called<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.250> 21<00:00:11.730> k

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
going through what's called the 21 k

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.390 
going through what's called the 21 k
system<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.290> reason<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.650> like<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:14.190> is

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
system and the reason I like this is

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.279 
system and the reason I like this is
because<00:00:15.020> Anthony<00:00:16.020> has<00:00:16.340> basically<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:18.289> system

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
because Anthony has basically a a system

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.769 
because Anthony has basically a a system
for<00:00:19.740> creating<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.430> product<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.090> lining<00:00:21.600> up

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
for creating a product and lining up

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.109 
for creating a product and lining up
people<00:00:22.260> who<00:00:22.500> will<00:00:22.680> promote<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.490> product<00:00:24.000> in

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
people who will promote that product in

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.470 
people who will promote that product in
a<00:00:24.779> very<00:00:25.380> what<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.859> would<00:00:25.920> call<00:00:26.099> shortcut<00:00:26.880> way<00:00:27.210> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
a very what I would call shortcut way is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.419 
a very what I would call shortcut way is
pretty<00:00:27.869> slick<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.590> way<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.830> he<00:00:28.920> gets<00:00:29.160> around

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
pretty slick the way that he gets around

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.160 
pretty slick the way that he gets around
most<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.150> difficult<00:00:30.720> work<00:00:30.869> that's

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
most of the difficult work that's

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.229 
most of the difficult work that's
involved<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.099> product<00:00:32.489> creation<00:00:32.759> process

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
involved in the product creation process

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.389 
involved in the product creation process
now<00:00:33.660> creating<00:00:34.140> your<00:00:34.200> own<00:00:34.290> product<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.890> hard

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
now creating your own product is hard

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.819 
now creating your own product is hard
especially<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.719> way<00:00:36.809> most<00:00:37.050> people<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.680> it

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
especially the way most people do it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.030 
especially the way most people do it
this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.460> kind<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.940> shortcut<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
this is kind of a shortcut way to have a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
this is kind of a shortcut way to have a
product<00:00:41.430> lined<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.050> people

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
product lined up and to have people

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.090 
product lined up and to have people
ready<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.739> promote<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.879> order<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.890> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
ready to promote in order to to get that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.830 
ready to promote in order to to get that
off<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.850> ground<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.239> making<00:00:48.539> money<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.809> fast

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
off the ground in making money as fast

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.410 
off the ground in making money as fast
as<00:00:49.289> possible<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.149> this

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
as possible you can see here and this

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.639 
as possible you can see here and this
might<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.719> small<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.620> but

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
might be small for you to see but

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.510 
might be small for you to see but
there's<00:00:53.250> actually<00:00:54.770> sample<00:00:55.770> emails<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.399> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
there's actually sample emails that you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
there's actually sample emails that you
can<00:00:56.699> use<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.570> swype<00:00:58.050> copy<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.739> actually

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
can use like swype copy to actually

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.680 
can use like swype copy to actually
promote<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.609> just<00:01:00.149> clicked<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:00.539> it's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
promote it I just clicked it now it's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.510 
promote it I just clicked it now it's
downloading<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> computer<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> can

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
downloading on a computer but you can

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.340 
downloading on a computer but you can
actually<00:01:02.760> download<00:01:02.910> those<00:01:03.359> emails<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.989> use

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
actually download those emails and use

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.670 
actually download those emails and use
those<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.189> run<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.700> exact<00:01:06.240> system<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.140> it's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
those to run this exact system so it's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440 
those to run this exact system so it's
about<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.010> foolproof<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
about as foolproof as you can get I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.649 
about as foolproof as you can get I
would<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.200> through<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.799> first<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.150> second

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
would go through this first the second

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
would go through this first the second
thing<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.930> would<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.159> through<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
thing I would do is to go through the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.050 
thing I would do is to go through the
million-dollar<00:01:15.420> launch<00:01:16.290> secrets<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.850> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
million-dollar launch secrets this is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
million-dollar launch secrets this is
going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> take<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.810> my<00:01:19.500> opinion<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.250> the
