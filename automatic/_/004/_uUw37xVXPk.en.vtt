I'm<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.830> do<00:02:20.070> is<00:02:20.310> I'm<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.640> heat<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
I'm going to do is I'm going to heat the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.110 
I'm going to do is I'm going to heat the
syrup<00:02:21.630> I'm<00:02:22.020> using<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.680> whisk<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.160> stir<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.790> just

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
syrup I'm using a whisk to stir it just

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.750 
syrup I'm using a whisk to stir it just
until<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> sugar<00:02:24.570> crystals<00:02:25.020> dissolve<00:02:25.760> at

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
until the sugar crystals dissolve at

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.700 
until the sugar crystals dissolve at
this<00:02:26.970> stage<00:02:27.300> before<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.960> comes<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.500> boil

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
this stage before it comes to the boil

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.770 
this stage before it comes to the boil
all<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.550> sugar<00:02:29.760> crystals<00:02:30.240> need<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.660> be

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
all the sugar crystals need to be

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.410 
all the sugar crystals need to be
dissolved<00:02:31.280> otherwise<00:02:32.280> once<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.970> syrup<00:02:33.180> is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
dissolved otherwise once the syrup is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.780 
dissolved otherwise once the syrup is
boiling<00:02:33.450> if<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:34.680> are<00:02:34.830> any<00:02:35.100> crystals<00:02:35.520> left

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
boiling if there are any crystals left

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.670 
boiling if there are any crystals left
then<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.330> might<00:02:36.510> start<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.930> crystallize<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
then it might start to crystallize the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.880 
then it might start to crystallize the
syrup<00:02:41.360> once<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.540> comes<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.110> boil<00:02:43.320> there's

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
syrup once it comes to the boil there's

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.740 
syrup once it comes to the boil there's
always<00:02:44.070> some<00:02:44.370> sugar<00:02:44.610> crystals<00:02:45.150> left<00:02:45.420> on<00:02:45.630> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
always some sugar crystals left on the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.980 
always some sugar crystals left on the
side<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.260> pan<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.060> I'm<00:02:48.060> going<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.420> use<00:02:48.630> a

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
side of the pan so I'm going to use a

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.300 
side of the pan so I'm going to use a
wet<00:02:49.320> brush<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:50.700> brush<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.150> crystals<00:02:51.630> then

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
wet brush to brush the crystals then

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.220 
wet brush to brush the crystals then
once<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.580> boiling<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:54.450> important<00:02:54.990> not<00:02:55.170> to

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
once it's boiling it's important not to

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.340 
once it's boiling it's important not to
stir<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.880> syrup<00:02:57.240> needs<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.930> boiled

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
stir it and the syrup needs to be boiled

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.949 
stir it and the syrup needs to be boiled
on<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> rapid<00:02:59.100> speed<00:02:59.280> because<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.180> faster<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
on a rapid speed because the faster it

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.480 
on a rapid speed because the faster it
comes<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.500> right<00:03:01.650> temperature<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
comes to the right temperature the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.820 
comes to the right temperature the
whiter<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.209> will<00:03:03.330> be<00:03:03.540> if<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.200> only<00:03:04.350> have<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.590> on

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
whiter it will be if you only have it on

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.800 
whiter it will be if you only have it on
a<00:03:04.890> low<00:03:05.220> heat<00:03:05.250> then<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.180> syrup<00:03:06.390> will<00:03:06.600> turn

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
a low heat then the syrup will turn

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:26.899 
a low heat then the syrup will turn
quite<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.140> yellow<00:03:07.500> in<00:03:07.650> color

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.259 

so<00:03:27.909> well<00:03:28.480> that's<00:03:28.659> starting<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.349> boil<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:30.269> need

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
so well that's starting to boil I need

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:41.960 
so well that's starting to boil I need
to<00:03:31.420> get<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.719> egg<00:03:31.840> whites<00:03:32.109> whisking

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.020 

once<00:03:42.510> my<00:03:43.050> success<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:44.190> need<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.520> gradually

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
once my success you need to gradually

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:54.580 
once my success you need to gradually
whisk<00:03:45.240> in<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.510> sugar

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.380 

now<00:03:55.590> I'm<00:03:55.710> going<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.040> leave<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.850> watch

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
now I'm going to leave that and watch

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.390 
now I'm going to leave that and watch
the<00:03:57.600> sugar<00:03:57.780> syrup<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.710> make<00:03:58.740> sure<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.280> it

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
the sugar syrup to make sure that it

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:10.800 
the sugar syrup to make sure that it
doesn't<00:03:59.610> overheat<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.510> caramelize

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.440 

now<00:04:11.810> it's<00:04:12.020> reached<00:04:12.400> 121<00:04:13.400> I'm<00:04:13.670> going<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.090> plunge

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
now it's reached 121 I'm going to plunge

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.129 
now it's reached 121 I'm going to plunge
the<00:04:14.930> pan<00:04:15.170> in<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:16.280> water<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:17.000> that<00:04:17.600> stops<00:04:18.049> the

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
the pan in the water and that stops the

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.800 
the pan in the water and that stops the
syrup<00:04:18.530> from<00:04:18.680> getting<00:04:19.010> any<00:04:19.130> hotter<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.850> then

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
syrup from getting any hotter and then

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.840 
syrup from getting any hotter and then
I'm<00:04:21.079> going<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.350> wipe<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.799> base<00:04:21.980> of<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.310> pan<00:04:22.550> so

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
I'm going to wipe the base of the pan so

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.180 
I'm going to wipe the base of the pan so
that<00:04:23.330> no<00:04:23.990> water<00:04:24.230> will<00:04:24.470> drip<00:04:24.650> into<00:04:24.860> my<00:04:25.100> syrup

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
that no water will drip into my syrup

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.460 
that no water will drip into my syrup
with<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.220> mixer<00:04:28.669> back<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:29.090> forth<00:04:29.360> speed<00:04:29.720> the

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
with the mixer back and forth speed the

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.450 
with the mixer back and forth speed the
syrup<00:04:30.860> gets<00:04:30.889> forward<00:04:31.639> very<00:04:31.910> slowly

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
syrup gets forward very slowly

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:42.540 
syrup gets forward very slowly
into<00:04:33.699> the<00:04:33.819> pan

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.010 

you<00:04:42.970> need<00:04:43.120> continued

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
you need continued

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.380 
you need continued
King<00:04:44.350> Day<00:04:44.560> and<00:04:44.890> for<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.430> bold<00:04:45.640> field<00:04:45.970> just

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
King Day and for the bold field just

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.430 
King Day and for the bold field just
slightly<00:04:46.690> warm

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
slightly warm

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.060 
slightly warm
at<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.800> moment<00:04:47.980> it's<00:04:48.370> feeling<00:04:48.760> very<00:04:48.970> off

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
at the moment it's feeling very off

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.560 
at the moment it's feeling very off
sometimes<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.310> can<00:04:51.520> take<00:04:51.550> about<00:04:51.880> five<00:04:52.300> to

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
sometimes it can take about five to

00:04:52.570 --> 00:05:13.750 
sometimes it can take about five to
seven<00:04:52.750> minutes<00:04:52.930> until<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.740> cools<00:04:53.980> down<00:04:54.100> enough

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.700 

now<00:05:14.760> that<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.090> bowl<00:05:15.270> is<00:05:15.300> feeling<00:05:15.840> new<00:05:16.020> form<00:05:16.380> I

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
now that the bowl is feeling new form I

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.310 
now that the bowl is feeling new form I
can<00:05:16.980> start<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.550> add<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.670> butter<00:05:18.060> but<00:05:18.870> first<00:05:19.170> of

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
can start to add the butter but first of

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.990 
can start to add the butter but first of
all<00:05:19.470> and<00:05:19.800> then<00:05:19.920> to<00:05:19.980> add<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.250> few<00:05:20.550> drops<00:05:20.610> of

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
all and then to add a few drops of

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.760 
all and then to add a few drops of
vanilla<00:05:21.060> extract

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.950 

I'm<00:05:27.280> not<00:05:27.460> lighting<00:05:27.789> too<00:05:28.030> much<00:05:28.210> because<00:05:28.599> it

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
I'm not lighting too much because it

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.510 
I'm not lighting too much because it
might<00:05:29.110> change<00:05:29.349> the<00:05:29.680> color<00:05:29.949> of<00:05:30.069> the<00:05:30.340> butter

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
might change the color of the butter

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.930 
might change the color of the butter
crazy

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.820 

and<00:05:33.420> then<00:05:33.660> I'm<00:05:33.780> going<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:33.960> actually<00:05:34.260> out<00:05:34.650> the

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use a

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.590 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use a
spatula<00:05:49.290> to<00:05:49.890> scrape<00:05:50.310> down<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:50.700> sides<00:05:51.120> of<00:05:51.330> Bowl

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600

just to make sure that all of the
mixture<00:05:54.930> is<00:05:55.080> getting<00:05:55.470> mixed<00:05:55.710> up<00:05:55.950> properly<00:05:56.370> and

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
mixture is getting mixed up properly and

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.790 
mixture is getting mixed up properly and
I'm<00:05:57.450> going<00:05:57.630> to<00:05:57.660> whisk<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:58.110> just<00:05:58.290> a<00:05:58.380> little<00:05:58.680> bit

longer<00:06:02.840> to<00:06:03.840> make<00:06:03.960> this<00:06:04.320> another<00:06:04.950> 20<00:06:05.430> or<00:06:05.640> 30

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
longer to make this another 20 or 30

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.780 
longer to make this another 20 or 30
seconds<00:06:06.480> just<00:06:06.810> until<00:06:07.050> it<00:06:07.230> starts<00:06:07.260> effective

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.520 

okay<00:06:12.790> as<00:06:12.970> I<00:06:13.090> lift<00:06:13.360> up<00:06:13.570> the<00:06:13.780> whisk<00:06:13.960> now<00:06:14.080> you<00:06:14.260> can

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
okay as I lift up the whisk now you can

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.070 
okay as I lift up the whisk now you can
see<00:06:14.830> how<00:06:15.070> it's<00:06:15.250> thickened<00:06:15.790> and<00:06:16.060> how<00:06:16.750> it<00:06:16.900> is<00:06:17.050> a

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
see how it's thickened and how it is a

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.990 
see how it's thickened and how it is a
nice<00:06:17.350> smoothie<00:06:18.100> consistency<00:06:20.640> so<00:06:21.640> the<00:06:21.730> next

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
nice smoothie consistency so the next

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.980 
nice smoothie consistency so the next
thing<00:06:22.150> to<00:06:22.300> do<00:06:22.480> is<00:06:22.720> the<00:06:22.900> color<00:06:23.170> it<00:06:24.450> so<00:06:25.450> using<00:06:25.870> the

paste<00:06:26.260> color<00:06:26.710> I'm<00:06:27.310> going<00:06:27.700> to<00:06:27.820> take<00:06:28.240> some<00:06:28.480> of

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
paste color I'm going to take some of

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.660

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
and as you'll see it didn't take very

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.810 
and as you'll see it didn't take very
much<00:06:51.290> of<00:06:51.500> the<00:06:51.560> pasted<00:06:51.800> color<00:06:52.130> to<00:06:52.370> get<00:06:52.550> it<00:06:52.700> to

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
much of the pasted color to get it to

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.330 
much of the pasted color to get it to
that<00:06:52.970> shade
