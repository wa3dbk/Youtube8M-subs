highest level tournaments out there I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.640 
highest level tournaments out there I
think<00:00:29.310> that's<00:00:29.490> come<00:00:29.670> from<00:00:29.960> like<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> very<00:00:31.289> open

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
think that's come from like a very open

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.709 
think that's come from like a very open
and<00:00:31.769> flexible<00:00:31.920> mindset<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> worst<00:00:33.210> practice

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and flexible mindset to worst practice

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.020 
and flexible mindset to worst practice
and<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.410> need<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.710> find<00:00:34.950> some<00:00:35.309> methods<00:00:35.940> that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and you need to find some methods that

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:47.849 
and you need to find some methods that
match<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.840> player<00:00:37.110> individuality

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.489 

the<00:00:48.850> central<00:00:49.269> eye<00:00:49.420> tracker<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:49.899> really

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
the central eye tracker is a really

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:52.049 
the central eye tracker is a really
important<00:00:50.949> thing<00:00:51.010> for<00:00:51.159> the<00:00:51.370> gamers<00:00:51.640> right<00:00:51.879> now

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
important thing for the gamers right now

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.569 
important thing for the gamers right now
basically<00:00:52.300> you<00:00:52.600> can<00:00:52.960> analyze<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:53.829> try<00:00:54.519> to

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
basically you can analyze and try to

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.000 
basically you can analyze and try to
track<00:00:54.940> data<00:00:55.210> we<00:00:55.749> have<00:00:55.899> so<00:00:56.109> much<00:00:56.260> data<00:00:56.320> so<00:00:56.710> many

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
track data we have so much data so many

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.549 
track data we have so much data so many
numbers<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:57.460> many<00:00:57.609> figures<00:00:58.000> that<00:00:58.629> teams<00:00:59.379> like

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
numbers so many figures that teams like

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.639 
numbers so many figures that teams like
us<00:00:59.710> should<00:01:00.309> use<00:01:00.699> way<00:01:01.269> more<00:01:01.719> wisely<00:01:02.019> than<00:01:02.289> we<00:01:02.559> do

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
us should use way more wisely than we do

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.039 
us should use way more wisely than we do
right<00:01:02.829> now<00:01:03.010> that's<00:01:03.820> when<00:01:04.119> a<00:01:04.479> product<00:01:04.780> like

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
right now that's when a product like

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.330 
right now that's when a product like
this<00:01:05.080> Tilsit<00:01:05.619> century<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.039> going<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.280> be

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
this Tilsit century is going to be

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.670 
this Tilsit century is going to be
really<00:01:06.610> exciting<00:01:07.149> you<00:01:07.390> can<00:01:07.479> analyze<00:01:07.869> what

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
really exciting you can analyze what

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.529 
really exciting you can analyze what
what<00:01:09.009> I'm<00:01:09.100> looking<00:01:09.430> at<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:09.850> then<00:01:10.090> you<00:01:10.180> can<00:01:10.360> try

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
what I'm looking at and then you can try

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.380 
what I'm looking at and then you can try
to<00:01:10.600> count<00:01:11.110> me<00:01:11.350> on<00:01:11.590> wire<00:01:11.890> your<00:01:12.280> brain<00:01:12.520> in<00:01:13.240> the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
to count me on wire your brain in the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.820 
to count me on wire your brain in the
sense<00:01:13.630> that<00:01:13.720> can<00:01:13.960> improve<00:01:14.289> your<00:01:14.409> game<00:01:14.470> in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
sense that can improve your game in

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.830 
sense that can improve your game in
future<00:01:17.909> practicing<00:01:18.909> is<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.119> most<00:01:19.299> important

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
future practicing is the most important

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.270 
future practicing is the most important
thing<00:01:20.049> especially<00:01:20.289> before<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.069> huge

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
thing especially before the huge

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.550 
thing especially before the huge
tournaments<00:01:21.940> and<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.360> think<00:01:22.840> central<00:01:23.409> eye

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
tournaments and I think central eye

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.919 
tournaments and I think central eye
tracker<00:01:24.039> might<00:01:24.640> become<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:24.970> game<00:01:25.299> chip<00:01:25.569> to<00:01:25.840> get

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
tracker might become a game chip to get

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.109 
tracker might become a game chip to get
the<00:01:26.170> best<00:01:26.350> data<00:01:26.560> out<00:01:26.890> of<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.250> by<00:01:27.549> using<00:01:27.610> these

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
the best data out of it by using these

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.940 
the best data out of it by using these
things<00:01:28.299> essentially<00:01:28.810> in<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:28.959> game<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.319> then<00:01:29.530> we

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
things essentially in a game and then we

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.100 
things essentially in a game and then we
need<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.220> replay<00:01:30.670> get<00:01:30.970> so<00:01:31.270> many<00:01:31.539> insights

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
need to replay get so many insights

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.050 
need to replay get so many insights
would<00:01:32.649> you<00:01:32.770> did<00:01:32.950> wrong<00:01:33.159> what<00:01:33.459> you<00:01:33.580> did<00:01:33.610> right

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
would you did wrong what you did right

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.590 
would you did wrong what you did right
how<00:01:34.869> many<00:01:35.280> fixations<00:01:36.280> did<00:01:36.429> you<00:01:36.549> I<00:01:36.640> had<00:01:37.179> per

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
how many fixations did you I had per

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.570 
how many fixations did you I had per
minutes<00:01:37.929> stop<00:01:38.350> by<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.530> soup<00:01:38.950> report<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.549> very

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
minutes stop by that soup report is very

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.760 
minutes stop by that soup report is very
hard<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.179> actually<00:01:40.569> understand<00:01:41.319> if<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.590> don't

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
hard to actually understand if you don't

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:57.880 
hard to actually understand if you don't
have<00:01:41.920> food<00:01:42.159> such<00:01:42.640> as<00:01:42.670> Jesus<00:01:43.420> century
