00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
to accept the mirror so I don't care if

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.009

I'm<00:00:41.920> R<00:00:42.129> it<00:00:42.250> up<00:00:42.339> however<00:00:42.940> you<00:00:43.390> may<00:00:43.570> not<00:00:43.750> want<00:00:43.960> to

I'm R it up however you may not want to
use<00:00:44.309> channel<00:00:45.309> locks<00:00:45.610> because<00:00:45.970> they<00:00:46.300> will

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
use channel locks because they will

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.990 
use channel locks because they will
damage<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.079> bar<00:00:47.260> end<00:00:47.500> so<00:00:48.250> if<00:00:48.579> you<00:00:48.699> want<00:00:48.879> you

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
can always wrap around a around or a

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.350 
can always wrap around a around or a
nice<00:00:52.300> shop<00:00:52.570> rag<00:00:52.809> around<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:54.070> bar<00:00:54.879> end<00:00:55.120> to

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360

nice shop rag around the bar end to
prevent<00:00:55.510> destroying<00:00:56.320> it<00:00:56.970> so<00:00:57.970> I<00:00:58.000> get<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.330> bar

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510

end<00:00:58.720> off<00:00:58.900> and<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.670> will<00:01:00.820> show<00:01:00.970> you<00:01:01.000> how<00:01:01.239> it

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
end off and I will show you how it

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.469 
end off and I will show you how it
actually<00:01:01.420> mounts<00:01:02.170> there's<00:01:02.470> a<00:01:02.559> step<00:01:02.920> here<00:01:03.309> that

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
actually mounts there's a step here that

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.390 
actually mounts there's a step here that
mounts<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:04.720> step<00:01:05.110> inside<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.920> bar<00:01:06.130> end

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
mounts to the step inside the bar end

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.980 
mounts to the step inside the bar end
and<00:01:06.670> that's<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:07.060> make<00:01:07.150> sure<00:01:07.210> that<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.540> bar<00:01:07.750> and

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
and that's to make sure that the bar and

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.170 
and that's to make sure that the bar and
just<00:01:08.590> kind<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.159> lines<00:01:09.340> up<00:01:09.520> with<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:09.970> so<00:01:10.119> you

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
just kind of lines up with it and so you

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.420 
just kind of lines up with it and so you
can<00:01:10.360> actually<00:01:10.479> tighten<00:01:10.869> it<00:01:10.930> down<00:01:10.960> it<00:01:11.950> has<00:01:12.220> no

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
can actually tighten it down it has no

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.340 
can actually tighten it down it has no
other<00:01:12.580> effect<00:01:12.939> on<00:01:13.119> that<00:01:13.299> however<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:14.049> makes<00:01:14.200> it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
other effect on that however it makes it

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.789 
other effect on that however it makes it
difficult<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.920> install<00:01:15.310> an<00:01:15.520> aftermarket<00:01:16.799> bar

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
difficult to install an aftermarket bar

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.859 
difficult to install an aftermarket bar
end<00:01:18.009> with<00:01:18.400> that<00:01:18.549> there<00:01:18.850> so<00:01:19.420> right<00:01:19.630> here<00:01:19.780> I'm

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
end with that there so right here I'm

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.539

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
loose so I'm just twisting it as hard as

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.270 
loose so I'm just twisting it as hard as
I<00:01:24.189> can<00:01:24.250> pulling<00:01:24.759> it<00:01:24.850> off<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.270> there<00:01:25.479> we<00:01:25.600> go<00:01:26.280> now

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
I can pulling it off and there we go now

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.069 
I can pulling it off and there we go now
we<00:01:27.340> have<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.640> get<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.850> end<00:01:28.030> clip<00:01:28.540> out<00:01:28.750> and

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
we have to get the end clip out and

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.660 
we have to get the end clip out and
there's<00:01:29.289> a<00:01:29.350> little<00:01:29.439> bit<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.770> gunk<00:01:30.100> stuck<00:01:30.490> in

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
there's a little bit of gunk stuck in

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.539 
there's a little bit of gunk stuck in
where<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.060> end<00:01:31.210> clip<00:01:31.479> grabs<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.409> bar<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:33.490> I'm

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
where the end clip grabs the bar so I'm

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.840 
where the end clip grabs the bar so I'm
peeling<00:01:33.819> that<00:01:33.850> out<00:01:33.999> with<00:01:34.119> a<00:01:34.149> screwdriver<00:01:34.509> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
internal is to prevent vibration

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.879 
internal is to prevent vibration
something<00:01:52.749> which<00:01:52.929> I<00:01:53.170> don't<00:01:53.439> want<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.619> mount<00:01:53.799> a

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:53.889 
something which I don't want to mount a

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:55.349 
something which I don't want to mount a
mirror<00:01:54.189> to<00:01:54.429> because<00:01:54.759> it's<00:01:54.880> going<00:01:54.969> to<00:01:55.030> make<00:01:55.209> my

mirror<00:01:55.719> vibrate<00:01:56.319> more<00:01:56.590> than<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:56.920> normally

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
mirror vibrate more than it normally

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.190 
mirror vibrate more than it normally
would<00:01:57.280> had<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.819> been<00:01:57.969> hard<00:01:58.630> mounted<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.109> the

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
would had it been hard mounted to the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.149 
would had it been hard mounted to the
bar<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.909> after<00:02:01.240> trying<00:02:01.740> multiple<00:02:02.740> times<00:02:02.950> to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
bar so after trying multiple times to

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.980 
bar so after trying multiple times to
get<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.429> out<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:03.880> finally<00:02:04.270> managed<00:02:04.719> to<00:02:04.899> get

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
get this out I finally managed to get

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.650 
get this out I finally managed to get
that<00:02:05.200> get<00:02:05.679> it<00:02:05.799> loose<00:02:06.069> and<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:10.000> know<00:02:10.119> normally

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
that get it loose and you know normally

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.090 
that get it loose and you know normally
lick<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.990> other<00:02:11.020> side<00:02:11.350> I've<00:02:11.590> done<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.950> other

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
lick the other side I've done the other

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.809 
lick the other side I've done the other
side<00:02:12.130> first

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
side first

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.120 
side first
it<00:02:13.270> came<00:02:13.720> out<00:02:13.840> rather<00:02:14.110> easy<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.890> everything

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
it came out rather easy and everything

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.100 
it came out rather easy and everything
slid<00:02:15.520> out<00:02:15.550> now<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.569> left-hand<00:02:16.930> side

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
slid out now this is the left-hand side

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.750 
slid out now this is the left-hand side
of<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.290> bike<00:02:17.440> which<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.980> kickstand<00:02:18.490> side

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
of the bike which is the kickstand side

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.050 
of the bike which is the kickstand side
so<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.510> means<00:02:19.840> any<00:02:20.370> water<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.459> gets<00:02:21.670> inside

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
so that means any water that gets inside

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.449 
so that means any water that gets inside
of<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.270> bar<00:02:22.569> or<00:02:22.840> any<00:02:22.959> moisture<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:24.099> actually

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
of this bar or any moisture is actually

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.190 
of this bar or any moisture is actually
going<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.640> collect<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.450> lower<00:02:25.750> end<00:02:26.080> of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
going to collect in this lower end of

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.620 
going to collect in this lower end of
the<00:02:26.319> bar<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.340> come<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.910> find<00:02:27.940> out<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.510> was

any corrosion that's in there in the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.240 
any corrosion that's in there in the
future<00:04:54.390> we'll<00:04:54.780> be<00:04:54.810> able<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.260> or<00:04:55.590> any<00:04:55.740> moisture

out<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.230> prevent<00:04:58.740> corrosion<00:05:04.580> so<00:05:05.580> now<00:05:05.700> we<00:05:05.760> can

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
out and prevent corrosion so now we can

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.180 
out and prevent corrosion so now we can
put<00:05:06.120> our<00:05:06.270> handlebar<00:05:07.020> grip<00:05:07.500> back<00:05:07.710> on<00:05:07.890> I'm<00:05:08.040> using

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
put our handlebar grip back on I'm using

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.040 
put our handlebar grip back on I'm using
Gorilla<00:05:08.640> Glue<00:05:08.910> I've<00:05:09.420> used<00:05:09.600> this<00:05:09.720> a<00:05:09.870> million

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
Gorilla Glue I've used this a million

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.490 
Gorilla Glue I've used this a million
times

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
times

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.560 
times
especially<00:05:11.340> on<00:05:11.460> heated<00:05:11.820> grips<00:05:12.000> because<00:05:12.270> it's

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
especially on heated grips because it's

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.600 
especially on heated grips because it's
a<00:05:12.690> hard<00:05:13.200> plastic<00:05:13.470> on<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:13.920> inside<00:05:14.220> it's<00:05:14.460> not

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
a hard plastic on the inside it's not

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.460 
a hard plastic on the inside it's not
like<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.850> normal<00:05:14.940> grip<00:05:15.510> where<00:05:15.750> it's<00:05:15.870> rubber<00:05:16.200> all

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
like a normal grip where it's rubber all

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.570 
like a normal grip where it's rubber all
the<00:05:16.620> way<00:05:16.710> through<00:05:17.210> so<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.510> little<00:05:18.960> bit<00:05:19.260> of<00:05:19.710> the

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
the way through so a little bit of the

the way through so a little bit of the
Gorilla<00:05:21.030> Glue<00:05:21.240> goes<00:05:21.660> a<00:05:21.690> very<00:05:21.810> long<00:05:22.050> way<00:05:22.290> it

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
Gorilla Glue goes a very long way it

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.430 
Gorilla Glue goes a very long way it
expands<00:05:23.580> nicely<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:24.330> if<00:05:24.930> you<00:05:25.020> ever<00:05:25.140> have<00:05:25.320> to

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
expands nicely and if you ever have to

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.050 
expands nicely and if you ever have to
remove<00:05:25.710> your<00:05:25.860> grip<00:05:26.040> in<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.190> future<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.550> quick

remove your grip in the future a quick

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.300 
remove your grip in the future a quick
turn<00:05:27.600> of<00:05:27.810> it<00:05:27.960> will<00:05:28.380> actually<00:05:28.530> crack<00:05:28.920> it<00:05:29.100> loose

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
turn of it will actually crack it loose

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.400 
turn of it will actually crack it loose
and<00:05:29.580> you<00:05:30.060> can<00:05:30.090> slide<00:05:30.390> your<00:05:30.570> bar<00:05:30.720> end<00:05:30.900> off<00:05:31.050> just

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
and you can slide your bar end off just

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.070 
and you can slide your bar end off just
as<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.680> did<00:05:31.740> prior<00:05:32.450> when<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.480> first<00:05:33.780> install

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
as I did prior when I first install

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.360 
as I did prior when I first install
these<00:05:34.200> I<00:05:34.260> used<00:05:34.500> Gorilla<00:05:34.830> Glue<00:05:35.040> that's<00:05:35.220> what

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
these I used Gorilla Glue that's what

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.120 
these I used Gorilla Glue that's what
the<00:05:35.520> remnants<00:05:36.210> of<00:05:36.240> that<00:05:36.690> brown<00:05:37.530> stuff<00:05:37.710> is<00:05:37.980> on

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
the remnants of that brown stuff is on

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.940 
the remnants of that brown stuff is on
there<00:05:38.930> so<00:05:39.930> getting<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:40.530> grip<00:05:40.860> back<00:05:41.100> on<00:05:42.950> falls

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
there so getting the grip back on falls

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.540 
there so getting the grip back on falls
into<00:05:44.190> place<00:05:44.280> nicely<00:05:46.100> twist<00:05:47.100> it<00:05:47.250> so<00:05:47.340> it<00:05:47.430> matches

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
into place nicely twist it so it matches

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.120 
into place nicely twist it so it matches
the<00:05:47.790> other<00:05:48.000> one<00:05:48.210> so<00:05:48.420> my<00:05:48.600> heated<00:05:49.560> cable<00:05:49.950> isn't

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
the other one so my heated cable isn't

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.250 
the other one so my heated cable isn't
in<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.340> way<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.580> anything<00:05:50.820> and<00:05:51.270> now<00:05:51.900> I<00:05:51.930> can<00:05:52.170> go

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
in the way of anything and now I can go
