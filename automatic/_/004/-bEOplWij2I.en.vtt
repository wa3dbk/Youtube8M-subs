 a fraternal hug from Panama not very 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.280
 kind because they decided what are the 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.320
 arguments that the political group has 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.729

 politician to the president lugo 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.600
 yes as not as you will know andrea the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.180
 dear country party that make up 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.390
 part block party party 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.390
 of opposition 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.070
 to the government of fernando lugo us 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.970
 we have tried already in some other 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.799
 occasion to bring the impeachment 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.350
 this poor performance in his functions at 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.770
 president lugo and frankly we have not 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.909
 obtained the necessary votes we 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.220
 we start from the premise that our 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.830
 error within the opposition a 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.799
 Responsible position so responsible 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.750
 we must also mark a sheet of 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.209
 route in relation to the trajinar and what 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.940
 the paraguay will be produced 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:51.119
 recent events are not a magic one 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.149
 family of condescending events with 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.580
 armed groups like the known ones 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.990
 known effects groups of Paraguay 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.799
 what is called what is called army 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.860
 of the Paraguayan people the pp that I have already 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.290
 generated this a good amount of 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.259
 killed between police 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.720
 and if civil citizenship as well as 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.660
 kidnappings this this group is what 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.000
 relates directly to those with 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.680
 farc and with other sectors this 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.200
 uses in the mechanism of violence 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.320
 as a claim mechanism we 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.380
 we live in a state of absolute right 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.950
 and of democracy a good time ago and 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.320
 this mechanism of impeachment is 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.830
 a mechanism established in our 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.290
 constitution and this in the past 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.450
 times and after the events of the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.580
 curuguaty city because curuguaty 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.190
 fused community inside the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.830
 Paraguay where it is established 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.560
 amount lady who has certain may 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.459
 be claimed not before the courts as 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.100
 as a property is that who would be 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.570
 belongs to the state no less true is 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.520
 that for internal jesus justifies that the 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.170
 which should be ordered sir fields for 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.209
 make clear what you are telling us 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.400
 counting says that the death of these 17 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.680
 people is simply the trigger for 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.480
 a crisis that comes before but 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.950
 the rejection in the congress is partly the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.810
 support that has lent 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.000
 the president lugo to armed groups 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.560
 illegal in your country that would even have 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.379
 links with groups like the group 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.390
 terrorist of the farc itself is 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.370
 likewise open he has claimed it if 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.950
 we have reclaimed him from fernando lugo 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.200
 we have asked to rectify directions 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.060
 imagine jaison that now own 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.400
 authentic radical liberal party that the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.010
 party support this government of 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.920
 fernando lugo who is brilliant who is 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.660
 that they achieved in the alliance 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.599
 democratic for change as they called it 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.799
 having the power today is giving 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.660
 is that this is the possibility of 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.530
 alternative to having to face a 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.120
 impeachment so this is almost 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.099
 almost unanimously in the camera 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.790
 deputy where the lawsuit was filed 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:08.340
 impeachment complaint this already 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.930
 has been pronounced after deputies the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.840
 vote was 73 to 1 with that you know 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.950
 giving the pattern that the political class 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.650
 almost almost mostly agrees 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.600
 we go beyond what can happen 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.180
 Now that has to go through the 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.280
 senate the congress 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.920
 would act like the lower house would act 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.220
 as a plaintiff in this case 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.110
 I understand and the Senate would be the one 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.150
 would take case out the impeachment 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.440
 but we still have to go through the Senate 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.450
 true indeed this is how I 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.300
 I'm now in braking this has to 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.470
 go through the senate that the meat has 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.300
 that prepare the regulation and the libel 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.150
 accusatory and good and he will have to 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.780
 withdraw its defenders this I do not believe 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.820
 which go far from him the 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.080
 unrestricted 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.300
 of the air there is a norm that marks us 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.660
 our constitution and to him the due 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.970
 process is going to give no guarantee and my 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.660
 presence have alternated is just a 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.800
 that this install the legislators 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.500
 presidents of other political parties 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.200
 that we have taken another determination in 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.570
 this guarantee to the citizenship and 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.250
 also to the international community of 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.150
 that the process is going to take its due 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.520
 way 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.870
 we have the safeguards of the 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.490
 institutionality the republic of 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.320
 paraguay deputies as it was said 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.080
 initially you expected the 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.230
 congressmen the resignation today of fernando 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.270
 or are you requesting that the 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.240
 president resign because he already decided 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.850
 qualify for the trial if the president in 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:52.220
 a press conference held this 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:55.290
 tomorrow he submits to impeachment and he 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.080
 communicates that he does not intend to resign here 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.610
 some an order until you want 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.270
 popular and will show some demonstrations 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.270
 referents of the Catholic Church of 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.970
 bishopric where we analyze the 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.860
 possibility that fernando lugo us 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.860
 give this opportunity that he 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.280
 will give up its independent mineral and 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.530
 that this process we completed it 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.710
 account that the next elections are 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.330

 we are very grateful to roberto campos
