one<00:00:01.230> of<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.439> things<00:00:01.650> that<00:00:01.829> I've<00:00:02.070> been<00:00:02.310> working

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
one of the things that I've been working

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.970 
one of the things that I've been working
on<00:00:03.210> along<00:00:03.570> with<00:00:03.629> my<00:00:03.899> colleagues<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.589> a

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
on along with my colleagues is a

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.629 
on along with my colleagues is a
computer<00:00:05.670> weather<00:00:05.850> forecasting<00:00:06.540> system

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:07.639 
computer weather forecasting system

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:09.950 
computer weather forecasting system
computer<00:00:08.639> weather<00:00:08.970> modeling<00:00:09.420> over<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.719> polar

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
computer weather modeling over the polar

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.020 
computer weather modeling over the polar
regions<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.679> particularly<00:00:11.250> challenging<00:00:11.790> for

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
regions is particularly challenging for

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.810 
regions is particularly challenging for
a<00:00:12.059> number<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.360> reasons<00:00:13.190> one<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.370> our

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
a number of reasons one is that our

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.000 
a number of reasons one is that our
understanding<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.960> polar<00:00:16.320> atmosphere

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
understanding of the polar atmosphere

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.800 
understanding of the polar atmosphere
and<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> polar<00:00:17.550> weather<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.119> not<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:18.449> good<00:00:18.630> as

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and the polar weather is not as good as

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.540 
and the polar weather is not as good as
it<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:18.990> over<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.800> tropics<00:00:20.279> or<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
it is over the tropics or the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.029 
it is over the tropics or the
mid-latitudes<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.840> our<00:00:21.960> basic<00:00:22.350> understanding

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
mid-latitudes so our basic understanding

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.740 
mid-latitudes so our basic understanding
of<00:00:23.130> how<00:00:23.279> things<00:00:23.519> work<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.539> good

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
of how things work here is not as good

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.960 
of how things work here is not as good
and<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.710> basic<00:00:26.130> understanding<00:00:26.849> that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
and it's that basic understanding that

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.759 
and it's that basic understanding that
allows<00:00:27.210> us<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.630> represent<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.320> weather<00:00:28.500> in

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
allows us to represent the weather in

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.929 
allows us to represent the weather in
the<00:00:28.800> atmosphere<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.429> everything<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the atmosphere and everything that

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.150 
the atmosphere and everything that
happens<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.510> our<00:00:30.660> model<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.500> that's<00:00:31.710> one<00:00:31.980> thing

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
happens in our model so that's one thing

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.650 
happens in our model so that's one thing
that<00:00:32.219> makes<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.730> challenge<00:00:32.759> our<00:00:33.270> basic

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that makes it a challenge our basic

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.229 
that makes it a challenge our basic
understanding<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:35.070> second<00:00:35.760> thing<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.059> makes

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
understanding a second thing that makes

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.540 
understanding a second thing that makes
it<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.480> challenge<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.200> fact<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.620> there

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
it a challenge is the fact that there

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910 
it a challenge is the fact that there
are<00:00:38.579> fewer<00:00:39.000> observations<00:00:39.809> over<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.680> polar

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
are fewer observations over the polar

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.470 
are fewer observations over the polar
regions<00:00:41.520> then<00:00:41.760> there<00:00:41.910> are<00:00:42.059> over<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
regions then there are over the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.500 
regions then there are over the
mid-latitudes<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.520> in<00:00:44.520> large<00:00:44.820> part<00:00:45.180> that's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
mid-latitudes and in large part that's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.779 
mid-latitudes and in large part that's
because<00:00:45.600> more<00:00:46.379> people<00:00:46.410> live<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
because more people live in the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.600 
because more people live in the
mid-latitudes<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> tropics<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.610> over

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
mid-latitudes in the tropics then over

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.459 
mid-latitudes in the tropics then over
Antarctica<00:00:51.180> were<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.870> northern<00:00:52.230> polar

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
Antarctica were the northern polar

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.430 
Antarctica were the northern polar
regions<00:00:52.949> our<00:00:53.399> main<00:00:53.879> concern<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.320> is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
regions our main concern down here is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.360 
regions our main concern down here is
aviation<00:00:56.809> forecasting<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.379> mainly<00:00:59.070> for

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
aviation forecasting it's mainly for

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.209 
aviation forecasting it's mainly for
flight<00:00:59.609> safety<00:00:59.960> these<00:01:00.960> aircraft<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.770> no

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
flight safety these aircraft have no

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.880 
flight safety these aircraft have no
other<00:01:02.430> places<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.210> return<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:06.330> our<00:01:07.260> ability

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
other places to return to so our ability

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
other places to return to so our ability
to<00:01:07.920> forecast<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.640> weather<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.229> high

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to forecast the weather is is a high

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.969 
to forecast the weather is is a high
impact<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:12.510> weather<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
impact the weather is what it is and you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.760 
impact the weather is what it is and you
can't<00:01:14.490> wish<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:14.939> away<00:01:15.229> we<00:01:16.229> take<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> very

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
can't wish it away we take a very

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.840 
can't wish it away we take a very
conservative<00:01:17.159> approach<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.570> me<00:01:19.700> on<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
conservative approach on me on the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.530 
conservative approach on me on the
weather<00:01:21.409> my<00:01:22.409> philosophy<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.150> science

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
weather my philosophy is the the science

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.289 
weather my philosophy is the the science
has<00:01:24.659> been<00:01:24.840> here<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.229> millions<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:26.189> years<00:01:26.299> one

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
has been here for millions of years one

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.539 
has been here for millions of years one
more<00:01:27.509> day<00:01:27.720> won't<00:01:27.930> matter<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.799> course<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.310> want

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
more day won't matter of course we want

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
more day won't matter of course we want
to<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.759> them<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.689> our<00:01:30.990> main

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
to get them out when we can our main

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.280 
to get them out when we can our main
goal<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.520> fly<00:01:32.729> safe<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.579> like<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:36.290> take

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
goal is to fly safe and I like to take

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.010 
goal is to fly safe and I like to take
the<00:01:37.619> same<00:01:38.009> amount<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.460> people<00:01:38.759> home<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.869> me

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the same amount of people home with me

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:54.800 
the same amount of people home with me
that<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.229> brought

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.330 

so<00:01:55.810> right<00:01:55.960> now<00:01:55.990> I'm<00:01:56.290> sitting<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.800> c-17

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
so right now I'm sitting in a c-17

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.450 
so right now I'm sitting in a c-17
aircraft<00:01:57.700> which<00:01:58.300> weighs<00:01:58.510> about<00:01:58.690> 200<00:01:59.470> tons<00:01:59.800> and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
aircraft which weighs about 200 tons and

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.370 
aircraft which weighs about 200 tons and
we're<00:02:00.580> sitting<00:02:00.730> on<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> bus<00:02:01.180> 60<00:02:01.780> device<00:02:02.050> and

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
we're sitting on a bus 60 device and

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.460 
we're sitting on a bus 60 device and
below<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:03.160> 1,100<00:02:03.820> feet<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.120> water<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.410> I'm

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
below that is 1,100 feet of water so I'm

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.900 
below that is 1,100 feet of water so I'm
here<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.740> talk<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.220> pilot<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.670> fly<00:02:06.700> the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
here to talk to the pilot to fly the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.639 
here to talk to the pilot to fly the
planes<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.450> McMurdo<00:02:07.750> Station<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:08.320> they<00:02:08.470> say

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
planes to McMurdo Station and they say

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.650 
planes to McMurdo Station and they say
so<00:02:08.710> many<00:02:09.010> different<00:02:09.220> challenges<00:02:09.820> they<00:02:10.510> have

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
so many different challenges they have

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.230 
so many different challenges they have
to<00:02:10.810> land<00:02:11.020> on<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.500> ice<00:02:11.650> they<00:02:12.280> have<00:02:12.430> one<00:02:12.730> shot<00:02:13.030> to

so<00:03:12.310> it's<00:03:12.519> that's<00:03:13.030> an<00:03:13.209> exciting<00:03:13.570> challenge<00:03:15.180> is

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
so it's that's an exciting challenge is

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.729 
so it's that's an exciting challenge is

are proved to go hurt penguins and seals
off<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.590> runway<00:04:10.130> we'll<00:04:10.730> get<00:04:10.880> them<00:04:11.120> out<00:04:11.330> of

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
off the runway we'll get them out of

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.270 
off the runway we'll get them out of
here<00:04:11.510> get<00:04:12.290> him<00:04:12.410> away<00:04:12.500> from<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.920> aircraft

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
here get him away from the aircraft

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.110 
here get him away from the aircraft
operations<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:15.710> we<00:04:15.860> don't<00:04:15.980> farm<00:04:16.940> the

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
operations and so that we don't farm the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:26.850

wildlife

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.140 

so<00:04:27.860> we<00:04:27.950> can<00:04:28.100> see<00:04:28.280> how<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:28.550> extreme

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
so we can see how this extreme

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.970 
so we can see how this extreme
environment<00:04:29.440> impacts<00:04:30.440> our<00:04:30.500> ability<00:04:30.560> to
