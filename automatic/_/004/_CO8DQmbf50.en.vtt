for some too slow cpu others it's the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.169 
for some too slow cpu others it's the
amount<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.840> ram<00:00:13.049> but<00:00:13.769> for<00:00:13.920> most<00:00:14.099> people<00:00:14.730> it's

amount of ram but for most people it's

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.480 
amount of ram but for most people it's
actually<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> speed<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.500> their<00:00:17.010> hard<00:00:17.220> drive

actually the speed of their hard drive

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.550 
actually the speed of their hard drive
doesn't<00:00:17.880> matter<00:00:18.090> how<00:00:18.240> fast<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> CPU<00:00:19.050> got<00:00:19.289> I

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
doesn't matter how fast the CPU got I

mean<00:00:19.590> ultimately<00:00:19.859> you're<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> be

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
mean ultimately you're going to be

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.160 
mean ultimately you're going to be
throttled<00:00:21.029> by<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.240> speed<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.170> disk<00:00:22.710> and

throttled by the speed of that disk and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
feel the crunch of the drives especially

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.899 
feel the crunch of the drives especially
when<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.470> reading<00:01:22.920> from<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> drives<00:01:23.610> or

showing you how fast it is insanely fast
just<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.630> show<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.810> how<00:01:43.079> much<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.320> a

just to show you how much of a
bottleneck<00:01:43.860> your<00:01:44.460> drives<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.710> this

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
bottleneck your drives can be so this

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.420 
bottleneck your drives can be so this
happens<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:48.210> 256<00:01:49.140> gig<00:01:49.380> model<00:01:49.740> top<00:01:50.280> of

right around eight hundred dollars so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.749 
right around eight hundred dollars so
like<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.689> said<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:55.530> lucky<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.340> been<00:01:56.549> put

or<00:03:54.959> 300<00:03:57.150> even<00:03:58.150> even<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.599> fast<00:03:58.870> scuzzy<00:03:59.609> like<00:04:00.609> no

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
or 300 even even the fast scuzzy like no

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.830 
or 300 even even the fast scuzzy like no
this<00:04:02.049> this<00:04:04.680> this<00:04:05.680> is<00:04:05.859> a<00:04:05.889> dream<00:04:06.220> come<00:04:06.280> true<00:04:06.849> this

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
this this this is a dream come true this

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.750 
this this this is a dream come true this
is<00:04:07.959> absolutely<00:04:08.379> a<00:04:08.799> dream<00:04:08.859> come<00:04:09.340> true<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.669> I

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
is absolutely a dream come true and I

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.610 
is absolutely a dream come true and I
realized<00:04:10.239> like<00:04:10.419> five<00:04:10.870> years<00:04:11.109> from<00:04:11.230> now<00:04:11.379> this

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
realized like five years from now this

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.309 
realized like five years from now this
is<00:04:11.739> going<00:04:11.919> to<00:04:12.040> be<00:04:12.129> standard<00:04:12.699> right<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:14.139> right

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
is going to be standard right so right

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.509 
is going to be standard right so right
now<00:04:14.549> cutting<00:04:15.549> edge<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.919> certainly<00:04:17.919> if<00:04:18.160> you

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
now cutting edge and certainly if you

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.460 
now cutting edge and certainly if you
want<00:04:18.760> massive<00:04:19.479> performance

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
want massive performance

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.590 
want massive performance
you<00:04:22.370> need<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.580> think<00:04:22.640> about<00:04:22.850> your<00:04:23.060> biggest

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
you need to think about your biggest

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.690 
you need to think about your biggest
bottlenecks<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:25.070> may<00:04:25.220> very<00:04:25.250> well<00:04:25.550> be

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
bottlenecks and that may very well be

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.490 
bottlenecks and that may very well be
your<00:04:26.120> hard<00:04:26.570> drive<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.050> fact<00:04:27.230> that<00:04:27.320> it's

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
your hard drive so the fact that it's

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.470 
your hard drive so the fact that it's
got<00:04:27.530> 256<00:04:28.190> gigs<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:28.730> should<00:04:29.120> be<00:04:29.150> able<00:04:29.240> to

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
got 256 gigs I should be able to

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.780 
got 256 gigs I should be able to
accommodate<00:04:29.960> most<00:04:30.710> of<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:30.920> utilities<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.730> I

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
accommodate most of the utilities that I

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.910 
accommodate most of the utilities that I
run<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.930> course<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.200> operating<00:04:33.620> system<00:04:33.860> I

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
run and of course the operating system I

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.640 
run and of course the operating system I
think<00:04:33.950> i'm<00:04:34.190> going<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.400> keep<00:04:34.610> most<00:04:35.300> of<00:04:35.510> my

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
think i'm going to keep most of my

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.230 
think i'm going to keep most of my
documents<00:04:36.650> like<00:04:36.800> photos<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.700> images<00:04:37.850> and

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
documents like photos and images and

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.570 
documents like photos and images and
whatnot<00:04:38.570> on<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:39.740> separate<00:04:40.100> drive<00:04:40.280> one<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
whatnot on a separate drive one of the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.330 
whatnot on a separate drive one of the
western<00:04:41.300> digital<00:04:41.500> velociraptors<00:04:42.500> just

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
western digital velociraptors just

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.740 
western digital velociraptors just
because<00:04:43.520> that's<00:04:43.670> going<00:04:43.760> to<00:04:43.850> have<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.240> higher

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
because that's going to have a higher

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.450 
because that's going to have a higher
capacity<00:04:45.290> for<00:04:45.470> storage<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:45.830> i'm<00:04:46.160> not<00:04:46.340> going

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
capacity for storage and i'm not going

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.100 
capacity for storage and i'm not going

to access those files all the time i

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.820 
to access those files all the time i
want<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.680> run<00:04:48.830> most<00:04:49.640> if<00:04:49.880> not<00:04:49.940> all<00:04:50.150> of<00:04:50.360> my<00:04:50.600> apps

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
want to run most if not all of my apps

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.710 
want to run most if not all of my apps

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.700 
future video is an HDD this is an SD d
this<00:05:19.970> is<00:05:20.000> like<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.480> Tyrannosaurus<00:05:21.169> Rex<00:05:21.440> to<00:05:21.680> a

this is like the Tyrannosaurus Rex to a

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.080 
this is like the Tyrannosaurus Rex to a

from<00:05:23.540> a<00:05:24.500> falafel<00:05:24.800> Raptor<00:05:25.340> at<00:05:25.669> all<00:05:26.290> I'm<00:05:27.290> not

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
from a falafel Raptor at all I'm not

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.020 
from a falafel Raptor at all I'm not
making<00:05:27.740> fun<00:05:27.800> of<00:05:27.919> it<00:05:28.040> I'm<00:05:28.190> having<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:28.700> lot<00:05:28.880> of<00:05:28.910> fun

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
making fun of it I'm having a lot of fun

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.310 
making fun of it I'm having a lot of fun
with<00:05:29.510> this<00:05:29.630> hardware<00:05:29.960> and<00:05:30.050> hopefully

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
with this hardware and hopefully

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.560 
with this hardware and hopefully
everybody<00:05:30.620> else<00:05:30.800> is<00:05:30.950> too<00:05:31.160> I<00:05:31.190> mean<00:05:31.400> we<00:05:31.550> got<00:05:32.540> a

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
everybody else is too I mean we got a

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.810 
everybody else is too I mean we got a
hundred<00:05:33.080> more<00:05:33.350> people<00:05:33.680> stopping<00:05:34.220> by<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.550> see

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
hundred more people stopping by to see

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.850 
hundred more people stopping by to see
how<00:05:34.940> this<00:05:35.210> is<00:05:35.270> going<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.630> work<00:05:35.780> in<00:05:36.020> what<00:05:36.830> I

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
how this is going to work in what I

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.430 
how this is going to work in what I
tweeted<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:37.400> out<00:05:37.490> on<00:05:37.760> Twitter<00:05:38.360> of<00:05:38.870> course<00:05:39.080> as

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
tweeted it out on Twitter of course as

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.409 
tweeted it out on Twitter of course as
opposed<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:39.860> tweeting<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:40.400> out<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:41.150> local

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
opposed to tweeting it out the local

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.219 
opposed to tweeting it out the local
post<00:05:41.600> office<00:05:42.430> so<00:05:43.430> uh<00:05:43.460> here<00:05:44.240> we<00:05:44.330> go<00:05:44.479> going<00:05:45.169> to

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
post office so uh here we go going to

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.580 
post office so uh here we go going to
give<00:05:45.350> this<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.500> good<00:05:46.010> stab<00:05:46.370> and<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:47.720> see<00:05:48.440> how

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
give this a good stab and and see how

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.930 
give this a good stab and and see how
well<00:05:48.770> it<00:05:48.800> runs<00:05:49.070> so<00:05:49.370> this<00:05:49.490> is<00:05:49.610> going<00:05:49.700> to<00:05:49.790> be<00:05:49.850> the

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
well it runs so this is going to be the

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.110 
well it runs so this is going to be the
first<00:05:50.150> in<00:05:50.330> a<00:05:50.450> series<00:05:50.479> of<00:05:50.960> videos<00:05:51.970> related<00:05:52.970> to
