putting it up how do you think it kind

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.760 
putting it up how do you think it kind
of<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.090> differs<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:07.020> maybe<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.530> tone

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
then obviously like when like the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.700 
then obviously like when like the
European<00:01:27.750> players<00:01:27.990> come<00:01:28.229> over<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> play<00:01:28.619> you

European players come over to play you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.289 
European players come over to play you
that's<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.400> they're<00:01:29.579> having<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.970> contend

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that's what they're having to contend

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.370 
that's what they're having to contend
with<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.479> well<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.320> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
with as well so it's kind of do you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.870 
with as well so it's kind of do you
think<00:01:31.560> home<00:01:31.680> turf<00:01:31.920> obviously<00:01:32.310> makes<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> big

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
think home turf obviously makes a big

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.249 
think home turf obviously makes a big
difference<00:01:33.180> then<00:01:33.329> clearly<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.020> through

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
difference then clearly just through

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.179 
difference then clearly just through
jetlag<00:01:35.299> yeah<00:01:36.360> hundred<00:01:36.810> percent<00:01:36.900> um<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.650> feel

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
jetlag yeah hundred percent um I feel

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.679 
jetlag yeah hundred percent um I feel
like<00:01:38.340> we're<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.670> American<00:01:38.939> tournaments

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
like we're not like American tournaments

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.749 
like we're not like American tournaments
