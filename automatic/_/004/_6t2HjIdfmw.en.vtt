00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.040
 we are in the Leningrad region this 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.849
 corn hont bentham 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:20.420
 Japanese variety 78 days of ripening on 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:35.239
 actually harvesting 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:35.239
 so it was much earlier lake 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:49.250
 I planted from 20 seeds 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:54.510
 which were teabags the 18th total 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:59.210
 except for this instance, everything else 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.210
 died immediately notice all 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.399
 the next three 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:19.549
 Bush died off and then went from the stepson 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:19.549
 so everything looks small 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.150
 this is just a breath just amazing 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.290
 where at all then it has grown it was not 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:40.090
 until June there was nothing at all 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.090
 and he seemed and then at ten but 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.790
 also it is practically choose that is 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.570
 this shot is not 78 days of ripening 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:07.330
 rotted 60 here so it looks let's go on 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:13.700
 the sun is not particularly he ran out 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:16.250
 milk arrow from milk ripe yes but 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.550
 it was not at all seventy to eighty 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.550
 mourning 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:31.489
 Tasty even very so I recommend 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.120
 Try considering that I just have them. 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.480
 tornu 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:41.420
 among the flowers and their plots with 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:51.620
 potatoes are all potatoes 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:56.620
 potatoes sort of luck you can say 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:00.019
 that since I didn't fertilize the formulas in the middle 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.600
 there is no other bed behind him 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.660
 that this is probably a good experiment 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.930
 Candles year planting try plant 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:13.070
 see them separately as they grow up 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.440
