of all their pagodas wins the game well

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:28.719 
of all their pagodas wins the game well
the<00:01:27.710> way<00:01:27.799> that<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.009> get<00:01:28.159> rid<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.520> goat<00:01:28.700> is

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
the way that you get rid of the goat is

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.240 
the way that you get rid of the goat is
it's<00:01:29.030> basically<00:01:29.119> by<00:01:29.619> connecting<00:01:30.619> two<00:01:30.890> tiles

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
it's basically by connecting two tiles

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.760 
it's basically by connecting two tiles
or<00:01:31.729> two<00:01:32.240> squares<00:01:32.659> i<00:01:32.840> should<00:01:33.049> say<00:01:33.259> of<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.560> same

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
or two squares i should say of the same

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.350 
or two squares i should say of the same
color<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:34.340> here<00:01:34.610> i've<00:01:34.700> got<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:35.000> yellow<00:01:35.180> on

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
color so here i've got the yellow on

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.270 
color so here i've got the yellow on
here<00:01:35.540> i'll<00:01:35.630> take<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:35.990> drag<00:01:36.170> this<00:01:36.320> over<00:01:36.500> maybe

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
here i'll take and drag this over maybe

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.649 
here i'll take and drag this over maybe
drop<00:01:37.549> this<00:01:37.729> there<00:01:37.969> and<00:01:38.119> i<00:01:38.149> can<00:01:38.299> flip<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.570> around

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
drop this there and i can flip it around

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.870 
drop this there and i can flip it around
if<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.049> really<00:01:39.259> wanted<00:01:39.469> to<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:40.310> i'll<00:01:40.490> hit<00:01:40.670> done

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
if I really wanted to and i'll hit done

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.700 
if I really wanted to and i'll hit done
over<00:01:41.210> here<00:01:41.329> on<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.570> left<00:01:41.810> so<00:01:42.380> i've<00:01:42.469> connected

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
over here on the left so i've connected

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.490 
over here on the left so i've connected
three<00:01:43.189> yellows<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.520> I've<00:01:43.729> lost<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.090> pagoda

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
three yellows and I've lost the pagoda

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.779 
three yellows and I've lost the pagoda
so<00:01:45.500> now<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.680> opponent<00:01:46.250> has<00:01:46.340> come<00:01:46.520> in<00:01:46.640> he's

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
so now the opponent has come in he's

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.810 
so now the opponent has come in he's
placed<00:01:47.090> two<00:01:48.020> blue<00:01:48.799> tiles<00:01:49.219> together<00:01:49.399> because

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
placed two blue tiles together because

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.340 
placed two blue tiles together because
he's<00:01:49.909> got<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> solid<00:01:50.360> tile<00:01:50.689> of<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.869> same<00:01:51.110> color

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
he's got a solid tile of the same color

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.020 
he's got a solid tile of the same color
he<00:01:51.619> gets<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.860> place<00:01:52.039> of<00:01:52.189> lakota<00:01:52.490> there<00:01:52.789> and

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
he gets the place of lakota there and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.120 
he gets the place of lakota there and
now<00:01:53.570> he's<00:01:53.750> connected<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.409> city<00:01:54.740> here

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
now he's connected to the city here

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.609 
now he's connected to the city here
anytime<00:01:55.909> you<00:01:56.149> connected<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:56.630> city<00:01:56.899> you're<00:01:57.409> also

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
anytime you connected a city you're also

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.319 
anytime you connected a city you're also
going<00:01:57.799> to<00:01:58.039> get<00:01:58.280> rid<00:01:58.430> of<00:01:58.460> one<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.670> your<00:01:58.789> pagodas

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
going to get rid of one of your pagodas

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.450 
going to get rid of one of your pagodas
now<00:01:59.689> I<00:01:59.750> can<00:01:59.990> come<00:02:00.170> back<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.500> capture<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:01.189> if

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
now I can come back and capture this if

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.810 
now I can come back and capture this if
i<00:02:02.060> connect<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:02.689> with<00:02:02.869> two<00:02:03.590> more<00:02:04.100> regions<00:02:04.670> so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
i connect to it with two more regions so

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.999 
i connect to it with two more regions so
whoever<00:02:05.000> has<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.359> most<00:02:05.630> regions<00:02:06.170> connected

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
whoever has the most regions connected

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.779 
whoever has the most regions connected
to<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.130> city<00:02:07.460> will<00:02:08.379> recapture<00:02:09.379> that<00:02:09.679> city<00:02:09.979> so

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
to a city will recapture that city so

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.100 
to a city will recapture that city so
the<00:02:10.910> next<00:02:11.060> thing<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.300> may<00:02:11.420> do<00:02:11.629> is<00:02:11.750> take<00:02:11.959> this

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
the next thing I may do is take this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.530 
the next thing I may do is take this
double<00:02:12.500> blue<00:02:12.830> here<00:02:13.160> put<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.459> here

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
double blue here put it here

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.880 
double blue here put it here
and<00:02:14.629> now<00:02:14.750> I've<00:02:14.840> got<00:02:15.019> an<00:02:15.140> area<00:02:15.469> of<00:02:15.530> three

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
and now I've got an area of three

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.759 
and now I've got an area of three
regions<00:02:16.280> like<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.790> now<00:02:17.719> what<00:02:18.260> I'm<00:02:18.379> trying<00:02:18.680> to

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
regions like so now what I'm trying to

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.860 
regions like so now what I'm trying to
do<00:02:18.920> here<00:02:19.159> is<00:02:19.189> basically<00:02:19.430> try<00:02:19.939> to<00:02:20.000> connect<00:02:20.629> to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
do here is basically try to connect to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.110 
do here is basically try to connect to
his<00:02:21.109> little<00:02:21.349> blue<00:02:21.620> region<00:02:21.980> there<00:02:22.189> and<00:02:22.459> take<00:02:23.090> it

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
his little blue region there and take it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.360 
his little blue region there and take it
over<00:02:23.390> now<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.349> only<00:02:24.560> way<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:24.920> will

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
over now the only way that that will

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.979 
over now the only way that that will
happen<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:25.879> is<00:02:26.060> similar<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.420> Tigris<00:02:26.870> and

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
happen is this is similar to Tigris and

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.800 
happen is this is similar to Tigris and
Euphrates<00:02:27.079> is<00:02:27.799> if<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.430> have<00:02:28.579> more<00:02:28.879> total<00:02:29.329> you

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
Euphrates is if I have more total you

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.440 
Euphrates is if I have more total you
know<00:02:29.930> grid<00:02:30.290> spaces<00:02:30.890> on<00:02:31.040> my<00:02:31.220> side<00:02:31.549> than<00:02:32.120> there

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
know grid spaces on my side than there

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.000 
know grid spaces on my side than there
so<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.959> were<00:02:33.109> to<00:02:33.170> do<00:02:33.349> this<00:02:33.379> and<00:02:33.680> do<00:02:33.890> another

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
so if I were to do this and do another

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.059 
so if I were to do this and do another
double<00:02:34.430> blue<00:02:35.209> there<00:02:35.450> I'd<00:02:35.689> have<00:02:35.720> three<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.920> his

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
double blue there I'd have three to his

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.970 
double blue there I'd have three to his
two<00:02:37.400> grids<00:02:38.269> now<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.810> can<00:02:38.989> never<00:02:39.230> connect<00:02:39.709> them

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
two grids now you can never connect them

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.479 
two grids now you can never connect them
if<00:02:40.220> they<00:02:40.879> are<00:02:41.319> equally<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.889> same<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.340> if<00:02:43.430> I

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
if they are equally the same so if I

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.330 
if they are equally the same so if I
have<00:02:43.639> only<00:02:44.060> two<00:02:44.540> blues<00:02:45.349> and<00:02:45.680> then<00:02:45.769> connected

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
have only two blues and then connected

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.640 
have only two blues and then connected
to<00:02:46.430> his<00:02:46.579> two<00:02:46.819> blues<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.420> wouldn't<00:02:48.230> be<00:02:48.349> able<00:02:48.439> to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
to his two blues I wouldn't be able to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.990 
to his two blues I wouldn't be able to
legally<00:02:48.859> place<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.430> tile<00:02:49.670> now<00:02:49.849> there

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
legally place the tile now there

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.789 
legally place the tile now there
actually<00:02:50.269> is<00:02:50.389> a<00:02:50.420> bug<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.780> sometimes<00:02:51.590> happens

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
actually is a bug that sometimes happens

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.740 
actually is a bug that sometimes happens
with<00:02:52.159> this<00:02:52.310> app<00:02:52.549> that'll<00:02:53.150> actually<00:02:53.389> let<00:02:53.629> you

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
with this app that'll actually let you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.330 
with this app that'll actually let you
do<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.169> then<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.409> randomly<00:02:54.799> kicks<00:02:55.159> one

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
do that and then it randomly kicks one

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.500 
do that and then it randomly kicks one
of<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.489> pakodas<00:02:55.879> out<00:02:56.030> but<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.269> shouldn't

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
of the pakodas out but it shouldn't

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.789 
of the pakodas out but it shouldn't
really<00:02:56.540> let<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:56.930> do<00:02:57.079> that<00:02:57.230> according<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.650> the

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
really let you do that according to the

so I'm going to connect that kick him

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.640 
so I'm going to connect that kick him
out<00:04:14.000> of<00:04:14.180> there<00:04:14.419> and<00:04:14.659> watch<00:04:15.290> what's<00:04:15.470> going<00:04:15.560> to

happen might connect kick him out of
there<00:04:18.079> it's<00:04:18.199> going<00:04:18.289> to<00:04:18.380> double<00:04:18.680> that<00:04:18.709> up

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
there it's going to double that up

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.349 
there it's going to double that up
because<00:04:19.039> it's<00:04:19.280> larger<00:04:19.639> than<00:04:19.699> five<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.269> then

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
actually kicked his back out so he's now

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.360 
actually kicked his back out so he's now
got

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
got

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.100 
got
pagoda<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:29.000> he's<00:04:29.120> got<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.360> put<00:04:29.630> back<00:04:29.900> out

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
pagoda that he's got to put back out

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.900 
pagoda that he's got to put back out
onto<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.500> board<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.370> that's<00:04:31.669> pretty<00:04:31.790> much

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
onto the board and that's pretty much

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.430 
onto the board and that's pretty much
the<00:04:32.060> game<00:04:32.330> you're<00:04:32.510> just<00:04:32.660> trying<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.930> get<00:04:33.229> rid

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
the game you're just trying to get rid

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.590 
the game you're just trying to get rid
of<00:04:33.470> pagodas<00:04:34.040> try<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.580> sell<00:04:34.790> yourself<00:04:35.210> up<00:04:35.419> so

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
of pagodas try to sell yourself up so

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.659 
of pagodas try to sell yourself up so
that<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.840> can't<00:04:36.080> get<00:04:36.199> taken<00:04:36.560> over<00:04:36.680> maybe<00:04:37.340> drop

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
that you can't get taken over maybe drop

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.250 
that you can't get taken over maybe drop
other<00:04:37.850> colors<00:04:38.240> in<00:04:38.449> to<00:04:38.600> block<00:04:38.810> other<00:04:38.990> people

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
other colors in to block other people

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.540 
other colors in to block other people
from<00:04:39.380> building<00:04:39.710> up<00:04:39.770> some<00:04:39.979> of<00:04:40.040> these<00:04:40.130> larger

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
from building up some of these larger

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.060 
from building up some of these larger
areas<00:04:40.910> like<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.360> but<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.380> game<00:04:42.530> is<00:04:42.620> very<00:04:42.770> quick

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
areas like so but the game is very quick

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.760 
areas like so but the game is very quick
it's<00:04:43.310> very<00:04:43.490> light<00:04:44.080> it's<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.199> little<00:04:45.320> bit<00:04:45.470> luck

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
it's very light it's a little bit luck

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.350 
it's very light it's a little bit luck
base<00:04:46.040> because<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.669> ones<00:04:46.940> that<00:04:47.090> have<00:04:47.240> the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
base because the ones that have the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.270 
base because the ones that have the
double<00:04:47.690> colors<00:04:47.990> are<00:04:48.229> just<00:04:48.260> a<00:04:48.650> lot<00:04:48.830> better<00:04:48.979> than

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
double colors are just a lot better than

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.469 
double colors are just a lot better than
the<00:04:49.370> ones<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.760> you<00:04:49.850> can<00:04:49.970> see<00:04:50.120> here<00:04:50.300> have<00:04:50.449> a

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
the ones that you can see here have a

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.750 
the ones that you can see here have a
like<00:04:50.750> a<00:04:50.780> blue<00:04:51.260> and<00:04:51.290> a<00:04:51.560> yellow<00:04:51.770> you<00:04:52.460> know<00:04:52.580> those

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
like a blue and a yellow you know those

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.000 
like a blue and a yellow you know those
aren't<00:04:52.940> quite<00:04:53.300> as<00:04:53.330> easy<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.500> put<00:04:54.740> out<00:04:54.830> in<00:04:54.919> the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
aren't quite as easy to put out in the

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.040 
aren't quite as easy to put out in the
board<00:04:55.220> in<00:04:55.370> an<00:04:55.490> optimal<00:04:55.940> place<00:04:56.270> whereas<00:04:56.960> the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
board in an optimal place whereas the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.180 
board in an optimal place whereas the
doubles<00:04:57.380> you<00:04:57.470> can<00:04:57.590> usually<00:04:57.710> just<00:04:57.949> drop<00:04:58.160> a

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
doubles you can usually just drop a

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.010 
doubles you can usually just drop a
double<00:04:58.580> anywhere<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.270> get<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.419> pagoda<00:04:59.750> out

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
double anywhere and get a pagoda out

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.290 
double anywhere and get a pagoda out
yeah<00:05:00.979> I<00:05:01.010> think<00:05:01.220> this<00:05:01.280> might<00:05:01.460> be<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.639> nice<00:05:02.030> game

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
yeah I think this might be a nice game

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.420 
yeah I think this might be a nice game
to<00:05:02.449> play<00:05:02.570> with<00:05:02.810> my<00:05:02.960> wife<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.320> son<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:04.340> know

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
to play with my wife and son you know

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.070 
to play with my wife and son you know
they<00:05:04.550> like<00:05:04.699> ticket<00:05:05.000> to<00:05:05.090> Ryan<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.600> carcassonne

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
they like ticket to Ryan and carcassonne

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.779 
they like ticket to Ryan and carcassonne
I<00:05:06.139> think<00:05:06.530> this<00:05:06.650> is<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:06.800> nice<00:05:07.039> little<00:05:07.250> variation

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
I think this is a nice little variation

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.960 
I think this is a nice little variation
on<00:05:07.970> that<00:05:08.139> so<00:05:09.139> that's<00:05:09.320> kin<00:05:09.620> card<00:05:10.430> gin<00:05:10.729> or

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
on that so that's kin card gin or

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.500 
on that so that's kin card gin or
whatever<00:05:11.240> it's<00:05:11.389> called<00:05:11.500> thanks
