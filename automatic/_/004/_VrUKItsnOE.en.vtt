00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.160
 all right 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.160
 and 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.590
 party 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.260
 the day I upload this video I am 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.130
 birthday and yes I thought it was the one with you 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.140
 to fit 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.369
 this is not a decoration but is one 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.039
 do yourself with food 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.170
 I show you two simple Attendance 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.170
 so look bad luck if you like it 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.240
 work 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.240
 I have 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.160
 all right 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.950
 you need all of that, among other things 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.900
 and the rest you will have kitchen if 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.800
 you can also substitute the marshmallows 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.750
 I just use cookies because I want 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.090
 sometimes off 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.310
 start with glaze first i do it 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.770
 just with the tray and on your stand 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.930
 Just what far already but to 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.530
 marshmallow stuck to stick or one 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:17.400
 hearts song and then you go 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.400
 pour over it 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.049
 make sure everything is alright 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.270
 spread and possibly you can spoon 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.840
 use so that everything is smooth 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.840
 to spread 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.420
 then we have the marshmallow it 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.170
 cookie in the tip and I just use 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.020
 disco dip 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.119
 and another and then they look like this 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.569
 if you want to dry well you can use them 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:57.310
 put in a mug if you have a cookie 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.219
 used and if it is quite large 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.110
 you can understand it in 4 parts as it 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.759
 booklet consists of two parts you can get them 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.890
 take it apart 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.599
 then grab a straw and press it 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.119
 just flat with your fingers 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:14.829
 because that is already the replacement and then falls 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.329
 your cookies do n't break us up and like 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.870
 the other half does not sit so well 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.459
 dip it in the glaze and yes then 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.989
 stick it on again 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.660
 instead of putting the cookie in the dip 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.579
 it is better to just pat another one 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.079
 just grab it and it is there 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.150
 pour over it 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.290
 because that is somewhat easier and and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.290
 cookies a bit more vulnerable 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.180
 these creatures themselves are inspired by 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.799
 pinterest so maybe you have man 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.620
 Referring come but I wanted to 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.859
 show how you made it you have 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.859
 all needed 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.840
 first you cut two friends 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.700
 immediately so that you work four and 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.120
 after that you stick them on the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.120
 inside 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.580
 the Web 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.410
 I put your sweets in it or there 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.410
 you want to do healthy fruit 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:29.460
 and then we can set up a mess 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:31.260
 and you just have air for a little longer 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.690
 2 hours even I hope you like it 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.480
 for me they are not very difficult to 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.620
 So yes go work accompanied 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.780
