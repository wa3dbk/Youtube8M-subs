 in case they are not injured or none will run to the longest 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.100

 Within formats we will select one of the available 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.990
 and to its right the profile the quality 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.020
 for example the kilo we could leave in so much water in high quality to give

 let's see him as the bench for today 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600
 in so much quality 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.520
 then if we click on options 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.600
 there is an option that is particularly interesting to escape the team if the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.229
 process completed correctly this is because as the process takes a 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.709
 time if we're not going to be ahead of the computer when it ends then for 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.709
 that the computer knows itself well 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:17.019
 to give start the pro to the process oar crime convert 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:22.199
 and at this point I'm going to pose the video because it will take several minutes 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.149
 they were aware the process was completed 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:34.329
 if we click on 'pop' as it is said but they arrive without being able to open to the 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.089
 output folder 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.089
 showing the file that we have had 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.819
 notes that the central one that we have selected at this point 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.779
 It was like seeing the options are very simple and we hope you bring 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.079
 useful result in the future continuation
