00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
Auto in another game until we get to

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.770 
Auto in another game until we get to
Batman<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.730> probably<00:02:39.030> be<00:02:39.209> one<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.570> games

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
Batman and probably be one of the games

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.720 
Batman and probably be one of the games
before<00:02:39.959> Batman<00:02:40.320> go<00:02:40.650> we<00:02:40.770> got<00:02:40.890> two<00:02:41.070> games<00:02:41.340> and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
before Batman go we got two games and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.370 
before Batman go we got two games and
then<00:02:42.180> after<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.600> think<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> game's<00:02:43.110> kind

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
then after that I think the game's kind

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.980 
then after that I think the game's kind
of<00:02:43.470> start<00:02:43.680> flowing<00:02:44.270> again<00:02:45.270> we'll<00:02:45.780> have

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
of start flowing again we'll have

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.050 
of start flowing again we'll have
battlefield<00:02:47.209> we'll<00:02:48.209> have<00:02:48.420> Assassin's<00:02:49.380> Creed

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
battlefield we'll have Assassin's Creed

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.930 
battlefield we'll have Assassin's Creed
call<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.120> duty<00:02:51.890> then<00:02:52.890> we<00:02:52.980> get<00:02:53.130> into<00:02:53.250> watch<00:02:53.580> dogs

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
call of duty then we get into watch dogs

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
the videos in order and for example

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.530 
the videos in order and for example
let's<00:03:43.320> say<00:03:43.470> video<00:03:43.790> 3<00:03:44.790> gets<00:03:45.060> more<00:03:45.239> views<00:03:45.510> than

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
let's say video 3 gets more views than

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.210 
let's say video 3 gets more views than
video<00:03:45.930> number<00:03:46.080> two<00:03:46.380> it's<00:03:46.590> like<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:46.980> how<00:03:47.160> you

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
video number two it's like so how you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.810 
video number two it's like so how you
skip<00:03:47.580> video<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.239> how<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:48.930> skip<00:03:49.440> two<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.610> just

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
skip video to how you skip two and just

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.020 
skip video to how you skip two and just
go<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.060> three<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.480> don't<00:03:51.989> get<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.350> but<00:03:52.709> when<00:03:53.580> you

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
go to three I don't get it but when you
