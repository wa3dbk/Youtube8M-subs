00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:15.700
 hello everyone so I'm back 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:20.140
 I'm coming back with a video on the mask 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.820
 to the presle so that's so I think 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.390
 I will do it right away if I do not 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.250
 will never get out good so for 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.560
 start i'm already going to show you all 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.490
 the items I will need so 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.370
 already the presle so here I have the 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.000
 guys and it's not and still small 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.410
 grains but hey we'll do with 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.190
 so it looks like that's actually the 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.600
 so here's right next cd are 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:53.590
 flowers of Roman chamomile 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.840
 so since my presles are fine 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.400
 to be just at the level of quantity 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.190
 I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.259
 nettle powder that I had made so a 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.659
 soup spoon I think that will be enough 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:15.479
 so here you have argan oil so 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:21.460
 look good organic virgin oils 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.700
 you will need honey from the aloe 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.700

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:35.679

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.409

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.679
 I already put the chamomile to infuse 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.119
 So here it is already close to 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.060

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.710

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.620
