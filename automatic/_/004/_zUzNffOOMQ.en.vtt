00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:16.410
 hello let's make beans or beans 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.080
 red for its preparation we will need 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.350
 500 grams of beans that I put in 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.120
 Soak the night before 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:30.170
 2 onions 3 tomatoes a carrot 3 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:33.140
 garlic cloves a piece of bacon and 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.910
 seasoning we're going to use cumin is 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.790
 important also for this elaboration 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.739
 have a male banana but in my 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.470
 case is a bit difficult to find it like this 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.390
 I'm going to replace it with potatoes 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.110
 to start cutting the bacon out of this 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.940
 way then let's crack the banana 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.760
 male as I am doing with the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:59.550
 potatoes we grate the tomato 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.550
 we cut the onion and garlic in cubes 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.610
 and then we're going to toast the cumin in a 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.610
 pan over high heat for 5 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.790
 in the pot we are going to add 3 tablespoons 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.330
 of olive oil and let's start 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.940
 go then 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.750
 two minutes tornados to two minutes by 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.750
 the others and add the onion and garlic 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.570
 to bring with two minutes 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.800
 and we add the tomato 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.580
 we believed it for two minutes 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.850
 and we add the fried ones 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.730
 this is to avoid using the famous 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.400
 cubes 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.630
 which are only cholesterol and are very 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.630
 harmful to health 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.650
 then we are going to add the male banana or 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.350
 the potato the carrot 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.560
 we cover with water 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.570
 We boil once 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.780
 started to boil 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.020
 add a little salt and let's 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.540
 dismiss removing this fat in the part 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.590
 from above that is nothing but fat what 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.450
 I leave for 45 minutes over medium heat and 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.170
 then in the blender I will add the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.260
 cumin the carrot a case of the broth a 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.630
 case of beans and I'm going to make a puree 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.720
 I'm going to add this puree again to 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.330
 the first 2 months that are waiting 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.770
 about 15 more minutes to the beans 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:43.080
