00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.110 
out for that because that can make it
stiff<00:02:10.690> now<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.350> way<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.650> combat<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.520> is<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:12.910> use

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
stiff now the way I combat that is I use

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.780 
stiff now the way I combat that is I use
baby<00:02:13.480> powder<00:02:13.690> in<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.620> morning<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.130> sprinkle<00:02:15.670> it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
baby powder in the morning I sprinkle it

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.880 
baby powder in the morning I sprinkle it
on<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.240> comb<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.450> through<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.530> helps<00:02:17.830> to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
on and comb it through and that helps to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.610 
on and comb it through and that helps to
get<00:02:18.070> rid<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.460> some<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.030> shininess<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:20.140> it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
get rid of some of that shininess and it

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.410 
get rid of some of that shininess and it
absorbs<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.370> oil<00:02:21.730> that's<00:02:21.940> been<00:02:22.030> placed

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
absorbs that oil that's been placed

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.110 
absorbs that oil that's been placed

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
there until I can wash it about one more

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.090
