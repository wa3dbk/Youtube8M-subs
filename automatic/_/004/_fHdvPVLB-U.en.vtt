00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.320 
championship against temple st. Mary's
is<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.259> great<00:02:07.469> team

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
is a great team

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.600 
is a great team
team<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:08.900> has<00:02:08.990> won<00:02:09.020> 25<00:02:09.650> games<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:10.190> think<00:02:10.400> four

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
team that has won 25 games I think four

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.640 
team that has won 25 games I think four
out<00:02:10.729> of<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.910> last<00:02:10.970> six<00:02:11.360> seasons<00:02:11.570> they<00:02:12.440> have<00:02:12.560> an

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
out of the last six seasons they have an

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.260 
out of the last six seasons they have an
all-american<00:02:13.220> candidate<00:02:13.610> at<00:02:13.730> center<00:02:14.120> and

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
all-american candidate at center and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.300 
all-american candidate at center and
they<00:02:14.840> shoot<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> ball<00:02:15.350> extremely<00:02:15.530> well<00:02:16.010> from

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
they shoot the ball extremely well from

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.070 
they shoot the ball extremely well from
three-point<00:02:16.850> range<00:02:16.910> over<00:02:17.330> forty<00:02:17.630> percent<00:02:17.930> as

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
three-point range over forty percent as

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.770 
three-point range over forty percent as
a<00:02:18.140> team<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.880> know<00:02:20.000> they're<00:02:20.270> there<00:02:20.570> are<00:02:20.630> two

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
a team so you know they're there are two

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.940 
a team so you know they're there are two
things<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.230> we're<00:02:21.380> going<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.560> have<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.830> make

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
things and we're going to have to make

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.800 
things and we're going to have to make
sure<00:02:22.100> our<00:02:22.130> interior<00:02:22.730> defense<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.330> good<00:02:23.570> and

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
sure our interior defense is good and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.740 
sure our interior defense is good and
then<00:02:24.410> also<00:02:24.620> not<00:02:24.950> give<00:02:25.160> up<00:02:25.460> so<00:02:25.820> many<00:02:25.970> threes<00:02:26.420> I

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
then also not give up so many threes I

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.060 
then also not give up so many threes I
think<00:02:27.140> they<00:02:27.200> averaged<00:02:27.590> eight<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> half

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
think they averaged eight and a half

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.010 
think they averaged eight and a half
three-point<00:02:28.610> makes<00:02:28.760> per<00:02:29.030> game<00:02:29.240> so<00:02:29.540> they're

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
three-point makes per game so they're

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.680 
three-point makes per game so they're
very<00:02:30.320> very<00:02:30.530> dangerous<00:02:30.770> team<00:02:31.190> offensively<00:02:31.790> and

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
very very dangerous team offensively and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.180 
very very dangerous team offensively and
we've<00:02:32.870> been<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.050> very<00:02:33.260> good<00:02:33.410> team<00:02:33.590> defensively

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
we've been a very good team defensively

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.330 
we've been a very good team defensively
so<00:02:34.570> hopefully<00:02:35.570> we<00:02:36.020> can<00:02:36.200> guard<00:02:36.470> them<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.710> limit

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
so hopefully we can guard them and limit

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.740 
so hopefully we can guard them and limit
their<00:02:37.460> number<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.760> three-point<00:02:38.210> attempts<00:02:38.600> and

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
their number of three-point attempts and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.990 
their number of three-point attempts and
makes<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:40.160> give<00:02:40.310> ourselves<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.670> little<00:02:40.730> bit<00:02:40.910> of

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
makes to give ourselves a little bit of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.190 
makes to give ourselves a little bit of
control<00:02:41.330> in<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.510> game<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.990> talk<00:02:42.170> about

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
control in the game you talk about

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.560 
control in the game you talk about
success<00:02:42.740> defensively<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.460> defense<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.270> lot<00:02:44.390> of

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
success defensively and defense a lot of

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.810 
success defensively and defense a lot of
times<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:45.140> about<00:02:45.560> having<00:02:45.890> control<00:02:46.250> and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
times is about having control and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.030 
times is about having control and
discipline<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.630> read<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.380> have<00:02:48.590> just<00:02:48.740> one

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
discipline I read that you have just one

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.250 
discipline I read that you have just one
team<00:02:49.340> rule<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.209> quote<00:02:50.510> don't<00:02:51.020> be<00:02:51.230> a

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
team rule and it is quote don't be a

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.830 
team rule and it is quote don't be a
jerk<00:02:51.650> it's<00:02:52.310> kind<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.880> broad<00:02:53.060> statement<00:02:53.450> that

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
jerk it's kind of a broad statement that

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.480 
jerk it's kind of a broad statement that
one<00:02:53.990> of<00:02:54.080> your<00:02:54.230> players<00:02:54.440> game<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.190> give<00:02:55.340> us

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
one of your players game can you give us

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.160 
one of your players game can you give us
some<00:02:55.520> details<00:02:55.850> on<00:02:56.300> that<00:02:56.360> team<00:02:56.720> rule<00:02:57.340> well

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
some details on that team rule well

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.900 
some details on that team rule well
don't<00:03:00.170> be<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.380> jerk<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.860> then<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.490> then<00:03:01.700> I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
don't be a jerk and then and then I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.520 
don't be a jerk and then and then I
think<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:02.270> that<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.540> interpret<00:03:03.320> what

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
think it's that I interpret what

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.640 
think it's that I interpret what
behavior<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.310> manager<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.330> it's<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.410> little<00:03:06.530> bit

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
behavior is manager so it's a little bit

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.820 
behavior is manager so it's a little bit
subjective<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:08.660> know<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.080> guys<00:03:09.500> get<00:03:09.800> a

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
subjective and you know the guys get a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.260 
subjective and you know the guys get a
little<00:03:10.130> bit<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.340> an<00:03:10.430> idea<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.970> as<00:03:11.090> we<00:03:11.240> go

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
little bit of an idea of it as we go
