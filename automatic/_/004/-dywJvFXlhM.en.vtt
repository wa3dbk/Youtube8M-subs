like<00:00:14.470> out<00:00:14.650> here

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
like out here

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.000 
like out here
I<00:00:15.400> started<00:00:16.299> off<00:00:16.450> to<00:00:16.930> the<00:00:17.050> end<00:00:17.230> right<00:00:17.410> here<00:00:17.650> and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
I started off to the end right here and

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.530 
I started off to the end right here and
then<00:00:18.730> I<00:00:18.970> did<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:20.099> Hammad<00:00:21.099> in<00:00:21.669> the<00:00:21.880> back

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
then I did the Hammad in the back

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.249 
then I did the Hammad in the back
the<00:00:23.230> gearbox<00:00:23.500> mod<00:00:24.009> you<00:00:24.790> take<00:00:25.060> out<00:00:25.239> this<00:00:25.630> part

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
the gearbox mod you take out this part

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.440 
the gearbox mod you take out this part
right<00:00:26.470> there's<00:00:26.860> like<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.160> place<00:00:27.489> where<00:00:27.910> it

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
right there's like a place where it

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.979 
right there's like a place where it
spools<00:00:28.960> and<00:00:29.380> like<00:00:29.590> pulley<00:00:30.550> system<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.329> you

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
spools and like pulley system and you

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.740 
spools and like pulley system and you
can<00:00:32.169> take<00:00:32.380> out<00:00:32.529> the<00:00:32.590> bottom<00:00:33.420> rope

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
can take out the bottom rope

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.020 
can take out the bottom rope
so<00:00:35.410> this<00:00:36.309> comes<00:00:36.579> out<00:00:36.760> all<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.120> way<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.730> I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
so this comes out all the way and I

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.259 
so this comes out all the way and I
think<00:00:40.480> it's<00:00:40.629> just<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:40.960> little<00:00:41.109> bit<00:00:41.320> harder<00:00:41.739> I

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
think it's just a little bit harder I

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:52.410 
think it's just a little bit harder I
don't<00:00:43.269> know<00:00:43.859> but<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.820> pull<00:00:52.030> it<00:00:52.179> back<00:00:52.390> like

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
don't know but you pull it back like

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.669 
don't know but you pull it back like
five<00:00:52.960> times

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
five times

00:00:53.679 --> 00:01:54.020 
five times
it<00:00:53.859> locks<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:03.370> it<00:01:03.399> from<00:01:03.760> here<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:05.050> there<00:01:05.260> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:03.600
