of Dropbox now Windows Live SkyDrive the
thing<00:02:13.460> I<00:02:13.730> hate<00:02:13.760> about<00:02:14.450> Windows<00:02:15.080> Live<00:02:15.320> SkyDrive

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
thing I hate about Windows Live SkyDrive

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.390 
thing I hate about Windows Live SkyDrive
is<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:20.440> every<00:02:21.440> time<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.740> click<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.070> file

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
is this every time you click on a file

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.750 
is this every time you click on a file
right<00:02:24.880> then<00:02:25.880> watch<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.240> download<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:27.760> can't

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
right then watch the download it can't

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.720 
right then watch the download it can't
view<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.300> internet<00:02:29.630> browser<00:02:31.060> and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
view it in the internet browser and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.270 
view it in the internet browser and
another<00:02:34.730> bad<00:02:35.000> thing<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.650> if<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.830> want<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.130> add

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
another bad thing is if you want to add

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.790 
another bad thing is if you want to add
files<00:02:38.830> ship<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.980> click<00:02:40.160> on<00:02:40.280> add<00:02:40.580> files<00:02:41.090> on<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
files ship to click on add files on the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.340 
files ship to click on add files on the
internet<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:45.170> gotta<00:02:45.320> browse<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:46.100> upload<00:02:46.130> it

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.940 

then<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:51.500> click<00:02:51.710> upload<00:02:53.650> then<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.770> get<00:02:54.920> to

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
then you click upload then you get to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:06.150 
then you click upload then you get to
wait<00:02:55.130> while<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.400> uploads<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:02.110> there<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.170> go

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.670 

so<00:03:07.160> that's<00:03:07.580> what<00:03:07.940> i<00:03:07.970> don't<00:03:08.240> like<00:03:08.300> about

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
so that's what i don't like about

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.240 
so that's what i don't like about
SkyDrive
