leaving you with that zigzag part after

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.979 
leaving you with that zigzag part after
you<00:00:41.730> figure<00:00:42.000> out<00:00:42.059> which<00:00:42.329> part<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.840> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you figure out which part it is that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.240 
you figure out which part it is that
you'd<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.530> were<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
you'd like you were then going to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.220 
you'd like you were then going to
section<00:00:44.579> off<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.969> pieces<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.719> hair<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.020> either

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
order to keep the crisp blowing also to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
order to keep the crisp blowing also to

split the hair the front piece out and
you<00:01:00.090> went<00:01:00.239> from<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> quarter<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.050> an<00:01:01.109> inch

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you went from about a quarter of an inch

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.529 
you went from about a quarter of an inch
to<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.530> half<00:01:01.770> an<00:01:01.949> inch<00:01:02.070> you're<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.420> to

to a half an inch you're then going to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.260 
to a half an inch you're then going to
take<00:01:03.809> two<00:01:04.110> fingers<00:01:04.379> insert<00:01:05.309> them<00:01:05.549> inside<00:01:06.090> of

take two fingers insert them inside of
it<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.430> split<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> hair<00:01:08.760> into<00:01:09.030> three

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
it and split the hair into three

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.780 
it and split the hair into three
sections<00:01:10.290> try<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> make<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> sections<00:01:11.640> as

sections try to make the sections as

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.760 
sections try to make the sections as
equal<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.210> possible<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.409> find<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
equal as possible if you find the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.530 
equal as possible if you find the
section<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.250> isn't<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.760> equal<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.330> kind

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
section on isn't really equal just kind

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.359 
section on isn't really equal just kind
of<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.229> use<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.650> judgment<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.220> order

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.850 
of you know use your judgment in order
to<00:01:17.549> equal<00:01:17.909> them<00:01:18.030> out<00:01:18.210> you're<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.409> going<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to equal them out you're then going to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
to equal them out you're then going to
crisscross<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.670> strands<00:01:21.210> you're<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.900> to

crisscross the strands you're going to
go<00:01:22.140> underneath<00:01:23.299> rather<00:01:24.299> than<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.780> top<00:01:25.110> so

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
go underneath rather than on top so

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
go underneath rather than on top so
you're<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.430> continuously<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.479> from

still going to be swinging it underneath
so<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.220> does<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.790> actually<00:01:51.210> lifts

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
so what that does is it actually lifts

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.990 
so what that does is it actually lifts
the<00:01:51.689> braid<00:01:51.930> kind<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.189> off<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.700> scalp

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the braid kind of up and off the scalp

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.130 
the braid kind of up and off the scalp
and<00:01:54.240> almost<00:01:54.540> MIT<00:01:54.750> gives<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and almost MIT gives it a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.270 
and almost MIT gives it a
three-dimensional<00:01:55.590> kind<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.369> look<00:01:58.280> you're

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
three-dimensional kind of look you're

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.920 
three-dimensional kind of look you're
going<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.460> continue<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.119> all<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.479> way<00:02:00.630> back

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
going to continue this all the way back

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.609 
going to continue this all the way back
until<00:02:01.200> your<00:02:01.530> desired<00:02:02.420> braid<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.840> depending
