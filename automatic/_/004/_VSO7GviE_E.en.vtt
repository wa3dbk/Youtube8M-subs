and what I do is I snipe to less and
this<00:00:51.030> helps<00:00:51.360> me<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.890> know<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.190> can

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
sniping and you want to get a clip so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.830 
sniping and you want to get a clip so
you<00:00:59.550> need<00:00:59.699> your<00:00:59.850> aim<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> can

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
getting to 29 and making sure that the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.660 
getting to 29 and making sure that the
person<00:01:17.180> another<00:01:18.180> bot<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.810> only<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.549> you<00:01:20.549> know

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
has a lot fewer points than me so what

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
has a lot fewer points than me so what
you're<00:01:25.860> going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.880> clear

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you're going to do then is just clear

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.710 
you're going to do then is just clear
out<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:29.280> might<00:01:29.520> seem<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.000> bad<00:01:30.299> thing

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
out and this might seem like a bad thing

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.679 
out and this might seem like a bad thing
to<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.740> actually<00:01:32.180> really<00:01:33.180> fun<00:01:33.479> once

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
to do but it's actually really fun once

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.380 
to do but it's actually really fun once
you<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:33.960> into<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.490> what<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> do

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.380 
online so what
just<00:02:13.769> have<00:02:13.980> fun<00:02:14.250> with<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.580> i<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.790> figured<00:02:15.209> i

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
just have fun with it i just figured i

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.610 
just have fun with it i just figured i
just<00:02:15.569> thought<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.019> would<00:02:16.110> be<00:02:16.170> better<00:02:16.500> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
just thought that it would be better to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.309 
just thought that it would be better to
do<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.190> rather<00:02:17.790> than<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.629> on<00:02:18.659> capture<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
do this rather than go on capture the

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.229 
do this rather than go on capture the
flag<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.920> put<00:02:20.069> friendly<00:02:20.430> fire<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.849> put<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
flag and put friendly fire on put the

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.729 
flag and put friendly fire on put the
flag<00:02:21.420> where<00:02:21.599> you<00:02:21.690> want<00:02:21.900> switch<00:02:22.170> teams<00:02:22.440> and

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
flag where you want switch teams and

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.410 
flag where you want switch teams and
then<00:02:23.220> they<00:02:23.340> don't<00:02:23.489> even<00:02:23.610> shoot<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.090> they<00:02:24.239> just

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
then they don't even shoot you they just

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.509 
then they don't even shoot you they just
stand<00:02:24.690> there<00:02:24.810> waiting<00:02:25.080> for<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.409> to<00:02:25.440> go<00:02:25.739> this

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
stand there waiting for you to go this

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.100 
stand there waiting for you to go this
is<00:02:26.700> better<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.180> you're<00:02:27.540> trying<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.959> hit<00:02:28.080> a

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.289 
is better because you're trying to hit a
shot<00:02:28.409> as<00:02:28.560> fast<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:28.980> possible<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.700> you're

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
shot as fast as possible and you're

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.900 
shot as fast as possible and you're
trying<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.690> hit<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> shot<00:02:31.110> on<00:02:31.349> someone<00:02:32.310> who<00:02:32.489> is

someone who is actually shooting at you

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.000 
someone who is actually shooting at you
now<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.450> know<00:02:37.049> some<00:02:37.319> people<00:02:37.349> might<00:02:37.650> say<00:02:37.709> that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
now I know some people might say that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.190 
now I know some people might say that
this<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> same<00:02:38.610> as<00:02:38.819> going<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.720> Team

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
this is the same as going on Team

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.890 
this is the same as going on Team
Deathmatch<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.970> putting<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.269> difficulty<00:02:42.780> on

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
Deathmatch and putting the difficulty on

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.479 
Deathmatch and putting the difficulty on
the<00:02:43.019> same<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.680> being<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.129> by<00:02:44.310> yourself

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
the same and just being you by yourself

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.460 
the same and just being you by yourself
and<00:02:44.819> go<00:02:44.940> against<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.420> enemy<00:02:45.660> team<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.049> that's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
and go against the enemy team and that's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.500 
and go against the enemy team and that's
true<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.980> can<00:02:47.310> be<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.579> same<00:02:47.730> but<00:02:48.269> here

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
true that can be the same but here

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.390 
true that can be the same but here
you're<00:02:48.690> trying<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.019> go<00:02:49.140> against<00:02:49.829> multiple

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you're trying to go against multiple

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.069 
you're trying to go against multiple
enemies<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.060> they're<00:02:51.299> going<00:02:51.750> against

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
enemies and they're going against

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.400 
enemies and they're going against
themselves<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.840> know<00:02:54.870> everyone's

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
themselves and so you know everyone's

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.130 
themselves and so you know everyone's
for<00:02:55.620> themselves<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.310> that's<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.060> basic<00:02:57.540> way

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
for themselves and that's the basic way

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.110 
for themselves and that's the basic way
of<00:02:58.170> free<00:02:58.470> throw<00:02:58.709> which<00:02:59.340> makes<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.670> even<00:02:59.790> harder

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
of free throw which makes it even harder

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.059 
of free throw which makes it even harder
because<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.930> makes<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.379> easier<00:03:01.680> for<00:03:01.890> them<00:03:02.010> to

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
because it makes it easier for them to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.119 
because it makes it easier for them to
climb<00:03:02.519> up<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:03.060> your<00:03:03.090> score<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:03.930> kill<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:05.069> they

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
climb up to your score and kill and they

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.530 
climb up to your score and kill and they
don't<00:03:05.459> have<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.760> kill<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.090> they<00:03:06.239> can<00:03:06.390> just

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
don't have to kill you they can just

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.949 
don't have to kill you they can just
kill<00:03:06.690> other<00:03:06.840> people<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.879> rack<00:03:08.879> up<00:03:08.910> points<00:03:09.329> and

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
kill other people and rack up points and

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.339 
kill other people and rack up points and
get<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.519> 30<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.730> win<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> match<00:03:12.269> now<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.049> did

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
get to 30 and win the match now I did

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.890 
get to 30 and win the match now I did
cut<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.709> off<00:03:13.829> because<00:03:14.099> something<00:03:14.900> something

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
cut it off because something something

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.949 
cut it off because something something
