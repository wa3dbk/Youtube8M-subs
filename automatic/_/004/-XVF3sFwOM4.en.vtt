00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Playstation 4 is more powerful than Xbox 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.220
 one on paper although this is not something 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.110
 necessarily bad in the previous 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.870
 generation you have to remember that although 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.099
 playstation3 was more powerful than xbox 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.809
 360 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.510
 the graphic differences were not so 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.640
 important remember that I talk about games 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.410
 multiplatform because the games 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.900
 exclusive tend to squeeze the most 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.810
 the resources of each console and so 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.000
 so much the comparisons are not I do not know 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.040
 how to say it are not so valid that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 playstation 4 are more powerful on the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.360
 paper that xbox one can finish 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.290
 meaning that video games 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.300
 multiplatform that go out to what 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.820
 throughout the generation have better 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.370
 graphics or better performance that is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.760
 more frame rate per second is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.340
 say more pts is on playstation 4 than the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.289
 xbox one for this I have prepared the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.210
 next comparative table so that 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.329
 Everyone knows the differences 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.340
 techniques between both consoles remember 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.590
 that we are talking about paper and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.180
 that all these are assumptions can 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.820
 have developers that do 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.580
 a better video game we are talking about 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.610
 graphic quality for xbox one that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.200
 playstation 4 even if it is multiplatform 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.520
 we are talking about paper 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.340
 this is important that you have it in 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.100
 mind the two consoles both consoles 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.990
 they mount a very similar cpu actually 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.090
 it's practically the same the two have 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.500
 eight cores and eight processes so 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.950
 so much the difference is in the speed 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.630
 of that cpu the speed of xbox one is 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.840
 slightly higher than the playstation 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.180
 4 as we can see in image 175 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.360
 gigahertz per core in the case of the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.790
 xbox one against 1 6 gigahertz per 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.729
 core in the case of playstation 4 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.220
 this increase in the speed of xbox 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.610
 one is because microsoft decided 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.200
 overclock on doing an overclocking of the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.660
 speed of your cpu so you can do 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.149
 front to be able to fight one more battle 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.580
 fierce with playstation 4 in 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.410
 terms of performance we also have 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.360
 to remember that the speed of the cpu 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.510
 overclocking the speed of the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.890
 cpu can cause problems 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.940
 temperature is to say problems of 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.710
 heaters your video high is of 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.690
 temperature therefore that can 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.000
 impact on the life of the console 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.310
 I repeat again that we are talking about 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.850
 suppositions assumptions and that everything 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.980
 this is on paper very well let's 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.140
 talk about the nuclei of the gpu and by 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.230
 so much of the graphic memory in this 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.700
 case the xbox one has 768 cores of 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.730
 gpu against the 1,152 of the ps4 is spoken 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.940
 that comparatively the both consoles 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.180
 could be equated with an average of 7 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.270
 thousand 707 thousand 800 in the case of the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.160
 playstation 4 and 7 thousand 700 in the case of 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.790
 xbox one remember that these are 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.720
 assumptions in terms of operations 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.940
 per second 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.100
 xbox one comes out losing against 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.970
 playstation 4 123 after flaps versus 184 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.850
 teraflops and here comes the great 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.400
 difference in ram memory in this 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.440
 case both consoles mount 8 gigas of 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.770
 memory but the difference is in the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.020
 true 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.070
 as we can see in the table and xbox one 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.940
 has 2 thousand 133 megahertz of memory 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:28.750
 ram ddr3 and playstation 45 thousand 500 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.170
 megahertz ram memory gddr5 the 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.300
 gddr5 ram memory is superior to that of 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.790
 r3 although it also supposes a greater 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.100
 electricity consumption therefore 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.840
 also a greater warming will have to 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.120
 see if the design of the playstation 4 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.910
 can cope with increases in 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.440
 console temperature this is something 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.820
 important since nobody wants the 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.800
 console is spoiled by 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.470
 overheating we also have to 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.960
 remember that playstation 4 mounts inside 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.970
 from the console itself the transformer in 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.830
 change to xbox one we have to add 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.750
 a piece of transformer that really 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.340
 it's pretty big that it will go outside the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.770
 console 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.990
 the xbox one mounts a memory that ram of 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.300
 32 megabytes that in theory has been created 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.250
 to help the developers though 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.040
 this is quite to confirm since 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.989
 can cause other problems because 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.420
 the developers would have to deal with 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.370
 with a little auxiliary memory 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.010
 capacity 32 megs 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.389
 capacity although this memory is 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.340
 fucking fast and sorry for the 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.260
 expression but it's very fast in 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.010
 terms of bandwidth and xbox one 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.760
 it has 68 3 gigas per second and 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.380
 playstation 476 gigas per second about 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.090
 the paper the differences are pretty 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.340
 important in terms of 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.070
 internal storage both have 500 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.870
 gigabytes of hdd and the rest 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.840
 characteristics are what everyone already 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.850
 probably know in terms of 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.220
 retro retrocompatibility and this is 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.030
 important xbox one does not have it and in pc 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.419
 4 are going to assemble a system in the cloud that 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.090
 Gaikai is called to be keita and 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.010
 aica and it's going to be a kind of say 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.990
 we are going to play via streaming 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.120
 basically what is going to happen is that 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.250
 in the sony servers is going to be 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.320
 rendering a video game and to us 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.229
 we are going to send the image of being 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.690
 video game rendered in the cloud to 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.660
 our consoles that's how we can 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:26.000
 play playstation 3 video games in 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.680
 principle the other characteristics are 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.300
 relatively important is the most 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.700
 important is the subscription service 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.260
 in xbox one we still have the xbox 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.000
 live that you have to pay and playstation 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.710
 4 and this is a difference 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.990
 quite important with the playstation3 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.230
 now we will have a mandatory service 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.560
 of payment if we want to play online there 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:48.290
 several offers and if you buy them with or without 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.140
 you have a free year of playstation plus 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:54.260
 if the normal shopping I think you have a 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:57.560
 free month of playstation plus then there's 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.680
 to pay I think there are about 49 is to say 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.100
 50 euros per year to renew the 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.900
 subscription to play online 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.060
 although playstation 4 is on paper 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.830
 more powerful than xbox one in the end what 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.169
 really important and that's always what 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.540
 I say is the catalog of video games that 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.370
 will have each one because it does not help 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.500
 that a console is double or triple 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.720
 of powerful that the other if the games that 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.730
 they come out for her we do not like them so in 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.040
 reality the playstation 4 war 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.840
 against xbox one will be based on the 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.820
 quality of the titles that come out for 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.070
 these and not so much in the hardware that 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.300
 they assemble or the technology they have in their 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.220
 bowels 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.199
 add that the two consoles seem to me 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.990
 great and that the ideal would be to be 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:41.300
 enjoy them both with their pros and their 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.669
 cons even though I see a problem a 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.159
 unimportant in xbox one and it is that it is 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:49.639
 one hundred euros more expensive than playstation 4 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:52.370
 because xbox one includes standard kinect 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.379
 that may be that you like it or 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.240
 Do not like that, it's going to taste for each 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:57.830
 one although under my point of view and 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.659
 remember this is my opinion can be 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.879
 that you share it or not to me kinect 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:04.669
 honestly I'm not interested I do not want 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:08.150
 play by moving the arms but 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:10.819
 I prefer a command that and each one decides 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.860
 what you want though this video only 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:15.860
 intended to make us see that about the 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.379
 PlayStation 4 paper is more powerful than 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.620
 xbox one that's a reality does not make 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:23.509
 lack deny nothing happens so you can 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.340
 be that the differences are very large 

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:28.009
 throughout the generation or it can be 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:31.190
 that nothing happens and everything remains with the 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:34.639
 same stupid fight that was fought against 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:37.460
 when it came out, sorry, playstation3 against 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.020
 xbox 360 so good guys like 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.729
 I always end with a question 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.710
 others which one you like the most 

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:45.710
 bought either one of the two or buy 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.419
 that some this Christmas as a gift if 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.889
 you liked this video of at least 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:50.810
 it's down here if you're new to me 

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:55.030
 channel you can subscribe I upload a video 

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.030
 every day and see you in the next video
