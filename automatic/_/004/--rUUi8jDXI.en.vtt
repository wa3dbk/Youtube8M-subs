CB galaxy radios released a new radio

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.950 
CB galaxy radios released a new radio
the<00:00:09.300> galaxy<00:00:09.809> DX<00:00:10.200> 99<00:00:10.860> v2<00:00:11.540> now<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:12.750> they've

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
the galaxy DX 99 v2 now what they've

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.160 
the galaxy DX 99 v2 now what they've
done<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.679> answer<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.370> call<00:00:14.719> you<00:00:15.719> have<00:00:15.870> had<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
done is as answer to call you have had a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.340 
done is as answer to call you have had a
long<00:00:17.039> time<00:00:17.400> now<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.670> galaxy's<00:00:18.449> sideband

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
long time now that galaxy's sideband

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.580 
long time now that galaxy's sideband
radios<00:00:19.770> were<00:00:20.520> all<00:00:20.760> high-power<00:00:21.270> ever<00:00:22.260> since

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
radios were all high-power ever since

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.960 
radios were all high-power ever since
the<00:00:22.769> loss<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.310> 99<00:00:23.820> oh<00:00:24.949> yeah<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> was<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.400> 94

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the loss of the 99 oh yeah I was in 94

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.870 
the loss of the 99 oh yeah I was in 94
and<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:29.330> 98<00:00:30.330> VHB<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.320> were<00:00:31.610> side<00:00:32.610> being

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and the 98 VHB that were side being

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.160 
and the 98 VHB that were side being
capable<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.600> were<00:00:33.719> both<00:00:33.899> higher

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
capable and they were both higher

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590 
capable and they were both higher
powered<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.160> lot<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.790> application<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
powered so a lot of application and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.180 
powered so a lot of application and
people<00:00:36.870> couldn't<00:00:37.140> use<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.320> radio<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.100> there

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
people couldn't use that radio for there

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.520 
people couldn't use that radio for there
was<00:00:38.280> too<00:00:38.460> high<00:00:38.610> power<00:00:38.989> so<00:00:39.989> now<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
was too high power so now we have a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.959 
was too high power so now we have a
revisited<00:00:41.219> 99<00:00:41.730> v2<00:00:42.860> this<00:00:43.860> brings<00:00:44.160> sideband<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
revisited 99 v2 this brings sideband to

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.010 
revisited 99 v2 this brings sideband to
a<00:00:45.000> lower<00:00:45.300> 30<00:00:45.690> 40<00:00:46.079> watt<00:00:46.260> range<00:00:47.539> like<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.719> used<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
a lower 30 40 watt range like we used to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.229 
a lower 30 40 watt range like we used to
have<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.469> now<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:50.219> they've<00:00:50.399> decided<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.940> use

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
have and now what they've decided to use

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.069 
have and now what they've decided to use
is<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> chassis<00:00:52.379> from<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.890> 98<00:00:53.399> bhp<00:00:53.809> they<00:00:54.809> feel

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
is the chassis from the 98 bhp they feel

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.430 
is the chassis from the 98 bhp they feel
that<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:55.350> been<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> very<00:00:55.770> high<00:00:56.190> reliability

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
that that's been a very high reliability

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.950 
that that's been a very high reliability
high<00:00:58.440> quality<00:00:59.270> that<00:01:00.270> really<00:01:00.300> feel<00:01:00.719> good<00:01:00.899> about

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
high quality that really feel good about

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810 
high quality that really feel good about
the<00:01:01.260> receiver<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> other<00:01:02.070> parts<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.730> that

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the receiver and other parts of that

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.620 
the receiver and other parts of that
radio<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.700> they<00:01:05.700> brought<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.180> into<00:01:06.510> this

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
radio so they brought that into this

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.510 
radio so they brought that into this
radio<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:07.200> well<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.619> now<00:01:07.770> you've<00:01:07.920> got<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.220> choice

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
radio as well so now you've got a choice

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.320 
radio as well so now you've got a choice
of<00:01:08.820> three<00:01:09.030> chassis<00:01:09.439> all<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.909> same<00:01:12.090> high

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
of three chassis all all the same high

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.690 
of three chassis all all the same high
quality<00:01:12.360> chassis<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.710> 40<00:01:14.490> Watts

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
quality chassis you can have 40 Watts

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.210 
quality chassis you can have 40 Watts
100<00:01:15.299> watts<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:16.380> 200<00:01:16.920> Watts<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
100 watts or 200 Watts so you have the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.320 
100 watts or 200 Watts so you have the
99<00:01:20.820> V<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.990> 94<00:01:22.530> HP<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> 98<00:01:23.820> v<00:01:24.150> HP

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
99 V the 94 HP and the 98 v HP

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.320 
99 V the 94 HP and the 98 v HP
respectively<00:01:25.700> okay<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.759> let's<00:01:27.090> talk<00:01:27.270> about

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
respectively okay so let's talk about

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.980 
respectively okay so let's talk about
this<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> 99<00:01:28.740> V<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.750> few<00:01:30.750> switches

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this one here the 99 V to few switches

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
this one here the 99 V to few switches
and<00:01:31.320> stuff<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> little<00:01:32.250> different<00:01:32.670> than

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and stuff are a little different than

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.760 
and stuff are a little different than
what<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.060> used<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:34.110> we've<00:01:34.320> got<00:01:34.530> eight

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
what you used to now we've got eight

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.090 
what you used to now we've got eight
bands<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.640> 40<00:01:36.210> channels<00:01:38.689> echo<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.990> delay<00:01:40.799> time

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
bands of 40 channels echo and delay time

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.510 
bands of 40 channels echo and delay time
right<00:01:41.400> up<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> top<00:01:43.189> underneath<00:01:44.189> here

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
right up here on the top underneath here

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.520 
right up here on the top underneath here
is<00:01:44.700> our<00:01:45.470> SWR<00:01:46.470> meter<00:01:46.500> selection<00:01:48.140> if<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:49.380> it's
