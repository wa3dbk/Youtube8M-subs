00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
know I've had to give a definite answer

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.080 
know I've had to give a definite answer
I'd<00:01:24.030> say<00:01:24.270> he<00:01:24.650> is<00:01:25.650> probably<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.400> towards<00:01:27.000> his

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
I'd say he is probably in towards his

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.370 
I'd say he is probably in towards his
end<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.930> win<00:01:28.049> another<00:01:28.140> one

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
end but I think you can win another one

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.690 
end but I think you can win another one
or<00:01:28.500> two<00:01:28.530> slams<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.189> that'll<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.520> more

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
or two slams I think that'll be more

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
or two slams I think that'll be more
important<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.180> him<00:01:30.329> than<00:01:30.439> their<00:01:31.439> being<00:01:31.770> number

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
important to him than their being number

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.480 
important to him than their being number
