00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.700 
to have some idea about where this is
coming<00:02:05.560> from<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.460> can<00:02:06.789> deal<00:02:07.179> with<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
coming from so you can deal with the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.460 
coming from so you can deal with the
causal<00:02:09.310> elements<00:02:09.490> of<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.149> now<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.630> increased

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
causal elements of it now it increased

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.500 
causal elements of it now it increased
when<00:02:11.709> you<00:02:11.800> had<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.130> baby<00:02:12.310> yes<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.030> there's

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
when you had the baby yes and there's

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.750 
when you had the baby yes and there's
been<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> division<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.319> attention<00:02:14.800> yes<00:02:15.430> at<00:02:15.700> that

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
been a division of attention yes at that

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.630 
been a division of attention yes at that
point<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.540> does<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.350> seem<00:02:17.740> logical<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.370> this

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
point so does it seem logical that this

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.809 
point so does it seem logical that this
may<00:02:18.819> be<00:02:18.880> attention-getting<00:02:19.780> behavior<00:02:20.819> that

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
may be attention-getting behavior that

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:22.850 
may be attention-getting behavior that
he's<00:02:21.940> doing<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.390> get<00:02:22.540> your<00:02:22.690> attention

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
he's doing it to get your attention

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.800 
he's doing it to get your attention
because<00:02:23.860> he<00:02:23.980> was<00:02:24.100> an<00:02:24.250> only<00:02:24.430> child<00:02:24.550> now<00:02:25.510> all<00:02:25.750> of

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
because he was an only child now all of

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.300 
because he was an only child now all of
a<00:02:25.840> sudden<00:02:25.870> here's<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.530> little<00:02:26.740> bundle<00:02:27.220> of

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
a sudden here's this little bundle of

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.750 
a sudden here's this little bundle of
joy<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.819> he<00:02:28.480> starts<00:02:28.810> throwing<00:02:28.990> tantrums<00:02:29.760> well

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
joy and he starts throwing tantrums well

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.750 
joy and he starts throwing tantrums well
I<00:02:31.030> can<00:02:31.450> connect<00:02:31.810> those<00:02:31.990> dots<00:02:32.050> yes<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.310> that

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
I can connect those dots yes and that

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.610 
I can connect those dots yes and that
seems<00:02:34.030> pretty<00:02:34.240> obvious<00:02:34.360> then<00:02:34.840> when<00:02:35.200> his<00:02:35.319> dad's

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
seems pretty obvious then when his dad's

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.130 
seems pretty obvious then when his dad's
home<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.880> doesn't<00:02:37.300> happen<00:02:37.480> as<00:02:37.720> much<00:02:37.750> which

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
home it doesn't happen as much which

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.559 
home it doesn't happen as much which
could<00:02:38.349> be<00:02:38.500> one<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.709> two<00:02:38.830> things<00:02:38.980> either<00:02:39.580> he

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
could be one of two things either he

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.820 
could be one of two things either he
doesn't<00:02:40.840> think<00:02:40.900> he<00:02:41.050> can<00:02:41.170> get<00:02:41.260> away<00:02:41.470> with<00:02:41.680> it

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
doesn't think he can get away with it

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.230 
doesn't think he can get away with it
with<00:02:41.950> his<00:02:42.069> dad<00:02:42.390> or<00:02:43.650> there's<00:02:44.650> now<00:02:45.240> double

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
with his dad or there's now double

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.290 
with his dad or there's now double
people<00:02:46.720> there<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.380> provide<00:02:47.709> attention<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:49.000> he

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
people there to provide attention so he

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.720 
people there to provide attention so he
doesn't<00:02:49.720> feel<00:02:50.020> deprived<00:02:50.560> quite<00:02:51.070> as<00:02:51.250> much<00:02:51.490> and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
doesn't feel deprived quite as much and

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.280 
doesn't feel deprived quite as much and
it<00:02:51.790> could<00:02:51.970> be<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.120> combination<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> two<00:02:53.080> so

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
it could be a combination of the two so

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.920 
it could be a combination of the two so
you<00:02:53.620> need<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:53.890> think<00:02:54.100> about<00:02:54.220> those<00:02:54.520> things

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
you need to think about those things

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.920 
you need to think about those things
so<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.319> prevention<00:02:55.849> it's<00:02:56.849> possible<00:02:57.599> that

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
so in the prevention it's possible that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.929 
so in the prevention it's possible that
you<00:02:58.530> may<00:02:58.980> want<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> hear<00:02:59.459> some<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.819> things

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
you may want to hear some of the things

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.240 
you may want to hear some of the things

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
and giving him the attention so he

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.399 
and giving him the attention so he
