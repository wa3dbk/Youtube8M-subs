00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.230
 other less lethal species have also attacked their appearance to appear 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.230
 dead leaves 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.249
 we have the butterfly leaf 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.979
 all over the planet many butterflies survive thanks to their leaf aspect 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.669
 none of his enemies without interest in dead leaves 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.400
 the rakitic soy butterflies can be seen with open wings 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 they usually do it just before they fly 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.220
 few animals have come to possess a camouflage as perfect as the insect 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.980
 South East Asia 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.830
 these insects look so much like their environment that there is almost no way to 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.970
 distinguish those of a fine jama 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.480
 even in the smallest details 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.910
 like false cracks in its supposed crust and spots that mimic the mosquito and 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.520
 the lichens 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.800
 even up close it is difficult to determine which end of this insect is the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.020
 head 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.200
 however its camouflage is a defense against predators 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.490
 the insect stick this getaria not 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.150
 while some animals survive indicating dead jas 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.420
 others manage to look like green leaves with such perfection that they do not 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 distinguish even centimeters away 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.310
 the disguise of these insects has gone beyond its leaf appearance 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.800
 they have even adapted their movements to simulate the movements caused 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.059
 by the wind 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.779
 when farinÃ³s move at the same time it's as if you for plant 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.779
 was affected by a non-existent breeze 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.060
 for millions of years these insects have been developing the skills 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.450
 necessary to survive in a tropical jungle and full of predators 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.619
 they are undoubtedly a supreme example of evolutionary success 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.719
 when the traveling leaves decide to move their expeditions do not usually pass 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.719
 of the distance needed to find fresh food 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.019
 they spend virtually their entire lives virtually immobile and rarely go out to 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:49.629
 discovered
