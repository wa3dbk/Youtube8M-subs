more opportunity have it to mess up and

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.830 
more opportunity have it to mess up and
therefore<00:01:23.070> may<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.640> back<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.060> yeah<00:01:24.420> that's

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
therefore may be back in yeah that's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.910 
therefore may be back in yeah that's
what<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.049> expecting<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
what I was expecting just because it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.810 
what I was expecting just because it
might<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.130> been<00:01:26.189> look<00:01:26.340> stronger<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
might have been look stronger but it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.859 
might have been look stronger but it
seems<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> announcement<00:01:27.509> shaded<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> way

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
seems like the announcement shaded a way

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.940 
seems like the announcement shaded a way
better<00:01:27.990> angle<00:01:28.290> regardless<00:01:28.650> he's<00:01:28.799> nerdy

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
better angle regardless he's nerdy

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.140 
better angle regardless he's nerdy
