00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
game and they've never been that blown

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.999 
game and they've never been that blown
away<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.750> that's<00:00:12.900> where<00:00:13.110> my<00:00:13.230> problem<00:00:13.410> starts

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
away and that's where my problem starts

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.369 
away and that's where my problem starts
here<00:00:14.219> BioShock<00:00:15.179> Infinite<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.289> would

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
here BioShock Infinite is what I would

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.340 
here BioShock Infinite is what I would
call<00:00:16.619> hyper<00:00:17.100> violent<00:00:17.750> majority<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.990> what<00:00:19.320> you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
call hyper violent majority of what you

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.220 
call hyper violent majority of what you
do<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.220> game<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.789> kill<00:00:21.210> people<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:22.080> my

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
do in this game is kill people so my

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.189 
do in this game is kill people so my
first<00:00:22.560> issue<00:00:22.859> here<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.269> there<00:00:24.630> are<00:00:24.779> two

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
first issue here is that there are two

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.009 
first issue here is that there are two
separate<00:00:25.890> stories<00:00:26.250> happening<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.269> there's

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.070 
separate stories happening and there's
such<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.680> huge<00:00:29.099> disconnect<00:00:29.670> there<00:00:30.119> there's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
such a huge disconnect there there's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.900 
such a huge disconnect there there's
this<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.650> story<00:00:32.009> which<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.610> what<00:00:32.759> your

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
different thing so this is to massively

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
different thing so this is to massively
different<00:01:08.610> sequences<00:01:09.210> happening<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.810> they

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
different sequences happening and they

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
different sequences happening and they
try<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.290> tell<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.640> should<00:01:11.820> be

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
try to tell you that you should be

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.289 
try to tell you that you should be
invested<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.270> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
invested in the other one the one that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
invested in the other one the one that
you<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.840> spend<00:01:16.200> most<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.680> time<00:01:16.799> doing

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
you don't spend most of your time doing

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.539 
you don't spend most of your time doing
in<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> game<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> felt<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.979> huge

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
in the game so I felt this huge

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.179 
in the game so I felt this huge
disconnect<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> also<00:01:22.409> had<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> massive

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
disconnect but I also had a massive

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.950 
disconnect but I also had a massive
issue<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> combat<00:01:24.090> feeling<00:01:24.479> extremely

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
issue with the combat feeling extremely

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.350 
issue with the combat feeling extremely
unnecessary<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> result<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.790> guess

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
unnecessary as a result of this I guess

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.539 
unnecessary as a result of this I guess
this<00:01:27.509> only<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:28.530> came<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.070> light<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.430> me

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
this only really came to light with me

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.819 
this only really came to light with me
when<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> played<00:01:30.090> burial<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.750> sea<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.470> burial

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
when I played burial at sea the burial

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.319 
when I played burial at sea the burial
at<00:01:31.950> sea<00:01:31.979> only<00:01:32.460> goes<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:32.939> about<00:01:33.000> four<00:01:33.299> hours

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
at sea only goes for about four hours

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.140 
at sea only goes for about four hours
and<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.770> actual<00:01:35.189> plot<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:36.479> burial<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.229> sea<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
and the actual plot in burial at sea is

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.350 
and the actual plot in burial at sea is
almost<00:01:39.150> equally<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.229> satisfying<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.490> plot

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
almost equally as satisfying as the plot

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.539 
almost equally as satisfying as the plot
in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> entirety<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.439> BioShock<00:01:44.130> Infinite

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
in the entirety of BioShock Infinite

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.819 
in the entirety of BioShock Infinite
so<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.880> sat<00:01:45.180> down<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.360> was<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.600> okay<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.560> did<00:01:46.710> I

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
so I sat down I was like okay what did I

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.389 
so I sat down I was like okay what did I
do<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.420> other<00:01:48.570> 10<00:01:49.049> hours<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.829> BioShock

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
do in the other 10 hours of BioShock

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.490 
do in the other 10 hours of BioShock
Infinite<00:01:50.549> when<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.329> wasn't<00:01:51.840> being<00:01:52.110> strung

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
Infinite when I wasn't being strung

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.539 
Infinite when I wasn't being strung
along<00:01:52.530> by<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.610> plot<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.710> actually<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.340> in

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
along by a plot all you actually do in
