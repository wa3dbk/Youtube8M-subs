00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Hmm 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.100
 Be alive 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.990
 I ate such gas for the first time yesterday night 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.110
 Hmm 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.110
 Fruits 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.270
 To do so but is distinguished service to do me goo put those cola on the occasion of nars 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.510
 And that 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:34.790
 I can really do raw ice cream 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.560
 I'd guess the point of also have baldur think so 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.880
 And I bought a little Parara 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:46.870
 You are also Tan made using another 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.870
 I wonder why I had a face now my stomach is not well 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.700
 It is feeling 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.060
 During that 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:00.070
 I think that we want to predict the Sapporo 2-year-old Stakes 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:05.640
 Please give me my predictions this time 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.640
 We think that we want to purchase six ways of three in a row this time 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.159
 This point is good 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.579
 My panel created 3 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:19.670
 Well this racer anyway No. 1 popularity of horse 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:22.950
 And at a pace that comes into play in the betting in this No. 1 is the likely to be popular my nail create 3 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.200
 After that I think the kana Mickey universe 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.760
 Although the Shin'umasei of Mickey universe is hurt I also look at local 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.030
 Pretty strong 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.650
 It was 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.830
 Because I almost fell into without following 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.350
 Anyway I thought it was a ratification 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.310
 Hmm 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:48.990
 I was very lost in the race but this race carrier 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:53.950
 The and after the point Rentai rate is very good of the piece, especially in recent years are aligned the tongue award 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.250
 There is also a case that the winning horse often gets involved in the betting ticket 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.770
 People of Maine successor 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.310
 I thought that I would infringe 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.230
 One duck 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.800
 This is my best choice 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.560
 It is an alien 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.560
 Anyway, how to win the New Horse Battle is extremely 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.590
 It was deep strength 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:23.310
 Listen to the 16th large outline 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:25.150
 Though I had been Hashirasa the all the time about five equal parts you out from the start by pulling 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.010
 It is the last of 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.280
 In roll up slightly in the adoption corner 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:37.120
 Go up 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.300
 The last is victory by putting two 3rds in a comfortable position 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.530
 It was Cho 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:47.700
 At this time, the tour will be sticky 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.210
 I had nominated secretly at 8 o'clock because the training was already so good 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.319
 It is a place 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.770
 Hisano 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:58.010
 I was completely able to show off the difference in power 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.530
 But in spite of the impact of Shin'umasen 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.069
 It's pretty popular with around 6 popularity 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.730
 Because it seems not 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:14.640
 I think this is quite a target 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:18.340
 We are expecting here because it is with Muses sultan who bought owner birth Niigata 2 years old stakes 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.260
 I think it's going to be 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.180
 In it I I have to end fracture so To water 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:33.540
 As a pity 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:37.460
 I think it is not a broken bone so far so I want you to recover quickly 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:41.480
 I do not have thought that if you want, depending on the horse until the painful 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:44.230
 Well here if 20 aliens are to win 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.610
 This last dad 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:53.870
 This time the muze center will happen 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.680
 I want to do it This time I was like this one 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.680
 What do you think 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:05.069
 It seems that the end of the paint does not seem to be well defined 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.890
 This weekend 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:13.630
 Likely Kana fit 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.630
 Thank you for your consideration as we expect 1 d more 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.620
