 good that such welcome to one live connected 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.909
 Today we are going to see what's new in that new one and I made four points 2 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.989
 and today I know that we will see shortly in the month of November and that 

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:16.890
 will update 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.419
 all multitouch devices to tighten this all for those that are not 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.630
 compatible with version 4 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.989
 i those that are half compatible as 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.170
 3g mobile second generation tas and iphone 3g will deposit for stockings 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.570
 in agreement 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.100
 in this case we have a country with 3g s that total is fully compatible with 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.960
 the news the iphone 4 the tas of the third generation these four 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.319
 fourth generation also based on this compatible 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:50.599
 with all these novelties d the first thing that should be highlighted what already 

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.590
 we commented on his day 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.890
 we have faith in the possibility 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.010
 to catch 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.280
 in first outcome applications right now 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490
 only the system but apart 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.030
 pa from the final version of the developers 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.410
 they will be able to present their applications 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.210
 I was a director of the service at the beginning we saw in his day 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 agreement the option to print 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.070
 already allows us to select a printer 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.830
 either through printer sharing at sea 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.840
 the normal western company with printer the first accident 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.590
 or from the compatible list of art 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.670
 pcpa we do not have different possibilities we are not going to stay without printing 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.580
 for the iphone as the ipad as we have seen he has this 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.550
 characteristic 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.580
 come close 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.150
 a general update of all those fabrications 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 we have updated the application of notes of ago 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.020
 we have certain application improvements that can give even for a 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.090
 little problem 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.420
 and we have other news a little more seen this agreement 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.910
 we have 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.440
 much better battery life with the use 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.700
 the mayor of the different networks and of the multitasking 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.700
 in agreement 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
 we continue watching multitasking as you can see 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.289
 according to all applications 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.779
 a pucho better performance also of incidents agreement 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.560
 of pi among the novelties because we can highlight that now in safari 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.729
 the search option that allowed us to search the searched face 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.729
 will only allow us to search between 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.659
 the result we want to search in google 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.659
 if not that if we look 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.479
 to search 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.200
 if we look now we have the possibility to look for results 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.519
 on that page that is to say the text 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.510
 same as we can do with the desktop safari because we have the possibility 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.429
 not just searching 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:56.259
 a result that the government does not as we have given that we have 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.259
 that if not we will also be able to find those results 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.339
 to real time 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:02.619
 osorno 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.609
 some characters and as you see 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.899
 is updated in real time 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:11.819
 with which they look for that word in all the pages that are shown to us page 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.039
 garden results less 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.529
 that would be a DNA of the 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.529
 options among which cites improvements 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.829
 also for 100 available bosch of possibility 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.339
 Achilles 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.769
 the notes 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.899
 I remember 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.049
 we have 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.169
 the possibility of going to the adjustments 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.209
 and if we go, write down 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.209
 we have the possibility to change the type 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.119
 of letrÃ¡n 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.359
 so if we go 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.289
 we can see that the font has changed 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.289
 agreement 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.170
 Sor the different options with with sections in the map update 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.079
 solve enough double percent more 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.569
 While in the graphic section we find certain details 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:05.639
 agreement 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.919
 what is going 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.109
 to allow 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.059
 that the graphics do not know what to see stuck 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:12.529
 that we handle 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.529
 with enough ease the device 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:20.899
 and you have to remember that with the initial version, it's pretty 

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:25.309
 devices 3g the 3gs either that it was very thin 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:28.869
 with this update comes to solve certain problems to make 

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:31.159
 compatible with airplay 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.399
 with the pri the option also impression that we have seen 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:36.759
 largely 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.620
 I feel a series 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.710
 graphic improvements quilmes system improvements 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.539
 Well as you see this is the new 4 points 2 that will also be updated 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.559
 on our iphone in our case and that our 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:54.610
 certain improvements certain details that together 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.029
 they make that uncle that's still much better 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:59.370
 really where 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.740
 a greater impact we have is on the altar to see it work 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.740
 with union s 4 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.150
 agreement but apple iphone tarsero iphone 4 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.259
 neither do you see you fall behind since these little details at the end pulls money 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.999
 Well, these all see each other in a next town
