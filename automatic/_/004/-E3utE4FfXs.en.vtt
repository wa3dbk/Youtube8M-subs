hello and welcome to the first tutorial

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.000 
hello and welcome to the first tutorial
for<00:00:04.560> designing<00:00:05.069> levels<00:00:05.520> on<00:00:05.640> spark<00:00:07.010> this

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
for designing levels on spark this

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.080 
for designing levels on spark this
tutorial<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.530> made<00:00:10.530> by<00:00:10.710> busy<00:00:11.190> bee<00:00:11.309> arcade<00:00:11.759> and

spark<00:00:17.779> the<00:00:18.779> purpose<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.470> tutorial<00:00:19.650> is

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
spark the purpose of this tutorial is

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.200 
spark the purpose of this tutorial is
just<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.840> get<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> basic<00:00:22.140> level<00:00:22.619> up<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.910> running

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
just to get a basic level up and running

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.500 
just to get a basic level up and running
that's<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.840> nothing<00:00:24.990> fancy<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.300> first

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
that's it nothing fancy so the first

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.089 
that's it nothing fancy so the first
step<00:00:27.859> well<00:00:28.859> actually<00:00:30.410> should<00:00:31.410> really<00:00:31.800> go<00:00:31.920> into

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
step well actually should really go into

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.670 
step well actually should really go into
options<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.059> turn<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> volume<00:00:34.290> down<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
options and turn the volume down on the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.250 
options and turn the volume down on the
music<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.250> sound<00:00:35.640> effects<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.930> because

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
music and the sound effects just because

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.819 
music and the sound effects just because
if<00:00:37.680> you're<00:00:37.980> making<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.610> large<00:00:39.480> level<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.739> may

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
if you're making a large level it may

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
if you're making a large level it may
take<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> bit<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.520> timing<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.840> probably<00:00:43.079> want

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
take a bit of timing you probably want

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.310 
take a bit of timing you probably want
to<00:00:43.350> listen<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.800> own<00:00:43.920> music<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:45.170> you<00:00:46.170> don't

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
to listen to your own music or you don't

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.799 
to listen to your own music or you don't
want<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> hear<00:00:46.559> anything<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:46.980> all<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.690> okay<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
want to hear anything at all so okay the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.420 
want to hear anything at all so okay the
first<00:00:48.960> step<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> go<00:00:49.829> into<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.129> level

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
first step is to go into the level

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.560 
first step is to go into the level
editor<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:52.460> here<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.329> main

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
editor and here we are this is the main

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.160 
editor and here we are this is the main
screen<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> level<00:00:55.500> editor<00:00:56.750> by<00:00:57.750> default

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
screen of the level editor by default

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.979 
screen of the level editor by default
you're<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.770> train<00:00:59.100> mode<00:00:59.270> which<00:01:00.270> means<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.809> can

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you're in train mode which means you can

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.650 
you're in train mode which means you can
plot<00:01:01.320> points<00:01:01.770> which<00:01:01.980> create<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.850> train<00:01:03.329> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
plot points which create the train so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
plot points which create the train so
I'm<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.589> ahead<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.549> create

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
I'm just going to go ahead and create

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.340 
I'm just going to go ahead and create
some<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.330> basic<00:01:06.650> training<00:01:09.229> just<00:01:10.229> by

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
some really basic training just by

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.090 
some really basic training just by
clicking<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.070> left<00:01:11.280> mouse<00:01:11.430> button<00:01:11.820> and

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
clicking with my left mouse button and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
clicking with my left mouse button and
to<00:01:14.100> finish<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.580> train<00:01:14.820> off<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.299> last<00:01:15.750> point

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
to finish the train off the last point

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.109 
to finish the train off the last point
has<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:17.390> snap<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.140> first<00:01:19.680> point<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
has to snap on to the first point and it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.730 
has to snap on to the first point and it
kind<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> auto<00:01:21.659> snaps<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.500> close<00:01:22.710> enough

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
kind of auto snaps and it's close enough

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.960 
kind of auto snaps and it's close enough
so<00:01:23.630> there<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.930> finished<00:01:25.799> train<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> did<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
so there is finished train I did it in a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.990 
so there is finished train I did it in a
clockwise<00:01:27.360> order<00:01:28.220> which<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> best<00:01:29.790> way<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
clockwise order which is the best way to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660 
clockwise order which is the best way to
do<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:32.130> counter

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
do it you can do it in a counter

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.899 
do it you can do it in a counter
clockwise<00:01:32.780> order<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.549> doesn't

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
clockwise order like this but it doesn't

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.420 
clockwise order like this but it doesn't
look<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.530> when<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> play<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> game

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
look right when you go to play the game

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.950 
look right when you go to play the game
and<00:01:38.670> I'll<00:01:38.850> leave<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.270> there<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.780> can

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and I'll leave that up there so you can

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.910 
and I'll leave that up there so you can
see<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> difference<00:01:42.500> just<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> zoom

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
see the difference just going to zoom

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.730 
see the difference just going to zoom
out<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.460> using<00:01:45.149> my<00:01:45.920> mouse<00:01:46.920> scroll<00:01:47.880> wheel<00:01:47.939> if

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
out here using my mouse scroll wheel if

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.770 
out here using my mouse scroll wheel if
you<00:01:49.740> don't<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> scroll<00:01:51.149> wheel<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.750> can

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you don't have a scroll wheel you can

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.620 
you don't have a scroll wheel you can
use<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.970> plus<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.210> minus<00:01:54.329> keys

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.889 

so<00:01:59.439> now<00:01:59.920> we've<00:02:00.040> got<00:02:00.189> two<00:02:00.659> chunks<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.719> land

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
so now we've got two chunks of land

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.200 
so now we've got two chunks of land
there<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:03.250> next<00:02:03.520> step<00:02:03.789> is<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:06.210> place

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
there and the next step is to place

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.009 
there and the next step is to place
spark<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.819> player<00:02:10.030> start<00:02:10.360> position<00:02:10.780> so

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
spark the the player start position so

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.770 
spark the the player start position so
just<00:02:11.230> click<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.650> arrow<00:02:11.950> here<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:13.660> can

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
just click this arrow here and you can

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.600 
just click this arrow here and you can
see<00:02:14.349> spark<00:02:14.650> there<00:02:14.830> just<00:02:15.040> click<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.370> them<00:02:15.489> and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
see spark there just click on them and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.880 
see spark there just click on them and
he'll<00:02:16.510> be<00:02:16.660> underneath<00:02:17.080> your<00:02:17.260> cursor<00:02:17.620> you

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
he'll be underneath your cursor you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.320 
he'll be underneath your cursor you
don't<00:02:18.069> have<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.370> hold<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.670> key<00:02:18.819> down<00:02:18.849> it's

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
don't have to hold the key down it's

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.420 
don't have to hold the key down it's
just<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:20.170> just<00:02:20.290> follows<00:02:20.530> your<00:02:20.739> cursor<00:02:21.130> and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
just it just follows your cursor and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.500 
just it just follows your cursor and
we'll<00:02:21.970> put<00:02:22.150> them<00:02:22.209> right<00:02:22.390> there<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.790> can<00:02:25.030> put

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
three general areas like different types

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.920 
three general areas like different types
of<00:03:14.079> levels<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.650> can<00:03:14.709> be<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.130> first<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.930> get

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
of levels that can be the first is get

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.180 
of levels that can be the first is get
from<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.200> start<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.590> end<00:03:17.680> which<00:03:18.040> is

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.750 
quicker it rotates further the more
accurate<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.410> can<00:04:30.440> be<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:31.310> we'll<00:04:31.430> just<00:04:31.610> kind

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
accurate you can be so we'll just kind

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.210 
accurate you can be so we'll just kind

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
of line it up the land and we'll go back

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.220

you can drag whatever you can drag the
flan<00:04:40.940> this<00:04:41.480> land<00:04:42.610> spark<00:04:45.040> you<00:04:46.040> can<00:04:46.190> also<00:04:46.340> drag

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
flan this land spark you can also drag

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.580 
flan this land spark you can also drag
individual<00:04:47.690> points<00:04:48.340> of<00:04:49.340> lion<00:04:50.150> or<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.590> yeah

individual points of lion or the yeah

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.760 
individual points of lion or the yeah
the<00:04:51.740> points<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.490> make<00:04:52.550> up<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.970> land<00:04:53.770> we'll

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
the points that make up the land we'll

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.140 
the points that make up the land we'll
just<00:04:54.919> move<00:04:55.010> those<00:04:55.190> out<00:04:55.400> like<00:04:55.610> this<00:04:55.850> because

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
just move those out like this because

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.260 
just move those out like this because
these<00:04:56.690> are<00:04:56.990> going<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.230> be<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:58.370> boundaries<00:04:58.880> and

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
these are going to be the boundaries and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.080 
these are going to be the boundaries and
it'll<00:04:59.960> be<00:05:00.080> tree<00:05:00.350> here<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:00.770> a<00:05:00.830> tree<00:05:01.010> there<00:05:01.220> you

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
it'll be tree here and a tree there you

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.750 
it'll be tree here and a tree there you
won't<00:05:02.180> be<00:05:02.360> able<00:05:02.419> to<00:05:02.600> go<00:05:02.690> past<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.760> then

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
won't be able to go past it then

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.890 
won't be able to go past it then
depending<00:05:05.180> like<00:05:05.330> if<00:05:05.480> you're<00:05:05.600> in<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.750> desert

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
depending like if you're in the desert

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.290 
depending like if you're in the desert
scene<00:05:06.350> I<00:05:06.910> will<00:05:07.910> be<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.150> cactus<00:05:08.780> fair<00:05:09.020> instead

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
scene I will be a cactus fair instead

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.970 
scene I will be a cactus fair instead
city<00:05:11.300> scene<00:05:11.570> will<00:05:11.720> be<00:05:11.840> this<00:05:11.990> black<00:05:12.380> structure

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
city scene will be this black structure

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.640 
city scene will be this black structure
and<00:05:13.960> let's<00:05:14.960> go<00:05:15.169> back<00:05:15.350> here<00:05:15.880> move<00:05:16.880> this<00:05:17.060> up<00:05:17.120> fit

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
and let's go back here move this up fit

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:24.190 
and let's go back here move this up fit
you<00:05:18.650> can<00:05:18.830> rotate<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.280> land<00:05:19.490> too<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:23.870> let's

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
you can rotate the land too so let's

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.760 
you can rotate the land too so let's
just<00:05:24.440> test<00:05:24.770> this<00:05:25.070> level<00:05:25.490> out<00:05:27.700> and<00:05:28.990> it<00:05:29.990> says<00:05:30.200> you

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
just test this level out and it says you

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.020 
just test this level out and it says you
have<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:30.979> find<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.280> exit<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.640> complete<00:05:31.940> this

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
have to find the exit to complete this

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.710 
have to find the exit to complete this
level<00:05:32.210> ok<00:05:32.750> now<00:05:33.680> see<00:05:34.040> this<00:05:34.250> this<00:05:34.790> piece<00:05:35.030> of<00:05:35.240> this

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
level ok now see this this piece of this

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.570 
level ok now see this this piece of this
chunk<00:05:36.020> of<00:05:36.110> land<00:05:36.290> up<00:05:36.470> here<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.830> looks<00:05:37.340> kind<00:05:37.550> of

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
chunk of land up here it looks kind of

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.030 
chunk of land up here it looks kind of
funny<00:05:37.790> because<00:05:37.970> we<00:05:38.270> drew<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.660> any<00:05:39.040> counter

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
funny because we drew it any counter

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.750 
funny because we drew it any counter
clockwise<00:05:40.930> manner<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.290> this<00:05:43.010> land<00:05:43.250> down<00:05:43.490> here

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
clockwise manner and this land down here

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.810 
clockwise manner and this land down here
is<00:05:43.880> right<00:05:44.090> in<00:05:44.750> what<00:05:44.930> looks<00:05:45.140> good<00:05:45.550> they<00:05:46.550> are<00:05:46.610> the

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
is right in what looks good they are the

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.840 
is right in what looks good they are the
boundaries<00:05:47.150> here<00:05:47.960> in<00:05:48.110> here<00:05:48.380> and<00:05:48.700> there's<00:05:49.700> the

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
boundaries here in here and there's the

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.280 
boundaries here in here and there's the
exit<00:05:50.180> so<00:05:50.540> we're<00:05:50.900> just<00:05:50.930> gonna<00:05:52.180> exit<00:05:53.180> takes<00:05:54.140> us

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
exit so we're just gonna exit takes us

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.900 
exit so we're just gonna exit takes us
back<00:05:54.440> to<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.740> level<00:05:54.890> editor<00:05:55.130> because<00:05:55.640> that's
