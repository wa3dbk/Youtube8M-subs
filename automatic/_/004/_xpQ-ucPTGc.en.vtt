00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
after hatchlings that are friendly to us

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.279 
after hatchlings that are friendly to us
the<00:00:25.920> Alliance<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> Horde<00:00:27.689> they<00:00:27.900> seem<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the Alliance but the Horde they seem to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.740 
the Alliance but the Horde they seem to
be<00:00:28.730> you<00:00:29.730> know<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> hostile<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.300> neutral

be you know I have a hostile on neutral
and<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:34.469> they<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> drop<00:00:35.040> chance<00:00:35.370> from

and I think they have a drop chance from
them<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.780> easy<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> an

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
them I think it's easy to do it an

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.459 
them I think it's easy to do it an
alliance<00:00:37.910> however<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.329> do<00:00:39.570> need<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.989> quite

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
a high level in order to do this now you

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.590 
a high level in order to do this now you
need<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> go<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.620> into<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.340> norfair<00:00:44.940> alas<00:00:45.210> I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
need to go on into the norfair alas I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.290 
need to go on into the norfair alas I
did<00:00:45.690> show<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.739> map<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.160> think<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.910> I

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
did show it in the map I think if I

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.889 
did show it in the map I think if I
didn't<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.640> north<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
didn't it's just to the north of the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.830 
didn't it's just to the north of the
well<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> only<00:00:53.280> torrent<00:00:54.210> camp<00:00:54.510> that's

well it's the only torrent camp that's
not<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.289> Horde<00:00:55.620> torrent<00:00:56.250> camp

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
42 so if your characters

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.800 
42 so if your characters
4445<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.550> you're<00:02:15.670> leveling<00:02:16.060> feral<00:02:16.480> ass<00:02:16.600> it

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
4445 and you're leveling feral ass it

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.510 
4445 and you're leveling feral ass it
might<00:02:16.960> be<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> good<00:02:17.230> idea<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.740> do<00:02:17.830> these<00:02:18.040> quests

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
might be a good idea to do these quests

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.670 
might be a good idea to do these quests
there's<00:02:19.300> quite<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> lot<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.840> touring<00:02:20.560> around

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
there's quite a lot of touring around

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.530 
there's quite a lot of touring around
the<00:02:20.950> place<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.460> so<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.880> would<00:02:22.030> give<00:02:22.180> good

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
the place and so it would give good

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.420 
the place and so it would give good
experience<00:02:23.080> if<00:02:23.260> her<00:02:23.350> in<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.560> zone

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
experience if her in the zone

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.310 
experience if her in the zone
however<00:02:25.030> if<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.330> don't<00:02:25.600> come<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.900> feral<00:02:26.170> ass

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
however if you don't come to feral ass

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.680 
however if you don't come to feral ass
it's<00:02:26.650> not<00:02:26.800> really<00:02:27.070> worth<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.240> go<00:02:28.420> out<00:02:28.510> your

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
it's not really worth it to go out your

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.600 
it's not really worth it to go out your
way<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.900> come<00:02:29.260> here<00:02:29.530> unless<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.160> very<00:02:30.370> like

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
way to come here unless you very like

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.699 
way to come here unless you very like
pet<00:02:30.910> unless<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.540> very<00:02:31.750> much<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.140> pets<00:02:32.440> while

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
pet unless you very much like pets while

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.699 
pet unless you very much like pets while
leveling<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.850> yeah<00:02:34.330> besides<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:35.200> quite

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
leveling so yeah besides that it's quite

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.540 
leveling so yeah besides that it's quite
all<00:02:35.860> right<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:38.200> yeah<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.980> can<00:02:39.190> be<00:02:39.340> quite

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
all right so yeah it can be quite

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.640 
all right so yeah it can be quite
annoying<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:40.060> quest<00:02:40.300> because<00:02:40.540> there<00:02:41.350> isn't

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
annoying this quest because there isn't

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.180 
annoying this quest because there isn't
always<00:02:41.860> enough<00:02:42.550> turin<00:02:43.150> around<00:02:44.100> there's<00:02:45.100> not

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
always enough turin around there's not

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.970 
always enough turin around there's not
always<00:02:45.400> enough<00:02:45.630> turin<00:02:46.630> for<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.260> spawned<00:02:47.620> but

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
always enough turin for the spawned but

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.960 
always enough turin for the spawned but
the<00:02:48.070> good<00:02:48.190> thing<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.550> they<00:02:48.730> got<00:02:48.820> the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
the good thing is they got the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.420 
the good thing is they got the
relatively<00:02:49.540> high<00:02:49.660> respawn<00:02:50.290> timer<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.250> once

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
relatively high respawn timer so once

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.340 
relatively high respawn timer so once
you<00:02:51.580> clear<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.060> camp<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.900> north<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.320> can
