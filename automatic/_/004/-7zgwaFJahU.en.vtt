00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
just stop being a line whether I just

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.069 
just stop being a line whether I just
merge<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.039> normal<00:01:41.369> air<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.929> then<00:01:42.929> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
merge it with a normal air and then you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.859 
merge it with a normal air and then you
can<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.740> back<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.250> doing<00:01:44.759> your<00:01:44.880> funds<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.479> stuff

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.410 

some<00:01:55.200> sort

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
some sort

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.810 
some sort
anyways<00:01:57.080> that<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.620> how<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:57.800> make<00:01:58.100> my<00:01:58.220> circle<00:01:58.490> and

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
anyways that is how I make my circle and

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.320 
anyways that is how I make my circle and
I<00:01:58.880> hope<00:01:59.090> it's<00:01:59.300> at<00:02:00.080> least<00:02:00.290> even<00:02:00.680> understands

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
I hope it's at least even understands

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.760 
I hope it's at least even understands
much<00:02:02.330> easier<00:02:02.720> than<00:02:02.870> writing<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.320> out<00:02:03.409> so

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
much easier than writing it out so

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.440 
much easier than writing it out so
anyways<00:02:04.640> that's<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.150> for<00:02:05.210> now<00:02:05.479> but<00:02:07.149> ha<00:02:08.149> that

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
anyways that's it for now but ha that

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.770 
anyways that's it for now but ha that
was<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:09.050> like<00:02:09.259> 2<00:02:09.440> minutes<00:02:09.590> long
