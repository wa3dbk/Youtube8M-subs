00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
to shake well now the base of the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.639 
to shake well now the base of the
controller<00:00:48.329> isn't<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> only<00:00:48.989> part<00:00:49.379> that's

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
controller isn't the only part that's

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.160 
controller isn't the only part that's
actually<00:00:49.920> rumbling<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.149> triggers<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:52.020> it

actually rumbling the triggers have it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.740 
actually rumbling the triggers have it
as<00:00:52.320> well<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.520> intensity<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> rumble

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
as well and the intensity of the rumble

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.779 
as well and the intensity of the rumble
will<00:00:55.170> vary<00:00:55.440> depending<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:56.460> what's<00:00:56.670> happening

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
will vary depending on what's happening

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
will vary depending on what's happening
in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.840> game<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.710> example<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.160> you're

in the game so for example if you're

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.560 
in the game so for example if you're
shooting<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.609> machine<00:00:59.879> gun<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.180> gonna<00:01:00.270> go<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
shooting a machine gun it's gonna go to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.630 
just wasn't for me and I didn't need it
but<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.480> new<00:03:30.630> Kinect<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.170> breaking<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.340> mold

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
but the new Kinect is breaking the mold

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.580 
but the new Kinect is breaking the mold
completely<00:03:33.269> let's<00:03:33.660> just<00:03:33.870> look<00:03:33.959> at<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.200> camera

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
completely let's just look at the camera

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.289 
completely let's just look at the camera
alone<00:03:34.829> we're<00:03:35.100> going<00:03:35.310> from<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.579> normal<00:03:35.940> VGA

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
alone we're going from a normal VGA

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.080 
alone we're going from a normal VGA
sensor<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.049> full-blown<00:03:37.680> 1080p<00:03:38.340> camera<00:03:38.700> on

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090

this<00:03:39.600> new<00:03:39.840> guy<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.109> is<00:03:40.350> it's<00:03:40.560> beautiful<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.760> can

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
this new guy it is it's beautiful it can

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.300 
this new guy it is it's beautiful it can
read<00:03:42.180> two<00:03:42.540> gigs<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.140> data<00:03:43.320> per<00:03:43.680> second<00:03:44.250> you

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
read two gigs of data per second you

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.890 
read two gigs of data per second you
know<00:03:44.430> what<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.700> means<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.359> means<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.720> can

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
know what that means that means it can

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.229 
know what that means that means it can
track<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.440> perfectly<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.549> can<00:03:47.670> follow<00:03:47.910> you

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
track you perfectly you can follow you

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.360 
track you perfectly you can follow you
and<00:03:48.420> track<00:03:49.200> your<00:03:49.380> motion<00:03:49.709> much<00:03:49.890> more<00:03:50.130> easily

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
and track your motion much more easily

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.819 
and track your motion much more easily
and<00:03:50.730> precisely<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.570> no<00:03:51.690> more<00:03:51.900> waving<00:03:52.500> around

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
and precisely so no more waving around

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.009 
and precisely so no more waving around
wildly<00:03:53.609> trying<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.150> get<00:03:54.269> recognized<00:03:54.780> and

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
wildly trying to get recognized and

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.050 
wildly trying to get recognized and
while<00:03:55.500> we're<00:03:55.680> on<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.799> topic<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.730> Kinect

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
while we're on the topic of the Kinect

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.270 
while we're on the topic of the Kinect
yes<00:03:57.450> that's<00:03:58.019> clear<00:03:58.109> something<00:03:58.380> up<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.980> don't

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
yes that's clear something up you don't

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.069 
yes that's clear something up you don't
need<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.850> have<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.269> Kinect<00:04:00.570> on<00:04:00.690> at<00:04:00.900> all<00:04:01.049> times

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
need to have the Kinect on at all times

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.830 
need to have the Kinect on at all times
it's<00:04:01.560> not<00:04:01.709> always<00:04:02.040> on<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:03.120> can<00:04:03.299> turn<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.690> off

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
it's not always on you can turn it off

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.479 
it's not always on you can turn it off
so<00:04:04.079> that<00:04:04.109> it's<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.530> only<00:04:04.769> thing<00:04:05.100> it's

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
so that it's the only thing it's

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.660 
so that it's the only thing it's
listening<00:04:05.700> for<00:04:06.090> are<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.720> two<00:04:06.900> words<00:04:07.200> Xbox<00:04:08.190> on

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
listening for are the two words Xbox on

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.759 
listening for are the two words Xbox on
or<00:04:09.180> if<00:04:09.600> you<00:04:09.660> don't<00:04:09.780> even<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.620> can

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
or if you don't even like that you can

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.430 
or if you don't even like that you can
shut<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.010> off<00:04:11.220> 100%<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.660> it's<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:13.049> sitting

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
shut it off 100% so it's just sitting

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.210 
shut it off 100% so it's just sitting
there<00:04:13.560> doing<00:04:14.220> absolutely<00:04:14.400> nothing<00:04:16.220> nothing

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
and now I can utilize the Kinect in that

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.550 
and now I can utilize the Kinect in that
small<00:04:30.849> town<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.180> space<00:04:31.419> I<00:04:31.750> see<00:04:32.289> a<00:04:32.319> lot<00:04:32.530> of
