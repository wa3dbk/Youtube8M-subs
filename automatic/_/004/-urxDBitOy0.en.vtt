00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.920 
OK yeah I was just happy that opacity
and<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.320> then<00:02:28.860> don't<00:02:29.760> mind<00:02:30.090> me<00:02:30.330> being<00:02:30.570> an<00:02:30.720> idiot

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
and so then don't mind me being an idiot

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.830 
and so then don't mind me being an idiot
on<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:31.530> part<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.040> tried<00:02:32.430> mucho<00:02:33.090> V<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.570> then<00:02:33.720> it

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
on this part I tried mucho V but then it

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.450 
on this part I tried mucho V but then it
the<00:02:34.140> clipboard<00:02:34.590> doesn't<00:02:34.890> contain<00:02:35.160> an<00:02:35.340> image

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
the clipboard doesn't contain an image

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.080 
the clipboard doesn't contain an image
so<00:02:36.330> yes<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.690> had<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.050> control<00:02:37.680> see<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.730> shade

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
so yes I had to control see that shade

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.330 
so yes I had to control see that shade
again<00:02:39.240> then<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:40.080> need<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.290> control<00:02:40.800> V<00:02:41.010> on<00:02:41.160> this

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
again then I need to control V on this

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.820 
again then I need to control V on this
and<00:02:41.580> now<00:02:41.730> look<00:02:42.030> in<00:02:42.180> my<00:02:42.300> fully<00:02:42.630> shaded<00:02:43.110> skin<00:02:43.410> it

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
and now look in my fully shaded skin it

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.850 
and now look in my fully shaded skin it
looks<00:02:43.890> all<00:02:44.190> pretty<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.550> such<00:02:44.960> now<00:02:45.960> what<00:02:46.710> I'm

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
looks all pretty and such now what I'm

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.110 
looks all pretty and such now what I'm
doing<00:02:47.250> currently<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.990> save<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.590> as

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
doing currently is I have to save it as

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.320 
doing currently is I have to save it as
some<00:02:51.120> as<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.990> PNG<00:02:52.440> file<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.430> then<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:54.120> just

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
some as a PNG file and then you just

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.920 
some as a PNG file and then you just
rename<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.990> to<00:02:55.020> anything<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.620> did<00:02:55.950> Andrews<00:02:56.460> skin

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
rename it to anything I did Andrews skin

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.280 
rename it to anything I did Andrews skin
seems<00:02:57.930> simple<00:02:58.380> enough<00:02:58.410> and<00:03:00.050> then<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.260> course

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
seems simple enough and then of course

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.050 
seems simple enough and then of course
you<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.710> flatten<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.190> then<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.520> can<00:03:02.670> exit

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
you have to flatten it then you can exit

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.470 
you have to flatten it then you can exit
out<00:03:03.240> then<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.170> go<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.500> your<00:03:05.150> uploading<00:03:06.150> thing

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
out then you go to your uploading thing

out then you go to your uploading thing
like<00:03:07.440> or<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.710> can<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:07.980> go<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.160> Minecraft<00:03:08.550> on
