okay<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.770> video<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.879> teach<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.210> how<00:00:03.240> to

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
okay this video is to teach you how to

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.539 
okay this video is to teach you how to
use<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.720> stock<00:00:04.020> system<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.620> naming<00:00:04.830> but<00:00:05.460> now

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
use the stock system of naming but now

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.889 
use the stock system of naming but now
you<00:00:05.790> probably<00:00:06.000> realize<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.690> there<00:00:06.810> are

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
you probably realize that there are

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.890 
you probably realize that there are
actually<00:00:07.200> two<00:00:07.410> ways<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.980> naming<00:00:08.900> balanced

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
actually two ways of naming balanced

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.270 
actually two ways of naming balanced
compounds

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
compounds

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.249 
compounds
there's<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.059> stock<00:00:12.330> system<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.900> there's<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
there's the stock system and there's the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.530 
there's the stock system and there's the
modern<00:00:13.710> prefix<00:00:14.429> system<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.000> video<00:00:15.330> only

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
modern prefix system this video only

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.680 
modern prefix system this video only
deals<00:00:15.780> with<00:00:15.870> naming<00:00:16.289> using<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> stock<00:00:17.130> system

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
deals with naming using the stock system

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.240 
deals with naming using the stock system
please<00:00:18.690> keep<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> system<00:00:19.199> separate<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.980> always

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
please keep the system separate I always

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.340 
please keep the system separate I always
tell<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.550> use<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.939> or<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.090> other<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
tell you to use one or the other if you

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.630 
tell you to use one or the other if you
mix<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> rules<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.130> won't<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.430> anything

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640

right<00:00:24.949> trying<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> mix<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.910> rules<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.330> like

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
right trying to mix the rules is like

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.109 
right trying to mix the rules is like

only use Roman numerals for positive

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.000 
only use Roman numerals for positive
charges<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.149> something<00:01:00.539> has<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.410> beside<00:01:01.980> it

the<00:01:02.309> Roman<00:01:02.579> numeral<00:01:02.910> one<00:01:03.149> which<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.780> an<00:01:03.870> A

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the Roman numeral one which is just an A

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.289 
the Roman numeral one which is just an A
then<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.890> has<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> charge<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.549> positive<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:06.180> if

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
then it has a charge of positive one if

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.520 
then it has a charge of positive one if
something<00:01:06.540> has<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> Roman<00:01:07.049> numeral<00:01:07.320> two

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
something has the Roman numeral two

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.620 
something has the Roman numeral two
beside<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> which<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.479> got<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
beside it which is I I then it's got a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.270 
beside it which is I I then it's got a
charge<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.990> positive<00:01:10.110> two<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.010> only<00:01:11.159> other

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
charge of positive two the only other

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.609 
charge of positive two the only other
things<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.760> change<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> ending<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.049> IDE

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
things you just change the ending to IDE

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.160 
things you just change the ending to IDE
so<00:01:14.040> whatever<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.760> ending<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.869> knock<00:01:16.140> it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
so whatever the ending is you knock it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.230 
so whatever the ending is you knock it
off<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.650> change<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> IDE<00:01:17.460> now<00:01:18.030> these

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
off you change it the IDE now these

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.719 
off you change it the IDE now these
rules<00:01:18.509> may<00:01:18.720> seem<00:01:18.930> confusing<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.610> they're

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
rules may seem confusing now but they're

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.090 
rules may seem confusing now but they're
extremely<00:01:21.000> simple

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100

alright<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.140> Roman<00:01:55.409> numeral<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.770> going

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
alright and that Roman numeral is going

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.319 
alright and that Roman numeral is going
to<00:01:56.009> tell<00:01:56.159> me<00:01:56.250> remember<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:57.000> going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> tell

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
to tell me remember it's going to tell

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.359 
to tell me remember it's going to tell
me<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.600> charge<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:58.950> got<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.189> figure

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
me the charge so I just got to figure

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.609 
me the charge so I just got to figure
out<00:01:59.610> what's<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> charge<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.479> titanium<00:02:00.869> here's

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
out what's the charge on titanium here's

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.230 
out what's the charge on titanium here's
a<00:02:01.680> problem<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.549> can't<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:02.969> look<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
a problem you can't just look on the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.179 
a problem you can't just look on the
periodic<00:02:03.450> table<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.259> those<00:02:04.320> d-block

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
periodic table it's one of those d-block

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.190 
periodic table it's one of those d-block
or<00:02:05.640> transition<00:02:06.540> metals<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.079> have

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
or transition metals it can have

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.650 
or transition metals it can have
multiple<00:02:07.409> charges<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.879> I'm<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.179> figure

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
multiple charges so I'm going to figure

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.570 
multiple charges so I'm going to figure
out<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> charge<00:02:10.379> well<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.220> remember<00:02:11.370> our

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
out the charge well if you remember our

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.580 
out the charge well if you remember our
old<00:02:11.730> trusty<00:02:12.420> T<00:02:12.629> chart<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:13.140> use<00:02:13.319> that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
old trusty T chart we use that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.619 
old trusty T chart we use that
again<00:02:14.540> now<00:02:15.540> used<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:17.099> use<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.519> T<00:02:17.730> chart<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
again now used to we use the T chart to

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.080 
again now used to we use the T chart to
figure<00:02:19.440> out<00:02:19.739> how<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.040> balance<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.700> compound

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
figure out how to balance and compound

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.699 
figure out how to balance and compound
well<00:02:21.239> here<00:02:21.450> we've<00:02:21.900> already<00:02:22.050> got<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> balanced

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
well here we've already got a balanced

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.990 
well here we've already got a balanced
compound<00:02:23.160> we<00:02:23.280> want<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.519> actually<00:02:23.819> work

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
compound we want to actually work

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.600 
compound we want to actually work
backwards<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.019> figure<00:02:25.470> out<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.830> charge<00:02:26.190> on

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
backwards and figure out the charge on

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.339 
backwards and figure out the charge on
that<00:02:26.760> titanium<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.780> I'm<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:27.989> write<00:02:28.200> in

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
that titanium so I'm going to write in

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.690 
that titanium so I'm going to write in
everything<00:02:28.620> that's<00:02:28.860> understood<00:02:29.370> for

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
everything that's understood for

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.309 
everything that's understood for
instance<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.120> understood<00:02:30.599> that<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.080> one

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
instance it's understood that I have one

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.369 
instance it's understood that I have one
titanium<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.459> have<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:32.760> oxygen<00:02:33.140> now<00:02:34.140> I

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
titanium and I have one oxygen now I

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.110 
titanium and I have one oxygen now I
don't<00:02:34.530> know<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.860> charge<00:02:35.129> on<00:02:35.340> titanium<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:36.090> I

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
don't know the charge on titanium but I

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.390 
don't know the charge on titanium but I
do<00:02:36.299> know<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> charge<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.769> oxygen<00:02:37.890> that's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
do know the charge on oxygen that's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.589 
do know the charge on oxygen that's
negative<00:02:38.849> two<00:02:39.200> always<00:02:40.200> right<00:02:40.910> D<00:02:41.910> blocks<00:02:42.209> can

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
negative two always right D blocks can

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.990 
negative two always right D blocks can
have<00:02:42.720> different<00:02:43.080> charges<00:02:43.580> nonmetals<00:02:44.580> cannot

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
have different charges nonmetals cannot

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.550 
have different charges nonmetals cannot
so<00:02:45.780> if<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:47.269> oxygen<00:02:48.269> that's<00:02:49.049> one

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
so if I have one oxygen that's one

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.009 
so if I have one oxygen that's one
negative<00:02:50.220> two<00:02:50.549> charge<00:02:50.579> one<00:02:51.180> times<00:02:51.540> negative<00:02:51.630> 2

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
negative two charge one times negative 2

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.100 
negative two charge one times negative 2
is<00:02:52.049> negative<00:02:52.260> two<00:02:52.950> now<00:02:53.790> remember<00:02:54.239> whatever<00:02:54.690> is

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
is negative two now remember whatever is

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.229 
is negative two now remember whatever is
over<00:02:55.410> here<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:56.040> top<00:02:56.310> I've<00:02:56.579> got<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.000> same

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
over here at on top I've got the same

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.569 
over here at on top I've got the same
thing<00:02:57.450> over<00:02:57.630> here<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.049> opposite<00:02:58.590> because

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
thing over here but opposite because

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.580 
thing over here but opposite because
balanced<00:03:00.180> compounds<00:03:00.690> have<00:03:00.810> balanced<00:03:01.200> charges

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
balanced compounds have balanced charges

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.259 
balanced compounds have balanced charges
so<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.010> negative<00:03:02.190> two<00:03:02.459> here<00:03:02.640> then<00:03:03.150> we

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
so this is negative two here then we

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.940 
so this is negative two here then we
have<00:03:03.390> positive<00:03:03.569> two<00:03:03.930> there<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.590> now<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.769> only

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
have positive two there and now the only

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.360 
have positive two there and now the only
hole<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.549> right<00:03:06.510> here<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.829> charge<00:03:08.160> on

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
hole is right here the charge on

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.000 
hole is right here the charge on
titanium<00:03:08.730> I've<00:03:09.090> got<00:03:09.569> one<00:03:09.780> titanium<00:03:10.349> one<00:03:10.590> times

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
titanium I've got one titanium one times

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.750 
titanium I've got one titanium one times
what<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.400> positive<00:03:11.879> 2<00:03:12.060> right<00:03:12.269> 2<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:17.310> obviously

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
what is positive 2 right 2 so obviously

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.490 
what is positive 2 right 2 so obviously
this<00:03:18.000> one<00:03:18.209> titanium<00:03:18.720> must<00:03:18.870> have<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.019> charge<00:03:19.319> of

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
this one titanium must have a charge of

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.160 
this one titanium must have a charge of
positive<00:03:19.769> 2<00:03:20.340> now<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.299> want<00:03:21.569> you<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.750> notice<00:03:21.930> what

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
positive 2 now I want you to notice what

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.900 
positive 2 now I want you to notice what
I<00:03:22.230> did<00:03:22.440> was<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.590> actually<00:03:22.769> worked<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> big

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
I did was I actually worked on in a big

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.319 
I did was I actually worked on in a big
circle<00:03:24.260> back<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.859> charge<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.459> like<00:03:27.299> a

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
circle back to the charge I like a

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.330 
circle back to the charge I like a
detective<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.049> took<00:03:28.230> what<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.440> knew<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.950> I

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
detective I took what I knew and I

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.849 
detective I took what I knew and I
deduced<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.750> unknown<00:03:31.200> which<00:03:31.410> was<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> charge

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
deduced the unknown which was a charge

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.580 
deduced the unknown which was a charge
on<00:03:32.040> titanium<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.730> worked<00:03:33.329> my<00:03:33.569> way<00:03:33.599> back<00:03:34.079> around

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
on titanium I worked my way back around

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.190 
on titanium I worked my way back around
to<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:35.040> charge<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:36.299> primitive<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
to the charge and the primitive the the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.839 
to the charge and the primitive the the
most<00:03:37.380> important<00:03:37.829> premise<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.310> realizing<00:03:38.819> that

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
most important premise is realizing that

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.259 
most important premise is realizing that
whatever<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:39.510> up<00:03:39.690> here<00:03:40.370> then<00:03:41.370> over<00:03:41.730> here<00:03:42.180> is

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
whatever is up here then over here is

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.490 
whatever is up here then over here is
going<00:03:42.359> to<00:03:42.450> be<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.599> exact<00:03:42.959> same<00:03:42.989> thing<00:03:43.290> but

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
going to be the exact same thing but

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.379 
going to be the exact same thing but
opposite<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.340> my<00:03:44.579> negative<00:03:44.790> side<00:03:45.180> this

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
opposite this is my negative side this

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.659 
opposite this is my negative side this
is<00:03:45.450> my<00:03:45.599> positive<00:03:45.810> side<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.799> this<00:03:46.919> is<00:03:46.980> titanium

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
is my positive side so this is titanium

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.240 
is my positive side so this is titanium
with<00:03:47.819> a<00:03:47.849> positive<00:03:48.450> 2<00:03:48.630> charge<00:03:48.709> so<00:03:49.709> I'll<00:03:49.829> put<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.040> 2

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
with a positive 2 charge so I'll put a 2

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.270 
with a positive 2 charge so I'll put a 2
right<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.639> I'm<00:03:51.299> going<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.019> then<00:03:53.010> what

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
right here I'm going to and then what

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.500 
right here I'm going to and then what
comes<00:03:53.519> next<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:54.000> oxygen<00:03:55.220> but<00:03:56.220> remember<00:03:57.209> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
comes next is oxygen but remember the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.420 
comes next is oxygen but remember the
other<00:03:57.540> rule<00:03:57.870> has<00:03:58.019> changed<00:03:58.049> into<00:03:58.829> ID<00:03:58.919> so<00:03:59.310> it's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
other rule has changed into ID so it's

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.039 
other rule has changed into ID so it's
not<00:03:59.660> titanium<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.840> oxygen<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.739> cytanium<00:04:02.130> to

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
not titanium to oxygen in cytanium to

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.069 
not titanium to oxygen in cytanium to
oxide<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:05.459> is<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.760> answer<00:04:06.150> let's<00:04:06.870> do

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
oxide and that is the answer let's do

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.890 
oxide and that is the answer let's do
another<00:04:07.200> example

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.310

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
means I need to know what the charge is

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:49.580 
means I need to know what the charge is
of<00:04:48.930> this<00:04:49.080> iron

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
of this iron

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.559 
of this iron
you<00:04:50.490> know<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.699> charge<00:04:50.880> will<00:04:51.120> be<00:04:51.210> found<00:04:51.419> up

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
you know the charge will be found up

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.249 
you know the charge will be found up
here<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.150> don't<00:04:54.210> know<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:54.660> charge<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:55.080> iron

here and I don't know the charge of iron

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.230 
here and I don't know the charge of iron
iron<00:04:55.979> can<00:04:56.130> have<00:04:56.220> multiple<00:04:56.610> charges<00:04:57.000> because

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
iron can have multiple charges because

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.760 
iron can have multiple charges because
it's<00:04:57.389> transitional<00:04:57.870> so<00:04:57.990> what<00:04:58.560> I'm<00:04:58.620> going<00:04:58.710> to

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
it's transitional so what I'm going to

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.260 
it's transitional so what I'm going to
do<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:58.979> I'm<00:04:59.039> going<00:04:59.099> to<00:04:59.220> draw<00:04:59.400> my<00:04:59.430> t<00:04:59.610> chart<00:05:00.060> and

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
do is I'm going to draw my t chart and

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.510 
do is I'm going to draw my t chart and
I'm<00:05:00.960> going<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.169> work<00:05:01.319> my<00:05:01.380> way<00:05:01.620> back<00:05:02.039> round<00:05:02.340> and

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
I'm going to work my way back round and

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.740 
I'm going to work my way back round and
try<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.669> fill<00:05:02.940> in<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.150> blank<00:05:03.389> writer<00:05:03.599> and

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
try to fill in the blank writer and

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.909 
try to fill in the blank writer and
figure<00:05:03.930> out<00:05:03.990> what<00:05:04.139> the<00:05:04.199> charge<00:05:04.440> on<00:05:04.590> iron<00:05:04.740> is

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
figure out what the charge on iron is

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.680 
figure out what the charge on iron is
alright<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:05.639> know<00:05:05.699> that<00:05:05.970> there's<00:05:06.150> two<00:05:06.330> irons

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
alright I know that there's two irons

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.960 
alright I know that there's two irons
three<00:05:07.050> auctions<00:05:07.229> I<00:05:07.650> know<00:05:08.069> every<00:05:08.430> auction<00:05:08.580> is

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
three auctions I know every auction is

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.149 
three auctions I know every auction is
negative<00:05:09.270> two<00:05:09.479> so<00:05:10.409> that<00:05:10.500> means<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:10.800> my<00:05:10.919> grand

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
negative two so that means that my grand

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.309 
negative two so that means that my grand
total<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:11.639> 3<00:05:11.819> times<00:05:12.270> negative<00:05:12.659> 2<00:05:12.930> is<00:05:13.080> negative

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
total is 3 times negative 2 is negative

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.059 
total is 3 times negative 2 is negative
6<00:05:13.949> and<00:05:14.720> whatever<00:05:15.720> this<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:15.960> this<00:05:16.380> is<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.710> exact

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069 
6 and whatever this is this is the exact

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.219 
6 and whatever this is this is the exact
same<00:05:17.310> number<00:05:17.610> but<00:05:17.759> opposite<00:05:18.240> because<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.050> know

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
same number but opposite because I know

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.990 
same number but opposite because I know
bounce<00:05:19.590> compounds<00:05:20.280> have<00:05:20.400> balanced<00:05:20.669> charges

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
bounce compounds have balanced charges

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.999 
bounce compounds have balanced charges
so<00:05:21.150> negative<00:05:21.509> 6<00:05:21.720> and<00:05:21.960> positive<00:05:22.050> 6<00:05:22.470> bounce<00:05:22.740> and

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
so negative 6 and positive 6 bounce and

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.279 
so negative 6 and positive 6 bounce and
so<00:05:23.610> now<00:05:23.759> the<00:05:23.880> only<00:05:24.120> blank<00:05:24.389> left<00:05:24.780> is<00:05:24.960> what<00:05:25.169> is

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
so now the only blank left is what is

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.200 
so now the only blank left is what is
the<00:05:25.380> charge<00:05:25.620> on<00:05:25.740> my<00:05:25.860> iron<00:05:26.069> well<00:05:26.819> two<00:05:27.180> times

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
the charge on my iron well two times

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.230 
the charge on my iron well two times
quad<00:05:27.930> is<00:05:28.110> positive<00:05:28.500> 6<00:05:29.419> positive<00:05:30.590> 3<00:05:31.759> iron<00:05:32.759> has<00:05:33.210> a

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
quad is positive 6 positive 3 iron has a

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.080 
quad is positive 6 positive 3 iron has a
charge<00:05:33.599> here<00:05:33.930> of<00:05:33.960> positive<00:05:34.650> 3<00:05:35.130> so<00:05:35.340> this<00:05:36.030> is

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
charge here of positive 3 so this is
