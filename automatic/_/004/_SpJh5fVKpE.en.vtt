00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
anything like that and the bay this

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.560 
anything like that and the bay this
should<00:03:56.740> be<00:03:56.860> able<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.100> handle<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:58.060> in<00:03:58.150> addition

to<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:58.840> I've<00:03:59.200> got<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.530> smaller<00:04:00.070> real<00:04:00.430> for

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
to that I've got a smaller real for

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.960 
to that I've got a smaller real for
things<00:04:01.360> like<00:04:01.590> widening<00:04:02.590> garfish<00:04:03.280> flathead

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
and these smaller species they've also

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.190 
and these smaller species they've also
been<00:04:07.930> matched<00:04:08.320> with<00:04:08.970> their<00:04:09.970> roads<00:04:10.210> so<00:04:11.110> the

been matched with their roads so the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.510 
been matched with their roads so the
