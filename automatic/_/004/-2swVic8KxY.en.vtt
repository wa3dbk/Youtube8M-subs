00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.780
 I really don't understand. If you couldn't stop a guy with a top hat before, 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.880
 how does Klara jump into your time stream to solve the problem? 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.560
 Exactly. 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.250
 Just solve it! I don't know, she's an impossible girl. So you two are just sitting here? 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.110
 Daily? Nice boredom. So, what are you looking for, Mr. Doctor? 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.020
 Well, being Lord of Time, I save the entire planet over and over. 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.790
 I can say that I'm a superhero of the universe. So I thought I'd take a little break. 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.849
 Stop and say 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.890
 You're welcome, gentlemen. You save the planets? Show. Yes. 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.600
 My planet exploded. So what happened? Ah, yes! 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.530
 Krypton! Powerful point in time. I couldn't intervene. 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.480
 Very hard to explain. Hmm. Convenient. 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.199
 Yes. Yes it is. Almost like your belt, 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.199
 as they say. Just like your magic wand. It's not magic, it's a sonic screwdriver ... 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.609
 and I bet you want one! 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.640
 No. I'd have a bat screwdriver. What would a bat do with a screwdriver? 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.780
 You could have saved Rory and Amy! What? After all, they lived happily ever after! You left them abandoned in America. 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.420
 Is he always like that? AMY! 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.480
 I'd come to save you! 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.700
 Because I'm Batman! Excuse him, he's hypersensitive. She's really a piece. 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 Attractive companions! Yes! Another point on the superhero list. 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.460
 As I said... 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.790
 You're welcome. So, what now, Doctor? Oh, I don't know, probably the same. 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.370
 Always running, always saving. Probably a new body. 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.000
 He'll take it for a while before I get used to it. If you needed any help 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.330
 for example with Next or with something, buzz. Oh, I don't think it will be needed. 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.620
 Why? Because it is difficult to twist the neck with a neck when they do not have a neck. 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.250
 Attention! Joke! A little bit of backbone humor. You understand, right? 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.640
 Yeah, yeah, Doctor. Ha ha ha. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.000
 You're embarrassing guys, you know that? 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.000
 Now seriously go and save Amy. 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.100
 Hey! Do you want to know my hidden identity? 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.640
 No! No! Out! How did you even get here? Because I'm Batman!
