00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.000
 yes sir ppc you're fine the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.370
 hello does not consume very well but 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.030
 you have a coronation to your feet yes I 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.030
 a qualified sense 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.880
 good then let's talk today 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.410
 forests the biodiversity of the walls of 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.580
 roofs and sidewalks at paris pointe 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.710
 facing the camera because otherwise your 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.150
 body yes that ok very well 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.070
 no no it's time to say nothing 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.810
 good it's a mistake yes so in the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.080
 really theme is talking for nothing 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.689
 say 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
 so we listen to you then seven points and 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.140
 in less than art is this idea of 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.559
 videos or you elderly for whom the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.680
 players 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.960
 in fact I found them this idea that a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.840
 newspapers a restaurant well boy 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.219
 who is who who said someone is not 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.280
 need someone to listen to me 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.360
 in sight says carla there may be 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.149
 interesting this sentence that there is 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.800
 no need a listening no longer a 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.440
 bad shot for me to talk about exports 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.250
 of course the first point to speak is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.539
 not wind with his mouth is 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.539
 said it's to occupy the space 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.130
 there are many people who speak this 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.740
 that they have the anguish of silence 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.180
 can very well be between friends and not 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.220
 talk to each other all the time 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.180
 to occupy the space do like I 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.260
 said to make wind and that it moves 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.880
 it's no use except for Mr ppc the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.759
 second point is that we speak 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.780
 often because to avoid that the other 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:36.899
 tackles problems that scare us 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:39.030
 or say turn to avoid giving to 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.310
 the other the idea that we did not understand or 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.960
 than 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.759
 there are things we do not want 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.579
 to hear then we occupy the space 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.220
 especially so that the other do not take 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.110
 the hand and so we hoist things 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.170
 unpleasant 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.020
 it's second or third point it's 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.850
 there are people who speak half-word 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.340
 father does not mean he's talking to a 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:08.160
 word on two menus to say things he 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.229
 is alluded to by image and its 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.420
 girls do not dare to really go back to 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.980
 background and that's it's a little 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.489
 unpleasant because it's a code the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.019
 half word if you do it all to someone 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.760
 who does not have the code but understands nothing 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.780
 and in fact more think he understood 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.780
 but did not understand 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.270
 by not speaking half word 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.490
 the fourth point 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.740
 it's people that's enough 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.110
 unpleasant it's people who take themselves 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.760
 a little clever and who finish your 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.480
 sentences even before all and ends 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.410
 when meet people like that you 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.140
 never meet smart people 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.000
 he people who are ready is good you say 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.700
 that you say something and tac before 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.750
 a rib and ended it there by your place this 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.080
 which is unpleasant is that very 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.570
 often they say you were going to say this 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.470
 that they are very intuitive of crimes 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.080
 it's unpleasant either 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.280
 with a dubious air 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:12.330
 no he does not talk anymore here it is here says carbo 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.640
 then there is also the unspoken it is not the 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.950
 let's live this is the unspoken that is to say that 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.690
 the something important but we do not 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.880
 does not say it feels like waves 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.680
 will go from one head to the other of a 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.910
 brain to another and we do not talk about it 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.840
 while it is very important 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.010
 that's it and so is at nahd and 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.180
 implied 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.129
 ah ben there is someone tells airy 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.829
 this person you saw him the watch the 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.329
 shows the the number camera online 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.569
 I went straight to the picture 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.900
 me my right to the image is part of the 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.730
 side 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.670
 I agree but nothing 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.439
 reported a breakdown so we have imagined 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.200
 that she is the interlocutor at all 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.250
 understood with those whose 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.170
 said but in fact there is nothing against 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.360
 him 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.819
 the sixth point for that you'll be 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.080
 agree with you it is better to be quiet 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.640
 than to say nonsense and so their nest 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.530
 at the sixth point in a young point 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.330
 earth since I said to this stupidity 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.580
 perhaps 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.380
 justice or at low cost by the way the 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.810
 Métis firefighters via nonsense 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.290
 firefighters take us a seventh 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.860
 point I was far away is that it takes 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.190
 learn to speak also in a way to 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.350
 comfortable 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.380
 what does that mean therefore not 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.930
 take theater classes there are more 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.340
 that you no but but but the 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.680
 success videos it's a course of 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.540
 permanent theater for more than seven 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.900
 years old gentlemen already but yes but 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.270
 Yes 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.160
 if he's 7 and a half to 13 years old and this 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.720
 cap like the euro's top it's the 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.150
 even since bing not exactly at 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.650
 planchot denise and take the shopping 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.570
 and improvisation that's important 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.520
 that you have for videos of success 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.710
 from time to time actually I have 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.410
 serious are scenarios are written 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.600
 but things are improvised 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.100
 before one must be to be there must 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.690
 react because my ring to 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.789
 spectators behind the visionary 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.430
 behind and looks at us and passes us 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.259
 nothing and times nothing tian the cameraman he 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.240
 take it to me now a month but 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.530
 do not laugh the olive species a video he in 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.449
 take full mouth yes as always 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.150
 and then by the way I would like to finish 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:19.039
 by a quote from victor hugo nicolas 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:21.199
 boileau who were saying what they are this 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.570
 who conceives well is clearly stated 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.530
 and the words to say it cqpm it's 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.699
 boring people who end up 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.190
 cravings 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:31.070
 am i 'm going to the pc stop stop what 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.080
 is conceived well is pronounced this according 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.970
 clear is clearly stated and the words 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.740
 to say it these elements will say it 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.410
 come these flows peacefully 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.840
 flows elk a gesture is come 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:46.310
 Rubik was published the Austrian bans 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.630
 I do not think not according to what the 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.730
 quote it's the words come from 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.270
 taizé mans okay but we can say 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:56.330
 and therefore it is in is how much 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.220
 people born at 5.50 know will win the 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.419
 time is what is dearest has the 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.540
 time to go for a drink or so we 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.540
 go
