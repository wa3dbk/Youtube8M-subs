this<00:03:24.780> varies<00:03:25.319> from<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.799> traditional

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
this varies from the traditional

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.759 
this varies from the traditional
Puttanesca<00:03:27.569> because<00:03:27.870> we're<00:03:28.019> not<00:03:28.140> putting<00:03:28.379> the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
Puttanesca because we're not putting the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.640 
Puttanesca because we're not putting the
anchovy<00:03:29.310> fillets<00:03:29.640> in<00:03:29.879> here<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:31.379> cheese

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
anchovy fillets in here and the cheese

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.860 
anchovy fillets in here and the cheese
obviously<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:32.910> you're<00:03:33.060> still<00:03:33.329> going<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.660> get

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
obviously but you're still going to get

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.069 
obviously but you're still going to get
a<00:03:33.930> great<00:03:34.290> salty<00:03:36.140> tangy<00:03:37.140> flavor<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:39.079> it's

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
a great salty tangy flavor and it's

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.670 
a great salty tangy flavor and it's
going<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.379> be<00:03:40.530> juicy<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.400> creamy<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.680> it's

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
going to be juicy and creamy and it's

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.030 
going to be juicy and creamy and it's
looking<00:03:44.040> pretty<00:03:44.640> much<00:03:44.879> like<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.359> real<00:03:45.510> thing

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040
