00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
in and out of the front it's a real

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.900 
in and out of the front it's a real

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
challenge because as you can see this B

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.730 
challenge because as you can see this B
pillar<00:01:28.180> is<00:01:28.360> pretty<00:01:28.630> far<00:01:28.810> forward<00:01:29.290> compared<00:01:29.620> to

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
pillar is pretty far forward compared to

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.800 
pillar is pretty far forward compared to

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
where the seat is and so you kind of

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.180 
where the seat is and so you kind of
have<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.050> contort<00:01:32.410> your<00:01:32.560> body<00:01:32.800> a<00:01:32.920> little<00:01:33.070> bit

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
have to contort your body a little bit

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.860

to<00:01:33.340> get<00:01:33.460> in<00:01:33.610> there<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:33.970> tell<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.480> spending<00:01:34.840> a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
to get in there I tell you spending a

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.510 
to get in there I tell you spending a
week<00:01:35.020> with<00:01:35.050> this<00:01:35.290> car<00:01:35.530> that's<00:01:36.100> something<00:01:36.460> I

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
week with this car that's something I

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.700 
week with this car that's something I
noticed<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.940> lot<00:01:37.120> and<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:37.930> know<00:01:38.020> I'm<00:01:38.110> 6<00:01:38.380> foot<00:01:38.500> 1
