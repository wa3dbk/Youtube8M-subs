00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
sure about the exposure so you just

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.000 
sure about the exposure so you just
leave<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:21.989> there<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.470> it's<00:03:22.620> sort<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:22.949> like

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010
