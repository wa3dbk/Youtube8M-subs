00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.810
 now I'm going to adjust 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.709
 the mixing screw with the other to make the final idle adjustment 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.029
 remembering that after you can not you give a call in the car 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.029
 but it works 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:15.879
 in the same way as possible 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.850
 hugo for you to make the fine adjustment of the mixture the hot engine also heated 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.039
 at normal working temperature 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.000
 and this one is already in temperature the difference is that I left the 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.199
 mix is â€‹â€‹almost completely open so we're having an excess 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.410
 and then idle my idea the bean and bolt gradually 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.040
 by the time you will notice how thor will start your home 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.370
 from that point I'm going back from a quarter man of the revolution 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 the mixing screw 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.399
 crowther 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:22.780
 let's take one step at a time 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.780
 thus 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.900
 to the side 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.900
 if you did all the correct steps and promoter does not have 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.719
 no disability in the 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.949
 on the ignition portion of the engine valve adjustment will 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.119
 is ready 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.069
 just put the agenda filter 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.889
 my tip is if you put scorer 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.319
 first thing 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.319
 with adjustment of the people performing in the clean part of resignation but never you 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.319
 will get a certain mixture so it needs to be the point 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.359
 I've been too late too late 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.959
 ef 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.659
 a regulation made the way I just signed if you yourself 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.009
 my video of had them the point 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.749
 and carburetor will allow you to be a circuit 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:49.109
 practically 70% city 30% road between 11 and 12 kilometers of the river 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.729
 good quality gasoline 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:52.879
 so that's it 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.219
 I hope he was the only one that everyone if anyone has any 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.369
 Can you send me an email? 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.639
 I'll ask him a question 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.569
 he
