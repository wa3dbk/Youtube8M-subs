00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
we're able to provide an application

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
we're able to provide an application
that<00:01:01.949> works<00:01:02.070> indoors<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.850> outdoors<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.570> when

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that works indoors and outdoors so when

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
that works indoors and outdoors so when
you're<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> treadmill<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.100> app<00:01:05.309> can

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
you're on the treadmill this app can

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.670 
you're on the treadmill this app can
still<00:01:05.790> work<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.240> provide<00:01:06.540> time<00:01:06.990> distance<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
still work and provide time distance and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.649 
still work and provide time distance and
speed<00:01:07.950> recording<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> go

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
speed recording for you but if you go

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
speed recording for you but if you go
outdoors<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.350> has<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> added<00:01:11.070> advantage<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
outdoors it has the added advantage of

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.359 
outdoors it has the added advantage of
using<00:01:11.880> GPS<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.869> map<00:01:13.049> your<00:01:13.080> route<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> can

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
using GPS to map your route so you can

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.240 
using GPS to map your route so you can
always<00:01:14.670> come<00:01:14.939> back<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> relive<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> run<00:01:16.250> in
