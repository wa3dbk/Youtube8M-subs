mountain pine for you this is a minus
chamber<00:00:50.600> which<00:00:51.110> is<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.350> 5<00:00:51.710> needle<00:00:52.129> variety<00:00:52.640> of

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
chamber which is a 5 needle variety of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.930 
chamber which is a 5 needle variety of
pine<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:53.870> grows<00:00:54.140> in<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.559> Italian<00:00:55.010> Alps<00:00:55.129> and

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
pine that grows in the Italian Alps and

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.780 
pine that grows in the Italian Alps and
in<00:00:56.120> through<00:00:56.930> Switzerland<00:00:57.590> as<00:00:57.739> well<00:00:57.769> and<00:00:58.670> it

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
in through Switzerland as well and it

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.850 
in through Switzerland as well and it
grows<00:00:59.000> at<00:00:59.210> very<00:00:59.510> high<00:00:59.629> altitude<00:00:59.839> this<00:01:00.650> tree

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
grows at very high altitude this tree

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.840 
grows at very high altitude this tree
was<00:01:01.010> collected<00:01:01.610> about<00:01:01.870> 10,000<00:01:02.870> feet<00:01:03.850> after

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
was collected about 10,000 feet after

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.340 
was collected about 10,000 feet after
the<00:01:04.940> tree<00:01:05.119> was<00:01:05.269> lifted<00:01:05.659> about<00:01:05.869> four<00:01:06.080> years<00:01:06.229> ago

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
the tree was lifted about four years ago

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.990 
the tree was lifted about four years ago
it's<00:01:06.680> been<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.890> couple<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:07.310> years<00:01:07.369> in<00:01:07.640> its<00:01:07.759> pot

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
it's been a couple of years in its pot

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.930 
it's been a couple of years in its pot
and<00:01:08.240> then<00:01:09.020> we<00:01:09.409> buried<00:01:09.890> this<00:01:10.130> trig<00:01:10.369> completely

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
and then we buried this trig completely

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.609 
and then we buried this trig completely
and<00:01:11.180> put<00:01:11.390> it<00:01:11.479> in<00:01:11.570> some<00:01:11.720> good<00:01:11.930> quality<00:01:12.409> soil

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
and put it in some good quality soil

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.620 
and put it in some good quality soil
since<00:01:13.369> then<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.700> trees<00:01:13.909> come<00:01:14.179> on<00:01:14.300> in<00:01:14.450> leaps

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
since then the trees come on in leaps

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.290 
since then the trees come on in leaps
and<00:01:14.869> bounds<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.740> got<00:01:15.920> big<00:01:16.190> buds<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:16.729> very

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
and bounds it's got big buds it's very

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.760 
and bounds it's got big buds it's very
strong<00:01:17.539> it's<00:01:17.750> very<00:01:17.929> healthy<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.470> it's<00:01:18.590> doing

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
strong it's very healthy and it's doing

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.859 
strong it's very healthy and it's doing
very<00:01:18.890> well<00:01:19.220> so<00:01:19.250> now<00:01:19.729> we<00:01:19.789> want<00:01:19.940> to<00:01:20.330> begin<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.720> get

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
very well so now we want to begin to get

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.980 
very well so now we want to begin to get
some<00:01:21.110> styling<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:21.950> this<00:01:22.100> tree<00:01:22.780> there's<00:01:23.780> not<00:01:23.960> a

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
some styling to this tree there's not a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.660 
some styling to this tree there's not a
great<00:01:24.170> deal<00:01:24.289> of<00:01:24.470> carving<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.160> do<00:01:25.280> here<00:01:25.490> we've

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
great deal of carving to do here we've

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.219 
great deal of carving to do here we've
got<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:26.000> part<00:01:26.300> here<00:01:26.479> where<00:01:26.660> there<00:01:26.840> was<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:26.990> big

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
got this part here where there was a big

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.810 
got this part here where there was a big
root<00:01:27.470> that's<00:01:27.740> obviously<00:01:28.039> been<00:01:28.280> pulled<00:01:28.640> out<00:01:28.759> of

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
root that's obviously been pulled out of

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.370 
root that's obviously been pulled out of
the<00:01:29.000> ground<00:01:29.119> originally<00:01:29.750> in<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.899> mountains

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
the ground originally in the mountains

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.029 
the ground originally in the mountains
and<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:31.490> we've<00:01:31.670> just<00:01:31.910> got<00:01:32.060> one<00:01:32.090> long<00:01:32.630> branch

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
and then we've just got one long branch

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.380 
and then we've just got one long branch
what<00:01:34.039> we've<00:01:34.190> got<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.520> do<00:01:34.670> with<00:01:34.820> this<00:01:34.909> tree<00:01:35.179> now

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
what we've got to do with this tree now

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.270 
what we've got to do with this tree now
is<00:01:35.600> begin<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.080> get<00:01:36.229> some<00:01:36.440> style<00:01:36.710> into<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.130> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
is begin to get some style into it and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.370 
is begin to get some style into it and
that's<00:01:37.429> going<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.850> involve<00:01:38.179> a<00:01:38.509> fairly<00:01:39.140> large

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
that's going to involve a fairly large

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.620 
that's going to involve a fairly large
Bend<00:01:39.800> because<00:01:40.550> all<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.909> foliage<00:01:41.270> on<00:01:41.450> this

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
Bend because all of the foliage on this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.779 
Bend because all of the foliage on this
tree<00:01:41.869> is<00:01:41.899> on<00:01:42.110> one<00:01:42.319> branch<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:43.340> branch<00:01:43.580> has

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
tree is on one branch that branch has

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.430 
tree is on one branch that branch has
got<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.119> be<00:01:44.149> bent<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.690> we<00:01:44.810> can<00:01:44.990> bring<00:01:45.200> some

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
got to be bent so we can bring some

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.740 
got to be bent so we can bring some
foliage<00:01:45.649> up<00:01:45.979> perhaps<00:01:46.250> into<00:01:46.729> here<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.060> a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
foliage up perhaps into here and a

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.810 
foliage up perhaps into here and a
little<00:01:47.899> bit<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.140> carving<00:01:48.680> as<00:01:48.829> you've<00:01:49.399> seen<00:01:49.670> us

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
little bit of carving as you've seen us

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.870 
little bit of carving as you've seen us
do<00:01:50.000> many<00:01:50.240> times<00:01:50.540> before<00:01:51.250> from<00:01:52.250> this<00:01:52.369> angle<00:01:52.430> you

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
do many times before from this angle you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.219 
do many times before from this angle you
can<00:01:53.030> really<00:01:53.270> see<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.450> challenge<00:01:53.960> that<00:01:54.020> we

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
can really see the challenge that we

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.499 
can really see the challenge that we
have<00:01:54.439> with<00:01:54.649> this<00:01:54.799> material<00:01:55.009> in<00:01:55.520> as<00:01:55.909> much<00:01:56.119> as<00:01:56.360> we

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
have with this material in as much as we

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.359 
have with this material in as much as we
have<00:01:56.659> this<00:01:56.810> nice<00:01:57.079> old<00:01:57.320> branch<00:01:57.649> here<00:01:57.979> which<00:01:58.189> is

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
have this nice old branch here which is

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.069 
have this nice old branch here which is
cracked<00:01:58.700> halfway<00:01:59.180> through<00:01:59.479> at<00:01:59.600> this<00:01:59.750> point

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
cracked halfway through at this point

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.350 
cracked halfway through at this point
and<00:02:00.950> then<00:02:01.130> all<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.430> rest<00:02:01.549> of<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.820> foliage<00:02:02.149> is

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
and then all the rest of the foliage is

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.990 
and then all the rest of the foliage is
over<00:02:03.140> here<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:04.100> obviously<00:02:04.219> we've<00:02:04.610> got<00:02:04.850> to

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
over here and obviously we've got to

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.399 
over here and obviously we've got to
bend<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.390> forwards<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.020> that's<00:02:06.170> going<00:02:06.350> to

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
bend that forwards and that's going to

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.719 
bend that forwards and that's going to
be<00:02:06.469> a<00:02:06.500> little<00:02:06.710> bit<00:02:06.890> tricky<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.280> do<00:02:07.549> because

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
be a little bit tricky to do because

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.759 
be a little bit tricky to do because
we've<00:02:08.060> got<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.420> old<00:02:08.630> break<00:02:09.049> through<00:02:09.470> here

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
we've got this old break through here

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.500 
we've got this old break through here
which<00:02:10.280> has<00:02:10.399> gone<00:02:10.610> halfway<00:02:10.880> through<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
which has gone halfway through the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.900 
which has gone halfway through the
original<00:02:11.900> Trump<00:02:12.200> now<00:02:12.739> we've<00:02:12.950> got<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.400> support

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
original Trump now we've got to support

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.240 
original Trump now we've got to support
that<00:02:13.970> very<00:02:14.299> carefully<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:14.989> move<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.040> bend

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that very carefully and move the bend

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.460 
that very carefully and move the bend
along<00:02:16.579> to<00:02:17.030> bring<00:02:17.269> this<00:02:17.420> part<00:02:17.750> up<00:02:17.900> from<00:02:18.350> that

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
along to bring this part up from that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.509 
along to bring this part up from that
point<00:02:18.709> on<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.070> should<00:02:19.220> be<00:02:19.310> fairly

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
point on it should be fairly

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.160 
point on it should be fairly
straightforward<00:02:20.269> just<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.600> position<00:02:21.049> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
straightforward just to position the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.229 
straightforward just to position the
branches<00:02:21.650> because<00:02:22.040> fortunately<00:02:22.640> chamber<00:02:23.120> is

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
branches because fortunately chamber is

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.690 
branches because fortunately chamber is
nice<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.750> soft<00:02:24.049> is<00:02:24.230> very<00:02:24.500> flexible<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:25.250> very

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
nice and soft is very flexible and very

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.620 
nice and soft is very flexible and very
easy<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.150> bend<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.970> first<00:02:29.239> thing<00:02:29.390> we're<00:02:29.510> going

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
easy to bend the first thing we're going

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.449 
easy to bend the first thing we're going
to<00:02:29.690> do<00:02:29.870> with<00:02:30.019> this<00:02:30.170> material<00:02:30.709> is<00:02:30.799> begin<00:02:31.160> to

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
to do with this material is begin to

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.289 
to do with this material is begin to
remove<00:02:32.120> all<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.600> old<00:02:32.750> dead<00:02:33.019> bug<00:02:34.030> with<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.060> point

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
remove all the old dead bug with a point

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.819 
remove all the old dead bug with a point
like<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.540> when<00:02:35.840> it's<00:02:35.989> been<00:02:36.140> cut<00:02:36.380> back<00:02:36.530> from<00:02:36.739> a

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
like this when it's been cut back from a

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.560 
like this when it's been cut back from a
much<00:02:36.980> bigger<00:02:37.250> tree<00:02:37.519> it's<00:02:37.700> very<00:02:37.850> typical<00:02:38.030> that

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
much bigger tree it's very typical that

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.170 
much bigger tree it's very typical that
a<00:02:39.109> lot<00:02:39.560> on<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.739> bark<00:02:39.950> begins<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.489> dry<00:02:40.730> out<00:02:40.940> and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
a lot on the bark begins to dry out and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.840 
a lot on the bark begins to dry out and
die<00:02:41.290> back<00:02:42.290> naturally<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.190> want<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.459> start<00:02:43.519> to

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
die back naturally so I want to start to

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.970 
die back naturally so I want to start to
clean<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.329> all<00:02:44.540> back<00:02:44.780> where<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.470> cuts<00:02:45.709> are

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
clean this all back where the cuts are

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.770 
clean this all back where the cuts are
in<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.280> train<00:02:46.519> so<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.060> forth<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.480> we<00:02:47.600> can

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
in the train so on so forth so we can

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.330 
in the train so on so forth so we can
begin<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.079> see<00:02:48.200> what's<00:02:48.560> actually<00:02:48.709> alive<00:02:49.130> on

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
begin to see what's actually alive on

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.990 
begin to see what's actually alive on
what's<00:02:49.519> dead<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.820> then<00:02:50.720> we

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
what's dead and then we

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:31.600 
what's dead and then we
what<00:02:51.180> we've<00:02:51.360> got<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.540> work<00:02:51.690> with<00:02:52.050> exactly

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610
