00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hi guys with you djinnis and today i am 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.240
 I have prepared another stream for you 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.910
 information about call of duty gauss and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.809
 I remind you that we have already seen a teaser trailer 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.780
 new part 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.660
 and the game itself will show us the other day 21 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.260
 May at the microsoft event we will also see 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.689
 new xbox durango infinite 720 call 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.850
 as you want and also want to note that this 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.800
 not the first video cool beauty voice on 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.840
 my channel so if you missed 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.420
 previous videos never late 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.360
 see them what are you going today 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.870
 speech I decided to combine two news a 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.540
 rather 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.969
 news one rumor in one video since 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.410
 essentially they are interrelated and today we 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.090
 touch on the subject of the plot 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.070
 for starters, I would like to talk about 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.989
 characters at first I did not pay 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.000
 attention to one detail which is essentially 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.160
 flashed in the trailer itself and 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.800
 never paying attention to everyones 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.879
 Easter eggs and stuff as I look at 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.329
 most things 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.770
 quite superficially and only later 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.530
 some time i'm really starting 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.600
 process all received information 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.479
 I digest it in my head but speech 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.400
 not about that go to the details and how you 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.650
 remember if you of course watched 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 teaser trailer and at the end of the video on our 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.869
 6 characters appeared on the screens. 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.580
 pretentiously stood and looked into the camera 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.130
 we have already seen one of them for sure 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.259
 depicted on the supposed god start 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.210
 New game that remind for the first time 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.340
 appeared on the site melancholy and by the way i 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 sure that this is a character who 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.229
 late teaser and fires fire and clothes 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.939
 mask the rest of the five not counting 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.640
 dogs of course were left without much 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.590
 attention in a number of regions for pre-order 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.869
 games you can get exclusive 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.990
 poster to the wall in the room on this 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.409
 the poster also shows the characters and 6 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.869
 some motto way a way per year we all have 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.329
 we have and each of them has its own 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.280
 image if I may say so or 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.189
 responsible for something specific for example 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.740
 one wears a mask with a skull like it was 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.170
 shown in the trailer maybe he's ideological 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.640
 the mastermind is painfully strong on him 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.979
 concentrated attention 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.700
 another generally wears some kind of protective 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.799
 helmets 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.819
 maybe likes to blow everything to hell 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.999
 mother 3 put on a respirator and maybe he 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.540
 loves to paint everything find know if 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.849
 honest 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.280
 In principle, but obviously in my head 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.469
 Immediately comes the idea that these people are not 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.569
 just like that I am probably not 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:26.269
 some kind of team or just 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.849
 united by the general idea that essentially one and 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.969
 the same this main character and teaser 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.340
 the main character of the game why not here 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.079
 I would like to go to 2 leaks that 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.689
 it seems to me with a high probability 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.430
 may be true I would like 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.310
 talk directly to the plot 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.409
 single player campaign and my source 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.849
 if you can call it that though I don’t 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.790
 like how it sounds it sounds 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.980
 somehow by a gangster and so here's my 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.569
 the source told me that opportunity 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.599
 the plot will be built to combat 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.739
 system once again by the way 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.900
 presumably, again, the price dialogue 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.609
 a layer of supposedly a squad of six 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.530
 the man is trying to fight the regime in 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.659
 state government completely 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.609
 controls people and completely 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.340
 control the army and weapons in general 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.840
 so on all the weapons of the new generation 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.209
 installed fingerprint scanner 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.159
 or something else and just passing here 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.900
 a similar test you can shoot from 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.519
 one or another of our guns 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.250
 the alleged main character uses 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.620
 weapons of the present time for example by all 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.169
 favorite like on which similar scanners 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.699
 not yet because they are our team 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.889
 is rebel 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:33.620
 as you remember in the first video of call of 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.959
 duty gus I said that the events of the game will be 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.049
 take place in the near future before 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.189
 2025 anyway it's a small 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.319
 flashback black ops 2 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.909
 but by the same to give us will give 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.229
 only from modern weapons without 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.000
 any lotions or 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:49.250
 improvements in principle in this 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.359
 plan the facts converge but again 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.729
 information has not been confirmed 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.919
 officially so i wouldn't do 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:56.629
 some early conclusions so here's how i 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:59.090
 already said the government completely 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.849
 controls the population and apparently people 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.909
 it is not at all like relying on these 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.739
 ideas and loner built and now i would 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.810
 I wanted to share with you my opinion and 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.500
 their own guesses about the storyline 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.019
 parts of the game 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.599
 if you don't mind of course and how can I 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.509
 it seems the word goust is not without reason present 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.849
 in the title is an obvious fact that 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.779
 a group of six or some 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.139
 maybe more 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.999
 fighting 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.680
 with the ruling regime will be hiding from 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:27.569
 governments maybe by the way this is 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.210
 the reason why some of them are wearing 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.610
 masks in order not to show their faces to 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.009
 it was harder to find such ghosts 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.080
 which are not visible to the eyes of the state and 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.060
 i remember some time ago i read 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.129
 that the plot of call of duty goust will 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.499
 built on squad history to member 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.620
 which was gust a famous character and 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:48.749
 from the fr 2 mode to hit the gang 141 but 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.050
 somehow the assumption that was announced 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:54.569
 A little earlier, I personally like much 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.330
 more and seems more promising then 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.939
 what military situations or prewar 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.310
 I am bored with some sort of situation 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:04.550
 they are not interesting to me at all than 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.650
 similar underground fight with something 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.080
 superior to you at times 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.029
 many ardent fans of the mv series also often 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.729
 wrote about the possible return of the guest 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:17.969
 because he is such a cool character and his 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.849
 not at all killed and not planted on it 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:23.099
 some wetsuit who protected him 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.740
 from a bullet and bullets didn’t get into 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:28.169
 his chest hit his shoulder somewhere else 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.810
 not burned out then since cyber suit was 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.669
 fire resistant 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.860
 blah blah blah nobody naturally canceled 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.020
 and a similar epic comeback but I 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.360
 still as i said lean towards 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.039
 option to combat the regime is true i'm afraid 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.960
 suggest on what will still be 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.909
 built multiplayer after all always in Coke 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.539
 beauty battling teams were 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:50.610
 For example, squad Wait and rebels right there I 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.500
 plainly even afraid to imagine how 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.319
 developers want to link multiplayer 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.719
 single-player but let's see and see 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.819
 I am very interested to know that you 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:01.680
 have read about loners on the internet also 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.960
 interesting your guesses and opinions on 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.539
 about the storyline 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.639
 feel free to write all your ideas in 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.979
 comments are discussing this topic 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.449
 just do not go to the person and I 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.009
 be sure to read everything and maybe 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.740
 I'll announce something in the next video and 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:20.159
