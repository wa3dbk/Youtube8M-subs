in<00:05:24.800> composition<00:05:25.800> as<00:05:25.889> well<00:05:26.039> but<00:05:26.130> I<00:05:26.250> like<00:05:26.460> him<00:05:26.610> as

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
in composition as well but I like him as

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.700 
in composition as well but I like him as
a<00:05:26.760> striker<00:05:27.060> out<00:05:27.270> on<00:05:27.389> our<00:05:27.510> striker<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:28.110> paid<00:05:28.620> him

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
a striker out on our striker I paid him

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.350 
a striker out on our striker I paid him
in<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.860> 4-3<00:05:29.070> free<00:05:29.460> formation<00:05:30.000> we're<00:05:30.090> gonna<00:05:30.180> go

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
in a 4-3 free formation we're gonna go

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.600 
in a 4-3 free formation we're gonna go
on<00:05:30.389> to<00:05:30.720> his<00:05:30.810> cons<00:05:31.080> now<00:05:31.350> and<00:05:32.010> the<00:05:32.160> only<00:05:32.280> con<00:05:32.490> I've

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
on to his cons now and the only con I've

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.980 
on to his cons now and the only con I've
got<00:05:32.760> from<00:05:32.910> his<00:05:33.030> squad's<00:05:33.389> basically<00:05:33.840> what<00:05:33.960> i

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
got from his squad's basically what i

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.750 
got from his squad's basically what i
mean<00:05:34.169> by<00:05:34.289> that<00:05:34.320> is<00:05:34.650> he's<00:05:34.860> difficult<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.520> link

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
mean by that is he's difficult to link

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.100 
mean by that is he's difficult to link
into<00:05:36.030> like<00:05:36.150> hybrids<00:05:36.570> and<00:05:36.690> teams<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.020> less

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
into like hybrids and teams and less

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.430 
into like hybrids and teams and less
it'll<00:05:37.320> be<00:05:37.380> Scott<00:05:37.889> scottish<00:05:38.490> program

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
it'll be Scott scottish program

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.300 
it'll be Scott scottish program
championship<00:05:40.440> teams<00:05:40.680> to<00:05:40.770> come<00:05:40.889> i<00:05:41.010> thought<00:05:41.280> i

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
championship teams to come i thought i

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.620 
championship teams to come i thought i
made<00:05:41.550> a<00:05:41.580> pretty<00:05:41.789> good<00:05:41.880> high<00:05:42.060> bit<00:05:42.240> around<00:05:42.419> there

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
made a pretty good high bit around there

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.510 
made a pretty good high bit around there
but<00:05:42.720> it<00:05:42.780> is<00:05:42.870> difficult<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.380> link<00:05:43.620> in<00:05:43.740> teams<00:05:43.979> you

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
but it is difficult to link in teams you

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.700 
but it is difficult to link in teams you
know<00:05:44.550> unless<00:05:44.789> you<00:05:45.020> use<00:05:46.020> players<00:05:46.260> around<00:05:46.440> like

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
know unless you use players around like

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.750 
know unless you use players around like
the<00:05:46.800> leads<00:05:46.979> players<00:05:47.250> said<00:05:47.430> if<00:05:47.520> there's<00:05:47.729> a

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
the leads players said if there's a

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.650 
the leads players said if there's a
couple<00:05:47.940> of<00:05:48.030> good<00:05:48.120> leads<00:05:48.300> players<00:05:48.539> obviously

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
couple of good leads players obviously

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.540 
couple of good leads players obviously
but<00:05:49.410> if<00:05:49.470> you<00:05:49.560> don't<00:05:49.680> wanna<00:05:49.800> do<00:05:49.919> that<00:05:49.950> and<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.430> is

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
but if you don't wanna do that and it is

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.920 
but if you don't wanna do that and it is

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.200 
disco I still think he'll be around 50k
but<00:06:03.530> that's<00:06:04.530> me<00:06:04.770> its<00:06:04.919> overall<00:06:05.160> rating<00:06:05.639> little

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210
