any form of magnetic cover so it does

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.100 
any form of magnetic cover so it does
wrap<00:02:42.320> open<00:02:42.850> front<00:02:43.850> posed<00:02:44.180> quite<00:02:44.690> easily<00:02:44.870> if

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
back curve that you can't power off so

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.259 
back curve that you can't power off so
much<00:04:07.220> or<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.030> easy<00:04:08.209> sorry<00:04:08.540> but<00:04:10.120> opening<00:04:11.120> this

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
much or so easy sorry but opening this

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.590 
much or so easy sorry but opening this
turns<00:04:11.540> on<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.560> can<00:04:12.680> probably<00:04:12.890> see<00:04:13.040> if<00:04:13.340> we

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.010 

slowly<00:04:16.600> they<00:04:17.200> go<00:04:17.380> turned<00:04:17.920> off<00:04:21.000> off<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.990> I

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
slowly they go turned off off so I

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.300 
slowly they go turned off off so I
realized<00:04:23.350> that<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.620> don't<00:04:23.770> have<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.190> use<00:04:24.280> a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
realized that you don't have to use a

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.230 
realized that you don't have to use a
power<00:04:24.550> but<00:04:25.110> there<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.230> go<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:30.100> this<00:04:30.250> is<00:04:30.430> 2495

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
power but there you go so this is 2495

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.120 
power but there you go so this is 2495

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
for mobile phone duck call UK so these

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.040 
for mobile phone duck call UK so these
are<00:04:33.310> probably<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.000> bit<00:04:34.210> more<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.390> an<00:04:34.480> expensive
