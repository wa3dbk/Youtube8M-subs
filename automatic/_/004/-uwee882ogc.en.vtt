transparent tip at the end though so

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.810 
transparent tip at the end though so

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
can see exactly where the data is what's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.190 
can see exactly where the data is what's
the<00:00:57.560> main<00:00:58.300> benefit<00:00:59.300> of<00:00:59.450> having<00:00:59.570> this<00:00:59.810> one<00:01:00.020> over

the other one but you do have to be a
bit<00:01:02.150> more<00:01:02.270> upright<00:01:02.780> I<00:01:03.140> guess<00:01:03.800> this<00:01:03.950> one's<00:01:04.129> more

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
for display purposes basically this is

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.140

the pogo sketch stylus this soil is soft

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.000 
the pogo sketch stylus this soil is soft
in<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:32.870> does<00:01:33.050> feel<00:01:33.620> quite<00:01:33.860> comfortable

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
in so it does feel quite comfortable

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
you can fit in pretty much any angle

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.210 
you can fit in pretty much any angle
still<00:01:42.770> right<00:01:43.479> but<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.600> do<00:01:44.720> have<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.220> press

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
still right but you do have to press

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.060 
still right but you do have to press
down<00:01:46.250> quite<00:01:46.729> harden<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.150> so<00:01:47.300> if<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:47.540> like

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
down quite harden it so if you like

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.620 
down quite harden it so if you like
doing<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.190> just<00:01:49.460> very<00:01:49.729> lightly<00:01:49.970> sometimes<00:01:50.540> we

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
doing it just very lightly sometimes we

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.920 
doing it just very lightly sometimes we
won't<00:01:50.780> pick<00:01:50.900> it<00:01:51.020> up<00:01:51.140> but<00:01:52.360> generally<00:01:53.360> it's<00:01:53.659> very

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
won't pick it up but generally it's very

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.260 
won't pick it up but generally it's very
comfortable<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.650> bit<00:01:54.950> thin<00:01:55.190> for<00:01:55.940> my<00:01:56.150> liking

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
comfortable is a bit thin for my liking

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.200 
comfortable is a bit thin for my liking
but<00:01:56.780> it's<00:01:57.620> good<00:01:57.860> for<00:01:58.100> just<00:01:58.430> writing<00:01:59.030> and

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
but it's good for just writing and

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.389 
but it's good for just writing and
drawing<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.690> that<00:01:59.780> kind<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.049> thing

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
drawing and that kind of thing

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.550 
drawing and that kind of thing
this<00:02:01.420> stylist<00:02:02.420> has<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.899> hard<00:02:03.110> tip<00:02:03.320> of

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
this stylist has the hard tip of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.190 
this stylist has the hard tip of
transparent<00:02:04.100> end<00:02:04.219> it's<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.149> bit<00:02:05.270> thicker<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:05.960> it

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
transparent end it's a bit thicker so it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.400 
transparent end it's a bit thicker so it
feels<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.619> bit<00:02:06.649> more<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.159> an<00:02:07.369> actual<00:02:07.520> pen<00:02:07.909> I

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
feels a bit more like an actual pen I

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.650 
feels a bit more like an actual pen I
think<00:02:09.410> it's<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.560> bit<00:02:09.649> more<00:02:09.769> comfortable

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
think it's a bit more comfortable

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.030 
think it's a bit more comfortable
transparent<00:02:11.660> end<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.470> advantage<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.860> this

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
transparent end the advantage of this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.350 
transparent end the advantage of this
but<00:02:13.250> especially<00:02:13.430> when<00:02:13.670> you're<00:02:13.849> sketching<00:02:14.090> is

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
but especially when you're sketching is

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.440 
but especially when you're sketching is
you<00:02:14.540> can<00:02:14.690> see<00:02:14.720> through<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:16.269> exactly<00:02:17.269> where

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
you can see through to exactly where

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.910 
you can see through to exactly where
you're<00:02:17.569> going<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.750> draw<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.170> it's<00:02:18.319> an<00:02:18.410> accurate

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
you're going to draw so it's an accurate

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.449 
you're going to draw so it's an accurate
so<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:20.030> follows<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.349> Reds<00:02:21.560> are<00:02:21.739> pretty

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
so it follows the Reds are pretty

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.390 
so it follows the Reds are pretty
accurately<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:24.319> this<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.739> important<00:02:25.220> wing

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
accurately so this is important wing

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.740 
accurately so this is important wing
like<00:02:25.610> sketching<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.150> thing<00:02:26.300> as<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.480> can<00:02:26.599> see

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
like sketching a thing as you can see

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.960 
like sketching a thing as you can see
exactly<00:02:26.959> what<00:02:27.260> are<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.440> drawing<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.310> it's

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
exactly what are you drawing and so it's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.620 
exactly what are you drawing and so it's
very<00:02:29.540> accurate<00:02:29.810> but<00:02:31.150> problem<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.269> this<00:02:32.390> one

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
very accurate but problem with this one

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.559 
very accurate but problem with this one
is<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.340> obviously<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.459> end<00:02:34.849> is<00:02:35.030> bigger<00:02:35.269> and

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
is it obviously the end is bigger and

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.539 
is it obviously the end is bigger and
it's<00:02:36.200> opaque<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.769> yet<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:36.980> press<00:02:37.160> down<00:02:37.190> quite

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
it's opaque and yet to press down quite

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.670 
it's opaque and yet to press down quite
hard<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.480> you're<00:02:38.690> not<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:39.140> hundred<00:02:39.470> percent

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
hard so you're not a hundred percent

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.390 
hard so you're not a hundred percent
sure<00:02:40.330> exactly<00:02:41.330> where<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> line<00:02:42.799> is<00:02:43.069> going

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
sure exactly where to the line is going

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.390 
sure exactly where to the line is going
to<00:02:43.519> be<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:45.140> doesn't<00:02:45.530> make<00:02:45.799> that<00:02:46.010> much<00:02:46.069> of<00:02:46.250> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
to be it doesn't make that much of a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.710 
to be it doesn't make that much of a
difference<00:02:46.430> on<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.849> simple<00:02:47.180> app<00:02:47.269> like<00:02:47.420> this<00:02:47.569> but

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
difference on a simple app like this but

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.880 
difference on a simple app like this but
if<00:02:47.810> you're<00:02:48.019> heavily<00:02:48.170> into<00:02:48.530> your<00:02:48.650> sketchy

if you're heavily into your sketchy

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.370 
if you're heavily into your sketchy

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
enjoying and zooming in a lot of a kind

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.100 
enjoying and zooming in a lot of a kind
of<00:02:51.410> thing<00:02:51.590> it's<00:02:51.769> quite<00:02:52.099> noticeable<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.810> for

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110
