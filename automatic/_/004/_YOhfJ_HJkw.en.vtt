all right so I record
so<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.240> plane<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.720> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
so so this plane is a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.640 
so so this plane is a
we<00:00:11.700> based<00:00:11.969> ace<00:00:12.959> littlest<00:00:13.530> stick<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:14.959> and<00:00:15.959> all

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
we based ace littlest stick this and all

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.400 
we based ace littlest stick this and all
that's<00:00:17.090> what<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.300> covered<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.720> now

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
that's what is that covered with now

so basically inkjet refill refill harsh
to<00:00:36.960> die<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.789> together<00:00:38.789> the<00:00:39.210> urethane<00:00:39.510> well

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
to die to be together the urethane well

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.670 
to die to be together the urethane well
so<00:00:41.039> you<00:00:41.100> know<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.870> died<00:00:43.199> the

hairy<00:01:18.409> okay<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:24.119> 3/4<00:01:24.780> size<00:01:25.520> what<00:01:26.520> I

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
hairy okay this 3/4 size what I

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.779 
hairy okay this 3/4 size what I
described<00:01:29.399> bolted<00:01:30.170> 3/4<00:01:31.170> size<00:01:31.459> made<00:01:32.459> a<00:01:32.490> few

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
described bolted 3/4 size made a few

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.410 
described bolted 3/4 size made a few
modifications<00:01:33.469> and<00:01:34.880> how<00:01:35.880> they<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
modifications and how they don't the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.989

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
structure but the the basic framework

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:44.199 
structure but the the basic framework
and<00:01:39.600> shape<00:01:39.979> or<00:01:40.979> things<00:01:41.310> are

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:02:02.230 

Caleta<00:01:45.209> some<00:01:45.749> died<00:01:47.119> so<00:01:52.340> yellow<00:01:53.340> dye<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.179> the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.959 

did<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.390> pretty<00:02:03.810> much<00:02:04.079> if<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.640> saw<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.700> other

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
did it pretty much if you saw the other

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.880 
did it pretty much if you saw the other
time<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.079> don't<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:09.560> there's<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.679> bigger

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
time so if I don't have there's a bigger

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.400 
time so if I don't have there's a bigger
