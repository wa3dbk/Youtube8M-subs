00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.939 
will Johnson and he went out into the
field<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.289> learn<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.470> little<00:00:16.619> bit<00:00:16.830> about

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
field to learn a little bit about

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.620 
field to learn a little bit about
grilling<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.580> right<00:00:17.760> yeah<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.090> know<00:00:18.449> in

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
grilling is that right yeah I know in

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.240 
grilling is that right yeah I know in
dnews<00:00:18.869> we<00:00:19.289> care<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> science<00:00:19.949> behind

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
dnews we care about the science behind

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.000 
dnews we care about the science behind
everything<00:00:20.789> right<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:22.230> looked<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
everything right so we looked at the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.259 
everything right so we looked at the
idea<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:23.550> would<00:00:23.640> fill<00:00:23.910> people<00:00:24.180> with

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
idea is that we would fill people with

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.730 
idea is that we would fill people with
knowledge<00:00:24.600> about<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.930> science<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.410> grilling

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
knowledge about the science of grilling

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.019 
knowledge about the science of grilling
not<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:26.070> throwing<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> patty<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> grill

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
not just throwing a patty on the grill

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.880 
not just throwing a patty on the grill
but<00:00:27.359> knowing<00:00:27.570> what's<00:00:27.720> happening<00:00:28.109> inside<00:00:28.320> that

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
but knowing what's happening inside that

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.560 
but knowing what's happening inside that
burger<00:00:29.220> patty<00:00:29.429> that's<00:00:29.670> right<00:00:29.939> well<00:00:30.090> cooking

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
burger patty that's right well cooking

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.569 
burger patty that's right well cooking
is<00:00:30.750> actually<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> common<00:00:31.800> form<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> chemistry

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is actually a common form of chemistry

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.910 
is actually a common form of chemistry
we're<00:00:32.940> forcing<00:00:33.239> our<00:00:33.480> foods<00:00:33.780> into<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.440> chemical

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
we're forcing our foods into a chemical

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.650 
we're forcing our foods into a chemical
change<00:00:35.270> scientists<00:00:36.270> think<00:00:36.420> we've<00:00:36.540> been

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
change scientists think we've been

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.150 
change scientists think we've been
cooking<00:00:36.989> food<00:00:37.170> since<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.530> finally<00:00:37.860> harnessed

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
cooking food since we finally harnessed

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040 
cooking food since we finally harnessed
fire<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.610> 400,000<00:00:39.570> years<00:00:39.690> ago

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
fire like 400,000 years ago

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.810 
fire like 400,000 years ago
cooking<00:00:40.350> food<00:00:40.500> adds<00:00:40.710> flavor<00:00:41.040> sure<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
cooking food adds flavor sure but it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.119 
cooking food adds flavor sure but it
also<00:00:42.059> removes<00:00:42.510> bacteria<00:00:42.750> makes<00:00:43.440> food<00:00:43.649> easier

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
also removes bacteria makes food easier

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.950 
also removes bacteria makes food easier
to<00:00:44.280> digest<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.879> helped<00:00:45.270> us<00:00:45.360> feed<00:00:45.539> our<00:00:45.660> larger

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to digest and helped us feed our larger

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.330 
to digest and helped us feed our larger
and<00:00:46.079> larger<00:00:46.170> brain<00:00:46.559> by<00:00:46.710> providing<00:00:47.039> more

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
and larger brain by providing more

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.100 
and larger brain by providing more
calories<00:00:47.940> we've<00:00:48.270> even<00:00:48.539> found<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.989> earth

them<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.239> did<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:51.809> floss<00:00:52.230> well<00:00:52.500> what's

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
them they did not floss well what's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
them they did not floss well what's
actually<00:00:52.980> happening<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.820> fibers<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
actually happening to the fibers and the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.340 
actually happening to the fibers and the
meat<00:00:54.870> itself

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
meat itself

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
meat itself
well<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.489> freaking<00:00:56.789> down<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> mean

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
well it's freaking down right I mean

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.299 
well it's freaking down right I mean
it's<00:00:57.660> breaking<00:00:57.960> down<00:00:58.109> briskets<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.949> really

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it's breaking down briskets a really

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.090 
it's breaking down briskets a really
good<00:00:59.489> example<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.899> brisket<00:01:01.260> off<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> cow<00:01:01.710> which

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
good example the brisket off a cow which

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.549 
good example the brisket off a cow which
is<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> classic<00:01:03.149> meat<00:01:03.600> cut<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.110> used<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
is a classic meat cut that's used in

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.310 
is a classic meat cut that's used in
barbecue<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.729> working<00:01:06.210> muscle<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
barbecue it's a working muscle and and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.760 
barbecue it's a working muscle and and
so<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> result<00:01:09.180> those<00:01:09.840> collagen<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
so as a result those collagen is that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.620 
so as a result those collagen is that
connective<00:01:11.250> tissue<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.850> needs<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:12.540> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
connective tissue it needs to be at a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.210 
connective tissue it needs to be at a
high<00:01:12.840> temperature<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> certain<00:01:13.979> period<00:01:14.100> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
tender also what happens in that process

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.200 
tender also what happens in that process
there's<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.890> lot<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.250> fat<00:01:20.580> that's<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.000> that
