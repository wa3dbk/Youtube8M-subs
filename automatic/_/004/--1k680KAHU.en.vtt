to<00:01:53.490> late<00:01:54.390> 50s<00:01:55.079> early<00:01:55.409> 60s<00:01:55.649> I'm<00:01:56.430> guessing<00:01:57.390> in

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
to late 50s early 60s I'm guessing in

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.929 
to late 50s early 60s I'm guessing in
the<00:01:57.630> 50s<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.290> what<00:01:58.469> I'm<00:01:58.590> gonna<00:01:58.710> guess<00:01:58.979> I'll

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the 50s is what I'm gonna guess I'll

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.450 
the 50s is what I'm gonna guess I'll
lift<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:00.899> made<00:02:01.140> them<00:02:01.259> from<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.799> 30s

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
lift it up they made them from the 30s

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.510 
lift it up they made them from the 30s
up<00:02:02.790> into<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> 80s<00:02:03.719> but<00:02:04.649> judging<00:02:05.219> from<00:02:05.340> this

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
up into the 80s but judging from this

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.240 
up into the 80s but judging from this
just<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> material<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.500> aging<00:02:08.039> I'm

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
just the material and the aging I'm

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.120 
just the material and the aging I'm
gonna<00:02:08.520> say<00:02:08.759> 50s<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.959> what<00:02:10.170> I'm<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> say

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
gonna say 50s is what I'm going to say

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.370 
gonna say 50s is what I'm going to say

that that's a brand that they would just

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.440 
they put on their knives don't know why
I<00:03:24.210> guess<00:03:24.420> just<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.810> sell<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.260> or<00:03:25.380> something<00:03:25.770> but

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
I guess just to sell it or something but

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.300 
I guess just to sell it or something but
some<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.600> older<00:03:27.900> ones<00:03:28.020> older<00:03:28.980> than<00:03:29.160> this

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
some of the older ones older than this

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.620 
some of the older ones older than this
actually<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.760> think<00:03:29.850> some<00:03:30.210> of<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.360> ones<00:03:30.540> from

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
actually I think some of the ones from

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.680 
actually I think some of the ones from
the<00:03:30.720> thirties<00:03:31.200> didn't<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.770> anything<00:03:31.980> just

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
blank that's why I wish this one was

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.890 
blank that's why I wish this one was
