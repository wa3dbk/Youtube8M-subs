so many people think of creativity in

you<00:00:42.080> already<00:00:42.230> know<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.160> we're<00:00:43.400> real

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
you already know and so we're real

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.060 
you already know and so we're real
innovation<00:00:44.180> comes<00:00:44.420> in<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:44.930> getting<00:00:45.650> those

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
innovation comes in is getting those

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.490 
innovation comes in is getting those
things<00:00:46.460> that<00:00:46.699> are<00:00:46.790> unknown<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.540> so<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:48.110> have

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
things that are unknown and so you have

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.930 
things that are unknown and so you have
to<00:00:49.239> restructure<00:00:50.239> Andrey<00:00:50.690> alter<00:00:51.940> your

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
to restructure Andrey alter your

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.080 
to restructure Andrey alter your
perception<00:00:53.329> art<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.530> communicated<00:00:55.460> via<00:00:55.820> the

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
perception art is communicated via the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.799 
perception art is communicated via the
senses<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:56.780> these<00:00:57.739> senses<00:00:58.370> are<00:00:58.809> invisible

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
senses and these senses are invisible

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.420 
senses and these senses are invisible
and<00:01:00.340> so<00:01:01.340> how<00:01:01.880> do<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.710> communicate<00:01:03.710> those

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
and so how do you communicate those

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.889 
and so how do you communicate those
sensibilities<00:01:04.910> to<00:01:05.449> another<00:01:05.690> human<00:01:05.869> being<00:01:06.259> and

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
sensibilities to another human being and

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.980 
sensibilities to another human being and
backgrounds<00:01:08.899> are<00:01:09.020> totally<00:01:09.350> different

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
backgrounds are totally different

cultures<00:01:11.990> are<00:01:12.229> totally<00:01:12.590> different<00:01:12.740> but<00:01:13.670> there

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
cultures are totally different but there

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.490 
cultures are totally different but there
are<00:01:13.850> there<00:01:14.390> is<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.720> fundamental<00:01:17.350> fabric<00:01:18.350> of

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
are there is the fundamental fabric of

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.520 
are there is the fundamental fabric of
our<00:01:18.560> humanity<00:01:19.600> because<00:01:20.600> my<00:01:20.780> work<00:01:21.020> changes

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
our humanity because my work changes

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.499 
our humanity because my work changes
quite<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.800> bit<00:01:22.069> there's<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.340> whole<00:01:22.550> spectrum<00:01:23.209> of

that<00:01:40.099> that's<00:01:40.700> your<00:01:40.970> work<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.110> what<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:42.979> is

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
that that's your work so what it is is

those those those invisible
sensibilities<00:01:47.630> come<00:01:47.959> to<00:01:48.110> play<00:01:48.349> I<00:01:48.789> went

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
sensibilities come to play I went

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.150 
sensibilities come to play I went
through<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.720> formal<00:01:51.440> art<00:01:51.590> school<00:01:51.860> training

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
through a a formal art school training

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.809 
through a a formal art school training
we<00:01:52.940> did<00:01:53.149> drawing<00:01:53.869> printmaking<00:01:54.819> ceramics

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
we did drawing printmaking ceramics

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.859 
we did drawing printmaking ceramics
painting<00:01:56.569> and<00:01:57.490> after<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.520> had<00:01:58.819> experienced<00:01:59.599> all

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
painting and after I had experienced all

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.229 
painting and after I had experienced all
of<00:01:59.899> these<00:02:00.200> these<00:02:00.739> processes<00:02:01.429> I<00:02:02.229> ended<00:02:03.229> up

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
of these these processes I ended up

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:08.529 
of these these processes I ended up
going<00:02:05.239> with<00:02:05.270> metal<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:07.130> always<00:02:08.090> wondered

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
going with metal and I always wondered

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.770 
going with metal and I always wondered
why<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.229> gravitated<00:02:09.979> one<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.789> other<00:02:10.819> I

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
why I gravitated one to the other I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.130 
why I gravitated one to the other I
don't<00:02:12.650> know<00:02:12.739> if<00:02:12.860> you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
don't know if you

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.440 
don't know if you
pick<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.350> or<00:02:15.710> not<00:02:15.830> but<00:02:16.160> then<00:02:16.400> maybe<00:02:17.210> not

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
pick this up or not but then maybe not

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.420 
pick this up or not but then maybe not
now<00:02:17.660> but<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.930> was<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.140> very<00:02:18.380> aggressive<00:02:18.710> kind<00:02:19.370> of

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
now but I was a very aggressive kind of

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.980 
now but I was a very aggressive kind of
personality<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.270> for<00:02:21.140> me<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:22.310> paint<00:02:22.640> and

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
personality and for me the paint and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.510 
personality and for me the paint and
ceramics<00:02:23.990> was<00:02:24.200> much<00:02:24.500> too<00:02:24.740> submissive<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.400> was

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
ceramics was much too submissive it was

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.940 
ceramics was much too submissive it was
too<00:02:25.670> easy<00:02:31.090> metallurgy<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.810> mental<00:02:33.260> processes

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
too easy metallurgy and mental processes

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.300 
too easy metallurgy and mental processes
are<00:02:34.220> very<00:02:34.600> very<00:02:35.600> specific<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.680> very<00:02:36.710> linear

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
are very very specific and very linear

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.610 
are very very specific and very linear
and<00:02:37.610> very<00:02:37.910> demanding<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.780> one<00:02:39.020> there<00:02:39.320> was<00:02:39.470> the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
and very demanding so one there was the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.680 
and very demanding so one there was the
intellectual<00:02:40.040> discipline<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:41.300> kind<00:02:41.540> of

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
intellectual discipline of this kind of

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.540 
intellectual discipline of this kind of
structure<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.410> how<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.620> approach<00:02:43.310> the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
structure of how you approach the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.550 
structure of how you approach the
material<00:02:44.090> therefore<00:02:44.540> approach<00:02:44.870> form<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
material therefore approach form and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.640 
material therefore approach form and
then<00:02:46.190> also<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.850> physical<00:02:47.330> demands<00:02:47.660> when

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
then also the physical demands when

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.820 
then also the physical demands when
scale<00:02:49.130> started<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.730> increase<00:02:50.060> we<00:02:50.450> had<00:02:50.660> to

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
scale started to increase we had to

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.729 
scale started to increase we had to
understand<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:53.540> know<00:02:53.630> tools<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.380> machines

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
understand you know tools and machines

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.280 
understand you know tools and machines
that<00:02:55.070> could<00:02:55.220> do<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.670> larger<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:56.570> logistically

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
that could do it larger and logistically

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.650 
that could do it larger and logistically
you<00:02:57.860> know<00:02:57.980> shipping<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:58.670> installing<00:02:59.150> and

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
you know shipping and installing and

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.830 
you know shipping and installing and
then<00:03:00.530> when<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.770> gets<00:03:00.890> into<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:02.300> large-scale

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
then when it gets into the large-scale

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.470 
then when it gets into the large-scale
public<00:03:03.140> works<00:03:03.590> there's<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:05.209> know<00:03:05.300> the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
public works there's the you know the

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.570 
public works there's the you know the
politics<00:03:06.020> there's<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.530> engineering<00:03:07.250> there's

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.940 
politics there's the engineering there's

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
the feasibility studies and all of that

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.340 
the feasibility studies and all of that
and<00:03:10.220> all<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.940> those<00:03:11.090> things<00:03:11.150> which<00:03:11.930> are<00:03:12.110> so

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
and all of those things which are so

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.130 
and all of those things which are so
kind<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.830> prominent<00:03:13.400> all<00:03:14.150> they<00:03:14.390> do<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.690> they're

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
kind of prominent all they do is they're

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.990 
kind of prominent all they do is they're
kind<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.440> like<00:03:15.590> buttresses<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.459> go<00:03:16.580> down<00:03:16.790> to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
kind of like buttresses that go down to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.210 
kind of like buttresses that go down to
the<00:03:17.120> main<00:03:17.270> core<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:18.080> creating<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.890> net

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the main core of creating that net

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.180 
the main core of creating that net
unique<00:03:19.549> object<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:21.380> it's<00:03:21.560> created<00:03:22.040> that

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
unique object and so it's created that

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.060 
unique object and so it's created that
scenario<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:23.000> allows<00:03:23.269> me<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.720> perform<00:03:24.070> as

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
scenario that allows me to perform as

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.580 
scenario that allows me to perform as
best<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.910> can

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.030 

The<00:03:29.590> Sentinel<00:03:30.840> because<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:32.019> its<00:03:32.170> scale<00:03:32.530> its

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
The Sentinel because of its scale its

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.119 
The Sentinel because of its scale its
prominence<00:03:33.670> there<00:03:33.999> it<00:03:34.659> helps<00:03:34.959> define<00:03:35.349> a

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
prominence there it helps define a

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.849 
prominence there it helps define a
little<00:03:36.939> bit<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.719> cultural<00:03:38.139> profile<00:03:38.620> of

little bit the the cultural profile of

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.599 
little bit the the cultural profile of
the<00:03:38.980> institution<00:03:39.749> when<00:03:40.749> the<00:03:41.340> student<00:03:42.340> first

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
the institution when the student first

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.420 
the institution when the student first
comes<00:03:42.909> the<00:03:43.030> RIT<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:44.079> it's<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:44.950> first<00:03:45.189> time

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
comes the RIT and it's the first time

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.009 
comes the RIT and it's the first time
they're<00:03:45.639> on<00:03:45.790> campus<00:03:46.359> and<00:03:46.540> they<00:03:46.599> go<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.810> the

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
they're on campus and they go to the

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.080 
they're on campus and they go to the
central<00:03:47.439> core<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:47.920> campus<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.670> the

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
central core of the campus and the

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.699 
central core of the campus and the
Sentinel<00:03:49.510> is<00:03:49.689> there<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.049> they<00:03:50.139> walk<00:03:50.379> through

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
Sentinel is there and they walk through

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.379 
Sentinel is there and they walk through
it<00:03:50.889> and<00:03:50.950> they<00:03:51.040> look<00:03:51.250> at<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:51.879> know<00:03:52.150> what

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
it and they look at it and you know what

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.280 
it and they look at it and you know what
is<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.719> place<00:03:52.930> on<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.349> that<00:03:54.010> defines<00:03:54.669> a<00:03:55.290> a

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
is this place on that that defines a a

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.789 
is this place on that that defines a a
place<00:03:57.219> of<00:03:57.400> time<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:58.019> defines<00:03:59.019> part<00:03:59.499> of<00:03:59.620> their

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
place of time and defines part of their

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.759 
place of time and defines part of their
experience<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.989> when<00:04:01.989> they<00:04:02.139> come<00:04:02.349> back<00:04:02.379> to

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
experience and when they come back to

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.619 
experience and when they come back to
that<00:04:02.799> that's<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.609> residence<00:04:04.060> that<00:04:04.209> they<00:04:04.359> have

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
that that's the residence that they have

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.899 
that that's the residence that they have
I<00:04:04.989> was<00:04:05.560> thinking<00:04:05.919> about<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.250> educational

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
I was thinking about the educational

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.720 
I was thinking about the educational
process<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.719> how<00:04:07.840> dynamic<00:04:08.109> it<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.769> that<00:04:09.340> the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
process and how dynamic it is that the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.939 
process and how dynamic it is that the
student<00:04:10.540> comes<00:04:10.750> in<00:04:10.989> has<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.260> certain<00:04:11.680> set<00:04:11.919> of

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
student comes in has a certain set of

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.949 
student comes in has a certain set of
values<00:04:12.219> a<00:04:12.519> certain<00:04:13.000> understanding<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.810> who

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
values a certain understanding of who

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.439 
values a certain understanding of who
they<00:04:14.139> are<00:04:14.349> and<00:04:14.680> what<00:04:15.310> their<00:04:15.459> capacity<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.239> and

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
they are and what their capacity is and

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.349 
they are and what their capacity is and
as<00:04:16.570> they<00:04:16.780> go<00:04:16.989> through<00:04:17.440> this<00:04:18.130> process<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:19.090> the

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
as they go through this process that the

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.689 
as they go through this process that the
skills<00:04:20.019> that<00:04:20.139> they<00:04:20.410> learn<00:04:20.650> their<00:04:21.009> challenges

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
skills that they learn their challenges

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.480 
skills that they learn their challenges
that<00:04:21.880> they<00:04:22.060> are<00:04:22.320> it's<00:04:23.320> totally<00:04:23.830> changing<00:04:24.340> and

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
that they are it's totally changing and

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.279 
that they are it's totally changing and
when<00:04:24.580> they<00:04:24.669> come<00:04:24.880> out<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.210> other<00:04:25.330> end<00:04:25.449> there's

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
when they come out the other end there's

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.499 
when they come out the other end there's
a<00:04:26.349> transformation<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:27.160> happens<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.849> what<00:04:28.449> I

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
a transformation that happens and what I

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.450 
a transformation that happens and what I
tried<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.900> do<00:04:29.199> with<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.560> Sentinel<00:04:30.039> is<00:04:30.250> is

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
tried to do with the Sentinel is is

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.640 
tried to do with the Sentinel is is
somehow<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.360> that<00:04:31.810> reflected<00:04:32.500> that

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
somehow that that reflected that

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.890 
somehow that that reflected that
sensibility<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:33.520> things<00:04:33.970> are<00:04:34.240> in<00:04:34.360> flux<00:04:34.389> that

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
sensibility that things are in flux that

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.020 
sensibility that things are in flux that
things<00:04:35.139> are<00:04:35.320> in<00:04:35.440> changing<00:04:35.979> I<00:04:36.070> don't<00:04:36.250> not<00:04:36.729> sure

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
things are in changing I don't not sure

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.180 
things are in changing I don't not sure
about<00:04:37.240> this<00:04:37.539> I'm<00:04:37.780> not<00:04:37.810> sure<00:04:37.960> about<00:04:38.320> that<00:04:38.710> so

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
about this I'm not sure about that so

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.950 
about this I'm not sure about that so
therefore<00:04:39.460> even<00:04:40.030> though<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.360> was<00:04:40.479> nonverbal

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
therefore even though it was nonverbal

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.860 
therefore even though it was nonverbal
that<00:04:41.409> it<00:04:41.590> aligned<00:04:42.009> to<00:04:42.849> that<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.509> that<00:04:43.539> energy

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
that it aligned to that to that energy

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.629 
that it aligned to that to that energy
that<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.409> individual<00:04:44.889> is<00:04:44.919> going<00:04:45.220> through<00:04:45.430> and

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
that the individual is going through and

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.149 
that the individual is going through and
in<00:04:46.509> a<00:04:46.599> broader<00:04:46.870> context<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:47.680> is<00:04:47.830> what<00:04:47.979> art

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
in a broader context this is what art

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.719 
in a broader context this is what art

has always done in a society it it helps
human<00:04:52.389> eyes<00:04:52.509> and<00:04:52.539> experience<00:04:53.259> I'm<00:04:53.889> trying<00:04:54.310> to

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
human eyes and experience I'm trying to

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.939 
human eyes and experience I'm trying to
bring<00:04:54.849> my<00:04:55.300> understanding<00:04:56.199> and<00:04:56.349> my<00:04:56.500> perception

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
bring my understanding and my perception

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.320 
bring my understanding and my perception
my<00:04:57.520> personalization<00:04:58.409> that's<00:04:59.409> where<00:04:59.800> the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
my personalization that's where the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.300 
my personalization that's where the
innovation<00:05:01.330> comes<00:05:02.020> from<00:05:02.139> because<00:05:02.949> I'm

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
innovation comes from because I'm

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.980 
innovation comes from because I'm
solving<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.849> problem<00:05:04.270> in<00:05:04.389> a<00:05:04.479> different<00:05:04.509> way

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
solving the problem in a different way

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.080 
solving the problem in a different way
so<00:05:05.050> therefore<00:05:05.650> my<00:05:05.830> work<00:05:06.099> looks<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:07.060> know

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
so therefore my work looks you know

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.260 
so therefore my work looks you know
quite<00:05:07.419> different<00:05:07.930> from<00:05:07.990> everyone<00:05:08.320> else's

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
quite different from everyone else's

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.950 
quite different from everyone else's
it's<00:05:10.800> creating<00:05:11.800> a<00:05:11.919> new<00:05:12.370> context<00:05:13.150> a<00:05:13.330> new

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
it's creating a new context a new

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.980 
it's creating a new context a new
a<00:05:14.020> new<00:05:14.710> vocabulary<00:05:14.919> a<00:05:15.669> new<00:05:15.850> understanding<00:05:16.150> and

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
a new vocabulary a new understanding and

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.770 
a new vocabulary a new understanding and
hopefully<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:17.740> new<00:05:18.639> sensibility<00:05:19.120> where<00:05:19.690> the

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
hopefully a new sensibility where the

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.200 
hopefully a new sensibility where the
viewer<00:05:20.020> or<00:05:20.139> the<00:05:20.410> user<00:05:20.650> of<00:05:20.979> that<00:05:21.190> of<00:05:22.150> that

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
viewer or the user of that of that

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.809 
viewer or the user of that of that
object<00:05:22.539> there's<00:05:23.229> thousands<00:05:24.069> and<00:05:24.190> thousands

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
object there's thousands and thousands

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.300 
object there's thousands and thousands
of<00:05:24.910> chairs<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:26.050> thousands<00:05:26.620> of<00:05:26.680> tables<00:05:27.160> that

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
of chairs and thousands of tables that

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.070 
of chairs and thousands of tables that
are<00:05:27.370> made<00:05:27.639> and<00:05:27.880> these<00:05:28.270> have<00:05:28.449> been<00:05:28.569> explored

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
are made and these have been explored

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.650 
are made and these have been explored
and<00:05:29.349> explored<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.009> explored<00:05:30.430> so<00:05:31.120> as<00:05:31.449> an

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
and explored and explored so as an

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.110 
and explored and explored so as an
artist<00:05:32.069> what<00:05:33.069> can<00:05:33.250> i<00:05:33.340> bring<00:05:33.400> to<00:05:33.699> that<00:05:33.849> equation

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
artist what can i bring to that equation

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.620 
artist what can i bring to that equation
what<00:05:34.720> can<00:05:34.960> i<00:05:35.110> what<00:05:35.650> can<00:05:36.430> i<00:05:36.550> do<00:05:36.610> that<00:05:37.180> makes<00:05:37.509> it

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
what can i what can i do that makes it

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.270 
what can i what can i do that makes it
different<00:05:38.050> I<00:05:38.139> can't<00:05:38.410> make<00:05:38.590> it<00:05:38.800> more

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
different I can't make it more

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.180 
different I can't make it more
functional<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:40.030> can't<00:05:40.270> make<00:05:40.479> it<00:05:40.660> all<00:05:40.840> of<00:05:40.990> that

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
functional I can't make it all of that

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.400 
functional I can't make it all of that
so<00:05:42.810> basically<00:05:43.810> my<00:05:43.840> approach<00:05:44.470> to<00:05:45.250> that<00:05:45.490> is

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
so basically my approach to that is

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:54.390 
so basically my approach to that is
looking<00:05:47.410> at<00:05:47.650> the<00:05:47.800> object<00:05:48.370> as<00:05:53.009> kind<00:05:54.009> of<00:05:54.070> a<00:05:54.190> sense

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
looking at the object as kind of a sense

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.870 
looking at the object as kind of a sense
of<00:05:54.520> ceremony<00:05:55.090> that<00:05:55.300> we<00:05:55.389> live<00:05:55.570> our<00:05:55.720> lives<00:05:55.870> that

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
of ceremony that we live our lives that

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
of ceremony that we live our lives that
these<00:05:57.880> objects<00:05:58.509> are

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.300 

they<00:06:04.900> reflected<00:06:05.470> reflect<00:06:05.919> our<00:06:06.069> life<00:06:06.280> that

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
they reflected reflect our life that

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.360 
they reflected reflect our life that
reflect<00:06:06.910> on<00:06:07.030> morality<00:06:07.330> they<00:06:08.100> reflect<00:06:09.100> how<00:06:09.310> we

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
reflect on morality they reflect how we

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.059 
reflect on morality they reflect how we
engage<00:06:09.669> with<00:06:10.090> people<00:06:10.169> they<00:06:11.169> create<00:06:11.650> a<00:06:11.680> sense

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
engage with people they create a sense

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.540 
engage with people they create a sense
of<00:06:12.220> time<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:12.490> place<00:06:12.849> and<00:06:13.979> so<00:06:14.979> for<00:06:15.220> me<00:06:15.340> the

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
of time and place and so for me the

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.749 
of time and place and so for me the
table<00:06:15.940> becomes<00:06:16.330> a<00:06:17.220> ceremonial<00:06:18.220> theater<00:06:18.580> as<00:06:18.729> a

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
table becomes a ceremonial theater as a

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.340 
table becomes a ceremonial theater as a
word<00:06:19.060> that

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
word that

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:35.790 
word that
the<00:06:21.860> human<00:06:22.220> drama<00:06:22.340> is<00:06:22.820> played<00:06:23.060> out

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:46.150 

you

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.220 

you
