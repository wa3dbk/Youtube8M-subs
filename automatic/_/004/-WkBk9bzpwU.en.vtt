hello everybody welcome to week number

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.550 
hello everybody welcome to week number
four<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.710> genetics<00:00:05.430> video<00:00:06.089> series<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:07.379> week

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
four on genetics video series this week

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.690 
four on genetics video series this week
we're<00:00:07.680> going<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.830> talk<00:00:07.980> about<00:00:08.130> recessive

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
we're going to talk about recessive

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.820 
we're going to talk about recessive
radix<00:00:09.059> last<00:00:09.570> week<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:10.019> talked<00:00:10.260> about<00:00:10.410> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
radix last week we talked about the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.669 
radix last week we talked about the
spread<00:00:11.309> gene<00:00:11.580> spread<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.389> what<00:00:12.540> turns<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:13.320> blue

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
spread gene spread is what turns a blue

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.420 
spread gene spread is what turns a blue
pigeon<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> black<00:00:14.460> natural<00:00:14.880> lavender<00:00:15.570> etc

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
pigeon to a black natural lavender etc

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.980 
pigeon to a black natural lavender etc
spread<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> autosomal<00:00:18.359> dominant<00:00:18.810> gene

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
spread is a autosomal dominant gene

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.929 
spread is a autosomal dominant gene
meaning<00:00:19.529> if<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.160> gene<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.670> being

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
meaning if you have the gene it's being

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.090 
meaning if you have the gene it's being
displayed<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.750> can't<00:00:21.990> hide<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.710> can't<00:00:22.890> hide

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
displayed you can't hide you can't hide

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.300 
displayed you can't hide you can't hide
a<00:00:23.130> dominant<00:00:23.760> gene<00:00:24.859> but<00:00:25.859> they're<00:00:26.010> sets<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
a dominant gene but they're sets of

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
a dominant gene but they're sets of
genes<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.609> hide<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
genes you can hide it you can have a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.290 
genes you can hide it you can have a
blue<00:00:28.170> bar<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.340> visually<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> blue<00:00:30.060> bar

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
blue bar that's just visually a blue bar

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
blue bar that's just visually a blue bar
that<00:00:30.330> carries<00:00:31.640> recessive<00:00:32.640> red<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:34.170> know

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that carries recessive red and you know

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.790 
that carries recessive red and you know
anything<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.190> carry<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.850> hide<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.710> like<00:00:37.710> I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
anything can carry it and hide it like I

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.560 
anything can carry it and hide it like I
said<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.010> recessive<00:00:38.280> red<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.790> outside<00:00:39.300> what<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
said a recessive red is outside what is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.450 
said a recessive red is outside what is
not<00:00:39.750> sex-linked<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.920> talked<00:00:41.129> about<00:00:41.280> if

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
not sex-linked like we talked about if

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.910 
not sex-linked like we talked about if
the<00:00:41.579> base<00:00:41.760> colors<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.780> both<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.140> hens<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the base colors so both the hens and the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.430 
the base colors so both the hens and the
 have<00:00:44.550> two<00:00:45.030> genes<00:00:45.329> available<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.289> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
 have two genes available for it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.069 
 have two genes available for it
and<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:47.129> both<00:00:47.370> must<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:48.030> both<00:00:48.690> genes

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and they both must have both genes

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.130 
and they both must have both genes
filled<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:50.300> display<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.449> must<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.840> homozygous

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
filled to display it must be homozygous

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.880 
filled to display it must be homozygous
recessive<00:00:52.890> red<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.730> show<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.210> now<00:00:55.020> recessive

bride<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.250> epistatic<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.390> means<00:00:57.600> it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
bride is epistatic what just means it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.220 
bride is epistatic what just means it

masked over hides other colors so like

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.830 
masked over hides other colors so like
we<00:01:01.410> talked<00:01:01.680> about<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:01.980> video<00:01:02.699> 1<00:01:03.000> &amp;<00:01:03.210> 2<00:01:03.329> every

underneath but it's up a static mask
over<00:01:12.270> everything<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.270> versus<00:01:15.270> abra<00:01:15.600> mask

except<00:01:18.420> recessive<00:01:19.020> white<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.979> gene<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.640> more

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
except recessive white that gene is more

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
except recessive white that gene is more
powerful<00:01:21.479> than<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:23.040> only<00:01:23.159> thing<00:01:23.369> more

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

doesn't always mask over everything

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560 
doesn't always mask over everything
completely<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.820> spread<00:01:30.180> always

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
completely just like spread always

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.090 
completely just like spread always
doesn't<00:01:30.780> completely<00:01:31.909> blur<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:33.150> everything

recessive Reds the same way sometimes

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.310 
recessive Reds the same way sometimes
you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.210> things<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.810> recessive

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you can see things like this recessive

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.710 
you can see things like this recessive
right<00:01:40.470> here<00:01:40.939> this<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.210> pretty<00:01:42.479> good

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
right here this is a pretty good

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.289 
right here this is a pretty good

shade<00:01:45.659> again<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:46.680> mind<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> white<00:01:47.220> flight

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
shade again don't mind the white flight

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.810 
shade again don't mind the white flight
that's<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.590> that's<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.280> birds<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.640> this

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that's just that's all the birds in this

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.819 
that's just that's all the birds in this
breed<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.630> white<00:01:51.869> flight<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.439> not<00:01:52.590> part

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
breed have white flight that's not part

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.080 
breed have white flight that's not part
of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> recessive<00:01:53.280> red<00:01:53.610> gene<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:53.939> anything

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
of the recessive red gene or anything

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.959 
of the recessive red gene or anything
like<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:55.040> but<00:01:56.040> typically<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:56.700> would<00:01:56.850> be

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
like that but typically they would be

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.560 
like that but typically they would be
red<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.299> well<00:01:57.380> but<00:01:58.380> recessive<00:01:58.860> red<00:01:59.450> comes<00:02:00.450> in

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
red as well but recessive red comes in

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.090 
red as well but recessive red comes in
all<00:02:00.689> different<00:02:00.899> shades<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.560> varieties<00:02:01.950> this

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
all different shades and varieties this

this is not grizzle and it's not PI just
and<00:03:16.600> this<00:03:17.600> can<00:03:17.780> happen<00:03:17.959> with<00:03:18.140> recessive<00:03:18.650> red

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.289 
and this can happen with recessive red
it<00:03:19.100> doesn't<00:03:19.130> mean<00:03:19.549> that<00:03:19.579> this<00:03:19.970> bird<00:03:20.209> would

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
I just wanted to clear up that recessive

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.289 
I just wanted to clear up that recessive
Reds<00:04:16.549> aren't<00:04:17.000> necessarily<00:04:17.630> spread<00:04:18.290> as<00:04:18.560> then

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
Reds aren't necessarily spread as then

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.699 
Reds aren't necessarily spread as then
you<00:04:20.299> know<00:04:20.480> spread<00:04:20.959> like<00:04:21.290> we<00:04:21.410> talked<00:04:21.620> about

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
you know spread like we talked about

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.200 
you know spread like we talked about
last<00:04:22.070> three<00:04:22.310> less<00:04:22.520> people<00:04:22.700> think<00:04:23.060> that

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
last three less people think that

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.090 
last three less people think that
recessive<00:04:23.660> right<00:04:23.840> must<00:04:24.170> be<00:04:24.320> spread<00:04:24.650> since<00:04:24.980> the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
recessive right must be spread since the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.060 
recessive right must be spread since the
whole<00:04:25.280> pigeon<00:04:25.730> is<00:04:25.970> red<00:04:26.680> now<00:04:27.680> they<00:04:27.830> could<00:04:28.040> be

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
whole pigeon is red now they could be

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
whole pigeon is red now they could be
scrubbed<00:04:28.490> like<00:04:28.610> I<00:04:28.700> said<00:04:28.910> they're<00:04:29.060> a

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
scrubbed like I said they're a

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.700 
scrubbed like I said they're a
prosthetic<00:04:29.450> so<00:04:29.720> you<00:04:29.960> could<00:04:30.140> just<00:04:30.170> have<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.440> blue

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
prosthetic so you could just have a blue

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.510 
prosthetic so you could just have a blue
bar<00:04:31.300> with<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.420> dominant<00:04:32.840> spread<00:04:33.140> a

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
bar with the dominant spread a

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.890 
bar with the dominant spread a
homozygous<00:04:34.520> recessive<00:04:35.060> right<00:04:35.210> on<00:04:35.330> top<00:04:35.570> of<00:04:35.750> it

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
homozygous recessive right on top of it

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.620 
homozygous recessive right on top of it
but<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.440> spread<00:04:36.770> gene<00:04:37.070> in<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.820> of<00:04:37.940> itself<00:04:38.270> has

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
but the spread gene in and of itself has

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.310 
but the spread gene in and of itself has
nothing<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.080> do<00:04:39.260> with<00:04:39.290> recessive<00:04:39.890> red<00:04:40.130> and

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
nothing to do with recessive red and

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.410 
nothing to do with recessive red and
also<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:43.190> best<00:04:43.430> recessive<00:04:43.940> runs<00:04:44.150> like<00:04:44.300> I

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
also the best recessive runs like I

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.330 
also the best recessive runs like I
showed<00:04:44.660> you<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:44.870> blue<00:04:45.230> that<00:04:45.800> was<00:04:45.980> bleeding

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
showed you that blue that was bleeding

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.850 
showed you that blue that was bleeding
through<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:47.210> best<00:04:47.419> recessive<00:04:47.960> Reds<00:04:48.200> most

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
through the best recessive Reds most

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.480 
through the best recessive Reds most
people<00:04:49.160> say<00:04:49.400> a<00:04:49.430> scrud<00:04:50.020> however<00:04:51.490> pigeon

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
people say a scrud however pigeon

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.490 
people say a scrud however pigeon
fancier<00:04:52.850> I<00:04:52.880> know<00:04:53.090> in<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.270> genetic<00:04:53.630> world<00:04:54.020> so

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
fancier I know in the genetic world so

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.310 
fancier I know in the genetic world so
that<00:04:54.919> he's<00:04:55.850> tested<00:04:56.300> all<00:04:56.450> three<00:04:56.750> base<00:04:56.930> colors

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
that he's tested all three base colors

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.560 
that he's tested all three base colors
with<00:04:57.440> successive<00:04:57.860> red<00:04:58.190> he's<00:04:58.550> found<00:04:58.790> brown<00:04:59.270> to

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
with successive red he's found brown to

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.080 
with successive red he's found brown to
be<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.810> best<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.350> at<00:05:01.130> that<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:01.610> want<00:05:01.880> them<00:05:02.060> to

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
be the best and at that you want them to

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.180 
be the best and at that you want them to
be<00:05:02.240> tea<00:05:02.480> patterns<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:03.440> not<00:05:03.590> blue<00:05:03.919> bars

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
be tea patterns and not blue bars

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.100 
be tea patterns and not blue bars
because<00:05:04.640> tea<00:05:04.940> patterns<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.570> darkest<00:05:07.390> so<00:05:08.390> you

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
because tea patterns the darkest so you

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.080 
because tea patterns the darkest so you
know<00:05:09.290> it<00:05:09.800> makes<00:05:09.980> it<00:05:10.130> really<00:05:10.280> easy<00:05:10.400> for<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.850> red

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
know it makes it really easy for the red

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.670 
know it makes it really easy for the red
to<00:05:11.270> fill<00:05:11.540> in<00:05:11.720> everything<00:05:12.050> that's<00:05:12.440> already

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
to fill in everything that's already

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.820 
to fill in everything that's already
pretty<00:05:13.100> much<00:05:13.280> filled<00:05:13.610> in<00:05:13.790> with<00:05:14.330> color<00:05:14.830> this

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
pretty much filled in with color this

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.310 
pretty much filled in with color this
