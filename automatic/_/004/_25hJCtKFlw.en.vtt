tutorial<00:00:09.990> on<00:00:10.320> using<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.130> feature<00:00:11.309> called<00:00:11.429> quick

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
tutorial on using a feature called quick

tutorial on using a feature called quick
explosion<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.929> am<00:00:13.380> working<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:13.679> blender<00:00:14.480> 2.6

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
explosion I am working with blender 2.6

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.609 
explosion I am working with blender 2.6
0<00:00:16.699> and<00:00:17.699> let's<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.420> delete<00:00:18.869> our<00:00:19.020> default<00:00:19.320> cube

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
0 and let's just delete our default cube

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.679 
0 and let's just delete our default cube
there<00:00:19.890> I'm<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.670> create<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.150> sphere

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
there I'm going to create a sphere

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.560 
there I'm going to create a sphere
object<00:00:22.500> UV<00:00:23.220> sphere<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.820> hit<00:00:24.029> space<00:00:24.269> bar<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
object UV sphere I hit space bar and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.200 
object UV sphere I hit space bar and
type<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.869> sphere<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:26.220> there's<00:00:26.369> our<00:00:26.490> sphere<00:00:26.939> I'm

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
type in sphere so there's our sphere I'm

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.609 
type in sphere so there's our sphere I'm
just<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.510> leave<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.660> obviously<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.349> can

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
just going to leave it obviously I can

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.800 
just going to leave it obviously I can
change<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.250> resolution<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.330> smooth

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
change the resolution of it and smooth

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.330 
change the resolution of it and smooth
it<00:00:30.900> out<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.289> we're<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.679> quickly

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
it out but we're just going to quickly

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.720 
it out but we're just going to quickly
make<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.820> basically<00:00:33.210> fall<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.690> pieces<00:00:34.730> did

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
make it basically fall to pieces did

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.310 
make it basically fall to pieces did
something<00:00:36.059> like<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.840> patoot<00:00:37.079> oriole

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
something like this in a patoot oriole

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.709 
something like this in a patoot oriole
in<00:00:37.500> 2.5<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.579> don't<00:00:39.059> think<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.360> quick

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
in 2.5 I don't think this quick

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.750 
in 2.5 I don't think this quick
explosion<00:00:40.170> feature<00:00:40.739> was<00:00:40.980> available<00:00:41.280> then<00:00:41.640> as

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
explosion feature was available then as

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.069 
explosion feature was available then as
far<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.030> i<00:00:42.090> know<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.420> new<00:00:42.600> i<00:00:42.629> never<00:00:42.899> noticed

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
far as i know it's new i never noticed

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.160 
far as i know it's new i never noticed
it<00:00:43.320> before<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.219> saves<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> lot<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.820> time

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
it before but it saves you a lot of time

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.090 
it before but it saves you a lot of time
now<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.649> two<00:00:46.800> different<00:00:46.890> ways

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
now you can get to it two different ways

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.290 
now you can get to it two different ways
make<00:00:47.340> sure<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.610> your<00:00:47.640> object<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.210> want

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
make sure you have your object you want

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.410 
make sure you have your object you want
to<00:00:48.480> explode<00:00:48.840> selected<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:50.280> go<00:00:50.489> object<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
to explode selected I can go object and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660 
to explode selected I can go object and
up<00:00:51.510> two<00:00:51.629> quick<00:00:51.809> effects<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.559> choose<00:00:52.800> explode

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
up two quick effects and choose explode

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.150 
up two quick effects and choose explode
but<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.510> I'm<00:00:54.600> actually<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.559> hit

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
but what I'm actually going to do is hit

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.459 
but what I'm actually going to do is hit
space<00:00:56.489> bar<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.850> type<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.149> quick<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.719> explode<00:00:58.440> i

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
space bar and type in quick or explode i

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.459 
space bar and type in quick or explode i
like<00:00:58.829> using<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.550> space<00:00:59.730> bar<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:00.180> because

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
like using the space bar there because

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.420 
like using the space bar there because
typing<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.739> search<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.399> just

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
typing to search like that is just

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.969 
typing to search like that is just
usually<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> whole<00:01:03.329> lot<00:01:03.480> quicker<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.650> i'm<00:01:04.890> going

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
usually a whole lot quicker so i'm going

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.250 
usually a whole lot quicker so i'm going
to<00:01:05.100> hit<00:01:05.159> enter<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.510> down<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
to hit enter there and as down here you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.780 
to hit enter there and as down here you
can<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.150> some<00:01:09.330> options<00:01:10.760> you<00:01:11.760> have

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
can see you have some options you have

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.060 
can see you have some options you have
outward<00:01:12.270> velocity<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.350> number<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.799> frame

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
outward velocity the number of frame

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.600 
outward velocity the number of frame
starting<00:01:14.640> frames<00:01:15.500> ending<00:01:16.500> frames<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.549> you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
starting frames ending frames so if you

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.010 
starting frames ending frames so if you
didn't<00:01:17.850> want<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> explode<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.780> away<00:01:18.960> you

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
didn't want it to explode right away you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.539 
didn't want it to explode right away you
can<00:01:19.229> set<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> starting<00:01:19.740> frame<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.310> ending

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
can set the starting frame and ending

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.730 
can set the starting frame and ending
frame<00:01:20.790> higher<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> wanted<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> be

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
frame higher so if you wanted to be

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.370 
frame higher so if you wanted to be
there<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.150> two<00:01:24.150> seconds<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.689> doing<00:01:24.960> 30<00:01:25.200> frames

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
there for two seconds in doing 30 frames

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.770 
there for two seconds in doing 30 frames
a<00:01:25.470> second<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.130> would<00:01:26.520> say<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> 60<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
a second you would say it to 60 as a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.660 
a second you would say it to 60 as a
start<00:01:28.200> frame<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:28.829> however<00:01:29.040> many<00:01:29.369> frames

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
start frame and then however many frames

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.870 
start frame and then however many frames
you<00:01:29.909> want<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.810> end<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:34.549> let<00:01:35.549> me<00:01:35.670> mess

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
you want it to end that and let me mess

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.069 
you want it to end that and let me mess
with<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.119> setting<00:01:36.479> yet<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.869> we're<00:01:37.049> just

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
with that setting yet but we're just

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.660 
with that setting yet but we're just
gonna<00:01:37.259> leave<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.979> defaults<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.400> right

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
gonna leave all the defaults for right

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
gonna leave all the defaults for right
now<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.110> part<00:01:40.380> is

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
now and what we can do it this part is

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.380 
now and what we can do it this part is
pointing<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.189> hit<00:01:41.340> alt<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.150> see<00:01:42.299> our

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
pointing is hit alt a and see our

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.600 
pointing is hit alt a and see our
animation<00:01:42.899> that's<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> all<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.799> did<00:01:43.950> at<00:01:44.220> this

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
animation that's it all we did at this

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.069 
animation that's it all we did at this
point<00:01:44.850> once<00:01:45.149> I'll<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.659> again<00:01:45.899> cuz<00:01:45.990> it

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
point once I'll just do it again cuz it

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.630 
point once I'll just do it again cuz it
was<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.290> simple<00:01:46.530> I'm<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> hit<00:01:47.310> space<00:01:47.610> bar

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
was so simple I'm going to hit space bar

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.660 
was so simple I'm going to hit space bar
type<00:01:48.509> explode<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.470> at<00:01:50.070> least<00:01:50.250> start<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.520> type

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
type explode or at least start to type

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.319 
type explode or at least start to type
it<00:01:50.880> oh<00:01:52.159> let's<00:01:53.159> add<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> sphere<00:01:53.759> first<00:01:54.090> because

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
it oh let's add a sphere first because

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.819 
it oh let's add a sphere first because
you<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.810> something<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.259> explode

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you have to have something to explode

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.420 
you have to have something to explode
make<00:01:56.130> sure<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.460> selected<00:01:57.979> explode<00:01:58.979> and<00:02:00.259> then

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
make sure it's selected explode and then

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.300 
make sure it's selected explode and then
alt-a<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.549> animate<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.420> that's<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.890> far<00:02:04.920> as

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
alt-a to animate it that's it as far as

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.300 
alt-a to animate it that's it as far as
now<00:02:05.909> obviously<00:02:06.110> what<00:02:07.110> we've<00:02:07.290> done<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:08.099> we

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
now obviously what we've done here if we

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.130 
now obviously what we've done here if we
pull<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.610> panel<00:02:09.149> out<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.539> little<00:02:09.720> bit<00:02:09.929> more

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
pull this panel out a little bit more

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.770 
pull this panel out a little bit more
and<00:02:10.379> go<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> our<00:02:11.190> particles<00:02:12.000> panel<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.720> can

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and go to our particles panel you can

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.880 
and go to our particles panel you can
see<00:02:12.989> basically<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.500> created

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
see basically it created

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.680 
see basically it created
particles<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:14.490> us<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.510> change

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
particles for us here and you can change

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.300 
particles for us here and you can change
it<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> bunch<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.440> different<00:02:16.710> settings<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.280> here

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
it a bunch of different settings in here

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.760 
it a bunch of different settings in here
you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.090> change<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.510> gravity<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.260> how<00:02:19.410> fast

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
you can change the gravity so how fast

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.690 
you can change the gravity so how fast
it<00:02:20.010> falls<00:02:21.470> whether<00:02:22.470> how<00:02:22.920> random<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.550> is

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
it falls whether how random it is

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.870 
it falls whether how random it is
whether<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> pieces<00:02:25.170> are<00:02:25.290> spinning<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.700> i

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
whether the pieces are spinning but i

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.970 
whether the pieces are spinning but i
just<00:02:27.060> want<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.209> show<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> quick<00:02:27.830> this<00:02:28.830> is

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
just want to show you the quick this is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.610 
just want to show you the quick this is
like<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.330> add<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.810> let's<00:02:31.410> hit

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
like that you just add that in let's hit

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.100 
like that you just add that in let's hit
G<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.580> Z<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.090> move<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.540> up<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.810> little<00:02:33.930> bit

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
G and Z and move that up a little bit

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.000 
G and Z and move that up a little bit
don't<00:02:34.290> worry<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.530> looks<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:34.890> falling

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
don't worry that looks like it's falling

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.260 
don't worry that looks like it's falling
apart<00:02:35.190> there<00:02:35.459> when<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.700> start<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.060> animation

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
apart there when you start the animation

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.480 
apart there when you start the animation
over<00:02:36.690> again<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.050> goes<00:02:37.350> back<00:02:37.410> but<00:02:38.190> I'm<00:02:38.280> gonna<00:02:38.370> do

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
over again it goes back but I'm gonna do

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.590 
over again it goes back but I'm gonna do
is<00:02:38.550> I'm<00:02:38.580> going<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.760> make<00:02:39.030> something<00:02:39.240> for<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
is I'm going to make something for it to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.240 
is I'm going to make something for it to
bounce<00:02:39.900> off<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.440> ground<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.100> bounce

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
bounce off of a ground for it to bounce

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.460 
bounce off of a ground for it to bounce
off<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.690> hit<00:02:42.780> spacebar<00:02:43.020> I'm<00:02:43.290> going<00:02:43.410> to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
off of so you hit spacebar I'm going to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.160 
off of so you hit spacebar I'm going to
add<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> plane<00:02:44.030> SML<00:02:45.030> type<00:02:45.239> in<00:02:45.390> 20<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.900> scale<00:02:46.140> it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
add a plane SML type in 20 to scale it

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.199 
add a plane SML type in 20 to scale it
up<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.590> 20<00:02:46.980> size<00:02:47.160> now<00:02:47.310> at<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.489> point<00:02:47.700> if<00:02:48.120> we

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
up to 20 size now at this point if we

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.479 
up to 20 size now at this point if we
just<00:02:48.360> hit<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.720> day<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.320> falls<00:02:49.650> through<00:02:50.280> that

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
just hit all day it falls through that

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.699 
just hit all day it falls through that
plane<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.959> what<00:02:52.080> we<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.320> do<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.470> make<00:02:52.590> this

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
plane so what we have to do is make this

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.410 
plane so what we have to do is make this
plain<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.190> collision<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.970> with<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.209> plane

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
plain a collision so with the plane

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.750 
plain a collision so with the plane
selected<00:02:54.989> come<00:02:55.620> over<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.890> our<00:02:55.920> physics<00:02:56.400> panel

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
selected come over to our physics panel

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.330 
selected come over to our physics panel
here<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.120> type<00:02:57.840> collision<00:02:58.350> at<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.950> point<00:02:59.160> we

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
here and type collision at this point we

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.220 
here and type collision at this point we
all<00:02:59.400> day<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.910> will<00:03:00.030> collide<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:00.690> we<00:03:00.780> get<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> big

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
all day it will collide but we get a big

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.400 
all day it will collide but we get a big
bounce<00:03:01.920> now<00:03:02.880> depending<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.989> know<00:03:04.019> how<00:03:04.350> you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
bounce now depending on you know how you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.900 
bounce now depending on you know how you
want<00:03:04.650> how<00:03:04.830> much<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.130> want<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.519> bounce<00:03:05.700> off

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
want how much you want it to bounce off

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.620 
want how much you want it to bounce off
this<00:03:06.300> object<00:03:06.540> we<00:03:07.470> can<00:03:07.680> adjust<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.700> particle

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
this object we can adjust the particle

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.650 
this object we can adjust the particle
dampening<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:11.130> factor<00:03:11.640> here<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.150> I'm<00:03:12.510> going

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
dampening the factor here and I'm going

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.350 
dampening the factor here and I'm going
to<00:03:12.780> turn<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.170> up<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.190> prob<00:03:14.310> about<00:03:14.400> seven<00:03:15.209> or<00:03:15.300> so

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
to turn it up to prob about seven or so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.530 
to turn it up to prob about seven or so
I<00:03:15.540> think<00:03:15.750> we'll<00:03:15.959> be<00:03:16.019> good<00:03:17.090> boom<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.329> there

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
I think we'll be good boom and there

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.640 
I think we'll be good boom and there
doesn't<00:03:18.780> balance<00:03:18.989> as<00:03:19.230> much<00:03:19.440> an<00:03:19.560> hour

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
doesn't balance as much an hour

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.580 
doesn't balance as much an hour
particles<00:03:20.100> kind<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.340> fall<00:03:20.519> off<00:03:20.760> there<00:03:21.590> now

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
particles kind of fall off there now

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.440 
particles kind of fall off there now
obviously<00:03:22.769> we<00:03:23.130> can<00:03:23.250> also<00:03:23.370> change<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.239> they

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
obviously we can also change that they

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.180 
obviously we can also change that they
whether<00:03:24.810> they<00:03:24.989> die<00:03:25.230> like<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.829> disappear

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
whether they die like that and disappear

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.220 
whether they die like that and disappear
at<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.370> end<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:27.239> i<00:03:27.450> just<00:03:27.750> wanted<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.049> show<00:03:28.200> you

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
at the end but i just wanted to show you

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.500
