00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.300

 and then in this video I apologize 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.710
 but some little problems that I know 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.300
 good 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.870
 with his things to do and on Fridays 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.050
 for the boys 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.400
 good this video this comes from the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.400
 next Thursday and this video 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.400
 and some of the disney movies 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.310
 well let's start with the connection 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.150
 what is between the little mermaid expected and 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.150
 frozen I'm this there are many videos 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
 proposed 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.059
 do not 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.519
 from that way 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.840
 embarked for the marriage that according to 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.269
 this connection was about giving 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.070
 in degrees 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:12.710
 in the trip they died but that is the dinner 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.590
 the ship sank the bank one day of the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.500
 parents of that is no longer the one who explores 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.500
 ariel ueimar good 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.650
 notify in many videos not only 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.480
 that 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.050
 the many videos up to the part of the 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.050
 that appear 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.900
 I do not buy it anymore because 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.700
 this part of spending 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.500
 with the parents of this one 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.200
 that are also the ones to wake up knows 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.020
 then paint this one that is of sanz is 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:02.000
 sister of this and Anna when the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.630
 previous theory that elsa that the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.780
 parents who were drowned 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.690
 a social network this theory was a fans 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.580
 of frozen who asked one of the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.150
 producers that is the movie was 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.870
 certain said this theory of nap 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.840
 they answered him that really 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.670
 we for you and ghana were lost not 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.430
 died in evil but I have a 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.579
 island and where were a baby and the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.670
 he killed a leopard that's why he lives he survived 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:38.079
 and it was created by the gorillas and it ends 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.079
 being late sanz 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.720
 and the king of allendale 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.990
 Well that's what I get 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.290
 and concludes that this issue is that on 6 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.330
 January is the uncle of Japan and that magic 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.160
 it only affects the blonde girls of the 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.190
 family or think you have the role 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.460
 that has in common to brush and elsa both 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.340
 They are murky and want and have powers 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.550
 but to explain this you have to get to 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.330
 the theory that elsa's father is the 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.130
 bad of the animal is brother of the mother 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.850
 from Japan 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.510
 that's why the king of Andel wants him to 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.330
 hide your powers because your niece was 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.450
 of long hair was kidnapped by 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.220
 holding in the pound of magic 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.910
 because it only affects the girls flow 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.910
 it's family 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.640
 very good and we continue with this 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:49.030
 in the 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.820
 he is grandson of villa angela that speculates 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.150
 that she is the granddaughter of pray for that 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:58.480
 bridge can be understood also count 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.910
 from to while they are the most beautiful and jane 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.070
 they look alike on the other hand this 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.580
 theory would also explain why 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.130
 appears the ssa in the jungle the tableware 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.050
 that comes out in the beautiful and the beast ' 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.940
 put comes to the conclusion 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:21.720
 that this crockery is inherited from the country 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.720
 of families 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.740
 well then another theory or well 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.430
 I commented on almost all the videos of 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.570
 theory 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.570
 the reality 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.580
 I left without a red hat or is the mother already 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.610
 andy this 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.729
 the child 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:55.240
 and so to sing rather 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:59.050
 there are scenes from the past of 10 and the one that 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.370
 you come now where we know how to talk about 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.080
 a red subject 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.330
 very similar to someone without my theory 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.030
 this hat was from andy's mother and 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.180
 he was when he was little so his 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.370
 mother also outside can also good 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.840
 owner of jesse this yes 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.840
 his mother is emily 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:29.750
 it may be this theory is complicated but 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.870
 it makes sense if we have a bit of 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.870
 imagination 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:41.920
 this is from put the monsters and in that 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.920
 she is the brave witch 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:50.169
 sully and mike wazowski teach to travel to 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.060
 through the forces to puig has been 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.210
 When you think you stay, you will see again 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.920
 blue blue and because then I think we're going to 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.380
 say it 's love 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.660
 and go through a door and it ends 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.110
 traveling in the time of the time of 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.390
 brave where you try to understand the 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.440
 Magic 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:14.020
 because we believe that it is right in the 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.080
 witch's cabin we see a drawing that 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.360
 it looks blue and as if it were not enough each 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.290
 Once a door is closed this witch 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.290
 disappears 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.600
 then to finish this video record 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.870
 Rapunzel is the way the law is the 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.050
 nsa actually because the evil queen 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:39.310
 Snow white besides the wind seemed 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:42.790
 physical both have a nothing similar and 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.980
 They are obsessed with young motorcycles 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:50.050
 and beautiful 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:53.300
 as we also believe that certain 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.770
 obvious the queen of snow white equation 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.680
 Many 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:01.340
 and how they love old takes until then 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:05.259
 until the japan movie so using 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.259
 the knight's magic lets you press 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.320
 well, also 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.310
 for Thursday remember girls 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:24.350
 Friday, guys 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.350
 and then to the video
