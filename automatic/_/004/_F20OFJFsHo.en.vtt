than<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.740> do<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.610> don't<00:00:32.730> know<00:00:32.790> how<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.239> it

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
than I do and I don't know how you do it

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.540 
than I do and I don't know how you do it
because<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.989> dumped<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.710> bunch<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.130> there<00:00:35.160> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
because I dumped a bunch in there and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.360 
because I dumped a bunch in there and
they<00:00:35.730> clean<00:00:36.030> them<00:00:36.149> all<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.190> we're

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
they clean them all up and so we're

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.970 
they clean them all up and so we're
going<00:00:38.489> through<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> lot<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:40.290> thought<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.950> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
going through a lot and I thought that I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.010 
going through a lot and I thought that I
was<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.460> run<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> went<00:00:42.870> on

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
was going to run out and so I went on

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.889 
was going to run out and so I went on
the<00:00:43.140> internet<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.270> because<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.420> don't<00:00:45.600> live

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the internet and because I don't live

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.350 
the internet and because I don't live
anywhere<00:00:46.140> near<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.469> pet<00:00:46.710> store<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:48.000> didn't

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
if they all flew out and the frogs can't

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.350 
if they all flew out and the frogs can't
catch<00:01:55.340> them<00:01:55.550> because<00:01:55.850> they're<00:01:56.000> all<00:01:56.120> flying

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
it was like 40 bucks and it was a total

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.570 
it was like 40 bucks and it was a total
ripoff<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:14.950> if<00:02:15.950> you're<00:02:16.070> thinking<00:02:16.130> about

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
ripoff so if you're thinking about

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.240 
ripoff so if you're thinking about
buying<00:02:16.910> them<00:02:17.270> from<00:02:17.420> them<00:02:17.690> don't<00:02:18.080> because<00:02:18.500> that

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
buying them from them don't because that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.800 
buying them from them don't because that
word<00:02:19.460> flightless<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.360> don't<00:02:20.540> know<00:02:20.630> if<00:02:20.690> they

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
word flightless I don't know if they

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.640 
word flightless I don't know if they
know<00:02:20.960> what<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.230> means<00:02:21.520> because<00:02:22.520> they<00:02:23.650> they

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
know what that means because they they

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.740 
know what that means because they they
can<00:02:24.860> fly<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.610> fine<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.680> they<00:02:27.800> can<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.720> I

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
can fly just fine so they can and so I

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.990 
can fly just fine so they can and so I
did<00:02:30.050> that<00:02:30.080> once<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.190> learned<00:02:31.460> my<00:02:31.580> lesson

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
did that once and I learned my lesson

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.120 
did that once and I learned my lesson
because<00:02:32.260> there's<00:02:33.260> not<00:02:33.440> sort<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.920> house

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
because there's not sort of the house

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.850 
because there's not sort of the house
and<00:02:34.990> um<00:02:35.990> i<00:02:36.710> disposed<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.730> those<00:02:37.940> flies<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:39.650> um

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
and um i disposed of those flies but um

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.570 
and um i disposed of those flies but um
all<00:02:42.860> right<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.650> they<00:02:45.830> are<00:02:45.890> no<00:02:46.100> longer<00:02:46.340> in

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
all right and so they are no longer in

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.700 
all right and so they are no longer in
my<00:02:46.700> house<00:02:46.910> well<00:02:47.510> besides<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.230> ones<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.590> are

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
my house well besides the ones that are

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.360 
my house well besides the ones that are
already<00:02:48.890> loose<00:02:50.350> wasn't<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.440> good<00:02:51.920> thing<00:02:52.160> that

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
already loose wasn't a good thing that

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.350 
already loose wasn't a good thing that
did<00:02:52.580> come<00:02:52.760> out<00:02:53.050> was<00:02:54.130> we<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.400> guess<00:02:55.730> we<00:02:55.940> got<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.120> few

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
did come out was we I guess we got a few

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.050 
did come out was we I guess we got a few
containers<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:57.080> mean<00:02:57.680> probably<00:02:57.980> if<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.700> put<00:02:59.030> a

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
containers I mean probably if I put a

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.750 
containers I mean probably if I put a
few<00:02:59.360> flies<00:02:59.750> in<00:03:00.110> here<00:03:00.970> wingless<00:03:01.970> ones<00:03:03.760> who

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
few flies in here wingless ones who

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.790 
few flies in here wingless ones who
flies<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.360> here<00:03:05.390> with<00:03:05.870> some<00:03:06.050> food<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.620> let

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
flies in here with some food and let

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.979 
flies in here with some food and let
them<00:03:07.010> lay<00:03:07.489> eggs<00:03:07.790> until<00:03:08.150> they're<00:03:08.450> like<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.780> max

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
them lay eggs until they're like it max

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.449 
them lay eggs until they're like it max
production<00:03:09.530> that's<00:03:09.650> may<00:03:09.830> be<00:03:09.890> enough<00:03:10.190> for<00:03:10.370> a

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
production that's may be enough for a

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.030 
production that's may be enough for a
meal<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.000> they<00:03:11.300> will<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:11.810> all<00:03:11.959> of<00:03:12.140> them<00:03:12.350> and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
meal and they will you all of them and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.040 
meal and they will you all of them and
you<00:03:13.220> just<00:03:13.430> tell<00:03:13.670> me<00:03:13.790> how<00:03:13.940> many<00:03:14.000> flies<00:03:14.420> six

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
you just tell me how many flies six

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.900 
you just tell me how many flies six
frogs<00:03:15.380> should<00:03:15.739> eat<00:03:17.470> but<00:03:18.470> that's<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.440> I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
frogs should eat but that's so that I

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.970 
frogs should eat but that's so that I
think<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:22.970> best<00:03:23.270> thing<00:03:23.390> is<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.050> sent<00:03:24.709> me<00:03:24.770> much

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
think the best thing is I sent me much

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.260 
think the best thing is I sent me much
as<00:03:25.330> food<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.890> two<00:03:27.890> containers<00:03:28.280> I'm<00:03:28.850> actually

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
as food and two containers I'm actually

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.750 
as food and two containers I'm actually
the<00:03:29.720> half<00:03:30.380> way<00:03:30.650> out<00:03:30.860> of<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.630> but<00:03:32.630> uh

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
the half way out of it but uh

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.089 
the half way out of it but uh
that's<00:03:34.450> gone<00:03:34.689> well<00:03:35.370> I've<00:03:36.370> used<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.909> food

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
that's gone well I've used that food

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.449 
that's gone well I've used that food
because<00:03:39.099> what<00:03:39.970> I've<00:03:40.090> used<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.480> on<00:03:40.569> is<00:03:41.459> the

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
because what I've used it on is the

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.720 
because what I've used it on is the
containers<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.269> they<00:03:43.599> send<00:03:44.189> we<00:03:45.189> they<00:03:45.459> send

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
containers that they send we they send

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.309 
containers that they send we they send
us<00:03:45.879> the<00:03:46.060> frogs<00:03:46.360> in<00:03:46.629> that<00:03:46.780> we<00:03:46.989> get<00:03:47.140> from<00:03:47.170> the

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
us the frogs in that we get from the

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.809 
us the frogs in that we get from the
store<00:03:47.560> they<00:03:47.709> put<00:03:47.860> them<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.099> container<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:48.730> we

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
store they put them in container so we

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.819 
store they put them in container so we
can<00:03:48.939> write<00:03:49.090> home<00:03:49.299> at<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:50.170> same<00:03:50.230> containers

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
can write home at the same containers

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.910 
can write home at the same containers
that<00:03:50.860> they<00:03:51.129> raised<00:03:51.519> fruit<00:03:52.090> flies<00:03:52.269> in<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.920> so

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
that they raised fruit flies in and so

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.300 
that they raised fruit flies in and so
we<00:03:54.220> just<00:03:54.970> kept<00:03:55.209> those<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.780> they're<00:03:56.560> like<00:03:56.739> kind

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
we just kept those and they're like kind

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.949 
we just kept those and they're like kind
of<00:03:57.400> like<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.549> coffee<00:03:57.909> filter<00:03:58.209> thing<00:03:58.599> over<00:03:58.870> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
of like a coffee filter thing over the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.849 
of like a coffee filter thing over the
top<00:03:59.170> at<00:03:59.409> the<00:03:59.530> lid<00:03:59.859> and<00:04:00.180> um<00:04:01.200> they<00:04:02.200> could<00:04:02.440> pasta

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
top at the lid and um they could pasta

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.190 
top at the lid and um they could pasta
container<00:04:03.250> i<00:04:03.370> showed<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.700> them<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.870> we<00:04:04.989> put

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
container i showed you them and we put

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.300 
container i showed you them and we put
we<00:04:05.590> mix<00:04:05.799> that<00:04:05.950> food<00:04:06.190> up<00:04:06.310> in<00:04:06.519> there<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:08.069> then<00:04:09.069> I

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
we mix that food up in there and then I

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.800 
we mix that food up in there and then I
um<00:04:11.040> put<00:04:12.040> like<00:04:12.159> a<00:04:12.190> coffee<00:04:12.459> filter<00:04:12.760> in<00:04:13.060> just<00:04:13.239> more

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
um put like a coffee filter in just more

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.319 
um put like a coffee filter in just more
area<00:04:14.290> in<00:04:14.500> there<00:04:14.680> volume<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.940> they<00:04:16.030> have<00:04:16.120> stuff

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
area in there volume so they have stuff

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.629 
area in there volume so they have stuff
to<00:04:16.449> climb<00:04:16.690> on<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:16.930> lay<00:04:17.229> eggs<00:04:17.260> on<00:04:17.620> instead<00:04:18.579> of

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
to climb on and lay eggs on instead of

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.879 
to climb on and lay eggs on instead of
just<00:04:18.729> flop<00:04:19.120> walls<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.900> much<00:04:20.380> space<00:04:20.650> in<00:04:20.829> the

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
just flop walls and much space in the

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.310 
just flop walls and much space in the
middle<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:22.120> then<00:04:23.850> that<00:04:24.850> works<00:04:25.060> well<00:04:25.419> may

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
middle and then that works well may

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.140 
middle and then that works well may
there's<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.680> lot<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:26.830> flies<00:04:27.100> in<00:04:27.280> there<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:30.250> so

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
there's a lot of flies in there and so

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.230 
there's a lot of flies in there and so
that<00:04:31.600> did<00:04:31.810> good<00:04:32.440> and<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:33.580> know<00:04:33.699> I<00:04:33.729> found<00:04:34.060> out

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
that did good and you know I found out

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.420 
that did good and you know I found out
once<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:34.930> have<00:04:35.050> song<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.590> you<00:04:35.919> have<00:04:36.100> space

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
once you have song and you have space

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.420 
once you have song and you have space
for<00:04:36.669> more<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.539> make<00:04:37.780> more<00:04:38.440> you<00:04:38.979> get<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.190> lot

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
for more and you make more you get a lot

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.020 
for more and you make more you get a lot
of<00:04:39.460> flies<00:04:39.760> because<00:04:40.479> I<00:04:40.599> have<00:04:40.690> like<00:04:41.490> four<00:04:42.490> big

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
of flies because I have like four big

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.260 
of flies because I have like four big
jars<00:04:43.510> going<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.349> got<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.979> lot<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:45.940> flies

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
jars going that I got a lot of flies

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.520 
jars going that I got a lot of flies
there<00:04:46.539> and<00:04:46.780> it<00:04:47.349> started<00:04:47.530> like<00:04:47.949> two<00:04:48.190> of<00:04:48.340> these

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
there and it started like two of these

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.110 
there and it started like two of these
but<00:04:50.530> um<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:51.449> wanted<00:04:52.449> to<00:04:52.539> tell<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.780> guys<00:04:53.940> if<00:04:54.940> you

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
but um I wanted to tell you guys if you

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.510 
but um I wanted to tell you guys if you
know<00:04:55.270> I<00:04:55.300> think<00:04:55.419> about<00:04:55.690> genetics<00:04:56.229> which<00:04:57.070> your

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
know I think about genetics which your

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.430 
know I think about genetics which your
reptile<00:04:57.910> person<00:04:58.360> you<00:04:58.599> breathe<00:04:58.840> snakes<00:04:59.199> you

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
reptile person you breathe snakes you

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.490 
reptile person you breathe snakes you
should<00:04:59.770> oh<00:05:00.010> you<00:05:00.220> probably<00:05:00.699> do<00:05:01.740> but<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:04.720> fruit

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
should oh you probably do but the fruit

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.490 
should oh you probably do but the fruit
flies<00:05:07.110> wings<00:05:08.460> their<00:05:09.460> dominant<00:05:10.210> trait<00:05:10.500> over

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
flies wings their dominant trait over

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.850 
flies wings their dominant trait over
wingless<00:05:12.070> which<00:05:12.370> is<00:05:12.520> recessive<00:05:13.050> so<00:05:14.050> if<00:05:14.500> you

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
wingless which is recessive so if you

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.589 
wingless which is recessive so if you
have<00:05:15.099> a<00:05:15.130> good<00:05:16.000> perfect<00:05:16.590> bunch<00:05:17.590> of<00:05:18.599> fruit

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
have a good perfect bunch of fruit

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.670 
have a good perfect bunch of fruit
flightless<00:05:20.380> flies<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:22.199> they're<00:05:23.199> going<00:05:23.380> good

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
flightless flies and they're going good

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.080 
flightless flies and they're going good
and<00:05:24.510> one<00:05:25.510> male<00:05:25.949> that<00:05:26.949> has<00:05:27.099> wings<00:05:27.370> it's<00:05:27.849> in

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
and one male that has wings it's in

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
they're all going to have wings with him

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.610 
they're all going to have wings with him
like<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.580> week<00:05:33.729> because<00:05:34.449> their<00:05:34.870> lifespans

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
like the week because their lifespans

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.300 
like the week because their lifespans
like<00:05:35.860> 15<00:05:36.340> days<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.990> males<00:05:38.260> gonna<00:05:38.680> breed

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
like 15 days and that males gonna breed

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.310 
like 15 days and that males gonna breed
with<00:05:39.490> one<00:05:39.760> of<00:05:39.880> them<00:05:40.060> and<00:05:40.300> he's<00:05:40.750> going<00:05:40.960> to<00:05:41.020> have

they<00:05:45.470> will<00:05:45.500> all<00:05:45.889> have<00:05:46.190> wing<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.729> that<00:05:46.970> that

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
they will all have wing and that that

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.170 
they will all have wing and that that
just<00:05:48.160> but<00:05:49.160> useless<00:05:49.400> um<00:05:49.729> we'll<00:05:49.880> see<00:05:49.910> how

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
just but useless um we'll see how

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.290 
just but useless um we'll see how
somebody<00:05:50.600> to<00:05:50.690> control<00:05:51.050> them<00:05:51.260> and<00:05:52.300> actually

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
somebody to control them and actually

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.379 
somebody to control them and actually
that<00:05:53.720> did<00:05:53.930> happen<00:05:54.139> and<00:05:54.800> I<00:05:54.919> had<00:05:55.130> to<00:05:55.340> wipe<00:05:55.790> out<00:05:56.090> I

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
that did happen and I had to wipe out I

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.020 
that did happen and I had to wipe out I
dumped<00:05:56.900> it<00:05:56.960> out<00:05:57.080> he<00:05:57.949> started<00:05:58.010> a<00:05:58.430> new<00:05:58.580> one<00:05:58.790> and

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
dumped it out he started a new one and

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.310 
dumped it out he started a new one and
so<00:05:59.690> got<00:06:00.560> rid<00:06:00.740> of<00:06:00.770> all<00:06:00.919> the<00:06:01.040> wings<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:02.169> so<00:06:03.169> now<00:06:03.290> I

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
so got rid of all the wings and so now I

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.070 
so got rid of all the wings and so now I
have<00:06:03.350> a<00:06:03.470> bunch<00:06:03.680> of<00:06:04.010> good<00:06:04.820> wingless<00:06:05.540> ones<00:06:05.810> that

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
have a bunch of good wingless ones that

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.719 
have a bunch of good wingless ones that
can't<00:06:06.320> get<00:06:06.440> away<00:06:06.500> from<00:06:06.680> the<00:06:06.949> frogs<00:06:07.220> and<00:06:07.610> away

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
can't get away from the frogs and away

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.969 
can't get away from the frogs and away
from<00:06:07.790> me<00:06:11.050> see<00:06:12.050> ya<00:06:12.169> and<00:06:12.560> you<00:06:12.620> guys<00:06:12.740> know<00:06:12.949> a

company<00:06:49.400> first<00:06:49.700> answer<00:06:50.450> that<00:06:52.539> disappointed

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
company first answer that disappointed

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:59.620 
company first answer that disappointed
me<00:06:54.400> and<00:06:55.400> by<00:06:55.580> the<00:06:55.610> way<00:06:55.729> i<00:06:55.849> use<00:06:56.270> the<00:06:58.210> that<00:06:59.210> kind

me and by the way i use the that kind

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.020 
me and by the way i use the that kind
the<00:07:00.050> melanogaster<00:07:00.530> because<00:07:01.340> my<00:07:01.520> frogs<00:07:01.880> aren't

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
the melanogaster because my frogs aren't

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.680 
the melanogaster because my frogs aren't
that<00:07:02.150> big<00:07:02.389> and<00:07:03.229> they<00:07:03.740> need<00:07:03.950> the<00:07:04.099> small<00:07:04.340> ones

that big and they need the small ones
but

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030
