00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.700 
4 is a graphic intensive game so let's
see<00:00:20.939> how<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.150> game<00:00:21.390> looks<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.439> device

actually<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.820> first<00:00:23.910> time<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.300> I'm

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
actually this is the first time that I'm

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
actually this is the first time that I'm
going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> run<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.830> game<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:27.150> device

the game is running in full effect stays
no<00:02:36.599> doubt<00:02:36.840> about<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.109> one<00:02:37.499> however<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:40.819> game

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
no doubt about that one however the game

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.530 
no doubt about that one however the game
is<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.239> at<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.629> smooth<00:02:42.930> has<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.590> should<00:02:43.859> be

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
is not at a smooth has it should be

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.679 
is not at a smooth has it should be
there<00:02:45.540> are<00:02:45.689> some<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:48.030> frame<00:02:48.239> rates<00:02:48.450> are

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
there are some the frame rates are

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.459 
there are some the frame rates are
slightly<00:02:49.700> lower<00:02:50.700> than<00:02:51.090> what<00:02:51.930> they<00:02:52.079> should<00:02:52.290> be

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:52.469 
slightly lower than what they should be

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.309 
slightly lower than what they should be
and<00:02:52.739> these<00:02:53.489> notifications<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.870> are<00:02:54.930> coming

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
and these notifications that are coming

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.420 
and these notifications that are coming
from<00:02:55.439> xbox<00:02:57.709> is<00:02:58.709> not<00:02:58.980> helping<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.519> foundation

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
from xbox is not helping the foundation

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.159 
from xbox is not helping the foundation
because<00:03:02.430> at<00:03:03.060> times<00:03:03.269> they<00:03:03.599> also<00:03:04.169> slow<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:05.010> game

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
because at times they also slow the game

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:17.100 
because at times they also slow the game
further

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.800 

let's<00:03:17.710> go

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.570 

however<00:03:24.810> good<00:03:25.050> thing<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.950> human<00:03:26.400> is

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
however good thing is that the human is

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.050 
however good thing is that the human is
showing<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.090> full<00:03:27.330> effects<00:03:28.340> as<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.670> can<00:03:29.880> see

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
showing the full effects as you can see

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.670 
showing the full effects as you can see
all<00:03:30.090> our<00:03:30.270> ashes<00:03:30.959> are<00:03:31.590> flying<00:03:31.980> around<00:03:32.280> and

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
all our ashes are flying around and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.230 
all our ashes are flying around and
everything<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.980> between<00:03:40.970> these<00:03:41.970> are<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
everything is between these are the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.700 
everything is between these are the
Penguins<00:03:42.690> on<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.900> plane

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:57.490 

behind

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:28.930 

Oh

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.460 

the<00:04:29.600> frame<00:04:29.810> rates<00:04:30.020> are<00:04:30.350> actually<00:04:31.390> acceptable

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
the frame rates are actually acceptable

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.560 
the frame rates are actually acceptable
slightly<00:04:33.470> slower<00:04:33.710> but<00:04:36.400> for<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.760> positive

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
slightly slower but for the positive

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.750 
slightly slower but for the positive
graphic<00:04:39.290> intensive<00:04:39.560> game<00:04:40.010> they<00:04:40.340> are<00:04:40.490> still

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
graphic intensive game they are still

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.360 
graphic intensive game they are still
not<00:04:41.630> that<00:04:41.870> bad<00:04:42.140> and<00:04:44.080> considering<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.250> CPU<00:04:46.250> in

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
not that bad and considering the CPU in

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.690 
not that bad and considering the CPU in
this<00:04:46.550> thing<00:04:47.830> that's<00:04:48.830> actually<00:04:49.160> not<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.610> bad

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
this thing that's actually not a bad

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.400 
this thing that's actually not a bad
performance<00:04:51.490> but<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.670> feel<00:04:52.910> that<00:04:53.450> the<00:04:53.960> thing

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
performance but you feel that the thing

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.410 
performance but you feel that the thing
gets<00:04:54.620> are<00:04:54.860> slow<00:04:55.400> when<00:04:56.240> you<00:04:56.450> are<00:04:58.420> shooting

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
gets are slow when you are shooting

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.410 
gets are slow when you are shooting
someone<00:05:00.020> because<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:01.870> gun<00:05:02.870> is<00:05:02.900> not<00:05:03.260> able<00:05:03.470> to

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
someone because the gun is not able to

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:14.530 
someone because the gun is not able to
fire<00:05:05.420> the<00:05:05.660> bullet<00:05:05.960> at<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.440> rapid<00:05:06.890> speed<00:05:13.540> so

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
fire the bullet at the rapid speed so

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.660 
fire the bullet at the rapid speed so
these<00:05:14.720> are<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.960> frame<00:05:15.380> rates<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:16.160> the

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
these are the frame rates and the

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.540 
these are the frame rates and the
graphics<00:05:16.880> of<00:05:17.240> this<00:05:17.390> game<00:05:17.480> on<00:05:18.430> lumia<00:05:19.430> 1020<00:05:21.550> so

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
let's now check out the other game the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.100 
let's now check out the other game the
fruit<00:05:27.500> ninja<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.010> let's<00:05:28.250> see<00:05:28.430> how<00:05:28.840> that<00:05:29.840> one

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
fruit ninja and let's see how that one

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.930 
fruit ninja and let's see how that one
looks<00:05:30.350> on<00:05:30.560> this<00:05:30.800> game<00:05:33.190> on<00:05:34.190> this<00:05:34.460> device<00:05:34.730> in

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
looks on this game on this device in

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:48.020 
looks on this game on this device in
here<00:05:38.950> sure<00:05:39.950> this<00:05:40.160> area<00:05:40.520> so<00:05:40.700> we<00:05:40.820> can<00:05:40.850> advance

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.760 

if<00:05:48.450> they<00:05:48.750> can<00:05:48.900> lower<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:50.570> the<00:05:51.570> graphics<00:05:52.530> on

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
if they can lower the the graphics on

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.770 
if they can lower the the graphics on
this<00:05:53.340> device<00:05:53.670> it<00:05:54.000> will<00:05:54.150> become<00:05:54.540> further

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
this device it will become further

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.550 
this device it will become further
