00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
a choice specs pyroar only do that much

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.960 
a choice specs pyroar only do that much
to<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.650> broken-ass<00:01:05.489> piece<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:06.890> okay<00:01:07.970> we

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
to this broken-ass piece of okay we

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.670 
to this broken-ass piece of okay we
go<00:01:09.090> into<00:01:09.240> mess<00:01:09.420> /<00:01:09.630> now<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.049> trick<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> I

go into mess / now and we trick it I
suppose<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:13.100> don't<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.280> care<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
suppose I don't really care if I get a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.260 
suppose I don't really care if I get a
flame<00:01:15.090> orb<00:01:17.990> trick<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.850> never<00:01:20.850> see<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.090> coming

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
flame orb trick I never see that coming

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.249 
flame orb trick I never see that coming
which<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:21.990> good<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.500> least

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:36.730 

shame<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.289> you<00:01:31.070> getting<00:01:32.070> greedy

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.109 

okay<00:01:39.020> what<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.229> now<00:01:40.560> whose<00:01:41.490> ice<00:01:41.789> beam

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
okay what can I do now whose ice beam

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.080 
okay what can I do now whose ice beam
like<00:01:42.689> forever<00:01:46.069> why<00:01:47.069> are<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.369> staying<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.880> in

like forever why are you staying in in

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.010 
like forever why are you staying in in
cosmic<00:01:48.600> powering<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:52.490> guess<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:54.020> there's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
cosmic powering I guess because there's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.729 
cosmic powering I guess because there's
no<00:01:55.140> way<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.289> can<00:01:55.350> hurt<00:01:55.649> him<00:01:55.679> but<00:01:57.619> hmm<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.500> let's

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
no way I can hurt him but hmm so let's

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:03.050 
no way I can hurt him but hmm so let's
get<00:02:01.829> some<00:02:02.009> swish<00:02:02.220> initiative<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.819> just<00:02:02.939> go

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
get some swish initiative and just go

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.139 
get some swish initiative and just go
into<00:02:03.179> this<00:02:03.329> he's<00:02:03.720> just<00:02:03.750> gonna<00:02:03.989> do<00:02:04.200> that

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
into this he's just gonna do that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.039 
into this he's just gonna do that
because<00:02:06.149> eventually<00:02:06.509> he's<00:02:06.780> gonna<00:02:06.840> get

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
because eventually he's gonna get

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.850 
because eventually he's gonna get
created<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.899> see<00:02:10.140> nothing<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.530> its<00:02:10.709> team
