right<00:00:33.809> I've<00:00:34.530> got<00:00:34.649> an<00:00:34.739> AP<00:00:34.950> m26<00:00:35.460> driving<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:35.940> all

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
right I've got an AP m26 driving at all

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.190 
right I've got an AP m26 driving at all
APM's<00:00:38.070> great<00:00:38.520> little<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.510> controllers

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
APM's great little you know controllers

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.750 
APM's great little you know controllers
but<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> problem<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> LED

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
but the problem is that the LED

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520 
but the problem is that the LED
indicator<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.600> kind<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.110> here

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
indicator which you can kind of see here

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.279 
indicator which you can kind of see here
is<00:00:43.680> very<00:00:44.579> very<00:00:45.300> faint<00:00:45.600> especially<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.140> broad

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
is very very faint especially in broad

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.590 
is very very faint especially in broad
daylight<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.579> original<00:00:48.059> reason<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
daylight so the original reason for the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.619 
daylight so the original reason for the
crash<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.320> had<00:00:49.500> was<00:00:49.800> low<00:00:50.430> battery<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
crash I had was low battery and you

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.060 
crash I had was low battery and you
can't<00:00:51.809> really<00:00:52.020> hear<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.350> buzzer<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.920> high

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
can't really hear the buzzer at high

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.549 
can't really hear the buzzer at high
altitude<00:00:53.579> or<00:00:54.050> you<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.350> flying

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
altitude or you know if it's flying

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.889 
altitude or you know if it's flying
around<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.340> windy<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.910> having<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.539> LED

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
around and it's windy so having a LED

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.139 
around and it's windy so having a LED
indicators<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.680> pretty<00:00:59.129> critical<00:00:59.370> that's

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
indicators is pretty critical that's

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.610 
indicators is pretty critical that's
where<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> kind<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.690> put<00:01:00.840> these<00:01:00.930> guys<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.410> right

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
where I kind of put these guys in right

you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.280> guy<00:01:47.430> here<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you know this this guy here is going to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.210 
you know this this guy here is going to
be<00:01:48.509> your<00:01:48.630> ground<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:50.009> source

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
be your ground that's going your source

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.880 
be your ground that's going your source
ground<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.360> your<00:01:51.890> you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
ground and this is going to be your you

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.910 
ground and this is going to be your you
know<00:01:53.420> source<00:01:54.420> voltage<00:01:55.020> which<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.380> anywhere

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
know source voltage which is anywhere

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.910 
know source voltage which is anywhere
between<00:01:55.979> five<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.850> thirty<00:01:57.840> volts<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.619> I'm

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
between five and thirty volts so I'm

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
between five and thirty volts so I'm
going<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.189> running<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.549> off<00:01:59.840> eleven

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
going to be running this off eleven

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.510 
going to be running this off eleven
point<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.200> volts<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.100> basically<00:02:02.399> a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
point one volts you know basically a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.840 
point one volts you know basically a
three<00:02:02.850> cell<00:02:03.710> which<00:02:04.710> should<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.040> fine<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.700> you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
three cell which should be fine but you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.819 
three cell which should be fine but you
can<00:02:05.939> pretty<00:02:06.090> much<00:02:06.180> run<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.780> anything<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
can pretty much run it on anything the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.440 
can pretty much run it on anything the
more<00:02:08.009> more<00:02:08.610> power<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.970> brighter<00:02:09.179> it's<00:02:09.330> going

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
more more power the brighter it's going

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.089 
more more power the brighter it's going
to<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.690> they're<00:02:10.319> already<00:02:10.530> pretty<00:02:10.739> bright<00:02:11.069> so

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
to be they're already pretty bright so

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.670 
to be they're already pretty bright so
when<00:02:11.459> you

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
when you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.339 
when you
in<00:02:12.739> on<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.849> bench<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.329> know<00:02:14.359> make<00:02:15.109> sure<00:02:15.140> it's

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
in on the bench you know make sure it's

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.630 
in on the bench you know make sure it's
pointed<00:02:15.590> away<00:02:15.680> from<00:02:15.769> you<00:02:15.950> because<00:02:16.159> it'll<00:02:16.489> be

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
pointed away from you because it'll be

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.449 
pointed away from you because it'll be
it'll<00:02:17.030> be<00:02:17.120> quite<00:02:17.469> right

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
it'll be quite right

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.490 
it'll be quite right
the<00:02:19.730> remaining<00:02:20.000> five<00:02:20.359> pins<00:02:20.719> here<00:02:21.049> these<00:02:21.319> are

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
the remaining five pins here these are

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.970 
the remaining five pins here these are
meter<00:02:21.739> controls<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.450> got<00:02:23.930> your<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.890> know

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
meter controls so you got your you know

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.280 
meter controls so you got your you know
just<00:02:25.159> to<00:02:25.280> ground<00:02:25.659> this<00:02:26.659> does<00:02:26.900> work<00:02:27.140> without

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
just to ground this does work without

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.809 
just to ground this does work without
the<00:02:27.500> ground<00:02:27.739> but<00:02:28.040> I'd<00:02:28.129> say<00:02:28.310> make<00:02:28.549> sure<00:02:28.579> it's

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
the ground but I'd say make sure it's

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.479 
the ground but I'd say make sure it's
hooked<00:02:28.939> up<00:02:29.739> because<00:02:30.739> it's<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.159> way<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.370> was

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
hooked up because it's the way it was

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.099 
hooked up because it's the way it was
designed<00:02:31.639> and<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.329> don't<00:02:32.510> have<00:02:32.659> any<00:02:32.810> signal

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
designed and you don't have any signal

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.250 
designed and you don't have any signal
nor<00:02:33.500> these<00:02:33.620> problems<00:02:34.069> in<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.639> air<00:02:35.260> then

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
nor these problems in the air then

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.059 
nor these problems in the air then
you've<00:02:36.439> got<00:02:36.560> your<00:02:36.680> white<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:38.859> usually<00:02:39.859> tie<00:02:40.010> this

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
you've got your white I usually tie this

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.740 
you've got your white I usually tie this
into<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.900> APM's<00:02:42.250> motor<00:02:43.250> LEDs<00:02:43.790> which<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.659> know

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
into the APM's motor LEDs which you know

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.580 
into the APM's motor LEDs which you know
are<00:02:45.109> from<00:02:45.799> anywhere<00:02:46.459> between<00:02:46.609> a<00:02:46.760> 7<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.629> 11

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
are from anywhere between a 7 to a 11

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.679 
are from anywhere between a 7 to a 11
that<00:02:49.159> way<00:02:49.340> it's<00:02:49.519> kind<00:02:49.549> of<00:02:49.730> like<00:02:49.819> it'll<00:02:50.450> flash

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
that way it's kind of like it'll flash

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.210 
that way it's kind of like it'll flash
when<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.109> armed<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.680> can<00:02:51.829> you<00:02:52.069> can

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
when it's armed you can you can

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.740 
when it's armed you can you can
customize<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.329> you<00:02:53.389> can<00:02:53.540> move<00:02:53.659> them

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
customize this and you can move them

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.199 
customize this and you can move them
around<00:02:53.840> however<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.769> want<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.669> just<00:02:55.700> you

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
around however you want this is just you

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.069 
around however you want this is just you
know<00:02:56.239> an<00:02:56.389> example<00:02:56.919> and<00:02:57.919> then<00:02:58.069> you've<00:02:58.189> got<00:02:58.370> your

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
know an example and then you've got your

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.860 
know an example and then you've got your
you<00:03:00.079> know<00:03:00.200> red<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.909> should<00:03:02.599> be<00:03:02.689> for

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
you know red this is should be for

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.890 
you know red this is should be for
camera<00:03:05.439> then<00:03:06.439> you've<00:03:06.590> got<00:03:06.769> your<00:03:07.040> green<00:03:07.900> and

site where they have these pin outs if
you<00:03:17.090> want<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.389> change<00:03:18.019> it<00:03:18.199> out<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:18.530> this<00:03:18.709> GPS

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
you want to change it out but this GPS

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.920 
you want to change it out but this GPS
is<00:03:19.400> on<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.819> six<00:03:20.979> so<00:03:21.979> a<00:03:22.010> six<00:03:22.430> red<00:03:22.849> can<00:03:23.359> be<00:03:23.389> anything

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
is on a six so a six red can be anything

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.349 
is on a six so a six red can be anything
you<00:03:24.530> know<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:25.250> tie<00:03:25.729> it<00:03:25.790> into<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.180> buzzer

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
you know you tie it into the buzzer

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.979 
you know you tie it into the buzzer
which<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.169> a<00:03:27.290> five<00:03:28.209> if<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:29.299> want<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.599> have<00:03:29.750> you

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
which is a five if you want to have you

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.050 
which is a five if you want to have you
know<00:03:30.019> just<00:03:30.889> a<00:03:30.979> status<00:03:31.340> indicator<00:03:31.699> when<00:03:31.939> it

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
know just a status indicator when it

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.449 
know just a status indicator when it
arms<00:03:32.389> when<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.629> disarms<00:03:33.099> it<00:03:34.099> should<00:03:34.250> be<00:03:34.310> pretty

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
arms when it disarms it should be pretty

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.119 
arms when it disarms it should be pretty
simple<00:03:34.669> so<00:03:35.139> let<00:03:36.139> me<00:03:36.260> move<00:03:36.620> this<00:03:36.680> across<00:03:37.010> here

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
simple so let me move this across here

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.119 
simple so let me move this across here
and<00:03:37.699> show<00:03:38.269> you<00:03:38.329> this<00:03:38.689> how<00:03:39.199> it<00:03:39.349> hooks<00:03:39.500> up<00:03:39.739> right

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
and show you this how it hooks up right

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.289 
and show you this how it hooks up right
so<00:03:41.949> the<00:03:42.949> cool<00:03:43.129> thing<00:03:43.159> is<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.549> does<00:03:43.759> provide

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
so the cool thing is it does provide

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.300 
so the cool thing is it does provide
they<00:03:44.479> do<00:03:44.540> provide<00:03:44.840> when<00:03:45.709> you<00:03:45.769> purchase<00:03:46.099> this<00:03:46.250> a

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
they do provide when you purchase this a

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.490 
they do provide when you purchase this a
nice<00:03:46.579> little<00:03:46.609> transparent<00:03:47.449> heat<00:03:48.019> shrink<00:03:48.259> tube

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
nice little transparent heat shrink tube

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.199 
nice little transparent heat shrink tube
so<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:48.829> can<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.310> know<00:03:49.370> slide<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:49.939> in<00:03:50.030> here

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
so you can you know slide it in here

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.969 
so you can you know slide it in here
when<00:03:50.389> it's<00:03:50.509> you've<00:03:51.139> tested<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.650> it's<00:03:51.859> done

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:51.979 
when it's you've tested it it's done

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:53.770 
when it's you've tested it it's done
you're<00:03:52.220> done<00:03:52.310> with<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.579> soldering<00:03:52.939> I<00:03:53.239> use

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
you're done with the soldering I use

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.789 
you're done with the soldering I use
straight<00:03:54.109> just<00:03:54.680> cables<00:03:56.199> we've<00:03:57.199> got<00:03:57.409> you<00:03:57.709> know

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
straight just cables we've got you know

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.699 
straight just cables we've got you know
two<00:03:58.159> males<00:03:58.840> for<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.959> power<00:04:00.139> because<00:04:00.560> you

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
two males for the power because you

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.179 
two males for the power because you
don't<00:04:00.829> want<00:04:00.949> to<00:04:01.009> have<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.400> actual<00:04:01.879> power<00:04:03.189> with

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189 
don't want to have the actual power with

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.069 
don't want to have the actual power with
males<00:04:04.459> inside<00:04:05.120> here<00:04:05.449> because<00:04:05.629> carbon<00:04:05.900> fiber

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
males inside here because carbon fiber

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.170 
males inside here because carbon fiber
is<00:04:06.259> conductive<00:04:06.739> and<00:04:06.859> you<00:04:06.979> could<00:04:07.129> short<00:04:07.430> so

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
is conductive and you could short so

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.119 
is conductive and you could short so
it's<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.780> opposite<00:04:09.199> and<00:04:09.379> then<00:04:09.650> over<00:04:10.099> here

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
it's the opposite and then over here

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.550 
it's the opposite and then over here
we've<00:04:10.519> got<00:04:10.549> you<00:04:11.329> know<00:04:11.419> the<00:04:11.540> female<00:04:11.750> jumper<00:04:12.349> so

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
we've got you know the female jumper so

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.129 
we've got you know the female jumper so
that<00:04:12.709> I<00:04:12.739> can<00:04:12.859> plug<00:04:12.979> directly<00:04:13.159> into<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.639> board

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
that I can plug directly into the board

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:18.789 
that I can plug directly into the board
you<00:04:15.139> count<00:04:15.439> from<00:04:16.159> zero<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.639> 11<00:04:17.650> from<00:04:18.650> this

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
you count from zero to 11 from this

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.979 
you count from zero to 11 from this
sides<00:04:19.009> at<00:04:19.220> zero<00:04:19.489> one<00:04:19.759> two<00:04:20.030> three<00:04:20.359> or<00:04:20.449> four<00:04:20.630> so

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
sides at zero one two three or four so

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.860 
sides at zero one two three or four so
on<00:04:21.169> and<00:04:21.919> I'll<00:04:22.010> show<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:22.159> that<00:04:22.279> in<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.460> second<00:04:22.820> so

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
on and I'll show you that in a second so

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.290 
on and I'll show you that in a second so
once<00:04:24.530> it's<00:04:24.710> done<00:04:24.889> and<00:04:24.950> you<00:04:25.460> tested<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.150> can

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
once it's done and you tested it you can

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.540 
once it's done and you tested it you can
mount<00:04:26.450> it<00:04:26.630> i<00:04:26.870> want<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:27.380> mount<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:27.680> guy<00:04:27.950> here

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
mount it i want to mount this guy here

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.280 
mount it i want to mount this guy here
you<00:04:28.820> can<00:04:28.940> also<00:04:29.060> mount<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.930> pretty<00:04:30.139> much

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
you can also mount it pretty much

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.129 
you can also mount it pretty much
anywhere<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.860> may<00:04:31.370> make<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.610> 3d<00:04:32.600> print<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:32.990> have

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
anywhere I may make a 3d print and have

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.810 
anywhere I may make a 3d print and have
it<00:04:33.260> downward-facing<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.310> can<00:04:34.490> have<00:04:34.669> it

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
it downward-facing so I can have it

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.360 
it downward-facing so I can have it
overhead<00:04:35.560> depending<00:04:36.560> what<00:04:36.680> I'm<00:04:36.770> filming<00:04:37.190> and

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
and get this guy on power if you wire it

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.510 
and get this guy on power if you wire it
up<00:05:06.320> right<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.680> should<00:05:06.830> see<00:05:06.950> a<00:05:06.980> little<00:05:07.130> red<00:05:07.340> LED

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
up right you should see a little red LED

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.920 
up right you should see a little red LED
indicator<00:05:08.090> this<00:05:08.180> means<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.510> board's<00:05:08.780> got

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
indicator this means the board's got

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.110 
indicator this means the board's got
power<00:05:09.280> let's<00:05:10.280> kind<00:05:10.520> of<00:05:10.550> bring<00:05:10.760> this<00:05:10.880> all<00:05:11.090> back

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
power let's kind of bring this all back

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.390 
power let's kind of bring this all back
together<00:05:11.570> I'm<00:05:12.410> still<00:05:12.740> in<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:12.860> process<00:05:13.010> of

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
together I'm still in the process of

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.360 
together I'm still in the process of
rebuilding<00:05:13.700> this<00:05:13.970> guy<00:05:14.180> so<00:05:18.130> it'll<00:05:19.130> take<00:05:19.340> a

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
rebuilding this guy so it'll take a

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:27.439 
rebuilding this guy so it'll take a
little<00:05:19.550> while<00:05:22.210> all<00:05:23.210> right

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449

got<00:05:27.960> caught<00:05:28.259> up<00:05:28.379> there<00:05:28.590> in<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.770> video<00:05:28.979> cable

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
got caught up there in the video cable

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.260 
got caught up there in the video cable
alright<00:05:31.680> so<00:05:31.949> get<00:05:32.129> the<00:05:32.280> AP<00:05:32.699> and<00:05:32.729> back<00:05:32.939> up<00:05:33.120> on

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
alright so get the AP and back up on

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.980 
alright so get the AP and back up on
there<00:05:33.509> and<00:05:33.830> see<00:05:34.830> here<00:05:35.009> here's<00:05:35.219> the<00:05:35.280> LEDs

will look something like this couples
the<00:06:51.240> second<00:06:51.599> one<00:06:51.750> of<00:06:51.930> the<00:06:52.050> configuration

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
the second one of the configuration

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.540 
the second one of the configuration
later<00:06:53.690> but<00:06:54.690> this<00:06:54.839> is<00:06:54.900> the<00:06:55.050> broad<00:06:55.979> strokes<00:06:56.339> and

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
later but this is the broad strokes and

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.730 
later but this is the broad strokes and
how<00:06:56.610> to<00:06:56.669> get<00:06:56.819> it<00:06:56.939> installed<00:06:57.180> and<00:06:57.569> running<00:06:57.930> you

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
how to get it installed and running you

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.769 
how to get it installed and running you
can<00:06:58.770> actually<00:06:59.009> see<00:06:59.310> this<00:06:59.430> is<00:06:59.610> quite<00:07:00.270> blinding

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:00.779
