00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 since we soon have Easter, I want you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.099
 hereby part of this bunny and tinker 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.679
 You may need white fabric at best 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.230
 a nice slicing then one in addition 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.350
 fit in pink fabric one 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.560
 tailor scissors needles wire cutters 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.550
 chalk or a bubble bath one 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.380
 hairline and of course a sewing machine 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.279
 First of all we draw a template 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.630
 on cartoon and cut out isar 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.160
 then we put the cut out 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.410
 Katrin template on the floor and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.170
 records two bunny ears and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.460
 cut these in turn 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.160
 then we have these two 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.200
 ears parts on the white fabric now 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.530
 let's draw on the template of the big one 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.780
 ear a little smaller clock like 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.430
 to see in the picture 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.710
 if this smaller clock on cartoon 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.469
 cut open is contest as a template 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.520
 on the rose fabric trance and there will be 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.949
 then again a rosy 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.579
 cut out or actually two 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.010
 roses so then we have all the items 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.140
 which we need 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.810
 Now, at each valley below 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.270
 lower edge a little bit behind 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.830
 Sewn inside so it's just ours 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 the most beautiful and important thing is 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.049
 of course that the outer side of the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.200
 right side now is always one 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.060
 rosy placed on a white part and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.280
 it is correct that in the white 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.909
 not if the right side is up and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.259
 at the raw material the right side down too 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.090
 next step is a bit 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.640
 more complicated or a bit 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.229
 more complicated to explain 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.409
 So Rosenthal will, too 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.490
 white part draufgelegt 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.009
 the big detail is a bit 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.500
 is smaller than the white but important 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.520
 Nevertheless, the edges are always accurate 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.259
 lie together 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.079
 has that is you have to be like that 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.579
 always draw that detail so that you can 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.439
 both countries has exactly one another 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.810
 Thus , the whole order looks like this 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.619
 a bit but that's part as the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.450
 see you later why so now 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.840
 be the two ears from the left 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.549
 side because we have the whole 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.910
 baltrum sewn on the right side 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.929
 turned around and yes then it looks and 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.459
 then I have one more thing 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.709
 bit ironed so it does not work that way 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.040
 is warped and that's a bit 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.230
 it's easier to process now 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.209
 a piece of the advice is cut off 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.430
 that has what should be too long with it 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.379
 the whole fits in and both 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.569
 pages and even got out a lot 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.430
 Maturity were down to thin and that 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.190
 they are two equal turned on so 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.349
 a little twisted then how to 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.650
 this wire so that he is the same 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.310
 shape and size of a hare and then 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:47.010
 The wire is plugged into the ear as 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.329
 next will always be on the edge of 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.250
 pink and the white fabric and long 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.799
 not where they are green and that way 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.500
 that the wire is long at the moment 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.549
 running to the right of the needle is so the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.160
 wire is virtually in this one in this 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.810
 white bulls inside so that's beautiful 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.269
 Sewn with the edge so that I 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.069
 can not move then sees that 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.359
 it all went out in the picture 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.459
 no big difference to before 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.090
 but it does look real 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.019
 a big difference 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.450
 Now I have this one more 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.010
 Bit folded together and the man 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.510
 can see in the picture and that 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.250
 then sewn together a bit 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.099
 move down so it goes down 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.540
 I have a little bit of real looks now 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.920
 everything still does not work 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.049
 true, I think it is quite somehow 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.489
 looks cute 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.239
 now only the ears come to the 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.650
 moult 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.780
 I just have to 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.630
 both sides of the ear completely open the 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.960
 neck wrapped and yes that's it 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.370
 Magath just finished 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.080
 if you want to see how you cats 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.580
 you can do that by principle yes 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.110
 actually just the like the hare 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.290
 ears I link you here yet 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.290
 times
