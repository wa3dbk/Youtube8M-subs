00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.890
 hello today on our review 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.380
 pulses laboratory power supply 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.450
 an inner 3603 to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.100
 This power supply is interesting first 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.189
 queue and wide output range 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.840
 voltage up to 36 volts and the fact that he 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.930
 use pretty and compact 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.820
 housing on the front panel is placed 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.340
 large liquid crystal display with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.559
 backlight is not displayed output 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.110
 voltage output current and operating mode 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.159
 device controls the output 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.030
 voltage only limits button 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.930
 which includes includes exit and 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 output connectors 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.350
 load on the back but by 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.269
 power on and off 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.790
 power cable connector fuse 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.729
 the power source is quite compact not 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.040
 very heavy he is still pulsed on 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.040
 bottom side four rubber feet 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.140
 inside we can see Persian usual 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.710
 switching power supply 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.460
 claims to build quality and installation 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.190
 no, now let's demonstrate the main ones 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.830
 the power supply modes of energy 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.840
 360 because for the demonstration we will 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.830
 use this rheostat now on 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.640
 10 ohm resistance is set 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.640
 include power supply 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.570
 Consider the constant source mode 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.619
 voltage for example i need to set 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:59.460
 voltage is 30 volts and left and 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:02:02.950
 tension I want to feed to the maximum 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.580
 connect load load me 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.170
 already said 10 he 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.170
 Turn on the output using the inside here 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.380
 actually 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.870
 30 volt twenty nine and nine can 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.890
 correct the total TNC 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.860
 respectively 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.920
 how much resistance 10 it weighs 1 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.970
 different from okey voltage let's 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.970
 set your 20 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.210
 10 volts 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.629
 where you need to disconnect the load you can 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:55.939
 you can just click on the body on the dipstick 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:03:00.170
 and already then disconnect now 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:02.540
 The sources of the current regime it is for 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.579
 mode only restriction in order to 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.319
 to establish 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.920
 then in limiting you need to reduce the current and 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:14.480
 voltage to a minimum and then a little bit 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.219
 screw regulators what was 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.680
 some small value is set 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:20.680
 and paint the weekend theme well 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.419
 turn on the output for example i need 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.419
 limit current to 2 amps 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.370
 set by higher karen 2 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:39.370
 Ampere is 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:51.010
 connect the load because I 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.510
 the current is set at 2 amps 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.700
 resistance 10 ohm respectively for 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.230
 cure this current with very power 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.500
 automatically set the output 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.720
 voltage at 20 volts if 1 and 0 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.610
 ducks 3 amperes respectively source 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.610
 power supply set to 30 volts 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.489
 for example, I set the floor ampere 35 here 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.130
 and accordingly, so that I do not 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.320
 happened in the load there is short 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.480
 closure source anyway 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.410
 power auto bordered output 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.610
 the current is set by the master she 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.350
 3603 a 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.870
 compact power supply which 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.360
 will be simply indispensable in the repair and 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.060

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.140
 Goodbye all good
