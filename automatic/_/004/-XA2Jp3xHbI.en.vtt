00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.230
 for a couple of weeks in the tobacco shop 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:29.699
 of the cities these new ones have come out 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.579
 camel activate double then the rooms 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.540
 activate we all know them more or less 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.640
 except smokers are those cigarettes 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:43.739
 that by pressing the button they become 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.010
 these cigarettes practically menthol 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.330
 instead they are particular see if 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.689
 you can see them well here are those 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.580
 cigarettes have two buttons one for 

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:59.430
 activate menthol and the other for 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.799
 activate a new taste that is a taste 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.220
 strange mixed between berries and 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:08.509
 mirtillo then the opinions of this 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.280
 ie cigarette I tell you at the end 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.680
 put it like oar together on 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.360
 small package is very nice as in the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.189
 usually at the room activated not there 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.990
 you must never be able to do it 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.170
 see better 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:27.409
 here it is, we have the usual hat 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.000
 silver is the representation of 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.640
 two balls in a blue one for the for 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.710
 the mint and the other the pink one for 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.630
 berries while behind is the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.630
 explanation of how to use it 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.740
 then pressing the blue ball we will have the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.550
 mint flavor by pressing the ball 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.890
 violet we will have the taste of wild berries 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.840
 inside the package 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.860
 we also have a leaflet 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.780
 present in any version of 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.539
 well- released new cigarettes 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.119
 exactly that here where it tells us both 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:10.000
 the characteristics of cigarettes 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.000
 themselves and the various flavors available 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.150
 ie there is written that by activating not 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.689
 activating them we have a standard taste 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.730
 of a blue camel cigarette activate 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.540
 only the blue ball will have the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.129
 menthol camel as we already know them 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.010
 activating only the purple ball 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.930
 we will have new taste while activating them 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.019
 all 2 we will have a mix of tastes that 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.560
 honestly it sucks to me, but here it is 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.640
 indicates as one of the possibilities 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.430
 grind the cigarette and tell you immediately 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.560
 what do i think of this new stuff 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.599
 which will come out however the package costs 4 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.650
 60 euros there are twenty cigarettes 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.510
 obviously it is available in almost all 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.220
 how many tobacconists in the last week 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.739
 it was a test period i think 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.290
 since they have supplied them they will be 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.069
 available for everyone in when not 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.069
 will be taken off the market 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.270
 then the taste without 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.970
 not at all a room the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.520
 slightly lighter blue 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.769
 let's try to activate the first taste given 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.620
 that the menthol one anyway 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.099
 we know active loves the taste of fruits 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.769
 of forest 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:33.280
 we feel the click of the ball think that 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.280
 feel it 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.960
 I have to take the first shot 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.770
 I don't know if you've ever smoked a hookah 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.480
 but the taste is exactly what it is 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.480
 practically smoking a molasses of 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.780
 hookah through a cigarette 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.520
 ie I don't think a smoker to whom 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.990
 like tobacco taste you go by 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.760
 buy these cigarettes let's say it is 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.470
 more a whim 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.020
 also because the taste and more remember one 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.580
 candy that a cigarette 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.489
 so let's say the room did the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.640
 first step forward to extend the 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.620
 tobacco market also pre kids 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.270
 teenagers who don't like gus and la 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.730
 bitter cigarette and then you buy 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.669
 this stuff here to make up for that taste 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.400
 let's say and say that as strategies of 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.260
 selling works however I don't say that it is 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.180
 ethically right 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.380
 the values ​​of these cigarettes are 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:35.640
 tar 8 mg then medium strong nicotine 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.970
 05 medium and carbon monoxide 7 mg 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.710
 medium strong we don't even get close 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.500
 minimally to the taste of a marlboro or 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.240
 of a traditional camel like I said 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.380
 first the taste is very similar to the camer 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.090
 blue activating only the purple taste 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.470
 as he defines it here we will have one 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.820
 feeling of eating a candy 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.820
 marra at the same time 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.639
 although I must say that it is very fresh 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.190
 as gus that is maybe for the summer 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.660
 could also work but 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.080
 honestly yes as I am doing this 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.500
 video on March 13th here again 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.660
 cold 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.330
 let's say the taste of this cigarette 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.190
 it is not optimal in the winter we go 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.919
 now to activate the second ball 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:24.130
 that is the traditional maine toro 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.130
 it makes me feel better about the little noise it makes 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.550
 activated the second ball 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.830
 the taste genuinely doesn't change much 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.220
 we will have a fresher note than 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.230
 before 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.380
 let's say it becomes a kind of lolly 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.990
 mixed lollipop of caramel with fruit 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.430
 with blueberry and a caramel 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.800
 complains how to eat two sweets 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.340
 put them in your mouth and smoke a pudding 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.160
 that is, it makes absolutely no sense at least to 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.980
 my opinion if you then have to hide the 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.750
 taste of someone 's cigarette then 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.760
 it is the right choice because in the mouth it is not 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.080
 there remains the taste of the cigarette 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.080
 the taste of a candy remains 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:14.160
 as a payment to smoking 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.870
 we say that we do not have or rather do not have 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.370
 no payment was found ie after 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.070
 a cigarette you want to smoke another 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.930
 it is absolutely not to the feeling of 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.000
 satisfaction that is with a malboro 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.530
 red or even with a room 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.810
 traditional let's say they remind me 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.199
 very blue camel is a link the active 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.930
 eight 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:34.740
 compared to this there is even a memo 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:38.419
 less because in any case the taste of 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:42.120
 of this strange blueberry mixed with 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:45.600
 menthol completely removes the taste 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.520
 of tobacco and incites us to smoke another 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.110
 let's say for the room and 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.729
 this thing could also work 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.229
 since we are encouraged to understand the 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:57.960
 Our package if you do not stand to 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:07:01.200
 this allows general opinions I would say up 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.880
 ten a 6 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.600
 because however the cigarette is not 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.940
 evil taste is good 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:14.220
 we say that it is not evil but there is a 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:16.229
 however, he has some negative sides, that is not 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.870
 is a cigarette is practically a 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:19.850
 candy bile form and I don't think so 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.580
 well 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:25.889
 that is, you are not worth 4 euros and 60 to spend 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:30.900
 that is honestly I would buy two more 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:31.979
 packages of from 10 of the blue room or a 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.720
 package of 20 from the grand bleu 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:36.450
 rather than this with the camel acts 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.400
 but normal meters if we want to try 

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.780
 a new taste or to change why 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.990
 we are annoyed the taste of secrets 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.060
 traditional vote the whim sky then 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:48.450
 at that point these cigarettes could 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.190
 also go well however the 6th grade does not 

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.940
 it's too bad 

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:55.540
 we stay with the next review 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.540
 Hi guys
