shape<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.220> flatten<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:17.630> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
shape like that so flatten it then you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.250 
shape like that so flatten it then you

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.249 
fold it in half and then fold in half
again<00:04:58.599> to<00:04:59.289> give<00:04:59.439> like<00:04:59.650> force<00:05:00.719> then<00:05:01.719> come<00:05:02.050> down

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
again to give like force then come down

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.050 
again to give like force then come down
to<00:05:02.499> the<00:05:02.650> force<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:06.610> know<00:05:06.699> it<00:05:06.789> doesn't<00:05:06.939> really

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
to the force you know it doesn't really

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.559 
to the force you know it doesn't really
matter<00:05:07.449> but<00:05:07.810> basically<00:05:08.469> the<00:05:08.800> main<00:05:08.979> thing<00:05:09.310> is

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
matter but basically the main thing is

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.129 
matter but basically the main thing is
to<00:05:10.569> just<00:05:11.080> double<00:05:11.710> back<00:05:12.129> on<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.689> like<00:05:13.689> that<00:05:13.719> and

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
to just double back on it like that and

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.439 
to just double back on it like that and
you<00:05:14.229> don't<00:05:15.009> even<00:05:15.249> have<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.759> do<00:05:15.939> that<00:05:16.150> if<00:05:16.360> you

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
you don't even have to do that if you

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.679 
you don't even have to do that if you
don't<00:05:16.629> want<00:05:17.460> but<00:05:18.460> I<00:05:18.699> think<00:05:18.789> it<00:05:19.270> makes<00:05:19.419> it<00:05:19.599> look

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:19.689 
don't want but I think it makes it look

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:46.789 
don't want but I think it makes it look
better

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:46.799 

00:05:46.799 --> 00:06:02.930 

typical<00:05:47.799> for

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:12.910

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
definitely make it look better now she's

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.140 
definitely make it look better now she's
trying<00:06:16.820> to<00:06:19.270> okay<00:06:21.910> next

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
trying to okay next

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.660 
trying to okay next
it's<00:06:23.360> just<00:06:23.660> bring<00:06:24.500> these<00:06:24.680> flaps<00:06:25.010> up<00:06:25.310> like<00:06:25.490> this

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
it's just bring these flaps up like this

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:31.470 
it's just bring these flaps up like this
and<00:06:27.340> you're<00:06:28.340> done<00:06:28.670> you<00:06:29.360> have<00:06:29.690> a<00:06:30.160> origami

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
and you're done you have a origami

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.420 
and you're done you have a origami
Starcraft<00:06:32.480> Nexus<00:06:32.900> and<00:06:33.050> i<00:06:33.800> really<00:06:34.250> suggest

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
Starcraft Nexus and i really suggest

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.970 
Starcraft Nexus and i really suggest
using<00:06:34.820> bigger<00:06:35.420> paper<00:06:35.630> on<00:06:35.930> it<00:06:35.960> because<00:06:36.710> as<00:06:36.860> you

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
using bigger paper on it because as you

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.880 
using bigger paper on it because as you
can<00:06:37.100> see<00:06:37.340> it's<00:06:37.670> small<00:06:38.090> and<00:06:38.360> it's<00:06:39.140> also<00:06:39.440> not

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
can see it's small and it's also not

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.600 
can see it's small and it's also not
very<00:06:39.950> detailed<00:06:40.510> like<00:06:41.510> you<00:06:41.750> can<00:06:42.400> do<00:06:43.400> whatever

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
very detailed like you can do whatever

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.220 
very detailed like you can do whatever
um<00:06:44.450> make<00:06:45.320> it<00:06:45.500> look<00:06:45.770> a<00:06:45.800> bit<00:06:46.040> better<00:06:46.870> but<00:06:47.870> it's

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
um make it look a bit better but it's

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.870 
um make it look a bit better but it's
the<00:06:48.530> best<00:06:48.680> I<00:06:48.950> could<00:06:49.010> do<00:06:49.310> I<00:06:49.340> know<00:06:49.550> there's

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
the best I could do I know there's

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.790 
the best I could do I know there's
something<00:06:50.270> better<00:06:50.450> out<00:06:50.570> there<00:06:50.690> and<00:06:51.680> you'll

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
something better out there and you'll

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.280 
something better out there and you'll
have<00:06:51.950> to<00:06:52.270> but<00:06:53.270> I<00:06:53.300> might<00:06:53.660> try<00:06:53.870> to<00:06:53.900> do<00:06:54.110> a<00:06:54.140> better

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
have to but I might try to do a better

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.720 
have to but I might try to do a better
