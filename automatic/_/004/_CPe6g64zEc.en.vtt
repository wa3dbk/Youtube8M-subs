00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.600
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.970
 this new video 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.400
 today I want to update the def 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.820
 but where there are those who are now testing by a 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.790
 of days, first update and up 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.600
 some papers that I pulled away in the first place 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.720
 but marmelin waitress because too 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.120
 slow to use since one 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.489
 sweet is in itself a slow bunch though 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.830
 is slowed down even more not 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.260
 moves one centimeter does not move and 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:48.650
 so I said mestre between the perfect 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.440
 even if once defended with 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.920
 the chateau activates 2,500 defense points 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.830
 they were comfortable as a defense before 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.570
 the opponent does not go out of date 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.370
 it is but that its effect that it does 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.629
 recover a magic trap card to the 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.129
 cemetery 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.280
 I can never use it also because 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.830
 with the pull the tia ram on the recovers 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.220
 USA 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.470
 so I am not at all happy about it 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.540
 second change was remove not 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.370
 I could never have played well 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.430
 or when you had it in your hand does not 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.650
 I could use it when I had it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.630
 need I never caught it so I have 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.690
 preferred to remove it to the maximum yes 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.270
 could think of putting them to said al 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.330
 yours of these two cards however I have 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.760
 inserted two cups of draw lidia 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.560
 because the one with votes that pissed yes 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.540
 manage to have so many cards in 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.670
 everything is done at certain times 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.740
 match and then another guide 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.170
 it gets really big 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.990
 and in addition it gives us a hand in 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.570
 counteract unchanged various attacks leader 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.950
 by hand that would damage us too much yes 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.590
 He throws down between you and the water 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.020
 moletto first songs that pissed yes 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.970
 recovers a lot of cards and his 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.790
 salt attack and very very easily 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.810
 in addition that his second and third effect 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.210
 they could also help us do it 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.710
 dell'ics yz quite easily or 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.670
 also to steal the monsters themselves from the 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.330
 target 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.720
 so it seemed more than good 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.460
 as cards in this type of deck for 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.370
 the moment this about the changes I have 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.700
 done I'm already trying others for 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.410
 make the deck a little faster because 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.230
 let's say its only weak point 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.450
 which I have found so far in general 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.480
 however it behaves well against almost 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.349
 all marches for example in this match 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.510
 I was against a wine duff who played 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.239
 very well I was lucky 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.239
 that I found the black hole first because 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.050
 otherwise he had already beaten anyway 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.480
 a sweet one resists well thanks to the whole 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.300
 part of traps and as I said before 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.480
 with the tragedy a moment a hand 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.340
 exist various attacks thanks to his 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.990
 attack and defense that become a lot 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.040
 tall 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.350
 in a short time thanks to tiche says I had 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.370
 made the mistake of not having activated 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:22.650
 the quality indeed after this attack 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:27.090
 third part here instead with a deck that 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.930
 he played bat some spots or well understood 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.799
 what bunches you know 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.739
 starts immediately with more tickets left and 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.659
 the dog retrieves the message side 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.650
 so more than a little with magic cylinder 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.650
 and I did not expect 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.700
 then I practically stop one 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.290
 attimano the moves with meter level 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.620
 ab but fortunately with the pole of the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.469
 recovery the typhoon split it up and 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.340
 immediately I start to recover another 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:04:00.040
 the cat with an agile frame still there 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.760
 combo dog shadow ticket recovery a 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.060
 another monster has covered the nib 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.379
 then he picks up all the monsters 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.629
 thanks to the attack he makes with cobra 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.419
 I can play the tragedy that with 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.700
 five cards in hand 3000 3000 with the 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:18.459
 sixth fishing now becomes 3600 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.849
 three thousand are close to massagno a little 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.919
 the attack playing or cat entered 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.630
 ice cream 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.060
 I do a bit of a fine match or a mess 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.930
 of paper in hand 4,000 direct with the 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.099
 I draw here trying to make up for a while 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:41.110
 making me come down the goals to 1.071 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:44.940
 marshmallow neo baby food that always has 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:50.500
 in fact the 1500's count with things 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:53.789
 marshmallow delage but a little more 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.440
 suitable more inert ice cream then tiramisu 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.349
 recover a casino of cards in hand 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.470
 return they return in the def 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.970
 at that point a direct attack by 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.370
 tragedy and closes the game 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.259
