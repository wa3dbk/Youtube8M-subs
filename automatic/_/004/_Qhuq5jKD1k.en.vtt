00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.310 
ever did mostly because the kind of
problems<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.330> these<00:03:54.570> women<00:03:54.870> talked<00:03:55.080> about

on what not to wear for me connected

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.600 
on what not to wear for me connected
fashion<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.989> something<00:03:58.440> much<00:03:58.620> bigger<00:03:58.890> than

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
fashion to something much bigger than

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.699 
fashion to something much bigger than
something<00:03:59.940> superficial<00:04:00.390> yeah<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.410> he<00:04:01.530> came

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
something superficial yeah if he came

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.199 
something superficial yeah if he came
about<00:04:01.950> making<00:04:02.280> people<00:04:02.550> feel<00:04:02.850> good<00:04:02.910> about

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
about making people feel good about

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.270 
about making people feel good about
themselves<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:04.140> that's<00:04:04.650> what<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:04.890> was<00:04:05.040> able<00:04:05.160> to

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
themselves and that's what I was able to

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.340 
themselves and that's what I was able to
talk<00:04:05.550> about<00:04:05.670> in<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.910> book<00:04:05.940> things<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:06.660> made

me not feel good about myself and how I
went<00:04:10.709> about<00:04:10.910> transforming<00:04:11.910> fashion<00:04:12.330> into

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
went about transforming fashion into

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.420 
went about transforming fashion into
something<00:04:12.900> more<00:04:13.050> important<00:04:13.470> for<00:04:13.620> myself<00:04:13.769> I

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
something more important for myself I

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.699 
something more important for myself I
don't<00:04:14.970> feel<00:04:15.180> like<00:04:15.300> I<00:04:15.390> have<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.660> keep<00:04:16.440> searching

don't feel like I have to keep searching
for<00:04:17.100> something<00:04:17.310> else<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.729> make<00:04:17.850> me<00:04:17.910> feel<00:04:18.120> good

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359

I<00:04:24.449> do<00:04:25.449> spend<00:04:25.810> more<00:04:25.990> time<00:04:26.199> reflecting<00:04:26.680> and

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
I do spend more time reflecting and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.590 
I do spend more time reflecting and
realizing<00:04:27.220> wow<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.580> thought<00:04:27.789> I<00:04:27.850> was<00:04:28.210> really

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600

realizing wow I thought I was really
great<00:04:29.050> about<00:04:29.229> this<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.740> or<00:04:29.889> that<00:04:30.009> and<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:30.280> I

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
great about this this or that and then I

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.400 
great about this this or that and then I
come<00:04:30.490> to<00:04:30.550> find<00:04:30.880> out<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.090> no<00:04:31.810> actually<00:04:32.259> you're

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
come to find out that no actually you're

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.770 
come to find out that no actually you're
not<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:32.800> nice<00:04:33.370> or<00:04:33.610> magnanimous<00:04:34.449> or<00:04:34.539> whatever

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
not so nice or magnanimous or whatever

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.930 
not so nice or magnanimous or whatever
the<00:04:34.870> things<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.139> thought<00:04:35.259> I<00:04:35.320> was<00:04:35.530> are<00:04:35.740> if<00:04:36.699> you

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
the things I thought I was are if you

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.300 
the things I thought I was are if you
had<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.360> guess<00:04:37.720> what<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.169> blind<00:04:38.410> spot<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:39.130> have

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
had to guess what a blind spot you have

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.279 
had to guess what a blind spot you have
right<00:04:39.460> now<00:04:39.669> is<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.720> next<00:04:40.930> time<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.139> sit

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
right now is that the next time you sit

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.480 
right now is that the next time you sit
down<00:04:41.350> will<00:04:41.680> be<00:04:41.800> saying<00:04:41.979> aren't<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:42.460> glad

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
down will be saying aren't you so glad

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.029 
down will be saying aren't you so glad
you<00:04:42.729> conquered<00:04:43.120> it<00:04:43.240> right<00:04:43.630> any<00:04:44.560> thoughts<00:04:44.860> on

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
you conquered it right any thoughts on

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:45.629 
you conquered it right any thoughts on
what<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.310> might<00:04:45.460> be

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
what that might be

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.939 
what that might be
I<00:04:46.060> would<00:04:46.300> like<00:04:46.479> to<00:04:46.509> say<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:47.080> my<00:04:47.110> blind<00:04:47.560> spots

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
I would like to say that my blind spots

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.640 
I would like to say that my blind spots
are<00:04:48.280> becoming<00:04:49.000> more<00:04:49.300> apparent<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:50.350> I'm

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
are becoming more apparent so I'm

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.320 
are becoming more apparent so I'm
learning<00:04:50.979> to<00:04:51.190> break<00:04:51.370> up<00:04:51.550> with<00:04:51.669> the<00:04:51.789> idea<00:04:52.240> of

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
learning to break up with the idea of

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.270 
learning to break up with the idea of
that<00:04:52.479> failure<00:04:52.720> is<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.020> bad<00:04:53.260> thing<00:04:53.530> but<00:04:53.889> it<00:04:54.010> still

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
that failure is a bad thing but it still

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.050 
that failure is a bad thing but it still
stinks<00:04:54.520> when<00:04:54.610> you're<00:04:54.729> going<00:04:54.820> through<00:04:55.000> it

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
stinks when you're going through it

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.600 
stinks when you're going through it
doesn't<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.449> well<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.199> think<00:04:56.320> no<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:57.070> think<00:04:57.520> it

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
doesn't it well I think no I I think it

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.310 
doesn't it well I think no I I think it
doesn't<00:04:57.880> have<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.150> stink<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:58.630> think<00:04:58.960> actually

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
doesn't have to stink I think actually

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.409 
doesn't have to stink I think actually
you<00:04:59.830> can<00:05:00.010> enjoy<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.639> process<00:05:00.910> without

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
you can enjoy the process without

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.870 
you can enjoy the process without
succeeding<00:05:02.320> at<00:05:02.440> something<00:05:02.729> because<00:05:03.729> you're

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
succeeding at something because you're

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.040 
succeeding at something because you're
doing<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.300> but<00:05:04.479> then<00:05:04.570> how<00:05:04.660> do<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:04.810> know<00:05:04.900> you're

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
doing it but then how do you know you're

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.300 
doing it but then how do you know you're
