00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.160

 hey people this is anni kids today 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.359
 Let's do a tutorial about vectors 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.359
 my team and that simply means that 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.580
 Eye make-up journalist pen with it 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.490
 yes to wear many stars that already 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:36.860
 longer and wanted to make montur 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:40.910

 wear that and yes it just looks cool 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.160
 a bit of domination but also a lot 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.160
 feminine 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.840
 the last time was the tutorial 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.840
 I hope the law will bring in 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.520
 bit back the lipstick and that 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.860
 I have now brought to the ninth floor 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.570
 kiko touch states it and if so 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.620
 it's just not possible 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.620
 Let's go and I think 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.590
 but of course the lips have to act 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:31.520
 will be the latest inventions 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.520
 make-up is the lipliner and the kohl 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.579
 pin I do not know what invented the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.130
 dennis was smeared matter of 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.990
 which company system is always smithing me 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.479
 Brother everything twice over 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.649
 mopped off for so much more dry her 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.209
 it does the better it is and thus 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.740
 That's how it turned out for me 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:58.759
 now for everything only for 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:03.789
 everything just now also burned 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.789
 I use the following brush 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.229
 Beveled brush unspectacular 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.720
 me from karstadt 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.140
 it does not need special bristles 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.459
 Just use a provider brush then 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:24.260
 me here and kiko the beginner on 180 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.630
 matt black for black and go with it 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.450
 I just go in 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:33.880
 now shows my lips I warn 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.610
 you guys first of all it is very funny 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.620
 and looks like I'm at 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.710
 barbara you shave the beard 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.710
 let's have fun laughing 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.030
 funny yes ok 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:24.270
 The Rag Advisory Board line line 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.780
 we can easily do it 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.990
 like me but I have my beard 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.740
 let it snow 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:41.620
 Ok so that's how strong that is 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:46.500
 So there you do not need a kajal no 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:50.950
 lipliner So it's like this and now 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.530
 you blind yourself a little bit inside here 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.320
 we used the double touch first 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.670
 we almost have the moments and wear it too 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.470
 so it looks now would first 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.020
 wait is dried and 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.360
 as long as we can expect 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.170
 and come to the square and there I have to 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.140
 easy on orange features and 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.620
 Although things so I have my 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.870
 color palette glued together by yourself 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.350
 I think I'm fit like Picasso but 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.190
 it works in spite of the then 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.190
 maybe up 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.810
 so that your lips have also defined 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:42.210
 I still recommend you to look perfect 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:56.699
 that just has to be your makeup for that and 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:58.440
 then slightly fade outward afterwards 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.690
 but that would have to be done with it again 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.660
 it really does not blur or 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.520
 for example, I have one, I have one 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.639
 oblique lips than on one side the 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.889
 third winner from sang side thinner 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.139
 and it is this technology you can 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.520
 your lips are still a bit more symmetrical 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:19.440
 continue to act 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:27.000
 well, look at it slowly 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:29.330
 now ask this lot here 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.330
 generously 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:48.030
 I totally forgot 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:50.910
 the ultimate test a white cup 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:06:00.890
 which nothing in it 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:06:05.100
 would be like that and thats not to the 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.720
 lipstick is easy at the moment it looks 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.210
 it just already a pretty bleak from 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.460
 bit ghetto bit gangster step 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.110
 the people are really cheeky 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.640
 know a bit the know 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.790
 is told much at the moment excites many 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.400
 appeal 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:24.510
 the women are not like in the 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.770
 eighties grease catalog but 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.390
 you can do it as well as quite classic 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.330
 combine when for example the 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.510
 haro is clipper nice dress is 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.610
 then not sent longest week 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.620
 there is a video about candles white 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.900
 on 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.880
 The factory will then be quite natural it 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.580
 most likely there is more 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.410
 then I went in every day 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:51.960
