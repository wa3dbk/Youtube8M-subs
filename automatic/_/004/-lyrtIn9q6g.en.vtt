00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.100 

this<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.050> bug<00:00:01.199> for<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.800> Galaxy<00:00:02.399> s3<00:00:02.689> is<00:00:03.689> for

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
this is the bug for the Galaxy s3 is for

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.410 
this is the bug for the Galaxy s3 is for
bypassing<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.250> passcode<00:00:05.819> on<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.120> lockscreen

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
bypassing the passcode on the lockscreen

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.330 
bypassing the passcode on the lockscreen
and<00:00:06.720> what<00:00:07.680> that's<00:00:07.890> will<00:00:07.980> do<00:00:08.069> you'll<00:00:08.220> actually

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
and what that's will do you'll actually

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.950 
and what that's will do you'll actually
give<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.639> full<00:00:08.790> access<00:00:08.880> for<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.330> handset<00:00:09.750> and

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
give you full access for the handset and

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.980 
give you full access for the handset and
I<00:00:10.889> can<00:00:11.580> certainly<00:00:11.759> see<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.360> works<00:00:12.599> with<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
I can certainly see this works with the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.200 
I can certainly see this works with the
network<00:00:13.320> only<00:00:13.670> because<00:00:14.670> we<00:00:14.730> have<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.969> use<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
network only because we have to use the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.910 
network only because we have to use the
emergency<00:00:15.269> call<00:00:15.750> once<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.230> can<00:00:16.379> access<00:00:16.740> to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
emergency call once you can access to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.349 
emergency call once you can access to
the<00:00:16.980> handset<00:00:17.400> if<00:00:17.580> there<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> working<00:00:18.180> SIM

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the handset if there is a working SIM

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.820 
the handset if there is a working SIM
card<00:00:18.660> if<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.900> do<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.199> such<00:00:19.380> apps<00:00:19.650> like

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
card if you do have such apps like

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
card if you do have such apps like

and<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> thing<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.619> well<00:00:28.769> there

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
and the thing with this as well there

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
and the thing with this as well there
too<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.490> once<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.060> lock<00:00:30.420> screen<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.750> bypassed

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
too is once the lock screen is bypassed

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.200 
too is once the lock screen is bypassed
the<00:00:31.500> phone<00:00:31.710> does<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:31.949> seem<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.430> reblock<00:00:32.880> again

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the phone does not seem to reblock again

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.760 
the phone does not seem to reblock again
they<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.480> until<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.870> actually<00:00:34.200> restart<00:00:34.649> it

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
they on until it's actually restart it

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.950 
they on until it's actually restart it
so<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.030> go<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.510> lock<00:00:36.690> screen

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
so what we do is go to the lock screen

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.400 
so what we do is go to the lock screen
and<00:00:37.399> cool<00:00:38.399> emergency<00:00:38.850> call<00:00:39.200> enter<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> ice

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and cool emergency call enter the ice

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440 
and cool emergency call enter the ice
contacts<00:00:40.950> list<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.329> is

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
contacts list and then what we do is

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.630 
contacts list and then what we do is
just<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.870> combination<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> home<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.399> power

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
just a combination of the home and power

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.350 
just a combination of the home and power
button<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.489> we'll<00:00:47.700> see<00:00:47.730> who<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.120> get<00:00:48.210> this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
button and we'll see who can get this

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:59.819 
button and we'll see who can get this
done

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:19.340 

you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.990 

and<00:01:20.350> there<00:01:20.530> we<00:01:20.619> go<00:01:20.649> not<00:01:21.250> saw<00:01:21.490> Sasha<00:01:21.759> just

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
and there we go not saw Sasha just

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.240 
and there we go not saw Sasha just
bypass<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.689> lock<00:01:22.869> there<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.229> I<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:24.070> now<00:01:24.189> we

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
bypass the lock there and I so now we

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.670 
bypass the lock there and I so now we
have<00:01:24.430> full<00:01:24.610> access<00:01:24.789> to<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.210> handset<00:01:25.659> as<00:01:26.530> you

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
have full access to the handset as you

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.929 
have full access to the handset as you
can<00:01:26.799> see<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.009> can<00:01:27.130> take<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.340> number<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.729> times

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
can see you can take a number of times

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.210 
can see you can take a number of times
just<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.210> get<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.479> right<00:01:28.509> but<00:01:29.289> once<00:01:29.500> you<00:01:29.890> get<00:01:30.070> it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
just to get it right but once you get it

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.730 
just to get it right but once you get it
right<00:01:30.399> and<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:31.330> handset<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.960> actually<00:01:32.380> unlock

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
right and the handset is actually unlock

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.740 
right and the handset is actually unlock
that<00:01:32.950> will<00:01:33.070> not<00:01:33.280> read<00:01:33.490> lock<00:01:33.700> again<00:01:34.000> if<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.509> push

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
that will not read lock again if I push

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.020 
that will not read lock again if I push
the<00:01:34.899> power<00:01:35.080> button<00:01:35.140> on<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.530> side<00:01:35.759> by<00:01:36.759> should

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
the power button on the side by should

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.580 
the power button on the side by should
lock<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.360> handset<00:01:37.810> there's<00:01:38.049> new<00:01:38.140> lock<00:01:38.350> side

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
lock the handset there's new lock side

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.539 
lock the handset there's new lock side
and<00:01:38.799> whenever<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.039> push<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.340> power<00:01:39.490> button

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
and whenever I push the power button

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.180 
and whenever I push the power button
again<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.270> handsets<00:01:41.200> just<00:01:41.500> exactly<00:01:41.979> open

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
again the handsets just exactly open

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.010 
again the handsets just exactly open
again<00:01:42.459> so<00:01:42.640> then<00:01:42.789> I<00:01:42.909> can<00:01:43.060> have<00:01:43.149> access<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.929> the
