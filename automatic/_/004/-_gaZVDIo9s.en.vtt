00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.540
 I'm Nicola Boari responsible for 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.130
 marketing produced here in ferrari la 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.880
 ferrari empty with central engine 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.789
 open back born 40 years ago with 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.990
 the 308 gts where the name derived from 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.720
 characteristic car license plate with 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.210
 a roof that was removed but in the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.050
 over the years exactly in 1993 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.489
 with the launch of the 348 was born 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.350
 spyder version with a canopy 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:42.989
 foldable in canvas that disappeared 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:46.140
 at the opening this content was 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.930
 then further evolved in 2011 with 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.930
 the launch of the 458 spider 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.940
 the first that offered a 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.250
 retractable hard top 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.440
 this feature has been maintained 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.699
 also for the most powerful 488 spider 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 technology and performance as always 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.260
 in the history of Ferrari dedicated to those 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.820
 wants to reconcile performance with 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.370
 air guide 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.580
 hearing the noises outside the 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.340
 landscape but above all the sound of a 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.150
 the ferrari engine has many benefits 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.010
 from the record of the 488 spider one of the most 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.140
 weight is certainly important 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.630
 which is almost equal to 2 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.060
 the engine at 100 bhp more but 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.040
 thanks to the wise design the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.980
 car had suffered no increase of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.590
 weight 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.080
 as for aerodynamics also 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.570
 the spider as the berlinetta uses 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.420
 of solutions borrowed directly from 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.020
 racing world both from the xx program 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.480
 that from the championships gt own 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.790
 aerodynamics determines the forms of the 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.890
 back of the spider style that 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.380
 have been expertly combined by the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.390
 ferrari style center linking the requirements 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.620
 aerodynamic with more stylistic features 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.620
 recognizable ferrari 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.410
 the 488 spider completes the ferrari range 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.510
 of is designed for challenging winding roads 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.700
 like those that one can imagine oneself at 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.360
 florio plate or on the streets of the thousand 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.150
 miles passing by rural landscapes a 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.490
 small villages always accompanied 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.650
 from the soundtrack of the powerful vacuum 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.770
 ferrari never existed a spider 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.910
 ferrari so powerful 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.970
 and performance 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.350
 and this is also why we wanted to 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.450
 emphasize the innovation of this 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.820
 reading with a new blue color 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.960
 particularly suited to the character e 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.960
 to the performance of this car
