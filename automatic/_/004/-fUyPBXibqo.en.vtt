00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
around it okay so what you do instead of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.770 
around it okay so what you do instead of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
doing that you do which makes you go

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.579 
doing that you do which makes you go
really<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.649> kind<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.519> faster<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.589> you

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
really like kind of faster and like you

really like kind of faster and like you
can<00:00:58.739> keep<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.069> pace<00:00:59.309> up

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
can keep the pace up

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:27.370 
can keep the pace up
um<00:01:00.960> I'll<00:01:01.679> show<00:01:01.889> like<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:02.760> Dueling<00:01:03.149> Banjos

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.240 

that<00:01:28.380> won't<00:01:28.500> well<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.790> 96%<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:30.960> I

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
that won't well was like in 96% but I

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.170 
that won't well was like in 96% but I
first<00:01:32.250> dry<00:01:32.430> anyway<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:32.850> uh<00:01:33.120> yeah<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.280> basically

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180

first dry anyway so uh yeah so basically
what<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.660> just<00:01:36.870> do<00:01:37.080> instead<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.740> doing<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
what you just do instead of doing that

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.960 
what you just do instead of doing that
you<00:01:39.470> just<00:01:40.470> hold<00:01:40.950> your<00:01:41.130> hand<00:01:41.370> like<00:01:41.580> loose

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
hit it like right at the well where it

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.350 
hit it like right at the well where it
where<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.770> strum<00:01:59.040> bar<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.460> starts<00:02:00.060> or<00:02:00.240> like
