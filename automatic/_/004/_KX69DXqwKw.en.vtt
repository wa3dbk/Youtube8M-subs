00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 let's give it a try we give a chance 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.960
 I tried to do it in the slightest 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.980
 tried something serious with money 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.590
 because it is easy to pay 170 thousand euros 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.780
 irpef and ilor and just pay the personal income tax 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 this is the courage of a man a 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.260
 unlike all the others who 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.630
 they speak and it is not quantity and not 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.840
 it takes millions to need one of the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.900
 signs of great ideas , genius 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.779
 still our courage today 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.260
 our boarding assault on the problem 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.120
 of soccer in varese and above all a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.309
 day will be if we have the victory in 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 hand a day of great happiness for 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.250
 all the supporters among the citizens 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.829
 of varese 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.010
 so victory is the ultimate redemption 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600
 we are the final start-up 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.039
 used to thinking like old people 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.949
 farmers 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.390
 we respect the reason the time 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.180
 cyclic 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.250
 we are gathering and revitalizing the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.380
 ground through too 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.660
 web communications because that 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.840
 platform that attracts investors 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.340
 that is the platform that today attracts the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.710
 confidence 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.479
 that's the platform that attracts 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.830
 cardan mind on the go 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.180
 otherwise we are doing this 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.540
 free only with our commitment 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.490
 ideal with a pledge of choice of script 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.770
 of theater because this is football 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.000
 you must also be exhilarating 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.570
 never seen a cube soccer player 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.390
 tenuous no and this we prepare the ground 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.300
 under a historical profile today what is needed 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.240
 to give animus to something 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.090
 a quick communication today I today 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.220
 web but that I don't like and against 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.200
 my ethical condition but need one 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.110
 historical condition in our time 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.570
 today the web has a function here it is of 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.210
 genome today is a dna gems that I have to 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.250
 operate we must know how to use well we have 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.590
 5 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.470
 I thought of identifying a system of 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.929
 communication dissemination that has a 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.410
 substantially of a smile 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.940
 that is exhilarating the jokes are 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.120
 coordinates has a function already a 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.120
 result
