know if you can read this but it has a

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.610 
know if you can read this but it has a
12<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.400> 22<00:03:10.000> thousand<00:03:10.600> hurts<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:11.050> frequency

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
12 to 22 thousand hurts of frequency

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.290 
12 to 22 thousand hurts of frequency

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
for power adders X Y if you are looking

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.979 
for power adders X Y if you are looking
something<00:03:28.150> around<00:03:29.280> 1300<00:03:30.280> k<00:03:30.489> 13<00:03:31.269> 100<00:03:31.660> rupees

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
something around 1300 k 13 100 rupees

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.160 
something around 1300 k 13 100 rupees
that<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.410> 1.3<00:03:33.040> k<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.720> that's<00:03:34.720> an<00:03:34.870> indian

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
that is 1.3 k and that's an indian

that is 1.3 k and that's an indian
national<00:03:35.530> currency<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.220> should<00:03:36.400> be<00:03:36.519> about

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
national currency so it should be about
