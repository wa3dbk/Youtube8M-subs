00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.000
 show men what we are 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.430
 equal to them that there is no difference 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.620
 gender difference of nothing and I hope that 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.060
 that one day I'm singing in a 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.739
 scenario all the women are 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.739
 shouting with me that we are equal 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.640
 almost almost because there is a scene there is a 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.700
 part where I am 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.490
 holding on to a cable where I go 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.850
 supposedly flying and well I felt 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.080
 that my back was going to split 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.720
 terrible looking forward to new 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.340
 I had to repeat it several times and 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.250
 the next day I could not get up from the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.200
 bed with the new disk or continue there 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.420
 not because I finished the season when 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.150
 re millions sadly but it was a 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.770
 very beautiful stage where I discovered a 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.380
 very nice work team and I learned 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.630
 many things I will remove cameras 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.580
 but already but one hundred percent if already already 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:17.690
 a very nice experience but I had 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.690
 to devote a hundred just like you and a 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.640
 voice
