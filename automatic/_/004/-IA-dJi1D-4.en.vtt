00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.300
 so you will not need silicon scissors 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.860
 put when of two different sizes 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.930
 it will also occupy the little egg if not the 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.150
 you have because you have several students 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.910
 I recommend you dismissals 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.550
 brakes layers eye be well specific 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.620
 ask for the gaps come from this 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.970
 way and ask for them in advance 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.100
 you will also occupy a round stick 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.640
 a candle 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.010
 something to heal pain and you're going to occupy 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.289
 also a decorative ribbon in this 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.690
 case is a metallic tape and therefore what 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.269
 you are going to put it inside me in this case 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.420
 what to put these pebbles and well then 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.190
 let's see how it is done 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.510
 and what we're going to start doing is a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.140
 drilling in any 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.229
 next to a little egg obviously in a 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.810
 end you can heat by scissors but 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.850
 if you do not want to spoil them and 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.090
 you know the plastic lg stuck 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.180
 then you can occupy another object 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.280
 I am occupying these the shipowners of 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.259
 good watchmaker has to be super 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.690
 super hot so you can drill 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.960
 the plastic and good since you do not have 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.850
 hot what you're going to do is that what 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.770
 pierce 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.140
 Now as drilling you have to 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.360
 Be the same size as the stick 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.909
 so I can enter then here if 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.759
 I will occupy the scissors obviously the 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.840
 scissors and I'm going to turn it to wear 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.610
 and remove the excess plastic is by 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.140
 that I'm going to occupy in two sizes 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.780
 since good here is is then if 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.670
 try and stick not yet come in now I'm going 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.610
 to occupy the scissors that are a little more 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.920
 big and I'll do the same thing until 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.869
 is the size of the good val then here 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.830
 it is already as you can see that he is 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.019
 size and fits perfectly the stick and 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.160
 Now what I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:18.430
 line the stick with the board if you 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.950
 they want what can they can paint it but 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.090
 I in this case we will not cover 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.090
 I find where it is from 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:33.890
 the nuncio and I think it's good because what 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.890
 let's run and return with you 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.810
 Now what I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.720
 put some hot silicone 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.069
 inside the egg for the ball 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.670
 that cleared, be very careful 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.129
 I will try to put a small layer 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.819
 around and I'm going to stick the toothpick 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.819
 that is in 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.319
 since this in this way I'm also going to 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.140
 teach on this side so you do not leave 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.110
 to leave 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.030
 no particle of what we put 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.940
 inside in this case they are pebbles and they are 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.480
 great but if you are going to put 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.970
 something more then more is smaller not 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.890
 they were placed to salt because if you can 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.260
 leave and then I will not leave 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.900
 national dry now yes what I'm going to 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.209
 to do is that I'm going to put in the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.340
 pebbles or the material that you 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.220
 are going to use can put rice 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.730
 they can put better they can put other 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.100
 seeds and good try not to 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.690
 carry so much because if you do not you will not 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.000
 be able to move but at least that is 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.350
 this full for 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.330
 that at the time of closing I have seen 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.060
 I told them not to take it so long 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.820
 but I arrived I did not mean excuse me 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.580
 referred to that they have in consideration 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.690
 that there must be a space so that 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.720
 at the time that the children are not 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.610
 moving then sound now what I'm going to 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.440
 do is I'm going to seal this part if 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.110
 not every little time they do they are opening 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.260
 then I will not put glue on 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.450
 preference of this contact and I that 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.450
 it has glue now if I close it 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.870
 and I'm going to wait because I know a little bit 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.599
 and it's practically ready now if 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.939
 you do not want to decorate me in this 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.830
 I'm going to put a strip of these 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:35.800
 that come with a new sticker 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.759
 about where it is in part because the 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.759
 where it closes 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.330
 you can put that inflatable paint or 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.240
 with Downs 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.689
 and oil so that it is not painted to the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.580
 time to be manipulating the good then 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.099
 I in this case I put the stickers and 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.120
 it's ready now, I 'm going to 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.120
 show another that says 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.800
 see this this I put another material what 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.990
 can do colors can use 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.760
 different colors of eggs because 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.300
 I think they also come come in 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.400
 orange and blue so good as to 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.340
 I put this sugar I can play with 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.650
 that with the sound as you hear if you 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.790
 listen weaker stronger this you 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.790
 I put sugar listen 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.669
 and well, this was the one of 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.669
 pebbles 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.720
 and well, I think it 's a very 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.240
 good option is a material that is going to 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.450
 last because we miss each other so much 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.730
 down in the middle then you will like 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.560
 to your children and well I hope that you 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.870
 like the idea of â€‹â€‹today we see ourselves in a 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.760
 next video I send you many greetings and 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.760
 many kisses and until next time
