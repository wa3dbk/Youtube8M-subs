put some lag bolts up in there in four

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.590 
put some lag bolts up in there in four
of<00:02:04.070> them<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:05.990> way<00:02:08.860> when<00:02:09.860> it's<00:02:10.039> up<00:02:10.600> when

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
of them and that way when it's up when

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.410 
of them and that way when it's up when
it's<00:02:11.720> in<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:11.989> way<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:13.370> will<00:02:13.519> be<00:02:13.640> held<00:02:13.970> up<00:02:14.209> off

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
it's in this way it will be held up off

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.860 
it's in this way it will be held up off
the<00:02:14.690> angle<00:02:14.870> iron<00:02:15.200> by<00:02:16.090> about<00:02:17.090> half<00:02:17.150> an<00:02:17.480> inch<00:02:17.600> now

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the angle iron by about half an inch now

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.530 
the angle iron by about half an inch now
and<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:19.580> will<00:02:19.700> keep<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.030> out<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.269> water

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
and that will keep it out of the water

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.650 
and that will keep it out of the water
and<00:02:21.459> yeah<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.700> thing<00:02:22.880> weighs<00:02:23.030> about<00:02:23.180> 50

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660
