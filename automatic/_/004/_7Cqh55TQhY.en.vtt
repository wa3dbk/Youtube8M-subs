and and and made it with materials that
are<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.629> more<00:00:54.750> accessible<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
are a little more accessible to the to

the<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> masses<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.109> cost<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the to the masses and so the cost of the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.549 
the to the masses and so the cost of the
knife<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.280> very<00:00:59.309> reasonable<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.690> tell<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.530> I

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
knife is very reasonable and tell you I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.080

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
think they've really got a winner here

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.149 
think they've really got a winner here
and<00:01:03.629> when<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> take<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> look<00:01:04.920> at<00:01:05.070> the

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
screwdriver in there and I've just got

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.529 
screwdriver in there and I've just got
it<00:04:43.950> just<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.310> jeweler's<00:04:44.639> screwdriver<00:04:44.669> here<00:04:45.419> in

it just a jeweler's screwdriver here in

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.460 
it just a jeweler's screwdriver here in
it<00:04:46.410> just<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.800> comes<00:04:47.039> off<00:04:47.220> easily<00:04:47.460> enough<00:04:48.470> like

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
it just it comes off easily enough like

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.029 
it just it comes off easily enough like
so<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:50.550> scale<00:04:50.850> comes<00:04:51.090> on<00:04:51.330> like<00:04:51.539> that<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:52.139> then

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
so the scale comes on like that and then

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:59.810 
so the scale comes on like that and then
the<00:04:54.229> target<00:04:55.229> clips<00:04:55.650> scale<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.820> placed<00:04:57.690> on<00:04:58.820> in

they've even they've even gone to the

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.140 
they've even they've even gone to the
trouble<00:05:16.960> of<00:05:17.170> designing<00:05:17.740> designing<00:05:18.550> it<00:05:19.000> to

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
trouble of designing designing it to

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.750 
trouble of designing designing it to
look<00:05:19.330> like<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.660> bottom<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.110> a<00:05:20.230> tortoise<00:05:20.620> shell

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
you can see that see there so they carry

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.380 
you can see that see there so they carry
that<00:05:25.360> theme<00:05:25.690> on<00:05:26.050> throughout<00:05:27.180> throughout<00:05:28.180> the

scales are made of Cpl composite which

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.550 
scales are made of Cpl composite which
is<00:05:48.970> the<00:05:49.210> same<00:05:49.420> material<00:05:49.570> that<00:05:49.900> a<00:05:49.990> bowling<00:05:50.380> ball

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
is the same material that a bowling ball

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.380 
is the same material that a bowling ball
is<00:05:50.710> made<00:05:50.920> out<00:05:51.070> of<00:05:51.100> and<00:05:51.400> so<00:05:51.820> you<00:05:51.910> can<00:05:52.060> see<00:05:52.240> you

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
is made out of and so you can see you

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.510 
is made out of and so you can see you
get<00:05:52.570> this<00:05:52.750> you<00:05:52.990> get<00:05:53.140> this<00:05:53.320> swirl<00:05:53.860> pattern<00:05:54.370> in

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
get this you get this swirl pattern in

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.060 
get this you get this swirl pattern in
there<00:05:54.700> and<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.570> no<00:05:55.840> two<00:05:55.900> knives<00:05:56.380> are<00:05:56.620> exactly

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
there and and no two knives are exactly

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.310 
there and and no two knives are exactly
alike<00:05:57.430> that<00:05:58.150> swirl<00:05:58.600> pattern<00:05:59.020> will<00:05:59.200> be<00:05:59.290> a

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
alike that swirl pattern will be a

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.600 
alike that swirl pattern will be a
little<00:05:59.620> bit<00:05:59.740> different<00:06:00.100> on<00:06:00.160> each<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.520> every

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
little bit different on each and every

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.090 
little bit different on each and every
one<00:06:00.840> so<00:06:01.840> you've<00:06:02.110> got<00:06:02.140> a<00:06:02.290> sort<00:06:02.710> of<00:06:02.770> a<00:06:02.830> little<00:06:03.010> bit
