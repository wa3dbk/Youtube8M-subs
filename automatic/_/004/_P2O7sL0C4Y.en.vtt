00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.380
 well in this video I will show you how 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.110
 download install and use the int or dvd 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.930
 repair platinum 5 since for me it is one 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.029
 of the best DVD players I say 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.160
 which is the best since it has 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.800
 many formats to which you want to spend 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.130
 and it leaves you intact, not like others who 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.440
 they leave you audio and video separated 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.510
 to download it the file is hosted 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.850
 server for being just give in 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.329
 download now wait a few seconds and 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.699
 they download it 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.649
 Once you finish downloading them 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.560
 there will be a rar file we only give it 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:57.490

 Program

 in language does not bring Spanish so they 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:40.719

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:40.719
