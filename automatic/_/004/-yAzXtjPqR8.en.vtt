00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.980 
song that I feel like subjecting myself
to<00:05:29.520> every<00:05:29.970> time<00:05:30.180> I<00:05:30.300> listen<00:05:30.480> to<00:05:30.630> through<00:05:30.870> the

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
to every time I listen to through the

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.900 
to every time I listen to through the
state<00:05:31.290> but<00:05:31.770> no<00:05:31.890> other<00:05:32.070> tracks<00:05:32.430> on<00:05:32.610> this<00:05:32.760> LP

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
state but no other tracks on this LP

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.330 
state but no other tracks on this LP
really<00:05:33.330> struck<00:05:33.720> me<00:05:33.900> as<00:05:34.110> as<00:05:34.350> being<00:05:34.620> outright

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
really struck me as as being outright

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.240 
really struck me as as being outright
bad<00:05:35.790> what<00:05:36.450> sort<00:05:36.660> of<00:05:36.720> ended<00:05:37.020> up<00:05:37.140> not<00:05:37.560> impressing

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
bad what sort of ended up not impressing

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.180 
bad what sort of ended up not impressing
me<00:05:38.280> as<00:05:38.760> much<00:05:39.120> as<00:05:39.150> their<00:05:39.450> previous<00:05:39.780> release<00:05:40.380> is

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
me as much as their previous release is

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.570 
me as much as their previous release is
just<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.610> record<00:05:42.390> itself<00:05:42.870> in<00:05:43.290> whole<00:05:43.650> strange

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
just the record itself in whole strange

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.790 
just the record itself in whole strange
journey<00:05:45.060> is<00:05:45.390> is<00:05:45.660> lacking<00:05:46.050> in<00:05:46.470> a<00:05:46.560> little

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
journey is is lacking in a little

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.580 
journey is is lacking in a little
variety<00:05:47.370> for<00:05:47.610> me<00:05:47.760> a<00:05:47.790> little<00:05:48.000> sonic<00:05:48.590> variety

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
variety for me a little sonic variety

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.370 
variety for me a little sonic variety

tracks<00:06:24.030> yeah<00:06:24.900> I<00:06:24.930> know<00:06:25.260> that<00:06:25.980> kind<00:06:26.430> of

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
tracks yeah I know that kind of

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.210 
tracks yeah I know that kind of
linguists<00:06:27.210> and<00:06:27.450> and<00:06:27.690> and<00:06:27.930> know<00:06:28.170> are<00:06:28.560> not<00:06:28.770> known

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
linguists and and and know are not known

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.360 
linguists and and and know are not known
for<00:06:29.640> having<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.480> most<00:06:30.630> grimy<00:06:31.530> production

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
for having the most grimy production

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.180 
for having the most grimy production
style<00:06:32.760> actually<00:06:33.510> I<00:06:33.780> think<00:06:34.110> as<00:06:34.320> the<00:06:34.650> group<00:06:34.980> has

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
style actually I think as the group has

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.580 
style actually I think as the group has
progressed<00:06:35.700> with<00:06:36.090> each<00:06:36.450> new<00:06:36.690> record<00:06:37.200> their

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
progressed with each new record their

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.390 
progressed with each new record their
production<00:06:38.250> gets<00:06:38.370> a<00:06:38.520> little<00:06:38.730> more

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
production gets a little more

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.040 
production gets a little more
Milotic<00:06:40.400> lush<00:06:40.760> still<00:06:41.480> i<00:06:41.510> guess<00:06:41.780> i<00:06:41.900> was<00:06:41.960> just

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
Milotic lush still i guess i was just

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.720 
Milotic lush still i guess i was just
looking<00:06:42.230> for<00:06:42.380> a<00:06:42.560> few<00:06:43.070> more<00:06:43.190> hard-hitting

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
looking for a few more hard-hitting

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.390 
looking for a few more hard-hitting
moments<00:06:44.180> all<00:06:44.510> that<00:06:44.780> aside<00:06:45.170> this<00:06:45.830> is<00:06:45.890> easily

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
moments all that aside this is easily

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.250 
moments all that aside this is easily
the<00:06:46.610> most<00:06:46.880> ambitious<00:06:47.120> release<00:06:47.750> that<00:06:47.960> cunning

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
the most ambitious release that cunning

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.230 
the most ambitious release that cunning
linguist<00:06:48.500> have<00:06:48.680> put<00:06:48.890> together<00:06:49.010> so<00:06:49.400> far<00:06:49.430> in<00:06:50.090> the

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
linguist have put together so far in the

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.480 
linguist have put together so far in the
strange<00:06:50.600> journey<00:06:50.930> series<00:06:51.500> and<00:06:52.010> i<00:06:52.160> think<00:06:52.370> it's

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
strange journey series and i think it's

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.280 
strange journey series and i think it's
a<00:06:52.550> great<00:06:52.670> project<00:06:53.030> to<00:06:53.330> hold<00:06:53.600> things<00:06:53.810> over

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
a great project to hold things over

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.870 
a great project to hold things over
until<00:06:54.620> they<00:06:54.860> come<00:06:55.130> through<00:06:55.340> with<00:06:55.460> an<00:06:55.580> album

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
until they come through with an album

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.910 
until they come through with an album
that's<00:06:56.030> a<00:06:56.210> little<00:06:56.360> more<00:06:56.680> conceptual<00:06:57.680> and

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
that's a little more conceptual and

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.950 
that's a little more conceptual and
focuses<00:06:58.670> a<00:06:58.700> bit<00:06:58.910> more<00:06:59.120> on<00:06:59.360> the<00:06:59.480> individual

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
focuses a bit more on the individual

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.020 
focuses a bit more on the individual
talents<00:07:00.500> of<00:07:00.620> deacon<00:07:00.980> natty<00:07:01.190> and<00:07:01.430> no<00:07:01.580> I<00:07:01.850> think

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
talents of deacon natty and no I think

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.850 
talents of deacon natty and no I think
this<00:07:02.420> record<00:07:02.810> is<00:07:02.930> gonna<00:07:03.110> end<00:07:03.320> up<00:07:03.440> being<00:07:03.680> a

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
this record is gonna end up being a

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.880 
this record is gonna end up being a
little<00:07:04.040> bit<00:07:04.160> of<00:07:04.550> a<00:07:05.180> minor<00:07:05.450> hit<00:07:05.840> in<00:07:06.020> cunning

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
little bit of a minor hit in cunning

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.680 
little bit of a minor hit in cunning
linguist<00:07:07.190> discography<00:07:07.940> but<00:07:08.210> still<00:07:08.540> the

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690 
linguist discography but still the

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.990 
linguist discography but still the
quality<00:07:09.140> is<00:07:09.290> so<00:07:09.320> high<00:07:09.620> that<00:07:09.890> it<00:07:10.490> could<00:07:10.760> win

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000

over a newcomer most definitely I'm
