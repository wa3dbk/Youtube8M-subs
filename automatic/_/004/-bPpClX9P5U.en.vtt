00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
this dried out image and it's

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.360 
this dried out image and it's
excruciating<00:02:38.590> computer<00:02:39.590> takes<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.980> life<00:02:40.130> out

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
hold it for so long it's like putting

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.440 
hold it for so long it's like putting

your finger in the flame and you it's
