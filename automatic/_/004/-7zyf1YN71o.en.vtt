00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
these were battery operated I just cut

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.610 
these were battery operated I just cut
the<00:02:55.420> leads<00:02:56.420> off<00:02:56.600> going<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.140> battery<00:02:57.470> box

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.720 
the leads off going to the battery box
and<00:02:58.100> I<00:02:58.640> put<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.209> battery<00:03:00.170> connector<00:03:00.799> on<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.549> to

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
and I put a battery connector on it to

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.319 
and I put a battery connector on it to
use<00:03:01.970> with<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.299> lipo<00:03:03.260> battery<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:04.209> ran<00:03:05.209> in

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
light strips are removable I've just got

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.069 
light strips are removable I've just got
them<00:03:13.730> on<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.970> plane<00:03:14.180> right<00:03:14.420> now<00:03:14.450> with<00:03:14.810> scotch

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
them on the plane right now with scotch

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.740 
them on the plane right now with scotch
tape<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:16.160> these<00:03:16.340> these<00:03:16.970> actually<00:03:17.359> come<00:03:17.570> off

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
tape but these these actually come off

tape but these these actually come off
in<00:03:17.930> strips<00:03:19.570> they're<00:03:20.570> actually<00:03:20.959> stripped<00:03:21.350> to

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
in strips they're actually stripped to

in strips they're actually stripped to
the<00:03:21.530> lights<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:22.489> can<00:03:22.609> put<00:03:22.760> them<00:03:22.910> on<00:03:23.030> any<00:03:23.209> plane

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
the lights you can put them on any plane

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.680 
the lights you can put them on any plane
and<00:03:24.609> you<00:03:25.609> don't<00:03:25.760> have<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:26.000> bunch<00:03:26.269> them<00:03:26.450> up<00:03:26.510> as

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
and you don't have to bunch them up as

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.720 
and you don't have to bunch them up as
tight<00:03:26.870> as<00:03:27.079> I<00:03:27.170> did<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.530> did<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.950> just<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:30.730> just

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
tight as I did I did that just to just

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.520 
tight as I did I did that just to just
to<00:03:31.790> make<00:03:32.000> them<00:03:32.120> fit<00:03:32.329> on<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.600> firebird<00:03:33.109> phantom

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
to make them fit on the firebird phantom

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.610 
to make them fit on the firebird phantom
wing<00:03:33.709> but<00:03:34.640> as<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.880> see<00:03:35.120> if<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.200> got<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.410> really

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
wing but as you see if you got a really

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.069 
wing but as you see if you got a really
big<00:03:36.890> plane<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:38.060> get<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.239> couple<00:03:38.600> of<00:03:38.690> strands<00:03:38.930> of

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
big plane you get a couple of strands of

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.259 
big plane you get a couple of strands of
these<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:40.340> can<00:03:40.519> really<00:03:40.820> stretch<00:03:41.000> them

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
these and you can really stretch them

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.440 
these and you can really stretch them
out<00:03:44.049> so<00:03:45.049> all<00:03:46.010> right<00:03:46.190> that's<00:03:46.910> that's<00:03:47.359> pretty

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
out so all right that's that's pretty

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.690 
out so all right that's that's pretty
much<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.780> for<00:03:47.959> this<00:03:48.140> part<00:03:48.500> of<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.709> video<00:03:49.190> clip

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
much it for this part of the video clip

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.000 
much it for this part of the video clip
the<00:03:50.299> next<00:03:50.600> couple<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:51.140> videos<00:03:51.200> you're<00:03:51.890> going

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
the next couple of videos you're going

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.580 
the next couple of videos you're going
to<00:03:52.100> see<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.519> a<00:03:52.549> actually<00:03:53.359> older<00:03:53.750> footage<00:03:54.230> from

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
to see is a actually older footage from

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.550 
to see is a actually older footage from
before<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.640> first<00:03:55.880> flight

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.110 

alright<00:03:59.560> this<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.770> like<00:04:00.100> if<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.520> came<00:04:00.730> up<00:04:00.910> with

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
alright this is like if I came up with

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.030 
alright this is like if I came up with
this<00:04:01.900> is<00:04:02.080> actually<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.530> string<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.070> 20<00:04:03.220> lights

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
this is actually a string of 20 lights

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.470 
this is actually a string of 20 lights
that's<00:04:06.040> battery-operated<00:04:06.550> I<00:04:07.090> got<00:04:07.240> this<00:04:07.360> from

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
that's battery-operated I got this from

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.770 
that's battery-operated I got this from
a<00:04:07.690> local<00:04:08.620> craft<00:04:09.220> store<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:11.460> pre-wired<00:04:12.460> it

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
a local craft store and I pre-wired it

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.020 
a local craft store and I pre-wired it
to<00:04:13.780> light<00:04:14.020> sets<00:04:14.350> together<00:04:14.700> with<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.820> plug

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
to light sets together with the plug

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.510 
to light sets together with the plug
they<00:04:16.270> use<00:04:16.510> with<00:04:16.690> my<00:04:16.840> lipo<00:04:17.200> batteries<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.890> you

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
they use with my lipo batteries and you

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:28.100 
they use with my lipo batteries and you
plug<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:18.850> in<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.239> looks<00:04:19.390> like<00:04:19.540> this

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.890 

now<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:30.180> should<00:04:31.180> light<00:04:31.419> up<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.659> plumbing

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
now that should light up the plumbing

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.740 
now that should light up the plumbing
very<00:04:32.199> well<00:04:32.440> anyway<00:04:33.400> instead<00:04:33.669> of<00:04:34.240> permanently

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
very well anyway instead of permanently

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.920 
very well anyway instead of permanently
mounting<00:04:35.229> these<00:04:35.409> to<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.300> Firebird<00:04:37.300> phantom<00:04:37.720> i

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
mounting these to the Firebird phantom i

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.730

use packing tape just for older rolled a
strip<00:04:41.979> across<00:04:42.099> the<00:04:42.490> table<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.150> sat<00:04:43.990> down<00:04:44.259> and

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
strip across the table and sat down and

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.490 
strip across the table and sat down and
put<00:04:45.759> them<00:04:45.879> on<00:04:45.940> one<00:04:46.180> side<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:46.810> then<00:04:47.229> got

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
put them on one side and then got

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.200 
put them on one side and then got
another<00:04:47.800> piece<00:04:47.979> of<00:04:48.129> package<00:04:48.400> that<00:04:48.699> tape<00:04:49.000> and

another piece of package that tape and

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.540 
another piece of package that tape and
we'll<00:04:49.479> wrap<00:04:49.629> it<00:04:49.690> across<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.110> other<00:04:50.349> so<00:04:50.650> these

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
we'll wrap it across the other so these

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.520 
we'll wrap it across the other so these
are<00:04:51.729> actually<00:04:52.090> portable<00:04:52.569> light<00:04:52.780> strips<00:04:53.199> now

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
are actually portable light strips now

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.309 
are actually portable light strips now
and<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.460> can<00:04:54.639> attach<00:04:54.909> it<00:04:55.120> into<00:04:55.360> any<00:04:56.050> plane<00:04:56.289> I

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319
