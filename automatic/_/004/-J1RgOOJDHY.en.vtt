00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
sometimes they'll leave the middle right

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.570 
sometimes they'll leave the middle right
open<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.650> can<00:02:39.800> get<00:02:40.010> right<00:02:40.220> behind<00:02:40.340> them

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
stairs and this one I liked it so a

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.589 
stairs and this one I liked it so a
little<00:03:32.760> bit<00:03:32.879> more<00:03:33.060> than<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.299> other<00:03:33.389> one

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
little bit more than the other one

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.789 
little bit more than the other one
because<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.200> get<00:03:34.319> a<00:03:34.349> little<00:03:34.530> bit<00:03:34.650> more

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
because you get a little bit more

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.099 
because you get a little bit more
covered<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.489> it's<00:03:36.480> easier<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.870> pick<00:03:36.959> people

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
covered and it's easier to pick people

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.339 
covered and it's easier to pick people
off<00:03:37.379> beyond<00:03:37.919> that<00:03:37.950> Humvee<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.930> here's<00:03:40.290> a

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
off beyond that Humvee so here's a

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.759 
off beyond that Humvee so here's a
defensive<00:03:40.680> loading<00:03:41.370> bay<00:03:41.489> brush<00:03:42.230> this<00:03:43.230> one<00:03:43.500> I

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
defensive loading bay brush this one I

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.240 
defensive loading bay brush this one I
probably<00:03:44.189> use<00:03:44.400> most<00:03:45.109> it's<00:03:46.109> easy<00:03:46.349> to<00:03:46.949> pick<00:03:47.099> off

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
probably use most it's easy to pick off

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.629 
probably use most it's easy to pick off
people<00:03:47.609> like<00:03:47.849> trying<00:03:48.329> to<00:03:48.389> rush<00:03:48.599> plant<00:03:48.840> be

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
people like trying to rush plant be

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.640 
people like trying to rush plant be
actually<00:03:50.639> no<00:03:50.760> not<00:03:50.939> this<00:03:51.090> one<00:03:51.349> this<00:03:52.349> one<00:03:52.620> is

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
actually no not this one this one is

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.610 
actually no not this one this one is
another<00:03:52.799> effective<00:03:53.069> one<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.489> can<00:03:53.609> stun<00:03:54.620> up
