00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
here get into the starter area but then

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.310 
here get into the starter area but then
i<00:01:26.070> found<00:01:26.280> i<00:01:26.670> tried<00:01:27.090> using<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.509> hand<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
i found i tried using a hand just a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.530 
i found i tried using a hand just a
regular<00:01:28.500> wrench<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.759> i<00:01:29.850> wasn't<00:01:30.030> able<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.420> get

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
regular wrench and i wasn't able to get

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.780 
regular wrench and i wasn't able to get
enough<00:01:30.780> torque<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> get<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.740> top<00:01:31.979> bolt<00:01:32.400> off

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
enough torque to get that top bolt off

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.440 
enough torque to get that top bolt off
so<00:01:33.780> i<00:01:34.140> decided<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.890> use<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.180> impact<00:01:36.180> wrench

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
so i decided to use the impact wrench

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.219 
so i decided to use the impact wrench
and<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.780> did<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.979> no<00:01:38.009> trouble<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.670> all

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
and that did it with no trouble at all

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.330 
and that did it with no trouble at all
see<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.530> take<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> look<00:01:40.950> underneath

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
see if we can take a look underneath

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.200

think<00:03:28.940> it's<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.150> good<00:03:29.299> idea<00:03:29.480> because<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.680> can

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
think it's a good idea because it can

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.770 
think it's a good idea because it can
generate<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:31.670> much<00:03:31.730> torque<00:03:32.209> you<00:03:32.329> could<00:03:32.510> end<00:03:32.660> up

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
generate so much torque you could end up

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.640 
generate so much torque you could end up
stripping<00:03:33.079> threads<00:03:33.739> or<00:03:34.549> you<00:03:35.000> could<00:03:35.209> end<00:03:35.390> up

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
stripping threads or you could end up

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
getting it on so tight that it's almost

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.110 
getting it on so tight that it's almost
impossible<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.780> get<00:03:39.019> off<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.269> just<00:03:41.480> used<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
impossible to get off so I just used the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.710 
impossible to get off so I just used the
just<00:03:44.120> use<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:45.640> comma<00:03:46.640> those<00:03:46.970> combination<00:03:47.630> of

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
just use the comma those combination of

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.110 
just use the comma those combination of
things<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:48.170> get<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.530> back<00:03:48.980> on<00:03:49.340> I<00:03:49.670> think<00:03:49.880> I<00:03:49.940> got

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
things to get it back on I think I got

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.910 
things to get it back on I think I got
it<00:03:50.150> torqued<00:03:50.540> up<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.989> a<00:03:51.019> good<00:03:51.230> amount<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.590> torque

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
it torqued up to a good amount of torque

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.800 
it torqued up to a good amount of torque
I<00:03:52.190> don't<00:03:53.000> think<00:03:53.060> this<00:03:53.299> would<00:03:53.480> have<00:03:53.600> provided

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
I don't think this would have provided

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.390 
I don't think this would have provided
enough<00:03:54.230> torque<00:03:54.560> though<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.799> get<00:03:55.010> it<00:03:55.160> all<00:03:55.370> out

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
enough torque though to get it all out

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.620 
enough torque though to get it all out
so<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:56.209> had<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.480> use<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.690> impact<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:58.450> now<00:03:59.450> we're

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
so I had to use the impact and now we're

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.780 
so I had to use the impact and now we're
ready<00:03:59.780> for<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.140> test<00:04:00.380> can't<00:04:00.890> drive<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.489> now<00:04:01.610> of

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
car you'll hear like a few cracks of the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.570 
car you'll hear like a few cracks of the
starter<00:05:03.160> like<00:05:03.310> very<00:05:03.610> nervous<00:05:05.040> and<00:05:06.040> it's<00:05:06.310> done

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
starter like very nervous and it's done

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.610 
starter like very nervous and it's done
that<00:05:06.850> ever<00:05:07.240> since<00:05:07.690> I've<00:05:07.900> owned<00:05:08.110> this<00:05:08.260> car

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
that ever since I've owned this car

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.010 
that ever since I've owned this car
we've<00:05:09.460> gotten<00:05:09.760> those<00:05:09.850> few<00:05:10.210> cranks<00:05:10.480> that<00:05:10.870> it's

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
we've gotten those few cranks that it's

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.190 
we've gotten those few cranks that it's
kicked<00:05:11.320> out<00:05:11.560> because<00:05:11.890> it<00:05:12.160> was<00:05:12.280> so<00:05:12.460> worn<00:05:12.760> out

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
kicked out because it was so worn out

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.730 
kicked out because it was so worn out
but<00:05:14.200> now<00:05:14.470> I<00:05:14.980> think<00:05:15.880> even<00:05:16.390> if<00:05:16.660> it's<00:05:16.810> flooded<00:05:17.410> I

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
but now I think even if it's flooded I

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.180 
but now I think even if it's flooded I
can<00:05:18.730> get<00:05:19.390> it<00:05:19.510> to<00:05:19.630> turn<00:05:19.870> over<00:05:20.200> and<00:05:20.650> get<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:20.890> good

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
can get it to turn over and get a good

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.110 
can get it to turn over and get a good
start<00:05:21.640> out<00:05:21.880> of<00:05:22.060> it<00:05:22.210> that<00:05:23.580> makes<00:05:24.580> you<00:05:24.670> feel<00:05:24.910> so

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
start out of it that makes you feel so

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.870 
start out of it that makes you feel so
much<00:05:25.300> better<00:05:25.570> about<00:05:25.690> this<00:05:26.110> car<00:05:26.440> is<00:05:26.880> another

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
much better about this car is another

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.550 
much better about this car is another
thing<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.270> would<00:05:28.510> happen<00:05:28.690> when<00:05:28.930> I<00:05:28.990> first<00:05:29.290> got

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
it is that when the starter got hot it

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.010

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
pickup coil off we did put on a new
