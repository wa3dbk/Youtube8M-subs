00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
okay this is the next day I'll just pull

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.230 
okay this is the next day I'll just pull
this<00:00:07.649> trap<00:00:08.010> out<00:00:11.330> so<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.480> trap<00:00:14.030> was<00:00:15.030> not

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
this trap out so that trap was not

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.010 
this trap out so that trap was not
triggered<00:00:18.020> my<00:00:19.020> trigger<00:00:19.320> now<00:00:20.000> this<00:00:21.000> trap<00:00:21.390> is

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
triggered my trigger now this trap is

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.359 
triggered my trigger now this trap is
right<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.029> somehow<00:00:25.310> it<00:00:26.310> ended<00:00:26.789> up

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
right here and somehow it ended up

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.970 
right here and somehow it ended up
upside<00:00:29.369> down<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.119> did<00:00:30.300> something<00:00:30.980> but

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
upside down so it did something but

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.850 
upside down so it did something but
didn't<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.340> anything<00:00:32.520> good<00:00:32.820> enough<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.860> this

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
didn't do anything good enough and this

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.330 
didn't do anything good enough and this
trap<00:00:35.190> wasn't<00:00:35.610> even<00:00:35.790> touched<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.710> yet<00:00:38.190> again

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
trap wasn't even touched so yet again

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.770 
trap wasn't even touched so yet again
another<00:00:38.700> failure<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:42.290> these<00:00:43.290> three<00:00:43.620> traps<00:00:44.780> are

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
another failure so these three traps are

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.920 
another failure so these three traps are
just<00:00:46.500> obsolete<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.760> mice<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.270> too<00:00:48.420> smart<00:00:48.690> for

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
just obsolete the mice are too smart for

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.959 
just obsolete the mice are too smart for
them<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:51.030> got<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.539> other<00:00:51.719> trap<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
them now so got this other trap here a

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.200 
them now so got this other trap here a
little<00:00:53.969> similar<00:00:54.770> except<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:59.760> one<00:00:59.940> piece

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
little similar except the the one piece

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.719 
little similar except the the one piece
here<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.350> bit<00:01:01.530> different<00:01:02.239> oops

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
here is a little bit different oops

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.890 
here is a little bit different oops
rather<00:01:05.729> than<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.180> through<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.479> whole<00:01:08.780> get

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:23.749 

this<00:01:12.900> piece<00:01:13.200> right<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:20.040> gets<00:01:20.340> hooked<00:01:22.759> so

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
this piece right here it gets hooked so

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
this piece right here it gets hooked so
okay<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> try<00:01:24.509> these<00:01:24.570> traps<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.590> bit

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
okay I try these traps a little bit

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.480 
okay I try these traps a little bit
different<00:01:26.070> give<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.909> whirl<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:29.340> then

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
different give it a whirl and then

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.789 
different give it a whirl and then
there's<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.880> trap<00:01:31.100> just<00:01:32.100> pull<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:47.350 

they<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.329> lift<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.509> little<00:01:39.869> box<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:41.659> so

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.630 

so<00:01:48.360> these<00:01:48.869> are<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> traps<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:50.280> I'm<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so these are the traps that I'm going to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:59.569 
so these are the traps that I'm going to
use<00:01:53.540> i'm<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.780> use<00:01:55.219> two<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.250> these<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:58.579> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
use i'm going to use two of these and to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.510 
use i'm going to use two of these and to
these<00:01:59.850> traps<00:02:00.500> all<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.590> did<00:02:01.649> was<00:02:01.770> wrap<00:02:02.100> string

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
these traps all I did was wrap string

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.020 
these traps all I did was wrap string
around<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:04.130> covered<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.189> peanut<00:02:05.219> butter

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.740 

all<00:02:08.539> right<00:02:08.660> there<00:02:08.990> we<00:02:09.170> have<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:09.350> I<00:02:09.880> got<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.090> all

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
all right there we have it I got it all

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.680 
all right there we have it I got it all
upgraded<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.770> have<00:02:15.459> two<00:02:16.459> new<00:02:16.670> traps<00:02:17.060> in<00:02:17.330> here

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
upgraded I have two new traps in here

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.650 
upgraded I have two new traps in here
that<00:02:18.530> are<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:19.010> lot<00:02:19.400> different<00:02:19.430> than<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.480> old

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
that are a lot different than the old

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.910 
that are a lot different than the old
style<00:02:21.050> traps<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:22.430> one<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.660> newer<00:02:24.470> trap

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
style traps this one is a newer trap

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.400 
style traps this one is a newer trap
that's<00:02:25.250> slightly<00:02:25.550> different<00:02:26.230> here's<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
that's slightly different here's the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.330 
that's slightly different here's the
differences<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> trap<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.560> I

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
differences and this is a trap that I

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.400 
differences and this is a trap that I
had<00:02:31.550> earlier<00:02:32.000> with<00:02:32.150> string<00:02:32.540> peanut<00:02:33.260> butter

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
had earlier with string peanut butter

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.860 
had earlier with string peanut butter
and<00:02:33.620> wrap<00:02:34.160> around<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.880> they<00:02:35.540> looked<00:02:35.750> it

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
and wrap around and they looked it

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.490 
and wrap around and they looked it
fucking<00:02:36.200> clean<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:38.270> difference<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:39.290> one

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
fucking clean the difference is this one

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.729 
fucking clean the difference is this one
smaller<00:02:39.800> this<00:02:39.980> one's<00:02:40.190> bigger<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.790> coils

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
smaller this one's bigger the coils

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.820 
smaller this one's bigger the coils
springs<00:02:42.739> are<00:02:43.840> different<00:02:44.840> sizes<00:02:44.989> this<00:02:45.620> one's

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
springs are different sizes this one's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.150 
springs are different sizes this one's
much<00:02:46.100> bigger<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.300> this<00:02:47.450> one<00:02:47.630> probably<00:02:48.410> slam<00:02:49.130> a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
much bigger so this one probably slam a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.990 
much bigger so this one probably slam a
bit<00:02:49.580> more<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.910> punch<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:52.489> I

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
bit more of a punch to it and I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.790 
bit more of a punch to it and I
basically<00:02:53.450> get<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:53.989> same<00:02:54.200> thing<00:02:54.440> with<00:02:54.590> this

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
basically get the same thing with this

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.580 
basically get the same thing with this
trap<00:02:55.100> here<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.700> wrap<00:02:56.480> string<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.019> peanut

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
trap here I wrap string and peanut

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.130 
trap here I wrap string and peanut
butter<00:02:57.620> around<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.060> that's<00:02:59.720> what's<00:02:59.900> going

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
butter around it and that's what's going

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.979 
butter around it and that's what's going
on<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.440> here<00:03:01.180> peanut<00:03:02.180> butter<00:03:02.330> underneath<00:03:02.810> of

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
on in here peanut butter underneath of

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.390 
on in here peanut butter underneath of
these<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:05.500> I'm<00:03:06.500> going<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.680> close<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.130> up<00:03:07.250> and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
these so I'm going to close it up and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.090 
these so I'm going to close it up and
see<00:03:08.269> what<00:03:08.390> happens<00:03:10.480> hey<00:03:11.480> what<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:11.930> did<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:12.950> put

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
see what happens hey what I did is I put

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.729 
see what happens hey what I did is I put
that<00:03:13.160> one<00:03:13.549> extra<00:03:13.880> trap<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.540> placed<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.680> right

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
that one extra trap I placed it right

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.180 
that one extra trap I placed it right
here<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:17.810> close<00:03:18.049> up<00:03:18.079> this<00:03:18.350> but<00:03:18.920> there's

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
here so I close up this but there's

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.539 
here so I close up this but there's
going<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.430> be<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.579> wall<00:03:19.910> here<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:21.130> up<00:03:22.130> along<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
going to be a wall here and up along the
