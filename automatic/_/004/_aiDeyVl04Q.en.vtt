infinity<00:00:49.360> engine<00:00:49.510> but<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.940> step<00:00:52.210> in<00:00:52.239> the

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
infinity engine but it's step in the

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:53.610 
infinity engine but it's step in the
right<00:00:52.510> direction<00:00:52.539> and<00:00:53.079> I'm<00:00:53.230> really<00:00:53.440> happy

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
right direction and I'm really happy

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.580 
right direction and I'm really happy
with<00:00:53.859> the<00:00:53.920> way<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.129> game<00:00:54.160> plays<00:00:54.340> right<00:00:54.789> now<00:00:54.940> so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
and just call to main under for instance

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.930 
and just call to main under for instance
and<00:01:10.500> most<00:01:11.500> players<00:01:11.770> will<00:01:12.190> go<00:01:12.340> ahead<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.760> run

using<00:01:23.110> him<00:01:23.530> we'll<00:01:24.010> go<00:01:24.100> ahead<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.280> put<00:01:24.460> them<00:01:24.580> in

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
using him we'll go ahead and put them in

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.670 
using him we'll go ahead and put them in
the<00:01:24.730> spy<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.030> best<00:01:25.450> simulate<00:01:25.660> them<00:01:26.200> use<00:01:26.440> room

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
the spy to best simulate them use room

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.220 
the spy to best simulate them use room
or<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.340> hook<00:01:27.580> zone<00:01:27.820> just<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.180> simulate<00:01:28.600> them

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
or a hook zone just to simulate them

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.840 
or a hook zone just to simulate them
using<00:01:29.740> him<00:01:29.860> over<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.190> middle<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.550> trying<00:01:30.790> to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
using him over the middle and trying to

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.440 
using him over the middle and trying to
rob<00:01:31.380> passes<00:01:32.380> but<00:01:33.190> okay<00:01:33.460> here's<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:33.970> gist<00:01:36.450> that

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
rob passes but okay here's the gist that

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.450 
rob passes but okay here's the gist that
is<00:01:37.720> what<00:01:38.050> you<00:01:38.170> can<00:01:38.290> expect<00:01:38.410> against<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.310> meet

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
is what you can expect against to meet

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.580 
is what you can expect against to meet
under<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.880> yes<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.600> looks<00:01:40.870> dangerous<00:01:41.350> but<00:01:41.560> i

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
under and yes it looks dangerous but i

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.400 
under and yes it looks dangerous but i
promise<00:01:42.190> you<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.820> what<00:01:43.270> will<00:01:43.660> happen<00:01:44.020> they

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
promise you it is what will happen they

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.570 
promise you it is what will happen they
very<00:01:44.980> rarely<00:01:45.070> will<00:01:45.490> pick<00:01:45.850> this<00:01:46.030> pass<00:01:47.430> go<00:01:48.430> back

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
very rarely will pick this pass go back

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.870 
very rarely will pick this pass go back
