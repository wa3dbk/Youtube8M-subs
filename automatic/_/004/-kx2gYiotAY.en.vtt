00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.070
 I believe where guys like they are 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.660
 the knight of the night batman is one 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.329
 of the best superheroes that has 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.669
 given the comics and not just for their 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.520
 Exciting stories and wonderful 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:27.070
 feats but also because very in the 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.750
 background everyone think that only 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.939
 We are going to an arts training 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.400
 martial arts and get control of a 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.730
 million dollar company to become 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.430
 the greatest detective in the world but 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.500
 how is it that a normal person could 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.930
 reach the physical and mental level of 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.629
 batman the answer has the 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.789
 neuroscientist and kinesiologist for being 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.850
 who has studied how a person 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.699
 could become a batman in life 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.730
 real becoming batman requires a 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.500
 lot of training but of course 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.170
 there are people who thanks to their 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.869
 body biology will respond better to 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.850
 training that others train is not 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.700
 more than subjecting the body to certain 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.190
 stress and some people do not respond 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.920
 as fast to this as the others 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.619
 while there are people who are 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.750
 on the other side of the spectrum where very 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.110
 little exercise brings huge 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.030
 results there is a genetic component 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.409
 that dictates how fast you can 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.630
 develop muscle mass 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.299
 and you have a gene that inhibits in some 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.159
 degree myostatin a protein that 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.969
 regulates the growth of fibers 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.670
 muscular 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:41.299
 you will have large muscles in a short time 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.119
 but batman does not just need to be strong 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.880
 agile and fast you also need to avoid 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.039
 the injuries in our body exist 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.009
 genes that contribute to the ability of 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:55.220
 recover from injuries one of these 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.950
 genes would be collagen 1 to 1 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.950
 its name indicates it is associated with the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.630
 production of collagen protein 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.450
 when we get thoroughly to see what they are 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.030
 tendons ligaments and tissues inter 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.820
 connective everything is reduced to fibers of 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.120
 collagen and if you have a bad expression 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.940
 of collagen 1 to 1 you will not be possessor 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.550
 of a spectacular connective tissue and 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.470
 that's where the injuries come 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.500
 the ability to avoid injuring you and 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.080
 recover quickly from wounds is very 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.720
 valuable not only to become 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.540
 batman but also to remain 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.580
 batman but the biggest barrier to 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.000
 becoming a batman is not going to be your 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.380
 body will be your mind if in this 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.340
 I ask you if you want 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.830
 become a batman what would you say 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.019
 but what about if I tell you that for 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.700
 become a batman you need to spend 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.069
 by a special process and a 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.900
 intensive training that will absorb 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.360
 all your time and you will not have more 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.650
 free time for youtube more than 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.400
 to see my videos I assure you that I 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.190
 would think twice is estimated that it would take 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.739
 between 15 and 18 years of training for 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.750
 get to the level of batman you can 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.180
 compare it with the Olympic athletes that 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.299
 they devote a whole decade before winning 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.209
 his first gold medal is a lot of 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.060
 time and dedication and to be honest 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.340
 most people do not have the 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.209
 willpower to submit to this 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.459
 regime and that is the biggest limitation but 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.319
 if you are decided enough 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.849
 to invest 15 years of your life 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.500
 training in what are you going to train batman 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.220
 has a wide range of skills 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.670
 from gymnastics parkour domain of many 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.340
 if not all martial arts 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.680
 even those that use projectiles 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.800
 and not like I'm supposed to throw their 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.440
 battles so you have to mentalize 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.629
 to be good in many things what 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.750
 It means you'll never be the best of 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.950
 world in some individual support a 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.620
 small problem is that when 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.989
 you develop certain skills it turns out 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.910
 counterproductive in the sense that 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.120
 They carry our physiology in a 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.340
 direction and that kind of adaptation between 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.209
 in conflict with other aspects that 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.650
 we would also like to have for example 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.139
 batman will need the speed of a 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.960
 corridor but also the resistance of 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.510
 a marathoner but when you train for 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.510
 gain resistance to your body you change 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.460
 certain way your muscles your system 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.560
 cardiovascular and this could 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.830
 oppose another objective that 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.200
 are you looking forward to being a batman 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.020
 you'll have to make sure you do not develop 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.930
 certain skills that eclipse others 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.750
 and finally maybe you want to start what 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.520
 the idea is there early 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.560
 that you have to start with your 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.500
 training before a certain age 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.020
 if you want to excel in a certain 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.300
 sport and although this idea is not of 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.090
 everything accepted by the specialists in 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.729
 the sport if it's going to take you about 10 years 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.440
 in becoming a batman you must 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.509
 make sure you reach the skill 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.530
 necessary for when you are in mid 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:17.409
 of 220 those principles of your 30 if for 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.590
 these then you are thinking to the devil 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:23.590
 I will become an ironman 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.199
 very bad news even if you already have the 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.590
 armor the only thing that will do for you 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.960
 is to amplify your skills so if 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.500
 you have no skill the only thing 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.810
 are going to do will be clumsy movements 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.310
 extremely powerful yes, but 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.500
 awkward 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.020
 so when you try to catch 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.170
 someone in full flight is very likely 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.140
 that what you do instead would be 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.300
 tear it down with your powerful super suit 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.370
 thank you very much to see this chapter if 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.800
 the video you liked to share with your 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.660
 friends and maybe they would also like 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.090
 start with your training to do 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.370
 batman and if you are not yet subscribed to 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.890
 channel this is the best time to 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.510
 do it only I have to remind them 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.790
 that my name is mountain stream and how 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.230
 forever 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.230
 we will see each other in the future
