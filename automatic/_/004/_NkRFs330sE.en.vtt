sometimes you wear jacket but now if

sometimes you wear jacket but now if
your<00:00:34.140> jackets<00:00:34.469> open<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.399> see<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> patch

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
your jackets open you can see the patch

your jackets open you can see the patch
in<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.360> middle<00:00:36.630> that's<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:37.020> clever<00:00:37.170> now<00:00:37.920> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
in the middle that's really clever now I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.380 
in the middle that's really clever now I
suppose<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> three<00:00:38.790> lines<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.180> on

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
suppose it's the three lines on it on

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.979 
suppose it's the three lines on it on
the<00:00:39.480> heart<00:00:40.010> run<00:00:41.030> I'm<00:00:42.030> hoping<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.570> you

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
the heart run I'm hoping they can you

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.270 
the heart run I'm hoping they can you
know<00:00:43.079> show<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.290> pride<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.890> pitch<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
know show that pride on the pitch and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.190 
know show that pride on the pitch and
show<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> front<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.390> score<00:00:45.989> lots<00:00:46.050> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
show from the front and score lots of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.229 
show from the front and score lots of
goals<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.559> us<00:00:46.620> now<00:00:46.820> certainly<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.850> think<00:00:47.910> it's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
goals for us now certainly I think it's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
goals for us now certainly I think it's
always<00:00:48.570> important<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> great

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
always important to have a great

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.389 
always important to have a great
relationship<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> fans

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
relationship and the you know the fans

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.340 
relationship and the you know the fans
to<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.940> behind<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.570> players<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
to really get behind the players and and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.500 
to really get behind the players and and
vice<00:00:55.770> versa<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.399> helps<00:00:56.670> both<00:00:56.820> ways<00:00:57.090> I'm<00:00:57.329> sure

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
vice versa it helps both ways I'm sure

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750 
vice versa it helps both ways I'm sure
if<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> fans<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.199> behind<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:59.280> players<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
if the fans get behind the players and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.920 
if the fans get behind the players and
viously<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> players<00:01:00.300> put<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:00.780> good

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.470 
viously the players put in some good
performances<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.850> confidence

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
performances then then that confidence

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.750 
performances then then that confidence
that<00:01:03.690> belief<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.199> will<00:01:04.530> grow<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.729> on

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that belief will will grow it will go on

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.830 
that belief will will grow it will go on
to<00:01:06.090> bigger<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.630> better<00:01:06.810> things

we're<00:01:43.830> going<00:01:43.979> out<00:01:44.220> looking<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.640> win<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> game

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.090 
we're going out looking to win the game
I<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.020> definitely<00:01:46.320> need<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.920> getting

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
I think we definitely need to be getting

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.590 
I think we definitely need to be getting
a<00:01:47.220> positive<00:01:47.580> result<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:48.090> need<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.360> win<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
a positive result we need to win the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.090 
a positive result we need to win the
game

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.200 

the<00:01:53.100> managers<00:01:53.490> from<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.820> different<00:01:54.000> background

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the managers from a different background

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.419 
the managers from a different background
to<00:01:54.630> us<00:01:54.750> he's<00:01:55.530> got<00:01:55.649> different<00:01:55.830> habits<00:01:56.220> and

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
to us he's got different habits and

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.279 
to us he's got different habits and
you'd<00:01:57.300> kind<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.780> jump<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.200> be

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
you'd kind of just jump in it to be

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.230 
you'd kind of just jump in it to be
awake<00:01:58.470> wanting<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.159> what<00:01:59.190> ideas<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.119> what

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
awake wanting to see what ideas and what

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.210 
awake wanting to see what ideas and what
other<00:02:00.390> stuff<00:02:00.569> he's<00:02:00.720> got<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.289> first<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:02.190> I

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
other stuff he's got to the first like I

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.649 
other stuff he's got to the first like I
said<00:02:02.429> I<00:02:02.490> think<00:02:02.550> is<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> bit<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.270> bring<00:02:03.450> home

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
said I think is a bit to bring home

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.359 
said I think is a bit to bring home
something<00:02:04.080> different<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:04.710> game<00:02:04.950> really

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
something different to the game really

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.370 
something different to the game really
earn<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:06.060> new<00:02:06.360> boss<00:02:06.630> coming<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
earn the new boss coming in and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.540 
earn the new boss coming in and
obviously<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.100> brings<00:02:08.340> something

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
obviously that brings something

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.889 
obviously that brings something
different<00:02:08.729> already<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.479> we're<00:02:09.630> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> have

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
different already so we're going to have

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.420 
different already so we're going to have
a<00:02:09.959> different<00:02:10.319> style<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.649> play<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.890> start<00:02:11.220> with

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
a different style of play to start with

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.190 
a different style of play to start with
which<00:02:11.940> which<00:02:12.209> would<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.540> interesting<00:02:12.989> he's

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
which which would be interesting he's

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.500 
which which would be interesting he's
been<00:02:13.350> there<00:02:13.530> done<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.739> he's<00:02:14.420> proven<00:02:15.420> himself

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
been there done it he's proven himself

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.199 
been there done it he's proven himself
at<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.930> highest<00:02:16.140> level<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:17.120> with<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
at the highest level and with the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.520 
at the highest level and with the
players<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.720> talent<00:02:19.049> he's<00:02:19.140> got<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.440> this

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
players and the talent he's got in this

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.410 
players and the talent he's got in this
squad<00:02:19.799> I<00:02:19.829> think<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.519> really<00:02:21.299> have<00:02:21.390> a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
squad I think you can really have a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.539 
squad I think you can really have a
positive<00:02:21.660> effect<00:02:22.140> hopefully<00:02:22.829> can<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.400> can

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
positive effect hopefully can you can

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.670 
positive effect hopefully can you can
push<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.820> on<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.180> next<00:02:24.390> level<00:02:24.470> nuke<00:02:25.470> it

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
push it on to that next level nuke it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.090 
push it on to that next level nuke it
