00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.370
 more cardboard made thanks to super mario rpg and middelburg understood 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.769
 that his fetish hero could very well adapt to the adventure game 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.799
 abandoning their traditional online platform that will have a new 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.880
 once crossed the iron with their friends forever 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.369
 dowse 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.989
 only if things had to be repeated over and over again weariness 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.349
 after toyota 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.769
 for him it's his mitten for cause 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.039
 dabo and even though our hormones still life hard to invite to a new enemy 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.259
 made his appearance 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.349
 it is a race of extraterrestrial mushrooms 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.899
 she is not very bad about the costs enough misfortune around could 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.050
 resume college life 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.480
 then the game runs in parallel over two epochs 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.500
 the scenario is relatively contained but the story will soon bring the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.710
 products presenting near the wheels of the past 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.750
 this will be an opportunity to savor holy tremor dishes 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.710
 the game alternates between the classic fights of any adventure game that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.660
 the parties on the left, which most often consists of using the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.660
 good power in the right place to activate a switch to progress 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.550
 m 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.340
 in the field of classical there are objects that increases the capabilities of 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.040
 characters there are some equipment that makes you stronger and there is fighting 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.110
 against the bosses in the most original we note that each action button is 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.730
 attributed to a character 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.510
 it disturbs a little at first that the portion at the confluence of four 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.510
 great thanks to smart techniques so much precisely on 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.620
 the combination of the actions of several characters at the same time 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.570
 the universe of the series mario is very well transcribed in this game found 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.520
 many of the detainees a lot of allies known a few months a little confusing 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 but still graphically very successful 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.820
 the balance between research and fighting is very well balanced 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.130
 the emerald are put to the test at times but it remains feasible 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.130
 with a minimum of discretion 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.020
 ac the big choice of actions make the players the fights are alike 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.560
 rarely we can fight back understand the utility of the pile of objects and all that 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.570
 in a very simple way 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.570
 classic gameplay greatly the job during these phases 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.820
 even if we can prefer the classic games with Mario this one remains 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.419
 interesting 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.149
 there are few platforms a lot of exploration but also humor is 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.260
 very present abilities learn objects to recover bodies from 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.259
 crime has screwed up thanks to all that 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.579
 the dual screen is always used since the top screen displays the 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.889
 map the state of the roads where the party of the level that we hÃ©rault are separated 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.269
 however the touch screen is not at all exploit it's a shame because 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.269
 it could have added an extra dimension to some cities 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.100
 they are relatively any 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.100
 apart from the well known castle of pitchounes nothing exceptional 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.219
 the fights against the big villains of ghosts are very numerous and sometimes 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:53.639
 even downright so 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.559
 once you've found the technique it's just a formality and you can 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:58.589
 to overcome them without being touched 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:02.149
 the piranha plant has for example made a disconcerting facility and it 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.149
 is a very advanced boss in the game 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.409
 mario already laid his mark on the platform world it seems in 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.719
 good way to do the same in the world of car games 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.089
 competition more difficult if you have some improvements here and there 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:28.719
 could really be done 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.930
 the game for those who have a good time 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.930
 despite the lack of a two-player mode and with a scenario perhaps too much 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.529
 directive Iberian nevertheless the look 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.870
 it is aimed at chocolate lovers all teens and subprimes and then 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:42.939
 lost of advanced to take the lead 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.229
 and unfortunately it does not go further than that
