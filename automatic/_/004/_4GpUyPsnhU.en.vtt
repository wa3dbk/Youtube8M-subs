the<00:01:42.329> zombies<00:01:42.780> alike<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.409> don't<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.159> they're

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the zombies alike I don't know they're

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.620 
the zombies alike I don't know they're
not<00:01:44.369> they're<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.759> sleep<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.390> something

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
not they're like sleep in a something

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.730 
not they're like sleep in a something
and<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.619> start<00:01:46.860> moving<00:01:46.979> after<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> while

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
and then they start moving after a while

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.010 
and then they start moving after a while
and<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.860> could<00:01:50.270> shoot<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> zombies<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and I could shoot the zombies like a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.690 
and I could shoot the zombies like a
couple<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.439> times<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.130> knife<00:01:53.340> them<00:01:53.579> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
couple of times and then knife them to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
couple of times and then knife them to
get<00:01:53.820> more<00:01:53.970> points<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.509> I'd<00:01:55.020> rather<00:01:55.259> not<00:01:55.680> do

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
get more points but I'd rather not do

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.950 
get more points but I'd rather not do
that<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> moment

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
that at the moment

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.670 
that at the moment
there's<00:01:57.560> buses<00:01:57.979> just<00:01:58.010> keep<00:01:58.370> on<00:01:58.610> peeping<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.680> got

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
there's buses just keep on peeping I got

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.080 
there's buses just keep on peeping I got
to<00:02:00.860> about<00:02:01.040> round<00:02:02.920> four<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.280> then<00:02:04.490> went<00:02:04.850> down

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
to about round four and then went down

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.850 
to about round four and then went down
which<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:05.840> probably<00:02:06.110> terrible<00:02:06.590> but

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
which is probably terrible but

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.380 
which is probably terrible but
considering<00:02:07.220> its<00:02:07.460> my<00:02:07.550> first<00:02:07.790> attempt<00:02:08.090> that's

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
considering its my first attempt that's

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.910 
considering its my first attempt that's
not<00:02:08.509> really<00:02:08.720> good<00:02:08.869> for<00:02:08.929> third<00:02:09.229> tent<00:02:09.590> i<00:02:09.709> guess

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
not really good for third tent i guess

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.620 
not really good for third tent i guess
it's<00:02:10.550> comment<00:02:10.880> on<00:02:10.940> what<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.300> got<00:02:11.480> on<00:02:11.569> your

it's comment on what you got on your

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.199 
it's comment on what you got on your
first<00:02:11.870> attempt<00:02:12.489> obviously<00:02:13.489> like<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.700> said<00:02:14.030> not

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
first attempt obviously like I said not

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.729 
first attempt obviously like I said not
the<00:02:14.330> best<00:02:14.540> at<00:02:14.630> zombies<00:02:15.020> but<00:02:15.200> I'm<00:02:15.350> giving<00:02:15.620> my

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
the best at zombies but I'm giving my

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.100 
the best at zombies but I'm giving my
guide<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.030> obviously<00:02:17.180> my<00:02:17.510> initial<00:02:17.870> force

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
guide this is obviously my initial force

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.180 
guide this is obviously my initial force
with<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.440> map<00:02:19.840> what<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.870> did<00:02:21.260> swap<00:02:21.590> before<00:02:22.010> is

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
with the map what I did swap before is

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.690 
with the map what I did swap before is
like<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:23.000> says<00:02:23.290> wait<00:02:24.290> hold<00:02:25.069> X<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.459> grab

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
like this it says wait hold X to grab

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.400 
like this it says wait hold X to grab
part<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:28.550> then<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.300> says<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:30.200> might

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
part and then it says this is this might

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.680 
part and then it says this is this might
be<00:02:30.500> good<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.880> build<00:02:32.150> something<00:02:32.390> of

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
be good to to build something of

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.449 
be good to to build something of
something<00:02:33.080> along<00:02:33.440> those<00:02:33.590> lines<00:02:33.650> which

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
something along those lines which

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.270 
something along those lines which
basically<00:02:34.790> means<00:02:35.030> obviously<00:02:35.570> in<00:02:35.750> black<00:02:35.959> ops<00:02:36.110> 2

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
basically means obviously in black ops 2

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.460 
basically means obviously in black ops 2
Tranzit<00:02:37.280> mode<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.730> or<00:02:38.030> zombies<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.989> can<00:02:39.290> use

Tranzit mode you or zombies you can use

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.759 
Tranzit mode you or zombies you can use

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
obviously this is going to be useful a

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.270 
obviously this is going to be useful a
late<00:02:47.120> stage<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.840> have<00:02:47.989> no<00:02:48.170> clue<00:02:48.380> obviously

late stage but I have no clue obviously

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.670 
late stage but I have no clue obviously
know<00:02:49.430> something<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:50.090> can<00:02:50.239> make<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.680> bright

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
know something you can make a bright

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.259 
know something you can make a bright
shield<00:02:52.070> but<00:02:52.400> that's<00:02:52.670> obviously<00:02:52.790> not<00:02:53.060> with

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
shield but that's obviously not with

a<00:03:05.269> lot<00:03:05.600> better<00:03:05.810> than<00:03:06.049> black<00:03:06.260> ops<00:03:06.440> 2<00:03:06.590> obviously

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
a lot better than black ops 2 obviously

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.220 
a lot better than black ops 2 obviously
it's<00:03:07.130> not<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.310> same<00:03:07.489> feeling<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.900> good<00:03:09.079> way
