00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.630
 spaces they told me in the 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:37.060
 second cbs news broadcast from the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.190

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.990
 They have faced the Templars them 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.790
 they are counted among their then low to 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.830
 twelve knights Templar 'that is to say the 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.750
 community police killed twelve 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.000
 Templars and the Templars too 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.430
 They killed a 16 - year-old 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.800
 just as you listen to a young man from 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.460
 16 years old I was operating with 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.200
 the community police a very thing 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.730
 different is lived in michoacán than what 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.350
 you can live in the city of mexico what 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.540
 that you can live in Monterrey 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.150
 that you can live in Guadalajara in the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.740
 big cities of the country are 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.450
 very small communities that stay 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.609
 absolutely nothing are communities 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.720
 very small where at some point 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.540
 the mafia arrives 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.670
 your mile to the lowest point that 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.260
 can bear the human being humiliates us 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.850
 to the point of violating them 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.310
 their women raping their daughters 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.230
 raping his girls by kidnapping her 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.240
 family and murdering their beings 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.060
 dear people simply get fed up 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.790
 Community police officers have taken 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.130
 justice by their own hand and they have taken 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.190
 times through machetes of sticks 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.200
 stones and other times already with certain 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.340
 armament to the templars of various 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 zones of michoacán 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.650
 apatzingán is the cradle of drug trafficking in 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.510
 apatzingán was before the headquarters 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.670
 of the Michoacán family and now the headquarters 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.990
 of the Knights Templar 'what 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.690
 they want to do the community is 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.490
 to remove them is to eliminate completely what 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.320
 is happening in Michoacán with 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.790
 regarding organized crime what 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.590
 they want the templars is that what 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.119
 they want forgiveness the community is that 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.979
 there are no more templars no more 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.380
 sects there is no more gulf there is no one 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.840
 but at the end of the day we're 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.700
 talking about a civil society group 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.740
 that is taking justice for own 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.450
 hand probably so 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.519
 extremely legitimate because the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.319
 government to the state abandoned us during 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.200
 a lot of time but 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.810
 of accounts we are seeing a group 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.150
 civilian taking justice by own hand 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.939
 when this type of phenomenon happens 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.700
 usually they never end well 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:39.040
 the regular end up untying in a 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.079
 civil conflict that goes to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.030
 happen when the community no longer 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.439
 want to save the weapons that will 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.590
 happen when the community wants 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.109
 continue to lead the security of 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.280
 their communities and michoacán 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.099
 concretely what is going to happen 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.750
 there they will have to face a serious 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.359
 problem because then they will have two 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.120
 one states the formal one and another one the 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:04.239
 another community that they are supporting 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.230
 the policemen who are supporting the 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.120
 that the people who are forming 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.219
 these types of groups are two powers with 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.719
 which is not going to be able to fight has 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.699
 that there is only one of these is the 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:18.760
 state monopoly that is the 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:21.280
 monopoly of the state's strength as 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.169
 tell them not to the community that 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.469
 they have risen in arms legitimately 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:30.210
 and who are currently demanding 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:32.670
 once and for all that there 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:37.140
 for their communities that are demanding 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.460
 once and for all that there is equality 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.620
 that there is a true state of law 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.910
 it's a very complex problem to disappear 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.970
 or do not disappear powers in 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.000
 michoacán final de facto accounts no 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.230
 exist in reality there are no 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.790
 powers in michoacán we have a 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.940
 governor who gets sick coming in that 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.860
 come out we have a serious problem finally 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.440
 We will be seeing what happens in Michoacán 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.000
