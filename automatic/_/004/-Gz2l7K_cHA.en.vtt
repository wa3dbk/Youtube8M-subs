00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hey people what is winter travel fitness 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.080
 and welcome to one 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.030
 further training video if previous 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.559
 Wishes were expressed with facetime and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.230
 I have not been able to do that yet 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.889
 come in because the other videos are still 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.750
 not online 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.750
 at the present time this means that 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.830
 here is the day after 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.570
 that means you became the day 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.420
 added to those the other 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.019
 That's why it was spoken like that now 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.210
 It turned on what stood on it 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.769
 Kreuzheben speed that means just after 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.820
 the squats directly cross in the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.160
 speed 60 percent of the maximum court 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.120
 I expect at the moment with 250 kilos 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.149
 that means 150 kilo four repetitions 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.739
 eight sets stretched with the rubber bands 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.860
 Guess we have a load of up 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.940
 between 170 and 180 that's what we mean 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.129
 start down with 150 plus because they 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.840
 not a two kilo per side though 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.859
 at all that it will soon 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.010
 probably still do not have and 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.840
 end up with 170 to 180 I can 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.470
 do not judge and you see 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.229
 attack the other way that means my mine 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.520
 left hand is tried and my right 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.470
 hand is zucchini 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.780
 I think so you can say that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.580
 means the hand outside surface shows after 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.009
 front left hand and hand 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.990
 outside time back to the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.549
 right hand and typical for me because 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.710
 i hold these displays a bit 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.610
 wants to balance 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.590
 unfamiliar for me to pull this way though 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.450
 is now done on the day of play and on 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.860
 main day I use yes to fight 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.770
 some had also asked why train 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.930
 I just practice this here so I practice now 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.439
 a few setups and the next 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.320
 meeting is for cruising 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.100
 prepare 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.869
 because of you has a few to fight 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.030
 asked why are you doing that's you 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.840
 you too weak that I would like to mean 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.700
 not on the main day 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.070
 so as usual to do on account of the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.549
 shoulder i want the evenly 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.619
 to have 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.270
 if I rot already inside her then 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.100
 at least evenly so I do that 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.670
 a little offsets that too 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.340
 fight on main day and you see goal 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.330
 is it really explosive now here 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.580
 you do not see it that good though 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.910
 really with power exclusively a rod 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.069
 to pull around the central nervous system 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.379
 yes, go there to train that is 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.900
 completely fires from all pipes against 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.630
 the weight swings quickly away from the ground 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.579
 to get in the lockout and the whole thing 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.670
 of course with a sub maximum one 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.410
 maximum load but with one 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.700
 light load he will go up 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.890
 Of course, then heavier but above 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.470
 is also a tick usually 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.360
 stronger or has the weight 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.099
 already a certain movement that is 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.810
 you do not have to go out of it anymore 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.090
 To move zero point means to go up 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.650
 the bands is dynamic resistance 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.720
 a fine thing about the whole then 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.459
 again tiring may be tiring 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.829
 to do and really to school 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.239
 we have to go up more speed gmbh us 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.799
 You should not give in , it will be easier 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.340
 but we'll have to be here soon 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.350
 sometimes the point of the legs runs wonderfully 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.880
 nobody was so open after that 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.530
 of course , would have been to press tape 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.959
 because I am at the moment due to the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.790
 shoulder injury in ping fast everything 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.190
 ignites everything tightly glued everything 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.290
 not bank ops here again briefly 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.180
 my shoulder treatment couple 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.829
 cutouts biceps tendon bursa 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.209
 everything is inflamed and is going to be now 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.940
 I just do not bitch 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.799
 More we have the part in there and times 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.620
 I want to see what happens next 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.389
 to start again that is tuesday 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.579
 bank press day look what I'm doing 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.040
 will take you on any event 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.410
 then again here knows quite normal 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.599
 her stretch with the band again one 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.419
 other variant external editorial 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.169
 that means you were in inner rotors 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.660
 appreciated here 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.400
 if I do not make a bench press 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.239
 but I can at least the triceps 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.050
 I am painless 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:02.470
 that's why a few sentences triceps bang 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:07.150
 once on cable and once so 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.220
 so that we are the long triceps 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.140
 head also with it has sprung 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.120
 namely on the shoulder blade my friends 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.690
 not all heads triceps in jumping on 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.540
 upper arm 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.510
 the middle so medial and the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.930
 lateral triceps head springing up on the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.310
 upper arm bones and the inner part of the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.630
 that's why it springs from the scapula 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.040
 also the over head exercise we here 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.830
 once again looks isolated yes and then but 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.750
 one more time on the body run 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.550
 isolated so that we are beautiful on the 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.010
 my triceps can concentrate 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.290
 friends and we get brute arms 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.050
 then, of course, the 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.650
 my friends have to blame with the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.410
 facebook started 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.479
 over to a variant I do not know 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.710
 What is it a mix of pages 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:58.220
 and just row the main thing 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.330
 main thing middle and back head 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.250
 I do not care about the rest 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.590
 The main thing is to shoot as well, of course 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.830
 on both sides then a few reverse 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.180
 fertilizer and water in the connection still 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.759
 made and of course the external ones 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.990
 rotation strengthened and in this sense 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.220
 That's it 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.139
 I hope I could do a bit 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.289
 take it until the next video makes it 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.289
 Well
