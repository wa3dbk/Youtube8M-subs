00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.830
 a fashionable guttenberg heartily 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.180
 Welcome to en wid today I want 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.709
 show them how we at inge viett 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.450
 to prepare dog food 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.310
 at the same time this is also an instruction 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.380
 for you if you yourself for your own 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.210
 Darling want to cook where mine 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.390
 prepare dog food we need 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.649
 Three things first, once good raw materials 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
 because it's the most important thing 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.160
 because the good raw materials the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.489
 ingredients that give 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.250
 that brings power and energy to the recipe 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.380
 So the right mix of raw materials 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.770
 and of course the time for that 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.850
 Preparation has how it works 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.329
 we look at the best in 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:54.060
 really good we start with that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.590
 important to the raw materials for our 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.120
 Feed dog and cats are 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.850
 carnivore that is their 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.220
 meat is not the main ingredient 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.769
 so easy our darlings as 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.570
 to introduce predators but the bit 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.590
 speaks a completely different language 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.930
 her teeth on 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.359
 there they find that the Europe to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.740
 catch and hold the prey and also 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.569
 the bowel is down and cats 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.670
 much shorter than plants 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:20.670
 eat that is the reason why the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.100
 benefit 90 to 99 percent meat in 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.770
 process our feed when we have it 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.780
 eg here an example to the light for 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.969
 people are very intense but for 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.340
 dogs cats absolute highlight because he 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.039
 has so many nutrients or this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.469
 components you may know 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.170
 Beef liver is quite rich in vitamin a too 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.109
 a very valuable raw material or here 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.609
 maybe very unusual 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.619
 class of william this example 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.409
 very important raw materials that has a lot 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.539
 muscle meat and also bones and 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.000
 These bones are for our natural ones 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.250
 Source of Calcium Calcium is important 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.840
 Photo should be more calcium than phosphorus 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.270
 be included and here I get 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.910
 Of course, calcium from the bones 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.880
 then this body exudes and one 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.020
 excess calcium again 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.789
 Of course, the bones are eliminated 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.250
 crushed with it down and candles 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.690
 nothing they can not leave 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:19.570
 other components for example and 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.610
 or four churches liver or even land 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.770
 for example or here the wings 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.470
 hearts are something like yours 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.600
 Muscle meat words and organs with 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.040
 to prepare the effect that photo 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.720
 100 cats are a bit 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.150
 different in their need for 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.160
 quotes cats almost want to have 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.110
 only free already very little 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.000
 with deposits under against also one 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.280
 Carbohydrates and get a little bit more 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.510
 Therefore, to the side, the peas 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.800
 carrots potatoes or also called 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.910
 before he can prepare again at each 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.580
 I would like to give you another alternative 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.870
 times dry food is anyway 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.910
 the ingredients of dry food 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.680
 then they will show up very quickly 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.270
 recognize the difference and believe there 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.920
 I understand why it is not 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.730
 dry food but only wet food 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.080
 We look at it 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.459
 the big difference of their production 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.290
 Dry foods are his 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.209
 components as the name implies 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.040
 with dry food one works only with 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.630
 dry ingredients typical 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.650
 For example, milk or milk 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.030
 leftovers from meat processing 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.320
 taken and to raise a mail or 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.140
 Bone meal that will be enough and now 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.450
 to paint or fishmeal which will be the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.290
 leftovers taken from fish processing 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.750
 or another of course was rice flour 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.400
 maize flour wheat flour or for the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.269
 minerals and vitamins then too 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.489
 a vitamins and minerals that the 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.640
 individual ingredients and enter the in 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.510
 a village, a kind of meat mail 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.510
 mix rice flour 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.090
 wheat flour weeks, of course, too 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.240
 Fishmeal wants and very important with it 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.870
 after mineral dates have too 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.480
 a vitamins and minerals and there 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.959
 can parents and have ours here 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.000
 mixture of dry so that this 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.010
 mixture of media dry food 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.419
 You'll have to briggs them under high 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.430
 compress pressure in the portals 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.190
 and then arise 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.620
 This frequency protected against damage 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.360
 mix of documents with it 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.770
 enough fed is how it is on 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.690
 finish one more portion fed 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.590
 sprayed that also has the advantage 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.540
 that it tastes better and who wants 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.550
 Of course you can do that in advance 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:45.460
 Add fabrics to make them beautiful 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:47.320
 down they switch so wanted to 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.060
 give impression of the alternative because 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.430
 currently only more than 50 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.190
 percent of our four-legged pets 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.140
 With dry food we are approaching 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.150
 Instead, rather real meat 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.220
 meat as it certainly too 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.729
 can eat at home and at our place 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.260
 butcher or supermarket can buy 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.330
 the preparation is then just us 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.740
 take the meat cut it is 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.410
 small components of trainers 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.669
 possibly by the meat grinder 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.490
 Un-mission only together if that did 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.690
 By the way, the fresh one is guaranteed 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.830
 our meat comes directly from 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.290
 battle cry and then becomes equal 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.000
 edited only exception season 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.860
 The farmers serve meat 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.720
 they do not have to demand the whole thing 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.170
 year to be finished 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.140
 this last single species of meat 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.790
 together the relationship of the free state 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.520
 is then important point that the 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.880
 Final recipe we solve that 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.230
 where we use the nutrients 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.990
 analyze meat species and thereby 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.970
 can calculate exactly what will happen 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.970
 if i have the free states in this 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.340
 We can mix that with us 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.860
 make sure we get out of the exact 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.660
 is properly nourished and with the food 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.520
 All nutrients get at the dog food 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:03.360
 Let's go over a few side dishes 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:06.250
 here we have a few carrots and 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:11.290
 maybe really only very little 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:18.520
 a few peas belong to those around the 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:19.960
 Dear god , we are here now 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.240
 First step we all have ingredients 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.640
 mixed is then cooked with it 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.370
 possible germs are killed and 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.010
 her food also made digestible 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.340
 and then the finished result looks then 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.340
 out 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.260
 I hope you have our little one 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.720
 Cooking lesson and that was for them 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.150
 interesting to see how fit the lining 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.310
 The many work that prepares 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.470
 shopping that's exactly what they think 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.390
 need it as they mix it 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.220
 chop and boil the 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.050
 Everything takes over for you and her 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.120
 need the finished fresh meat 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.160
 food only more to your darling 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.330
 Serve this reasonable wish of him 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.330
 you have a good appetite
