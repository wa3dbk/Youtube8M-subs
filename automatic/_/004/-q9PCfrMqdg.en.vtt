okay<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:24.390> sink<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.140> same<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
okay the sink is the same with the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.710 
okay the sink is the same with the
shoulder<00:01:26.189> halo<00:01:26.430> except<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.509> your

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
shoulder halo except for it's your

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690 
shoulder halo except for it's your
shoulder<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:29.310> you're<00:01:29.520> going

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
shoulder so if you're going

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.289 
shoulder so if you're going
counterclockwise<00:01:30.320> sink<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> left<00:01:31.710> shoulder

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
counterclockwise sink the left shoulder

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.899 
counterclockwise sink the left shoulder
to<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.329> left<00:01:33.479> leg<00:01:34.040> swooping<00:01:35.040> under<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.640> up

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
to the left leg swooping under and up

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.260 
to the left leg swooping under and up
okay<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.439> basically<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.700> how<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.880> kind<00:01:39.119> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
okay so basically this is how I kind of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.480 
okay so basically this is how I kind of
get<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:40.290> prepped<00:01:40.530> for<00:01:40.650> my<00:01:40.860> shoulder<00:01:41.189> halo

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
get I get prepped for my shoulder halo

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.310 
get I get prepped for my shoulder halo
okay<00:01:42.049> usually<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.799> windmill<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.520> on

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
okay usually I do one windmill and on

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.260 
okay usually I do one windmill and on
when<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.009> do<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:48.000> probably

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
when I do this I do it so it's probably

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.999 
when I do this I do it so it's probably
few<00:01:48.450> ways<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.689> doing<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.560> also<00:01:49.740> put<00:01:49.979> my

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
few ways of doing it and I also put my

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.289 
few ways of doing it and I also put my
arm<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.579> I've<00:01:50.759> seen<00:01:50.820> some<00:01:51.210> people

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
arm out like this I've seen some people

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.080 
arm out like this I've seen some people
go<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.490> okay<00:01:53.909> that's<00:01:54.060> just

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
go like this I do this okay that's just

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
go like this I do this okay that's just
me<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.600> could<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.290> probably<00:01:55.920> either<00:01:55.979> way

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
me you could do it probably either way

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.289 
me you could do it probably either way
whatever<00:01:56.369> way<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.640> works<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.880> you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
whatever way it works for you

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.330

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.550 
doing a windmill okay I'll be prepping
my<00:02:05.399> windmill<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.939> before<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.259> shoulder

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
barrel mill right so it's like CI I wash

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.520 
barrel mill right so it's like CI I wash
off<00:02:19.290> my<00:02:19.319> right<00:02:19.769> it's<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:20.819> my<00:02:20.969> head<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.569> then
