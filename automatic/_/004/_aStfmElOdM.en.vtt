00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.449
 so what you need to know about 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.640
 terns is that there are several 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.860
 types of cerny so you have Serbian 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.590
 who are going to be rather brown and others 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.340
 who votes rather violated to blue so this 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.700
 which is my case so how to hide from 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.829
 dark circles 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.110
 the best is to use the color that 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.820
 is opposite so the opposite color 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.829
 with blue collar is orange 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.469
 so what I advise you is 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.690
 to first use a first anti 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.370
 dark circles that will be orange and not too much 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.190
 it does not have to be anyway 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.490
 quite light but a little bit so me 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.120
 personally I use the corrector 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:57.940
 stained yves rock in hues medium 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:01:00.860
 which is still pretty orange and that's it 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.390
 and so we will come well applied 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.460
 so I personally like it 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.979
 work on the finger so we're fine we have 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.560
 applied but really just to 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.840
 places where there is blue not not 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.610
 everywhere so we go back well along 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.390
 a hedge where there is the big week 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.590
 who passes and I was reminded well drunk 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:30.020
 if you want but still covers 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:33.650
 tapping it allows to have a good 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.280
 results so we try to good at 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.950
 stop the edges already we see that it's 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.700
 a little bit better than the other side I 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.700
 do the other side 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:12.330
 we place well under the eye also who can 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:14.069
 to be slightly darker then there by 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.870
 example if I look at myself I see in 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.880
 my mirror I do not know if you will see the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.780
 camera but we still see what 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.540
 which is orange is so I finish the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.010
 product that I have on my hand so there we 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.480
 see that already it started well 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.739
 hide now what are we going to do 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.500
 it's how to use a corrector 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.530
 flesh color so it will barely be more 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.040
 clear that our complexion 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:46.500
 so I use the boeing home 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.170
 profits in shades 0 a so this is 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.319
 that I'm going to remake myself is that I'm going 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:58.650
 always apply to me and over 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:00.390
 the other for 29 well unified actually and 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.130
 so what I'm doing is that I 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.200
 applies in triangle so that is to say 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.660
 from the inner corner of the eye to the eye of 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.989
 nose and we go back up to the bomb have 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.600
 do not either over all the joy but 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:17.579
 it does not allow a triangle of light 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.959
 which numbers because it's really there 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:25.890
 that we have the more than 2 to gravel 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.390
 color level between the accounts of the 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.170
 nest that can be a little bit red 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.170
 as is my case 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.859
 here already we see that it is 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.329
 almost super is missing more than 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.620
 powder is now to do 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.810
 the other side is like 1 goes back well 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.290
 in the corner along a hedge where one 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:54.390
 has the same blue we go well with 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.019
 lower lashes and 1st drawings until 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.019
 corner of the nose 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.950
 I spend a little bit of food because 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.010
 that I have some little redness and 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.430
 here is the result 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.750
 totally hidden farms so after 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.660
 obviously if you said sarah his 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.000
 marks and here we will see again the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.680
 actually because there would be 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.720
 always a shadow but in any case at 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.850
 level of color we little not much 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.430
 do better so now I'm going 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.670
 use my corrector on my small 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.030
 imperfections and on my areas of 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.030
 rash 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.480
 and here we are still worried 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.650
 unified enough thanks to this technique 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.010
 so now he will stay at will 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.180
 all this for all that and 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.870
 normally we should not have 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.870
 of problem
