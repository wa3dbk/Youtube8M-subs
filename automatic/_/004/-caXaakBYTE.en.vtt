about some of the things that you folks
at<00:00:15.030> home<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.209> do<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:16.230> test<00:00:16.500> if<00:00:16.650> your<00:00:16.800> material

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
at home can do to test if your material

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.220 
at home can do to test if your material
is<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.610> fact<00:00:17.849> made<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.180> gold<00:00:18.390> or<00:00:18.599> if<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:18.900> maybe

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
is in fact made of gold or if it's maybe

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.650 
is in fact made of gold or if it's maybe
just<00:00:19.349> gold-plated<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.240> primary

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
just gold-plated one of the primary

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.330 
just gold-plated one of the primary
methods<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.110> we<00:00:22.259> use<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:23.009> do<00:00:23.099> a<00:00:23.130> good

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
methods that we use is to just do a good

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.189 
methods that we use is to just do a good
magnet<00:00:23.640> test<00:00:23.849> here<00:00:24.090> I've<00:00:24.210> got<00:00:24.419> a<00:00:24.660> really

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
magnet test here I've got a really

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.599 
magnet test here I've got a really
strong<00:00:25.560> Nana<00:00:25.800> that's<00:00:25.949> come<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.400> an<00:00:26.490> old

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
strong Nana that's come out of an old

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.519 
strong Nana that's come out of an old
hard<00:00:26.820> drive<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.720> could<00:00:27.840> use<00:00:27.990> any<00:00:28.140> magnet<00:00:28.470> you

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
hard drive you could use any magnet you

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.529 
hard drive you could use any magnet you
have<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> home<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.490> stronger<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.089> better<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
have a home the stronger the better a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.390 
have a home the stronger the better a
lighter<00:00:30.929> magnet<00:00:31.349> probably<00:00:31.650> me<00:00:31.830> may<00:00:32.189> or<00:00:32.339> may

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
lighter magnet probably me may or may

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.680 
lighter magnet probably me may or may
not<00:00:32.430> pick<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:32.879> on<00:00:33.059> some<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.269> the<00:00:33.390> things<00:00:33.570> I'm

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
not pick up on some of the things I'm

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
the stronger your magnet the more more

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.079 
the stronger your magnet the more more
better<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.379> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.589> serve<00:00:37.769> you<00:00:37.949> I've<00:00:38.850> got

this<00:00:42.930> section<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.650> you<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.070> probably<00:00:44.339> see

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
this section here you can probably see

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.259 
this section here you can probably see
most<00:00:46.110> people<00:00:46.460> even<00:00:47.460> ourselves<00:00:47.580> included

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
most people even ourselves included

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:49.789 
most people even ourselves included
sometimes<00:00:48.629> can't<00:00:48.989> even<00:00:49.229> determine<00:00:49.650> what

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:49.799 
sometimes can't even determine what

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.219 
sometimes can't even determine what
which<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.280> these<00:00:50.430> items<00:00:50.940> would<00:00:51.089> be<00:00:51.210> worth<00:00:51.479> care

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
which of these items would be worth care

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.289 
which of these items would be worth care
a<00:00:52.260> great<00:00:52.320> time<00:00:52.710> type<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.220> pricing<00:00:53.940> which<00:00:54.150> would

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
a great time type of pricing which would

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.929 
a great time type of pricing which would
be<00:00:54.390> more<00:00:54.659> of<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.869> costume<00:00:55.290> type<00:00:55.559> pricing<00:00:56.010> one

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:56.939 
be more of a costume type pricing one

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:58.369 
be more of a costume type pricing one
quick<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.330> easy<00:00:57.479> way<00:00:57.659> to<00:00:57.689> determine<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.290> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
quick and easy way to determine is to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.450 
quick and easy way to determine is to
get<00:00:58.500> your<00:00:58.619> magnet<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.189> already<00:00:59.339> mentioned

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
get your magnet as we already mentioned

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.170 
get your magnet as we already mentioned
and<00:01:00.360> just<00:01:00.420> go<00:01:00.720> through<00:01:00.890> kind<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.339> as

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and just go through kind of like this as

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.340 
and just go through kind of like this as
you<00:01:03.299> can<00:01:03.360> see<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> lot<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.839> these<00:01:03.989> items<00:01:04.260> are

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you can see a lot of these items are

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250 
you can see a lot of these items are
gonna<00:01:04.439> pick<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.799> directly<00:01:05.810> now<00:01:06.810> something

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
gonna pick up directly now something

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
gonna pick up directly now something
that<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.040> reason<00:01:08.369> why<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.759> is<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that the reason why we do this is that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.969 
that the reason why we do this is that
gold<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.420> silver<00:01:09.540> themselves<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.740> not

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
gold and silver themselves are not

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
gold and silver themselves are not
magnetic<00:01:11.430> any<00:01:11.939> material<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.750> pick

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
magnetic any material that you can pick

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.720 
magnetic any material that you can pick
up<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> magnet<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.640> know

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
up with a magnet like this you know

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.020 
up with a magnet like this you know
immediately<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.600> me<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.810> costume

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
immediately it's just me the costume

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.010 
immediately it's just me the costume
however<00:01:18.030> there's<00:01:18.300> something<00:01:18.480> else<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.870> bear

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
however there's something else to bear

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.360 
however there's something else to bear
in<00:01:19.140> mind<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.800> what's<00:01:20.070> called<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
in mind that this is what's called a

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.550 
in mind that this is what's called a
negative<00:01:20.550> test<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.300> that<00:01:21.450> means<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.470> if

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
negative test what that means is it if

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560 
negative test what that means is it if
it<00:01:22.770> picks<00:01:23.040> up<00:01:23.190> with<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> magnet<00:01:23.880> most

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it picks up with the magnet most

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.810 
it picks up with the magnet most
definitely<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> made<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> costume<00:01:26.310> material

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
definitely is made a costume material

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.950 
definitely is made a costume material
it's<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.120> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.390> karat<00:01:27.750> great

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it's not going to be karat great

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.240 
it's not going to be karat great
material<00:01:28.440> anything<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.980> that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
material anything like that

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.000 
material anything like that
however<00:01:29.970> I've<00:01:30.720> got<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> couple<00:01:31.260> other<00:01:31.500> items<00:01:31.680> in

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
however I've got a couple other items in

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.770 
however I've got a couple other items in
here<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.550> not<00:01:32.730> magnetic<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.510> chain

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
here that are not magnetic this chain

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170 
here that are not magnetic this chain
right<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.260> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.650> kind<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.920> see<00:01:35.130> where<00:01:35.880> my

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
right here you can kind of see where my

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.080 
right here you can kind of see where my
Banga<00:01:36.450> Tovar<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.900> doesn't<00:01:37.260> really<00:01:37.350> pick<00:01:37.590> up

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
Banga Tovar it doesn't really pick up

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.430 
Banga Tovar it doesn't really pick up
however<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.420> doesn't<00:01:39.630> automatically<00:01:40.200> mean

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
however that doesn't automatically mean

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.990 
however that doesn't automatically mean
that<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.680> material<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.220> made<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.460> karat<00:01:41.820> grade

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that this material is made a karat grade

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.760 
that this material is made a karat grade
material<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.600> also<00:01:42.780> other<00:01:43.110> base<00:01:43.290> metals<00:01:43.650> out

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
material or also other base metals out

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
material or also other base metals out
there<00:01:44.040> such<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.430> copper<00:01:44.850> aluminum<00:01:45.479> magnesium

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
there such as copper aluminum magnesium

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.899 
there such as copper aluminum magnesium
several<00:01:46.890> others<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.190> are<00:01:47.460> also<00:01:47.580> not

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
several others that are also not

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.850 
several others that are also not
magnetic<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:49.080> one<00:01:49.229> thing<00:01:49.440> that<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.620> need<00:01:49.740> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
magnetic so one thing that you need to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.950 
magnetic so one thing that you need to
do<00:01:50.040> after<00:01:50.340> you've<00:01:50.790> already<00:01:51.180> separated<00:01:51.659> those

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
do after you've already separated those

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
do after you've already separated those
pieces<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.440> for<00:01:52.710> example<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.220> our<00:01:53.280> big<00:01:53.490> pile

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
pieces out for example in our big pile

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.280 
pieces out for example in our big pile
here<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.000> determine<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.570> one's<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:54.930> magnetic

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
here I determine this one's not magnetic

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.440 
here I determine this one's not magnetic
so<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.740> set<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> aside<00:01:56.220> bring<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.270> on

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
so I can set that aside bring that on

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.360 
so I can set that aside bring that on
down<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.140> cascade<00:01:58.350> we're<00:01:58.710> finding<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.159> them

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
down to cascade we're finding have them

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.980 
down to cascade we're finding have them
have<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> closer<00:01:59.820> look<00:01:59.940> at<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.960> other

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
have a closer look at it the other

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.800 
have a closer look at it the other
material<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.920> guy<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.970> both<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> rest

if<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:20.920> would<00:02:21.099> just<00:02:21.250> throw<00:02:21.459> this<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.819> with<00:02:21.939> the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
if I would just throw this in with the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.459 
if I would just throw this in with the
mix<00:02:22.239> it'd<00:02:22.359> be<00:02:22.480> pretty<00:02:22.599> hard<00:02:22.719> to<00:02:22.959> determine<00:02:23.230> if

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
mix it'd be pretty hard to determine if

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.170 
mix it'd be pretty hard to determine if
this<00:02:23.620> was<00:02:23.829> actually<00:02:24.250> carried<00:02:24.489> great<00:02:24.640> material
