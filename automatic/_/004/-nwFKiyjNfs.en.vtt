 moment we are letting the tomato 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.770
 go settle and remember that we started 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.780

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.240

 apart today at a premiere a great premiere 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.530
 in this fifth chapter room how 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.280
 we feed ourselves in search of the DNA of 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.280
 Argentine food 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.920
 it is an anthropological work the taste 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.170
 national of the member because we eat 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.240
 both sweet and goodbye how can 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.650

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.759
 males 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.240
 apart from hashish they should do another 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:53.159
 interpretation at the request of the public 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.159
 incredible a bit to see an advance of 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.039
 advances such a feat we started with the most 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:04.200
 important the most important thing to 500 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:10.110
 grams of flour 40 to put more 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.110
 enriched the eggs and 9 more 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.200
 if you do not want to put as many yolks you can 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.989
 use for 5 by 500 grams 5 eggs is 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.470
 all right 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.470
 what we are achieving 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.620
 exactly the same 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.320
 and there we begin to unite is going to continue 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.530
 uniting all this slowly slowly 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.510
 slowly until a mass that does not 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.420
 It is very wet as it said beautifully fresh 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.420

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.270
 olive oil 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.810
 what is important so that it does not lengthen a 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.640
 little secret so that it does not lengthen the juice 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.640
