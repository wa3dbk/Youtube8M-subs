let's<00:04:44.970> open<00:04:45.150> up<00:04:45.240> call<00:04:45.420> of<00:04:45.540> duty<00:04:45.720> 4<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.140> then

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
let's open up call of duty 4 and then

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.960 
let's open up call of duty 4 and then
you<00:04:46.950> guys<00:04:47.070> can<00:04:47.310> go<00:04:47.460> ahead<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.640> pick<00:04:47.820> one<00:04:47.850> up

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
you guys can go ahead and pick one up

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.060 
you guys can go ahead and pick one up
because<00:04:48.120> it's<00:04:48.330> ridiculous<00:04:48.960> quad<00:04:49.800> this<00:04:49.920> is<00:04:50.040> a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
because it's ridiculous quad this is a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.700 
because it's ridiculous quad this is a
quad<00:04:50.310> core<00:04:50.660> this<00:04:51.660> thing<00:04:51.810> is<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:51.960> quad<00:04:52.200> core<00:04:52.440> I

quad core this thing is a quad core I
opening<00:04:53.610> call<00:04:53.790> of<00:04:53.880> duty<00:04:54.060> 4<00:04:54.090> right<00:04:54.360> now<00:04:54.770> look

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
opening call of duty 4 right now look

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.530 
opening call of duty 4 right now look
Claire<00:04:56.040> there<00:04:56.280> oh<00:04:56.630> there<00:04:57.630> we<00:04:57.750> go<00:04:58.040> right<00:04:59.540> let's

guys see what I've got it on here 1600 x

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.350 
guys see what I've got it on here 1600 x
1200<00:05:05.880> +<00:05:06.470> 4<00:05:07.470> X<00:05:07.760> with<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:08.850> filters<00:05:09.180> there

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
1200 + 4 X with the filters there

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.930 
1200 + 4 X with the filters there
alright<00:05:10.200> everything<00:05:10.500> else<00:05:10.650> looks<00:05:10.830> good<00:05:10.940> let's

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
alright everything else looks good let's

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.050 
alright everything else looks good let's
go<00:05:12.060> back<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.480> see<00:05:12.540> how<00:05:12.720> this<00:05:12.840> thing<00:05:13.050> runs<00:05:14.060> you

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
go back and see how this thing runs you

right<00:05:26.460> we're<00:05:26.580> in<00:05:26.640> game<00:05:26.850> i<00:05:27.120> mention<00:05:27.540> this<00:05:27.570> thing

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
right we're in game i mention this thing

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.630 
right we're in game i mention this thing
at<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.960> 250<00:05:28.440> gigabyte<00:05:28.590> hard<00:05:28.920> drive<00:05:29.010> so<00:05:29.610> you

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
at the 250 gigabyte hard drive so you

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.800 
at the 250 gigabyte hard drive so you
will<00:05:29.790> be<00:05:29.820> able<00:05:29.880> to<00:05:30.000> store<00:05:30.210> some<00:05:30.360> games<00:05:30.540> on<00:05:30.690> here

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
will be able to store some games on here

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.730 
will be able to store some games on here
i'm<00:05:31.170> gonna<00:05:31.290> start<00:05:31.440> my<00:05:31.620> fraps<00:05:32.180> test<00:05:33.180> right<00:05:33.420> now

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
i'm gonna start my fraps test right now

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.730 
i'm gonna start my fraps test right now
it's<00:05:34.740> running<00:05:36.050> let<00:05:37.050> me<00:05:37.230> better<00:05:37.470> be<00:05:37.590> a<00:05:37.620> good

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
it's running let me better be a good

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.370 
it's running let me better be a good
benchmark<00:05:38.780> see<00:05:39.780> if<00:05:39.840> i<00:05:39.900> can<00:05:39.990> take<00:05:40.110> these<00:05:40.260> guys

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
benchmark see if i can take these guys

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.700 
benchmark see if i can take these guys
out<00:05:40.590> i<00:05:40.919> get<00:05:41.880> them

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
out i get them

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.470 
out i get them
and<00:05:44.340> one<00:05:44.460> of<00:05:44.490> them<00:05:44.610> where's<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.330> other<00:05:45.420> one

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
and one of them where's the other one

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.300 
and one of them where's the other one
that<00:05:45.660> tell<00:05:45.990> him<00:05:46.080> to<00:05:46.140> come<00:05:46.230> out<00:05:46.380> trying<00:05:47.070> to<00:05:47.130> keep

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
that tell him to come out trying to keep

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.060 
that tell him to come out trying to keep
I<00:05:47.520> can't<00:05:48.150> Oh<00:05:48.240> doing<00:05:49.080> it<00:05:49.170> backwards<00:05:49.320> it's<00:05:49.950> like

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
I can't Oh doing it backwards it's like

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.560 
I can't Oh doing it backwards it's like
funky<00:05:50.400> it's<00:05:50.700> like<00:05:50.820> looking<00:05:51.060> in<00:05:51.180> a<00:05:51.240> mirror<00:05:51.270> yet

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
funky it's like looking in a mirror yet

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.290 
funky it's like looking in a mirror yet
to<00:05:51.660> move<00:05:51.780> backwards<00:05:52.940> I'm<00:05:53.940> sure<00:05:54.090> they're<00:05:54.210> going

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
to move backwards I'm sure they're going

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.750 
to move backwards I'm sure they're going
to<00:05:54.390> appreciate<00:05:54.570> this<00:05:54.870> review<00:05:55.200> over<00:05:55.470> to<00:05:55.760> get

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
to appreciate this review over to get

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.030 
to appreciate this review over to get
them<00:05:56.880> him<00:05:57.540> in<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.720> chin<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:58.140> think<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:58.890> just<00:05:58.950> got

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
them him in the chin I think I just got

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.610 
them him in the chin I think I just got
blowed<00:05:59.280> up<00:06:02.900> let's<00:06:03.900> see<00:06:04.080> let's<00:06:04.320> see<00:06:04.350> if<00:06:04.470> how<00:06:04.560> the

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
blowed up let's see let's see if how the

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.040 
blowed up let's see let's see if how the
benchmark<00:06:05.040> came<00:06:05.340> out<00:06:06.350> I'll<00:06:07.350> tap<00:06:07.650> out<00:06:07.800> of<00:06:07.830> this

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
benchmark came out I'll tap out of this

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:16.040 
benchmark came out I'll tap out of this
call<00:06:10.050> of<00:06:10.170> duty<00:06:10.200> 4<00:06:10.380> 1600<00:06:11.340> 1200<00:06:12.710> Lou<00:06:13.710> that<00:06:15.050> 29.7

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
call of duty 4 1600 1200 Lou that 29.7

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.470 
call of duty 4 1600 1200 Lou that 29.7
67<00:06:16.530> so<00:06:17.220> it's<00:06:17.370> playable<00:06:17.670> I<00:06:17.910> think<00:06:18.210> if<00:06:18.270> I<00:06:18.330> turn

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
67 so it's playable I think if I turn

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.120 
67 so it's playable I think if I turn
off<00:06:18.510> the<00:06:18.720> anti-aliasing<00:06:19.290> I<00:06:19.470> had<00:06:19.590> that<00:06:19.740> at<00:06:19.830> 4x

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
off the anti-aliasing I had that at 4x

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.160 
off the anti-aliasing I had that at 4x
it'll<00:06:20.850> probably<00:06:21.000> even<00:06:21.240> more<00:06:21.360> playable<00:06:21.840> 30

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
it'll probably even more playable 30

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.620 
it'll probably even more playable 30
frames<00:06:22.380> a<00:06:22.470> second<00:06:22.740> is<00:06:23.060> pretty<00:06:24.060> playable<00:06:24.510> and

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
frames a second is pretty playable and

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.480 
frames a second is pretty playable and
then<00:06:24.750> came<00:06:25.140> especially<00:06:25.320> call<00:06:25.830> it<00:06:25.920> 84<00:06:26.280> that's<00:06:26.430> a

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
then came especially call it 84 that's a

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.340 
then came especially call it 84 that's a
fun<00:06:26.670> game<00:06:26.850> so<00:06:27.060> yeah<00:06:27.510> this<00:06:27.660> thing<00:06:27.870> pack<00:06:28.110> some

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
fun game so yeah this thing pack some

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.860 
fun game so yeah this thing pack some
