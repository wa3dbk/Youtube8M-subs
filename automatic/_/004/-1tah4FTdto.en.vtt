same guys maybe if you got a different
controller<00:03:57.760> things<00:03:58.600> will<00:03:58.750> be<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.900> bit

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
controller things will be a bit

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.440 
controller things will be a bit
different<00:03:59.410> like<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.430> said<00:04:00.640> as<00:04:00.790> long<00:04:00.820> as<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.269> has

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
different like I said as long as it has

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.550 
different like I said as long as it has
the<00:04:01.480> Xbox<00:04:02.140> driver<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:03.579> can<00:04:03.820> see<00:04:04.090> all<00:04:04.450> our

pretty<00:04:08.380> epic<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.640> is<00:04:09.850> very<00:04:10.420> easy<00:04:10.750> to

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
pretty epic and it is very easy to

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.430 
pretty epic and it is very easy to
switch<00:04:11.799> over<00:04:12.190> from<00:04:12.340> console<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.420> PC<00:04:14.019> doing

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
switch over from console to PC doing

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.270 
switch over from console to PC doing
this<00:04:14.620> but<00:04:15.340> anyway<00:04:15.760> um<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.989> next<00:04:17.290> step<00:04:17.739> guys<00:04:18.010> is

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
this but anyway um the next step guys is

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
as you can see my sensitivity is quite

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.540 
as you can see my sensitivity is quite
fast<00:04:22.180> I'm<00:04:22.690> going<00:04:23.140> to<00:04:23.229> show<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.770> default

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
fast I'm going to show you the default

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.450 
fast I'm going to show you the default
that<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:24.880> get

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
that you get

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.960 
that you get
than<00:04:25.610> once<00:04:26.360> doing<00:04:27.319> this<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:27.919> all<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.759> really

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
than once doing this so all you really

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.650 
than once doing this so all you really
need<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.449> put<00:04:29.660> in<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:30.110> input<00:04:30.949> and<00:04:31.389> then<00:04:32.389> you<00:04:32.509> can

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
need to put in is input and then you can

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.070 
need to put in is input and then you can
see<00:04:32.870> down<00:04:33.289> about<00:04:34.069> eight<00:04:34.970> slots<00:04:35.599> you'll<00:04:35.870> see

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
see down about eight slots you'll see

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.309 
see down about eight slots you'll see
sensitivity<00:04:37.009> so<00:04:37.789> we<00:04:37.910> do<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.419> actually<00:04:39.110> I

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
sensitivity so we do that actually I

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.770 
sensitivity so we do that actually I
need<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.250> do<00:04:40.490> this<00:04:40.639> while<00:04:40.880> pause<00:04:41.479> so<00:04:42.380> we<00:04:42.860> go<00:04:43.099> the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
need to do this while pause so we go the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.400 
need to do this while pause so we go the
sensitivity<00:04:44.780> one<00:04:45.520> input<00:04:46.520> view<00:04:47.410> sensitivity

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
sensitivity one input view sensitivity

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.969 
sensitivity one input view sensitivity
and<00:04:48.650> then<00:04:49.340> we<00:04:49.580> want<00:04:49.970> it<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.419> be<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:51.530> think

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
and then we want it to be I think

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:59.680 
and then we want it to be I think
default<00:04:52.639> is<00:04:54.729> 2.0<00:04:56.889> and<00:04:58.389> let's<00:04:59.389> see<00:04:59.539> what

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
default is 2.0 and let's see what

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.460 
default is 2.0 and let's see what
happens<00:05:00.080> here

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
happens here

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.370 
happens here
yeah<00:05:01.460> so<00:05:01.729> you<00:05:01.820> can<00:05:01.940> see<00:05:02.090> my<00:05:02.300> sensitivity<00:05:02.840> is

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
yeah so you can see my sensitivity is

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.029 
yeah so you can see my sensitivity is
quite<00:05:03.949> low<00:05:04.370> guys<00:05:04.849> and<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:06.080> was<00:05:06.289> quite<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.680> pain

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
quite low guys and it was quite a pain

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.279 
quite low guys and it was quite a pain
in<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.310> ass<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.940> me<00:05:08.090> first<00:05:08.690> using<00:05:09.199> this

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
in the ass to me first using this

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.170 
in the ass to me first using this
command<00:05:09.650> because<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:10.009> wasn't<00:05:10.430> aware<00:05:10.639> of<00:05:10.910> the

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
command because I wasn't aware of the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.040 
command because I wasn't aware of the
change<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.960> sensitivity<00:05:12.770> but<00:05:13.580> this<00:05:14.360> varies

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
change of sensitivity but this varies

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.279 
change of sensitivity but this varies
quite<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.530> lot<00:05:15.919> and<00:05:16.130> you<00:05:16.340> can<00:05:16.550> go<00:05:16.789> from<00:05:17.289> actually

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
quite a lot and you can go from actually

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.960 
quite a lot and you can go from actually
one<00:05:18.889> point<00:05:19.340> one<00:05:19.759> two<00:05:20.419> five<00:05:21.130> I<00:05:22.130> think<00:05:22.849> which

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
one point one two five I think which

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.999 
one point one two five I think which
I've<00:05:23.150> never<00:05:23.419> actually<00:05:23.599> tried<00:05:24.199> but<00:05:24.590> we<00:05:24.710> might

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
I've never actually tried but we might

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.770 
I've never actually tried but we might
do<00:05:25.400> it<00:05:25.550> right<00:05:25.849> here<00:05:26.830> 5.0<00:05:28.210> now<00:05:29.210> this<00:05:29.509> is<00:05:29.630> going

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
do it right here 5.0 now this is going

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.589 
do it right here 5.0 now this is going
to<00:05:29.840> be<00:05:30.020> ridiculous<00:05:30.710> guys<00:05:31.270> whoa

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
to be ridiculous guys whoa

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.510 
to be ridiculous guys whoa
so<00:05:33.020> you've<00:05:33.199> nearly<00:05:33.440> got<00:05:33.680> mouse<00:05:34.099> sensitivity

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
so you've nearly got mouse sensitivity

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.779 
so you've nearly got mouse sensitivity
now<00:05:35.120> so<00:05:35.720> anyway<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.440> has<00:05:36.680> been<00:05:36.949> my<00:05:37.159> tutorial

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
now so anyway that has been my tutorial

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.020 
now so anyway that has been my tutorial
on<00:05:37.940> how<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.360> use<00:05:38.570> an<00:05:39.080> Xbox<00:05:39.919> controller<00:05:40.220> on

world at war PC it's pretty good guys it
is<00:05:45.080> really<00:05:45.860> really<00:05:46.219> useful<00:05:46.610> a<00:05:47.000> lot<00:05:47.210> better

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
is really really useful a lot better

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:48.879 
is really really useful a lot better
than<00:05:47.659> using<00:05:47.870> xpadder

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
than using xpadder
