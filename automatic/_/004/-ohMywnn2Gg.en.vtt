00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
as best as I could but I did think it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.789 
as best as I could but I did think it
came<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.640> pretty<00:01:35.880> good<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:37.079> don't<00:01:37.740> think

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
came out pretty good I don't think

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.609 
came out pretty good I don't think
there's<00:01:38.159> too<00:01:38.460> many<00:01:38.579> flaws<00:01:41.509> yeah<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
there's too many flaws yeah and there is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.940 
there's too many flaws yeah and there is
you<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:45.090> thing<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.990> basically<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> mini

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
you see this thing is basically a mini

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.580 
you see this thing is basically a mini
version<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> Wraith<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.960> basically<00:01:49.200> it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
version of the Wraith this basically it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.920 
version of the Wraith this basically it
is<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.070> got<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> plasma<00:01:50.790> cannon<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
is it's got a plasma cannon it's just a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.990 
is it's got a plasma cannon it's just a
little<00:01:52.200> weaker<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.250> still<00:01:53.369> take<00:01:53.700> out

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
little weaker but it can still take out

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.039 
little weaker but it can still take out
a<00:01:54.329> person<00:01:54.930> or<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.140> Spartan<00:01:55.770> or<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.329> grunt<00:01:57.329> or<00:01:57.600> I

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
a person or a Spartan or a grunt or I

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.130 
a person or a Spartan or a grunt or I
think<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> brute<00:01:59.009> maybe<00:01:59.570> but<00:02:01.460> definitely<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
think a brute maybe but definitely not a

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.600 
think a brute maybe but definitely not a
hunter<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:04.860> take<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.159> three<00:02:05.430> shots

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
hunter that would take like three shots

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.869 
hunter that would take like three shots
but<00:02:06.000> anyways<00:02:07.429> definitely<00:02:08.429> some<00:02:08.580> unique

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
but anyways definitely some unique

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.809 
but anyways definitely some unique
designs<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.539> this

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
designs on this

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.119 
designs on this
and<00:02:10.119> i<00:02:10.299> found<00:02:10.569> out<00:02:10.749> all<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.469> pieces<00:02:11.680> were

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
and i found out all the pieces were

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.610 
and i found out all the pieces were
available<00:02:12.459> on<00:02:12.939> break<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.870> brick<00:02:14.079> so<00:02:14.379> that<00:02:14.530> was

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
available on break a brick so that was

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.059 
available on break a brick so that was
really<00:02:14.650> good<00:02:15.659> so<00:02:16.659> i<00:02:16.689> went<00:02:16.870> out<00:02:17.109> went<00:02:17.560> ahead<00:02:17.680> got
