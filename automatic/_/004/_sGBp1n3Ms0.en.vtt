around<00:01:51.160> a<00:01:51.310> bit<00:01:51.460> more<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:52.210> mean<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.690> feels

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
around a bit more and I I mean it feels

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.810 
around a bit more and I I mean it feels
to<00:01:53.140> me<00:01:53.170> like<00:01:53.259> I<00:01:53.560> got<00:01:53.770> bumped<00:01:54.159> in<00:01:54.250> one<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.610> two

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820

and then I kind of slid up the track and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.109 
and then I kind of slid up the track and
I<00:01:56.470> was<00:01:56.590> a<00:01:56.619> little<00:01:56.920> loose<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.429> kink<00:01:57.670> anyway
