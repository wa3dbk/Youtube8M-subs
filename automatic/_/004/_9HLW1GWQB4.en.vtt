loaned us a couple phones here the Lumia
i<00:00:34.680> should<00:00:35.640> say<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> nokia<00:00:36.360> lumia<00:00:36.890> 1020<00:00:37.890> vs<00:00:38.820> the

i should say the nokia lumia 1020 vs the
nokia<00:00:39.809> lumia<00:00:40.309> 920<00:00:41.309> right<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.059> put<00:00:42.210> these<00:00:42.390> two

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
nokia lumia 920 right to put these two

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.270 
nokia lumia 920 right to put these two
ears<00:00:42.870> head<00:00:43.110> edge<00:00:43.760> or<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> see<00:00:45.030> who<00:00:45.210> wins<00:00:46.280> let's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
ears head edge or to see who wins let's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.340 
ears head edge or to see who wins let's
check<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.730> okay<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.629> there's<00:00:48.989> not<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
check it out okay so there's not one of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.290 
check it out okay so there's not one of
different<00:00:49.770> benchmarking<00:00:50.370> apps<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.940> are

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
different benchmarking apps that are

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.910 
different benchmarking apps that are
really<00:00:51.510> consistent<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.260> work<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.739> both

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
really consistent that work with both

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.660 
really consistent that work with both
phones<00:00:53.280> actually<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.620> Nokia's<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.550> we

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
phones actually on the to Nokia's so we

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.299 
phones actually on the to Nokia's so we
have<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> nokia<00:00:57.180> lumia<00:00:57.660> 1020<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:59.129> we're

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
have the nokia lumia 1020 here we're

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.700 
have the nokia lumia 1020 here we're
using<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.670> wp<00:01:00.390> benchmark<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> one

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
using the wp benchmark it's the one

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.799 
using the wp benchmark it's the one
benchmark<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.579> seems<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> work<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.420> both

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
benchmark that seems to work on both

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.560 
benchmark that seems to work on both
devices<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.799> measure<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.570> we

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
devices so we can measure them and we

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.929 
devices so we can measure them and we
have<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> speed<00:01:07.830> tests<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.460> course<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.790> can

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
have the speed tests of course you can

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.789 
have the speed tests of course you can
see<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.640> Lumia<00:01:11.640> 920<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.049> we're<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:13.710> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
see on the Lumia 920 so we're going to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380 
see on the Lumia 920 so we're going to
take<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> look<00:01:14.130> at<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> CPU

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
take a look at here is the CPU

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
pretty interesting how that came out on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.520 
pretty interesting how that came out on
the<00:01:53.070> scores<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.670> both<00:01:54.360> these<00:01:54.540> devices<00:01:54.869> was

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the scores on both these devices was

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.830 
the scores on both these devices was
kind<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.740> interesting<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.340> WP<00:01:56.969> bench<00:01:57.240> actually

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
kind of interesting is WP bench actually

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.870 
kind of interesting is WP bench actually
gave<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> higher<00:01:58.500> score<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.979> 920<00:01:59.549> than<00:01:59.729> the

gave a higher score the 920 than the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.510 
gave a higher score the 920 than the
1020<00:02:00.479> maybe<00:02:01.380> there's<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.649> more<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.369> on

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
1020 maybe there's just more going on

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.810 
1020 maybe there's just more going on
the<00:02:03.360> published<00:02:03.689> speed<00:02:03.960> tests<00:02:04.380> came<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.829> at<00:02:04.979> 219

the<00:02:12.159> 10<00:02:12.790> 20<00:02:13.180> or<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.840> 920<00:02:14.379> I<00:02:14.409> should<00:02:14.620> say<00:02:14.830> of

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
the 10 20 or the 920 I should say of

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.699 
the 10 20 or the 920 I should say of
course<00:02:15.629> maybe<00:02:16.629> it's<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:17.140> faster<00:02:17.590> better

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
course maybe it's just a faster better

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.680 
course maybe it's just a faster better
thing<00:02:18.190> but<00:02:18.519> that's<00:02:18.700> how<00:02:18.909> our<00:02:19.030> benchmarking<00:02:19.569> is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
thing but that's how our benchmarking is

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.170 
thing but that's how our benchmarking is
coming<00:02:19.989> out<00:02:20.080> between<00:02:20.319> these<00:02:20.650> two<00:02:20.830> devices

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
coming out between these two devices

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.850 
coming out between these two devices
okay<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.239> now<00:02:22.569> here<00:02:23.110> what<00:02:23.349> we've<00:02:23.500> done<00:02:23.650> is

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
okay so now here what we've done is

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.800 
okay so now here what we've done is
we've<00:02:24.010> run<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.250> multi<00:02:24.670> bench<00:02:24.909> two<00:02:25.239> scores<00:02:25.599> on

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
both these devices to see how they came

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.000 
both these devices to see how they came
out<00:02:27.849> they<00:02:27.909> came<00:02:28.209> out<00:02:28.330> fairly<00:02:28.660> similar<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.590> CPU

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
wonderful phone versus the 920 is also a

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.680 
wonderful phone versus the 920 is also a
great<00:03:21.370> phone<00:03:21.579> we've<00:03:21.760> definitely<00:03:22.389> like<00:03:22.660> the
