00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
start with a good pizza sauce and I like

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.170 
start with a good pizza sauce and I like
to<00:04:44.590> add<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.740> little<00:04:44.979> bit<00:04:45.159> more<00:04:45.340> sauce<00:04:45.610> on<00:04:45.909> to

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
to add a little bit more sauce on to

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.790 
to add a little bit more sauce on to
this<00:04:46.270> especially<00:04:46.659> being<00:04:47.020> on<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.530> grill

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
this especially being on the grill

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.100 
this especially being on the grill
because<00:04:48.789> you're<00:04:48.970> not<00:04:49.180> going<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.570> have<00:04:49.780> like

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
because you're not going to have like

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.200 
because you're not going to have like
the<00:04:50.349> convection<00:04:51.250> cell<00:04:51.490> where<00:04:51.699> it's<00:04:51.849> going<00:04:52.060> to

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
the convection cell where it's going to

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.120 
the convection cell where it's going to
leave<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:52.870> a<00:04:52.930> little<00:04:53.080> bit<00:04:53.320> more<00:04:53.440> doughy<00:04:53.800> in<00:04:54.039> the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
leave it a little bit more doughy in the

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.040 
leave it a little bit more doughy in the
center<00:04:54.430> so<00:04:54.610> this<00:04:54.789> helps<00:04:55.120> soften<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.810> top<00:04:56.020> a

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
center so this helps soften the top a

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.870 
center so this helps soften the top a
little<00:04:56.260> bit<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:59.250> then<00:05:00.250> we're<00:05:00.490> gonna<00:05:00.580> add<00:05:00.849> our

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
little bit and then we're gonna add our

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.670 
little bit and then we're gonna add our
cheese<00:05:03.599> now<00:05:04.599> for<00:05:04.930> if<00:05:05.110> you<00:05:05.229> wanted<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.590> add

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
cheese now for if you wanted to add

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.129 
cheese now for if you wanted to add
Parmesan<00:05:06.370> cheese<00:05:06.699> I<00:05:06.849> do<00:05:06.940> recommend<00:05:07.539> to<00:05:07.900> wait

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
Parmesan cheese I do recommend to wait

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.189 
Parmesan cheese I do recommend to wait
until<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.949> very<00:05:09.159> end<00:05:09.280> for<00:05:09.699> that<00:05:09.780> because<00:05:10.780> that

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
until the very end for that because that

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.320 
until the very end for that because that
cheese<00:05:11.590> is<00:05:11.889> going<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.430> melt<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.849> little<00:05:13.180> bit

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
cheese is going to melt a little bit

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.360 
cheese is going to melt a little bit
faster<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.139> it<00:05:14.740> also<00:05:15.659> can<00:05:16.659> tend<00:05:17.199> to<00:05:17.289> brown<00:05:17.530> so

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
faster and it also can tend to brown so

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.330 
faster and it also can tend to brown so
I<00:05:18.400> would<00:05:18.699> just<00:05:18.820> wait<00:05:19.030> till<00:05:19.210> afterwards<00:05:20.340> and

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
I would just wait till afterwards and

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.910 
I would just wait till afterwards and
we're<00:05:21.490> gonna<00:05:21.580> add<00:05:21.760> some<00:05:22.060> mushrooms<00:05:22.300> on<00:05:22.810> here

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:37.890 

some<00:05:30.540> pepperoni<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:36.360> as<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.540> can<00:05:37.690> see<00:05:37.870> I

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
some pepperoni and as you can see I

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.420 
some pepperoni and as you can see I
didn't<00:05:38.200> add<00:05:38.350> too<00:05:38.380> much<00:05:38.830> cheese<00:05:39.130> right<00:05:39.400> now

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
didn't add too much cheese right now

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.920 
didn't add too much cheese right now
because<00:05:39.760> when<00:05:40.030> I<00:05:40.060> pull<00:05:40.360> this<00:05:40.480> off<00:05:40.630> we're<00:05:40.840> gonna
