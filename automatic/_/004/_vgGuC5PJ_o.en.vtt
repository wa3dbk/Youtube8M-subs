 the children that we have at home today are men and women 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.350
 that within a few decades 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 will drive this country 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.460
 but nevertheless 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.460
 for many reasons some questions arise 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.280

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.270
 a melancholy and sometimes to the complaint about the crisis of values ​​in the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.270
 young boys 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.960
 however the new generations that we have 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 they are the product of work done by adults 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.770
 the future of civilization 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.800
 It depends on how we handle this crisis 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.630
 because as parents we are forming 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.740
 to the next generation of men and women 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.740
 that will be conducted as north and integrity 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.780
 they will leave 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.780
 what they have inherited 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.100
 the nations populated mostly 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.100
 immature and immoral men and women 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.369
 in this context 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.679
 the center of family formation of parents to children arises 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.899
 with a great moral and social responsibility 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.579

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.229
 so that the new generations of leaders 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.389
 lead this nation with moral firmness 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.389
 and intellectual quality 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.219

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.089
 to prepare the sophomores and women who have children 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:03.089

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.309
 or be a mother 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:31.919
 that is why we are working from the platform that has the greatest power of 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.229
 convocation of fathers and mothers 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.229
 the schools 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.049
 the school is the institution 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.999
 that has the ability to bring parents together 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.290

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.220

 the work of the family formation center from parents to children 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.129
 It is aimed at suppliers the need shown by many educational centers 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.650
 to have a good tool for parents 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.500
 so that they can train their children in an integral way 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:59.340
 the experience and our work with families 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.370
 confirms that the best way to prepare parents is through courses 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.370
 structured and specialized 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.009
 that's why we have a curriculum 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.559
 which includes courses 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:59.650
 that develop annually 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.949
 following a methodology according to the needs of parents 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.949
 and school programming 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.909
 each course contains seven elections of an hour and a half duration 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.430
 we use illustrative videos 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.569
 and at the end of each election, parents are given a simple but very useful 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.620
 homework you will do at home with your children 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.649
 this task will be delivered at the next meeting 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:05.309
 to be used by the corresponding areas of the school 

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:09.049
