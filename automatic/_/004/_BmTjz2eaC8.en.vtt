00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.410
 I'm franziska keller, I was the director of 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.470
 dance dance upside down for 10 years 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.540
 a company that made a cross between the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.210
 audiovisual apparatus construction 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.039
 audiovisual and contemporary dance today 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.309
 day I'm making a symbolic closure 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.290
 of that process by doing an exercise on 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.360
 scene with my valentine brother with the 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.520
 I'm only a year apart 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.620
 of age and that coincidentally both 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.780
 We decided to study contemporary dance 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.969
 in our first university race 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.460
 and building a discourse through 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.550
 graphic file about the photograph and 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.469
 how that material can build a 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.780
 scenic speech based on a 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.789
 improvisation I'm working with the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.030
 new media and medial art through 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.699
 of software and audiovisual projections 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.210
 that are building the scenic space 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.969
 migrant is a work that 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.299
 that talks about migration on the 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:11.350
 migration in our country chile and about 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:16.740
 all of that migrant body that body 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.860
 that moves that changes that adapt 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.159
 that swapped and that suffers consequences 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 due to his decision to emigrate and back 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.960
 be a desire an individual objective of 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.869
 that same body to finally talk 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.020
 that all of us came to a 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.549
 great migration and for me I call the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.549
 last migration that is the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.880
 the migration of life 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.620
 It's a pleasure for me to be participating 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.900
 of the Sala Arrau cycle is I think very 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.000
 interesting to enable spaces within 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.210
 the classical theaters for dance 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.620
 contemporary contemporary art I think 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.380
 that is building new speeches 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.750
 creative people who are much closer 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.460
 to the world of the cndr or maybe to what 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.860
 we used to see in festivals 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.980
 hoff and that is allowing to open 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.530
 instances of dialogue between creators 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.360
 and good for me or for the group of a 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.230
 very important place because we 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.330
 also as how 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.700
 the group 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.950
 of a dancer and I as a choreographer 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.510
 we also feel that paradoxically 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.800
 we are doing an act of migration 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.800
 inside this municipal theater 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.480
 I invite the whole world of dance 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.790
 contemporary medial art the new 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.860
 means and also to brothers' partners 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.960
 who want to play a little with us 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.840
 in a speech that is being built 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.910
 day by day and that allows us to investigate 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.070
 like the files and the material 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.530
 the one who is in our house 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.320
 it can be the engine for the construction of 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.850
 a creative experience so very 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.380
 cordially invited because it is 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.320
 doing a super honest job 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.110
 from our point of view towards what 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.270
 what is that body that emigrates 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.280
 that suits me personally 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.480
 I also think that all of us 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.910
 we have that feeling of that spirit of 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.640
 migrant within ourselves 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.810
 It is also not something alien and I think not 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.810
 it involves everyone
