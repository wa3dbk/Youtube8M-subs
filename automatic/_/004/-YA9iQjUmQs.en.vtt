on<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> dry<00:00:25.080> bag<00:00:25.320> why<00:00:26.220> most<00:00:26.490> waterproof<00:00:27.240> zippers

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
on a dry bag why most waterproof zippers

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.279 
on a dry bag why most waterproof zippers
that<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> market<00:00:29.720> are<00:00:30.720> made<00:00:30.990> with

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
that are out in the market are made with

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.180 
that are out in the market are made with
a<00:00:31.430> specific<00:00:32.430> kind<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.790> metal<00:00:33.450> chain<00:00:33.950> that<00:00:34.950> kind

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
a specific kind of metal chain that kind

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.060 
a specific kind of metal chain that kind
of<00:00:35.309> zipper<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:35.880> since<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> 1950s<00:00:37.110> but

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
of zipper is out since the 1950s but

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.920 
of zipper is out since the 1950s but
that<00:00:39.059> zipper<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.450> quite<00:00:39.809> heavy<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.379> stiff<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
that zipper is quite heavy and stiff and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.380 
that zipper is quite heavy and stiff and
takes<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.050> lot<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.399> force<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.730> open<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.149> close

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
takes a lot of force to open and close

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.410 
takes a lot of force to open and close
so<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.200> was<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:47.160> fitting<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.879> bag

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
so it was not really fitting for bag

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.060 
so it was not really fitting for bag
because<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> stuff<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.860> would

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
because that's the stuff that I would

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
because that's the stuff that I would
have<00:00:50.160> had<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.550> dry<00:00:50.850> suit<00:00:51.120> from<00:00:51.329> 1980<00:00:51.870> right

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
have had on my dry suit from 1980 right

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.799 
have had on my dry suit from 1980 right
yes<00:00:52.500> yes<00:00:52.890> very<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.670> yes<00:00:53.969> yes<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:55.140> now<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:56.809> we

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
yes yes very like yes yes so now then we

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
yes yes very like yes yes so now then we
came<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.079> with<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> idea<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> make<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.219> very

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
came up with the idea to make a very

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.100 
came up with the idea to make a very
flexible<00:00:59.699> new<00:01:00.359> type<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.989> troye<00:01:01.590> zipper<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
flexible new type of troye zipper and

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.870 
flexible new type of troye zipper and
this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> result<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.640> has

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
this is the result you see so this has

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.340 
this is the result you see so this has
no<00:01:06.180> metal<00:01:06.750> parts<00:01:07.140> yeah<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:09.350> plastic

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
no metal parts yeah this is plastic

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.399 
no metal parts yeah this is plastic
basically<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> polyurethane<00:01:11.580> compound<00:01:12.409> and

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
basically a polyurethane compound and

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.749 
basically a polyurethane compound and
this<00:01:13.740> zipper<00:01:14.509> has<00:01:15.509> an<00:01:15.689> internal<00:01:16.049> seal<00:01:16.759> which

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
this zipper has an internal seal which

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.810 
this zipper has an internal seal which
is<00:01:17.790> closed<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.720> held<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.170> space<00:01:19.560> forever<00:01:20.250> by

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
is closed and held in space forever by

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.030 
is closed and held in space forever by
the<00:01:20.880> coupling<00:01:21.840> elements<00:01:22.320> surrounding<00:01:22.530> it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the coupling elements surrounding it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.480 
the coupling elements surrounding it
interesting<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.500> therefore<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.159> very

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
interesting so therefore this is a very

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.140 
interesting so therefore this is a very
flexible<00:01:27.030> zipper<00:01:27.720> quite<00:01:28.680> lightweight

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
flexible zipper quite lightweight

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.470 
flexible zipper quite lightweight
pretty<00:01:30.360> easy<00:01:30.480> to<00:01:30.780> pull<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:32.030> completely<00:01:33.030> water

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
pretty easy to pull and completely water

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.230 
pretty easy to pull and completely water
drink<00:01:34.290> not<00:01:34.530> water-resistant<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.760> all<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
drink not water-resistant like all the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.510 
drink not water-resistant like all the
tons<00:01:36.480> of<00:01:36.660> zips<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.260> can<00:01:37.440> find<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:37.860> on

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
tons of zips that you can find right on

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.570 
tons of zips that you can find right on
time<00:01:38.790> because<00:01:38.910> this<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.720> really<00:01:40.290> water<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
time because this is really water and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.330 
time because this is really water and
air<00:01:41.880> times<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.960> test<00:01:43.260> these<00:01:43.560> zippers<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
air times we test these zippers with the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.680 
air times we test these zippers with the
500<00:01:44.850> millibar<00:01:45.740> each<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.490> our<00:01:48.150> factory

ago yeah and in early early this yes we
started<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.060> develop<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.260> more

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
started to develop this a little more

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.850 
started to develop this a little more
than<00:02:04.650> five<00:02:04.860> years<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.780> went<00:02:06.990> through<00:02:07.619> many

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
than five years and we went through many
