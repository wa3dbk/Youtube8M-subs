00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.639
 there is always a problem with the city 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 parking spaces 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.000
 auto load conditions find yourself 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.070
 places not an easy task 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.119
 gently park the car and more 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.100
 more complicated 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.570
 here comes the device 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.220
 thanks to which to be taught 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.220
 masterly can even beginner 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.790
 generally reverse one of the most dangerous 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.219
 maneuvers for any driver first 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.070
 visibility back limited in second 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.969
 walking and from behind backwards 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.340
 unnatural for human 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.010
 natures of the third all that is behind 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.590
 at the genetic level is perceived 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.960
 how danger car manufacturers 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.850
 understand this feature long ago 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.699
 working on systems and enhancements 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.440
 safety and reversing exactly 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.120
 for this purpose now many 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.649
 motorists own 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.460
 set on their transport 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.579
 facilities 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.439
 Parktronic and Rear View Cameras Market 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.130
 many models of rear cameras are presented 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.030
 species differ not in the main body 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.530
 method of mounting in 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.810
 brand dependent cars 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.939
 Different cameras are used respectively 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 but you need to understand where it will be 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.829
 transfer image from camera 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.680
 rear view 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.770
 as an option, this rearview mirror with 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.289
 by monitor 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.509
 individual monitors either 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.670
 multimedia head units 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.280
 which most often set 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.350
 the last time this is the convenience 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.210
 rear view camera with monitor not 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.909
 just report the presence of some 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.759
 unidentified interference behind the stern of the car she 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.890
 this hindrance also shows accordingly 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.170
 it's easier for the driver to act cleanly 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.110
 psychologically he doesn't see by touch 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.880
 and has some kind of field for review follows 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.130
 also consider what to cope with 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.789
 installing a similar camera car owner 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.770
 will be able 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.439
 and on their own especially for this 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.270
 no need to make a hole in the back 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.519
 the bumper is installed very simply 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.989
 here 4 latches we turn them down and on 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.900
 regular rearview mirror 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:21.650
 we attach and we connect this wire 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:24.840
 hiding under the upholstery under the ceiling and 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.000
 all this so tightly insert this 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.970
 procedure for connecting the camera to the mirror 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.280
 is probably about an hour with probably 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.620
 the advent of a compact camcorder and camera 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.750
 monitors install such a device 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.060
 it became much easier as 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.370
 technology development and so little 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.239
 the cost of that today installing the camera 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.600
 rear view 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.250
 cheaper parking sensors installation 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.850
 average camera within 3000 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.850
 rubles 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.620
 they differ in body material 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.540
 Recommendations to install the camera in 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.980
 metal case since they 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.189
 better protected from atmospheric 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.799
 impacts is the most common 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.400
 monitor installation method is just quick and 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.769
 inexpensively 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.079
 possible installation options in 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.569
 DVR recorder and even 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.180
 The smartphone is often installed in 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.129
 a mirror when itâ€™s not possible to replace 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.049
 put the head unit 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.549
 multimedia if in the car already 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.819
 multimedia device present 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.150
 it is more logical of course to connect the camera to 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.849
 him 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.620
 the camera itself is set above the license plate 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.720
 car sign to 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.220
 reduce the dead zone and get 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.919
 the widest coverage 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.139
 rearview camera more precisely the monitor itself 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:45.730
 a capricious thing so for not needed 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:49.359
 special care and most often the camera goes 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.120
 out of order when washing a car if 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:55.000
 plastic camera 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.290
 accordingly sufficient protection from water 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.010
 low and when hit by a jet of kirchera 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.310
 powerful automatic 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.459
 the camera is flooded with water to save 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.739
 You can close some plastic 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.080
 the package as a whole if the camera has 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.080
 good protection subscribe from 7 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.359
 metal, respectively, the water in it 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.680
 she misses hermetically from practice 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.290
 metal camera case never 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.360
 changed another way quickly and 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.000
 neatly park the car 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.070
 parking sensors parking radar measures 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.320
 the distance between your car and 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.050
 other objects nearby 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.240
 when used it is essential 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.330
 reduced chance of damage when 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.340
 parking your car or someone else's 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.470
 moreover parking in the yard or near 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.810
 the playground you are insured against 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.270
 probabilities that near the rear bumper 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.060
 car may be for example 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.970
 a small child considering that he is with 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.160
 repair bumper us often exceeds 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.160
 that he with a PDC installation 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.680
 naturally better to put parking sensors 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.970
 Besides 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.380
 how would this kind of comfort 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.160
 man reversing and having 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.539
 some warning signals already 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.449
 understand that it is comfortable and convenient for him 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.150
 and accordingly retains its 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.220
 car parking sensor installation 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.440
 on their own will not be difficult 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.050
 but it should be borne in mind that 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.300
 improper sensor installation will result 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.460
 to their constant reaction to harmless 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.860
 interference is likely 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.810
 skip the wall or table correctly 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.360
 you can put the sensors on 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.099
 every front end car like 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.320
 panel rule 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.169
 or installed on the glass in the area 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.320
 mirror either 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:53.430
 are located in the back of the car 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:57.060
 so that the driver will see 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.310
 reflected mirror 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.690
 Parktronic monitor 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:07.479
 the sensors themselves are installed in the bumper 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.169
 many motorists argue what to choose 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.840
 parking sensors 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.580
 or a rearview camera is our opinion that 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.620
 if you really have problems with 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.050
 parking a car and you seriously 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.840
 worry about your and others 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.370
 security, put both 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.560
 choose what suits you and your 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.780
 wallet well, I will say goodbye to you 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.780
 careful parking good luck
