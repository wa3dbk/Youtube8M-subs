00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.210 
sauce so what we do then pan on so
another<00:03:04.370> butter<00:03:04.640> into<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.030> pan<00:03:06.100> still<00:03:07.100> it

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
another butter into the pan still it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.370 
another butter into the pan still it
will<00:03:07.310> drizzle<00:03:08.299> of<00:03:08.690> oil<00:03:10.750> I'm<00:03:11.750> going<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:11.989> add<00:03:12.110> a

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
will drizzle of oil I'm going to add a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.380 
will drizzle of oil I'm going to add a
little<00:03:12.680> splash<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:14.260> wine<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.269> the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
little splash of wine and this is the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.500 
little splash of wine and this is the
same<00:03:17.660> principle<00:03:17.989> for<00:03:18.500> opening<00:03:19.160> up<00:03:19.310> all<00:03:20.269> the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
same principle for opening up all the

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.770 
same principle for opening up all the
cockles<00:03:20.930> where<00:03:21.350> your<00:03:21.470> mussels<00:03:21.829> or<00:03:22.100> clams<00:03:22.780> we

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
cockles where your mussels or clams we

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.470 
cockles where your mussels or clams we
just<00:03:23.930> let<00:03:24.049> that<00:03:24.170> come<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.130> boil<00:03:25.480> won't

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
just let that come to the boil won't

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.339 
just let that come to the boil won't
take<00:03:26.660> very<00:03:26.690> long

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349
