00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.519
 start with it 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.509
 little olive oil in the pan I do 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.640
 I've already got the ingredients here 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.720
 shredded bell pepper onion in small 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.060
 cubes 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.820
 with finely chopped garlic and 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.609
 here the mushrooms and the drakon 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.260
 I already get it and it is here and there 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.480
 we go pick here 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.640
 the intention is a little bit of oil in the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.420
 pan what I said 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.809
 then always grab the onions first 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.540
 fry the onions and then you think because if 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.370
 if you don't do that you will get like you 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.260
 all the ingredients together 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.940
 you actually get the taste of fried 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:54.580
 onions not in the sauce that's right 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.580
 what I like so much about this 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.750
 just delicious fruit 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.120
 take a look 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.420
 she also smells nice yes too bad that we 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.020
 don't have tv smell but 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.020
 smells so good 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.780
 as long as we go then the garlic goes 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.670
 add the bell pepper and the garlic if you like 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.020
 immediately wait with the onions you have 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.290
 chance he will burn and that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.290
 we don't want to 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.660
 so 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.030
 that baker also briefly and here as 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.450
 lastly we add the mushrooms 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 in terms of ingredients and now it comes 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.410
 exciting moment we go little bit 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.229
 could add fleur to it 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.350
 that it will manage flame 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.030
 So the extractor hood would be the flame in you 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.039
 cooker hood can shoot 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.789
 that would not be so nice little shot 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.789
 we vieux in the pan 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.580
 the alcohol evaporates that is the intention 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.599
 would keep up with a plan 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.959
 the flash in the pan is thus a 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.840
 little bit so it's not something fierce 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.200
 gives extra taste to you would she is 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.910
 Now you intend to check in via extra 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.190
 that cook that you almost no more moisture 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.400
 have it in the pan and then go the cream 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.400
 add 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.610
 this is approximately for 4 people 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.390
 how much deciliter bring the sauce to the 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.370
 boil in then it will still be about 2 a 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.480
 3 minutes to cook gently 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.560
 for a nice sauce the sauce is now used up 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.840
 thickness 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.739
 which make him taste a little 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.860
 use the salt from the sea ​​salt 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.860
 mill 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.950
 and now we will drag the pictures under us 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.270
 then do it at the last because then stay 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.670
 you carry on 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.989
 that's why leaves are the most beautiful in color 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.260
 take a look 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.260
 delicious 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.840
 homemade mushroom cream sauce with 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.020
 diced peppers carry fresh for whatever wants 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.020
