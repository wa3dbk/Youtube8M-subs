I<00:05:02.180> guess<00:05:02.740> at<00:05:03.740> that<00:05:03.830> time<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.490> Mercs<00:05:04.760> weren't

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
I guess at that time the Mercs weren't

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.110 
I guess at that time the Mercs weren't
very<00:05:05.900> enjoyable<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.800> play<00:05:06.830> with<00:05:07.250> and<00:05:07.520> people<00:05:07.669> I

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
very enjoyable to play with and people I

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.089 
very enjoyable to play with and people I
guess<00:05:08.810> we<00:05:08.960> can<00:05:09.080> all<00:05:09.260> agree<00:05:09.410> with<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.740> if<00:05:10.070> you

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
guess we can all agree with that if you

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.550 
guess we can all agree with that if you
guys<00:05:10.400> have<00:05:10.610> played<00:05:10.820> it<00:05:11.000> before<00:05:11.090> you<00:05:11.510> know<00:05:11.900> not

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
make sure that the Mercs aren't a you

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.950 
make sure that the Mercs aren't a you
know<00:06:31.160> too<00:06:31.300> overpowered<00:06:32.300> like<00:06:32.540> they<00:06:32.690> were<00:06:32.750> in

Arsenal's<00:06:35.600> oh<00:06:36.310> don't<00:06:37.310> give<00:06:37.430> them<00:06:37.580> like<00:06:37.700> a

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
Arsenal's oh don't give them like a

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.340 
Arsenal's oh don't give them like a
whole<00:06:38.000> arsenal<00:06:38.210> of<00:06:38.510> weapons<00:06:38.930> like<00:06:39.080> they<00:06:39.200> had

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
whole arsenal of weapons like they had

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.320 
whole arsenal of weapons like they had
before<00:06:39.770> make<00:06:40.160> it<00:06:40.310> where<00:06:40.490> it<00:06:40.610> was<00:06:40.790> like<00:06:40.910> pan<00:06:41.180> or

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
before make it where it was like pan or

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.640 
before make it where it was like pan or
tomorrow<00:06:41.720> where<00:06:41.870> they<00:06:41.960> only<00:06:42.050> had<00:06:42.260> the<00:06:42.350> machine

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
tomorrow where they only had the machine

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.560 
tomorrow where they only had the machine
gun<00:06:42.919> and<00:06:43.070> they<00:06:43.190> you<00:06:43.760> know<00:06:43.790> the<00:06:44.000> machine<00:06:44.360> gun

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
gun and they you know the machine gun

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.560 
gun and they you know the machine gun
made<00:06:44.990> it<00:06:45.250> easier<00:06:46.250> for<00:06:46.490> the<00:06:46.580> spies<00:06:46.910> but<00:06:47.360> then

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
made it easier for the spies but then

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.100 
made it easier for the spies but then
you<00:06:48.290> know<00:06:48.440> the<00:06:48.620> Mercs<00:06:49.330> could<00:06:50.330> still<00:06:50.630> skill<00:06:50.990> the

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
you know the Mercs could still skill the

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.490 
you know the Mercs could still skill the
spies<00:06:51.380> they<00:06:51.680> weren't<00:06:51.950> too<00:06:52.160> over<00:06:52.790> underpowered

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
spies they weren't too over underpowered

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.620 
spies they weren't too over underpowered
so<00:06:54.500> make<00:06:54.740> it<00:06:54.770> like<00:06:55.100> that<00:06:55.130> don't<00:06:55.700> take<00:06:56.450> the

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
so make it like that don't take the

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.620 
so make it like that don't take the
chaos<00:06:56.990> theory<00:06:57.290> route<00:06:57.680> and<00:06:58.010> say<00:06:58.520> well<00:06:59.360> let's

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630 
chaos theory route and say well let's

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.240 
chaos theory route and say well let's
just<00:06:59.780> give<00:06:59.930> the<00:07:00.080> Mercs<00:07:00.320> all<00:07:00.560> this<00:07:00.740> stuff<00:07:01.040> and

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
just give the Mercs all this stuff and

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.430 
just give the Mercs all this stuff and
give<00:07:01.490> the<00:07:01.669> spies<00:07:01.940> nothing<00:07:02.570> no<00:07:02.720> don't<00:07:03.050> do<00:07:03.230> that

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440
