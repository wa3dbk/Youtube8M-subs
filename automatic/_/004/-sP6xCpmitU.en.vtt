00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.470
 If God is on my side who will be against me 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.610
 It frees me from the evil one who walks around 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.430
 If He is on my side who will be against me 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.330
 It frees me from the evil one who walks around 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.480
 I will not let the evil one use me as his instrument 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.370
 I will not let the evil one use my talent for his work 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.280
 I will not leave, and I will trample him and he will die in his attempt 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.630
 I will not leave, and I will hear your lament 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.670
 Because I love God directly, I praise directly 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.710
 And the enemy I trample directly 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.500
 I shot direct hard and direct 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.160
 God strengthens me and I say that directly 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.440
 And they want to cheat me 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.370
 But I'm not going to leave 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.490
 My strength is God I trusted in God 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.590
 And big things will take me 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.490
 If God is on my side who will be against me 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.300
 It frees me from the evil one who walks around 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.230
 If He is on my side who will be against me 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.210
 It frees me from the evil one who walks around 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.710
 Tell me who the owner is 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.220
 Gold, silver and money, ah? 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.360
 Tell me who is the owner, 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.830
 From everything my eyes saw 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.600
 He is my rock, my strength 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.950
 And when he touches me he does it with subtlety 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.430
 Reprendo the enemy I will not be his prey 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.900
 Because I'm not a tail now I'm the head 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.760
 If God is on my side who will be against me 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.590
 It frees me from the evil one who walks around 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.370
 If He is on my side who will be against me 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.530
 It frees me from the evil one who walks around 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.720
 I hear his voice that is like a loud thunder 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.520
 And that spills great flames of fire 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.210
 It makes the desert tremble, its word is not a game 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.710
 And today I follow him because I'm not blind anymore 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.500
 Even though I rule camp against me, my heart will not fear 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.470
 Even if they fight against me, I will trust and there will be no fear 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.940
 I will receive his words, and only Him will I have fear 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.800
 He died for me and that's why he is my Savior 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.200
 If God is ... 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.900
 from my side ... 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.110
 If God is ... 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.860
 from my side ... 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.210
 If God is on my side who will be against me 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.620
 It frees me from the evil one who walks around 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.340
 If He is on my side who will be against me 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.660
 It frees me from the evil one who walks around 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.740
 It frees me from the evil one who walks around
