hi and welcome to brain stuff I'm

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.370 
hi and welcome to brain stuff I'm
Jonathan<00:00:11.730> Strickland<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.360> I'm<00:00:12.719> Ben<00:00:13.139> Bowlin

Jonathan Strickland and I'm Ben Bowlin
and<00:00:13.740> Ben<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.070> understand<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.759> have<00:00:14.940> an

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
and Ben I understand we have an

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.599 
and Ben I understand we have an
interesting<00:00:15.360> question<00:00:15.599> today<00:00:16.350> oh<00:00:16.710> yeah<00:00:17.369> this

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
interesting question today oh yeah this

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.200 
interesting question today oh yeah this
is<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.730> good<00:00:17.880> one

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
is a good one

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.390 
is a good one
all<00:00:18.330> right<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.630> Jonathan<00:00:19.140> are<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.830> ready<00:00:20.070> yep

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
all right so Jonathan are you ready yep

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.250 
all right so Jonathan are you ready yep
that's<00:00:20.699> not<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.029> question<00:00:21.390> okay<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:21.900> right

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
that's not the question okay all right

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.790 
that's not the question okay all right
how<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.640> astronomers<00:00:23.640> measure<00:00:24.560> distance<00:00:25.560> how

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
how do astronomers measure distance how

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.769 
how do astronomers measure distance how
are<00:00:25.920> they<00:00:26.039> able<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.279> measure<00:00:26.609> how<00:00:27.210> far<00:00:27.510> away<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
are they able to measure how far away a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.950 
are they able to measure how far away a
star<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.640> right<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> turns<00:00:30.269> out<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.929> know

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
star is right so it turns out you know

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.139 
star is right so it turns out you know
that<00:00:31.349> measuring<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> distance<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> star<00:00:32.550> is

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that measuring the distance to a star is

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.389 
that measuring the distance to a star is
an<00:00:33.420> interesting<00:00:33.809> problem<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.710> astronomers

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
an interesting problem so astronomers

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.950 
an interesting problem so astronomers
have<00:00:35.820> come<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.329> two<00:00:36.660> different

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
have come up with two different

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.380 
have come up with two different
techniques<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.770> estimate<00:00:37.890> how<00:00:38.399> far<00:00:38.430> away<00:00:39.059> any

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
techniques to estimate how far away any

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.049 
techniques to estimate how far away any
given<00:00:39.780> star<00:00:40.079> might<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.640> first

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
given star might be now that first

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.840 
given star might be now that first
technique<00:00:42.629> involves<00:00:43.700> triangulation<00:00:44.700> or

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
technique involves triangulation or

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.510 
technique involves triangulation or
parallax<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.530> Earth<00:00:46.710> orbits<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> Sun

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
parallax so the Earth orbits the Sun

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.420 
parallax so the Earth orbits the Sun
right<00:00:47.969> yeah<00:00:48.570> as<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.379> orbits<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.890> Sun<00:00:50.160> there's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
right yeah as it orbits that Sun there's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.520 
right yeah as it orbits that Sun there's
a<00:00:50.489> diameter<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.000> orbit<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> hundred<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
a diameter of orbit about a hundred and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
a diameter of orbit about a hundred and
eighty<00:00:52.680> six<00:00:53.010> million<00:00:53.460> miles<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.120> by<00:00:54.390> looking

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
eighty six million miles so by looking

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.170 
eighty six million miles so by looking
at<00:00:54.870> star<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.590> day<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> then<00:00:56.250> maybe<00:00:56.579> six

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
at star one day and then maybe six

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.700 
at star one day and then maybe six
months<00:00:57.420> later<00:00:57.629> looking<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.289> again

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
months later looking at it again

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
months later looking at it again
astronomers<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> difference<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
astronomers can see a difference in the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.779 
astronomers can see a difference in the
viewing<00:01:00.899> angle<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.680> star<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
viewing angle for that star so with a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.060 
viewing angle for that star so with a
little<00:01:03.120> trigonometry<00:01:03.530> just<00:01:04.530> frankly

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
little trigonometry just frankly

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.020 
little trigonometry just frankly
terrifying<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.760> me

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
terrifying to me

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
terrifying to me
the<00:01:06.270> different<00:01:06.630> angles<00:01:07.080> yield<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.770> distance

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the different angles yield the distance

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.100 
the different angles yield the distance
so<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.000> technique<00:01:09.330> works<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.780> stars<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so this technique works for stars that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.289 
so this technique works for stars that
are<00:01:10.320> about<00:01:10.560> 400<00:01:11.520> light<00:01:11.700> years<00:01:11.729> away<00:01:12.150> from

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
are about 400 light years away from

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.750 
are about 400 light years away from
Earth<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:13.020> closer<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:13.920> there's<00:01:14.130> no<00:01:14.280> direct

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
Earth or closer now there's no direct

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.820 
Earth or closer now there's no direct
method<00:01:15.240> currently<00:01:15.600> available<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.350> measure

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
method currently available to measure

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.160 
method currently available to measure
the<00:01:17.040> distance<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.490> stars<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.720> further

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the distance to stars that are further

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.980 
the distance to stars that are further
than<00:01:19.740> 400<00:01:20.430> light-years<00:01:20.700> from<00:01:21.150> Earth<00:01:21.689> but

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
than 400 light-years from Earth but

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890 
than 400 light-years from Earth but
there's<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.979> approximation<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.240> yes<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
there's a approximation right yes and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.510 
there's a approximation right yes and
this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> pretty<00:01:25.710> clever<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
this is a pretty clever one this is the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.690 
this is a pretty clever one this is the
second<00:01:26.970> technique<00:01:27.270> astronomers<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.470> use

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
second technique astronomers can use

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.100 
second technique astronomers can use
brightness<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.180> figure<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> star's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
brightness to figure out a star's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
brightness to figure out a star's
distance<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.579> because<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
distance so they do this because it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
distance so they do this because it
turns<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> star's<00:01:33.960> color<00:01:34.229> spectrum

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
turns out that a star's color spectrum

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.310 
turns out that a star's color spectrum
is<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.340> good<00:01:35.820> indication<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.630> its<00:01:37.020> actual

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
is a good indication of its actual

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.160 
is a good indication of its actual
brightness<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.340> blue<00:01:38.610> white<00:01:39.270> etc<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
brightness so like blue white etc the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.660 
brightness so like blue white etc the
relationship<00:01:40.799> between<00:01:40.950> color<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
relationship between color and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.700 
relationship between color and
brightness<00:01:42.030> has<00:01:42.479> been<00:01:42.659> proven<00:01:43.140> using<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
brightness has been proven using the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.219 
brightness has been proven using the
several<00:01:44.100> thousand<00:01:44.549> stars<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.600> close

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
several thousand stars that are close

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.899 
several thousand stars that are close
enough<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.680> earth<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.250> their<00:01:47.490> distance

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
enough to earth to have their distance

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.760 
enough to earth to have their distance
measured<00:01:48.600> directly<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.170> would<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> four

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
measured directly that would be the four

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.410 
measured directly that would be the four
hundred<00:01:49.920> light<00:01:50.220> years<00:01:50.250> closer<00:01:50.820> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
hundred light years closer so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.710 
hundred light years closer so
astronomers<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.380> look<00:01:52.829> at<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> distant<00:01:53.549> star

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
astronomers can look at a distant star

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.090 
astronomers can look at a distant star
determine<00:01:54.720> its<00:01:54.869> color<00:01:55.110> spectrum<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.860> from

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
determine its color spectrum and from

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.340 
determine its color spectrum and from
the<00:01:56.250> color<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:57.149> they<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.540> determine<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the color then they can determine the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.410 
the color then they can determine the
star's<00:01:58.619> actual<00:01:59.310> brightness<00:01:59.790> by<00:02:00.030> knowing<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
star's actual brightness by knowing the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.880 
star's actual brightness by knowing the
actual<00:02:00.719> brightness<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.259> comparing<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.829> to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
actual brightness and comparing it to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.039 
actual brightness and comparing it to
the<00:02:02.310> apparent<00:02:02.729> brightness<00:02:02.939> seen<00:02:03.600> from<00:02:03.780> Earth

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the apparent brightness seen from Earth

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.350 
the apparent brightness seen from Earth
that<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.619> by<00:02:04.920> looking<00:02:05.460> at<00:02:05.579> how<00:02:05.729> dem<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> star

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that is by looking at how dem the star

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.620 
that is by looking at how dem the star
has<00:02:06.509> actually<00:02:06.840> become

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
has actually become

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.630 
has actually become
once<00:02:07.869> it's<00:02:08.289> light<00:02:08.590> reaches<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.220> earth<00:02:09.369> they

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
once it's light reaches the earth they

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.280 
once it's light reaches the earth they
can<00:02:09.700> determine<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.569> distance<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
can determine that the distance of the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.500 
can determine that the distance of the
star<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.709> whatever<00:02:12.550> it<00:02:12.670> happens<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.060> be<00:02:13.090> right

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
star is whatever it happens to be right

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.870 
star is whatever it happens to be right
and<00:02:13.890> there's<00:02:14.890> some<00:02:15.100> other<00:02:15.400> stuff<00:02:15.490> which

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
and there's some other stuff which

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.400 
and there's some other stuff which
probably<00:02:16.150> yeah<00:02:16.390> I've<00:02:16.600> got<00:02:16.750> some<00:02:16.900> trivia<00:02:17.230> for

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
probably yeah I've got some trivia for

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.290 
probably yeah I've got some trivia for
you<00:02:17.470> about<00:02:17.620> good<00:02:17.980> all<00:02:18.310> right<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.610> let's<00:02:19.120> talk

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
you about good all right so let's talk

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.120 
you about good all right so let's talk
about<00:02:19.420> some<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.780> astronomical<00:02:20.680> units

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
about some of the astronomical units

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.070 
about some of the astronomical units
that<00:02:21.400> astronomers<00:02:21.910> use<00:02:21.970> including<00:02:22.600> Big<00:02:22.989> E

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
that astronomers use including Big E

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.410 
that astronomers use including Big E
astronomical<00:02:23.770> unit<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.760> astronomical

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
astronomical unit so the astronomical

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.090 
astronomical unit so the astronomical
unit<00:02:25.450> refers<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.590> distance<00:02:26.920> between

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
unit refers to the distance between

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.979 
unit refers to the distance between
Earth<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.970> Sun<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.209> average<00:02:28.750> distance

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
Earth and the Sun the average distance

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.300 
Earth and the Sun the average distance
about<00:02:29.970> 149<00:02:30.970> million<00:02:31.660> kilometers<00:02:32.530> then<00:02:33.160> you've

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
about 149 million kilometers then you've

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.400 
about 149 million kilometers then you've
got<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.670> Lightyear<00:02:34.180> yeah<00:02:34.720> what<00:02:34.959> is<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> light

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
got the Lightyear yeah what is a light

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.260 
got the Lightyear yeah what is a light
here<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.770> light-years<00:02:36.340> went<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.880> like<00:02:37.209> a

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
here so a light-years went up like a

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.080 
here so a light-years went up like a
regular<00:02:37.450> year<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:37.959> with<00:02:38.080> fewer<00:02:38.260> calories

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
regular year but with fewer calories

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.460 
regular year but with fewer calories
actually<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.239> course<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.750> light<00:02:40.900> year<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.260> the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
actually of course the light year is the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually of course the light year is the
distance<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.670> light<00:02:42.730> can<00:02:43.150> travel<00:02:43.180> through

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
distance that light can travel through

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.020 
distance that light can travel through
the<00:02:43.750> vacuum<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:44.170> space<00:02:44.459> within<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.670> span<00:02:46.000> of

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
the vacuum of space within the span of

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.400 
the vacuum of space within the span of
one<00:02:46.569> earth<00:02:46.840> year<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:48.190> that's<00:02:48.870> pretty<00:02:49.870> big<00:02:50.140> cuz

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
one earth year so that's pretty big cuz

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.900 
one earth year so that's pretty big cuz
lights<00:02:50.650> pretty<00:02:50.860> fast<00:02:51.190> yeah<00:02:51.430> yeah<00:02:51.730> we're

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
lights pretty fast yeah yeah we're

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.180 
lights pretty fast yeah yeah we're
talking<00:02:52.239> just<00:02:52.600> under<00:02:53.260> 10<00:02:53.650> trillion

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
talking just under 10 trillion

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.970 
talking just under 10 trillion
kilometers<00:02:54.420> that's<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.750> pretty<00:02:56.290> long<00:02:56.530> distance

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
kilometers that's a pretty long distance

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.530 
kilometers that's a pretty long distance
but<00:02:57.190> I've<00:02:57.400> got<00:02:57.610> something<00:02:57.970> that's<00:02:58.209> even

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
but I've got something that's even

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.110 
but I've got something that's even
longer<00:02:58.870> than<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.620> is<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.130> parsec

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
longer than that and that is a parsec

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.160 
longer than that and that is a parsec
hang<00:03:01.750> on

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
hang on

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.770 
hang on
is<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.799> Star<00:03:03.130> Wars<00:03:03.370> reference<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:04.209> can<00:03:04.569> be

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
is this a Star Wars reference it can be

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.580 
is this a Star Wars reference it can be
but<00:03:05.440> all<00:03:05.860> right<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.100> parsec<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.180> Star<00:03:07.390> Wars

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
but all right so parsec and Star Wars

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.170 
but all right so parsec and Star Wars
sounds<00:03:08.590> like<00:03:08.680> it's<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.980> unit<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.610> time<00:03:09.640> it's

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
sounds like it's a unit of time it's

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.789 
sounds like it's a unit of time it's
yeah<00:03:10.330> it's<00:03:10.600> actually<00:03:10.750> unit<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.290> distance<00:03:11.410> and

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
yeah it's actually unit of distance and

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.009 
yeah it's actually unit of distance and
the<00:03:12.250> way<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.519> works<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.030> talk<00:03:13.630> about<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
the way it works is you talk about the

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.770 
the way it works is you talk about the
distance<00:03:14.320> between<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:15.040> our<00:03:15.220> Sun<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.150> some

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
distance between the our Sun and some

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.039 
distance between the our Sun and some
other<00:03:17.019> astronomical<00:03:17.650> object<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.940> has<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.480> one

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
other astronomical object that has a one

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.699 
other astronomical object that has a one
second<00:03:20.680> arc<00:03:20.950> degree<00:03:21.810> difference<00:03:22.810> in<00:03:23.049> parallax

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
second arc degree difference in parallax

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.979 
second arc degree difference in parallax
angle<00:03:24.220> now<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.090> essentially<00:03:25.570> means<00:03:25.780> that

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
angle now that essentially means that

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.979 
angle now that essentially means that
when<00:03:26.140> we<00:03:26.230> look<00:03:26.440> at<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.829> star<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:27.940> we<00:03:28.390> compare

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
when we look at the star and we compare

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.050 
when we look at the star and we compare
it<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.470> Sun<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.010> we<00:03:30.160> do<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.519> again<00:03:30.850> and

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
it to the Sun and we do that again and

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.120 
it to the Sun and we do that again and
another<00:03:31.690> point<00:03:31.959> in<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.140> Earth's<00:03:32.350> orbit<00:03:32.500> we

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
another point in the Earth's orbit we

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.130 
another point in the Earth's orbit we
get<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.459> one<00:03:33.760> second<00:03:34.120> art<00:03:34.269> degree<00:03:34.450> that

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
get that one second art degree that

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.500 
get that one second art degree that
distance<00:03:35.560> actually<00:03:35.739> ends<00:03:36.070> up<00:03:36.130> being<00:03:36.510> 3.26

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
distance actually ends up being 3.26

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.560 
distance actually ends up being 3.26
light-years<00:03:38.079> so<00:03:38.680> it's<00:03:38.829> even<00:03:39.070> longer<00:03:39.519> so<00:03:39.910> there

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
light-years so it's even longer so there

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.090 
light-years so it's even longer so there
you<00:03:40.660> go

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
you go

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.380 
you go
astronomical<00:03:42.100> units<00:03:42.400> weights<00:03:43.120> are<00:03:43.299> the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
astronomical units weights are the

retconned explanation of why Han Solo
refers<00:04:06.609> to<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:07.180> parsecs<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.109> this<00:04:08.680> route

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
refers to the parsecs is that this route

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.240 
refers to the parsecs is that this route
goes<00:04:09.489> through<00:04:09.819> several<00:04:10.150> black<00:04:10.660> holes<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.470> for

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
goes through several black holes and for

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.830 
goes through several black holes and for
a<00:04:12.280> ship<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.609> be<00:04:12.640> safe<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.329> has<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.660> go<00:04:13.810> around

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
a ship to be safe it has to go around

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.050 
a ship to be safe it has to go around
the<00:04:14.410> black<00:04:14.590> holes<00:04:14.829> as<00:04:14.980> much<00:04:15.130> as<00:04:15.280> possible<00:04:15.430> so

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
the black holes as much as possible so

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.590 
the black holes as much as possible so
the<00:04:16.180> safest<00:04:16.510> route<00:04:16.720> is

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
the safest route is

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.110 
the safest route is
fifteen<00:04:18.230> parsecs<00:04:18.800> but<00:04:19.160> Han<00:04:19.310> Solo<00:04:19.760> he's<00:04:20.090> a

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
fifteen parsecs but Han Solo he's a

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.810 
fifteen parsecs but Han Solo he's a
daredevil<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:21.709> he<00:04:21.860> cuts<00:04:22.250> off<00:04:22.460> several

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
daredevil and so he cuts off several

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.670 
daredevil and so he cuts off several
parsecs<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:23.570> makes<00:04:23.810> it<00:04:23.960> more<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.320> twelve

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
parsecs and makes it more of a twelve

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.640 
parsecs and makes it more of a twelve
parsecs<00:04:25.160> or<00:04:25.520> less<00:04:26.330> than<00:04:26.630> 12<00:04:26.930> parsecs<00:04:27.170> ah

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
parsecs or less than 12 parsecs ah

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.150 
parsecs or less than 12 parsecs ah
that's<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.160> line<00:04:28.430> yeah<00:04:28.910> uh<00:04:29.180> but<00:04:30.110> is<00:04:30.710> that<00:04:30.920> is
