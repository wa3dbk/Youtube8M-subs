large<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.869> that's<00:01:19.049> definitely<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.500> reason

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
large so that's definitely the reason

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.219 
large so that's definitely the reason
why<00:01:19.890> max<00:01:20.130> don't<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.820> us<00:01:20.909> when<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> virus<00:01:21.509> pcs
