to<00:01:07.740> make<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> guide<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:08.760> think<00:01:08.880> i'm

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
to make a guide but I don't think i'm

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.789 
to make a guide but I don't think i'm
going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.470> really

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
going to do that now because it's really

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.800 
going to do that now because it's really
easy<00:01:10.979> all<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.820> need<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.540> two

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
easy all you need to do is do the two

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.649 
easy all you need to do is do the two
quests<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:13.790> how<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.509> put

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
quests and then how I do it is I put

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.840 
quests and then how I do it is I put
everything<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.409> wood<00:01:16.710> cut<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> rest<00:01:17.729> on

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
everything on wood cut in and rest on

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.570 
everything on wood cut in and rest on
the<00:01:17.939> herbs<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:20.250> there's<00:01:20.400> better

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the herbs but I think there's better

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.310 
the herbs but I think there's better
ways<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> now<00:01:21.299> because<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.810> prices<00:01:22.080> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
ways to do it now because the prices of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.840 
ways to do it now because the prices of
things<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.770> that's<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.189> an<00:01:23.460> old<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.820> of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
things but that's just an old way of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.719 
things but that's just an old way of
doing<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.240> how<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:25.280> have<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> look<00:01:26.549> into

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729

me doing this but yeah got a lot of bird
eggs<00:02:31.470> as<00:02:31.650> well<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:32.130> they're<00:02:32.550> really

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
eggs as well but they're really

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.700 
eggs as well but they're really
pointless<00:02:33.390> I've<00:02:33.690> already<00:02:33.810> got<00:02:34.020> our<00:02:34.140> birds<00:02:34.350> and

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
pointless I've already got our birds and

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.310 
pointless I've already got our birds and
no<00:02:34.950> one<00:02:35.070> really<00:02:35.100> cares<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.910> lot<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.600> rings<00:02:36.960> but

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
no one really cares a lot of rings but

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.560 
no one really cares a lot of rings but
they're<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.590> worth<00:02:37.860> much<00:02:38.210> it's<00:02:39.210> obviously

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
they're not worth much it's obviously

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.230 
they're not worth much it's obviously
just<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.960> seeds<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.530> are<00:02:40.850> pretty<00:02:41.850> good

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
just the seeds that are pretty good

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.680 
just the seeds that are pretty good
money<00:02:42.710> I<00:02:43.820> usually<00:02:44.820> just<00:02:44.850> did<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.360> on<00:02:45.630> a

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
money I usually just did this on a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.500 
money I usually just did this on a
Sunday<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:47.400> every<00:02:47.760> Sunday<00:02:47.880> afternoon<00:02:48.420> I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
Sunday like every Sunday afternoon I

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.000 
Sunday like every Sunday afternoon I
just<00:02:48.690> go<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:48.900> chop<00:02:49.110> maples<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.800> get<00:02:49.920> my

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
just go and chop maples and get my

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.010 
just go and chop maples and get my
writing<00:02:50.340> up<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.030> took<00:02:51.210> like<00:02:51.360> two<00:02:51.720> minutes

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
writing up and it took like two minutes

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.220 
writing up and it took like two minutes
not<00:02:52.650> even<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:53.360> then<00:02:54.360> just<00:02:54.600> top<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> money<00:02:55.110> up

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
not even that then just top the money up

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.810 
not even that then just top the money up
every<00:02:55.530> now<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.770> then<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.920> think<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.370> maxed

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
every now and then I think I just maxed

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.460 
every now and then I think I just maxed
out<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> cash<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.540> then<00:02:57.660> when<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> got<00:02:57.870> low<00:02:58.140> put

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
out the cash and then when I got low put

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.370 
out the cash and then when I got low put
more<00:02:58.740> in<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.160> think<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.000> can<00:03:00.150> put<00:03:00.360> like<00:03:00.570> seven

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
more in I think you can put like seven

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.350 
more in I think you can put like seven
mil<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.250> max<00:03:02.460> you<00:03:02.610> can<00:03:02.760> put<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.240> that

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
mil is the max you can put in and that

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.030 
mil is the max you can put in and that
lasts<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.050> think<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.650> tastes<00:03:06.530> 75k<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> day<00:03:07.860> or

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
lasts I think it tastes 75k a day or

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.240 
lasts I think it tastes 75k a day or
something<00:03:08.490> something<00:03:09.390> stupid<00:03:09.810> like<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.250> but

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
something something stupid like that but

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.100 
something something stupid like that but
yes<00:03:12.200> once<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.440> did<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.820> do<00:03:15.000> most<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:16.020> it

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
yes once I did this I so do most of it

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.949 
yes once I did this I so do most of it
sold<00:03:16.410> some<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.280> seeds<00:03:17.520> are<00:03:17.790> crashing<00:03:18.780> I

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
sold some of the seeds are crashing I

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.560 
sold some of the seeds are crashing I
don't<00:03:19.170> really<00:03:19.260> know<00:03:19.440> why<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.209> got<00:03:21.209> quite

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
don't really know why but I got quite

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.070 
don't really know why but I got quite
the<00:03:21.600> cash<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:23.040> spent<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.670> on<00:03:24.080> nothing

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
the cash and I spent that on nothing

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.660 
the cash and I spent that on nothing
it's<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.709> my<00:03:25.739> pouch<00:03:26.010> i<00:03:26.220> don't<00:03:26.400> know<00:03:26.459> i'm<00:03:26.520> going

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
it's in my pouch i don't know i'm going

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.610 
it's in my pouch i don't know i'm going
to<00:03:26.730> spin<00:03:26.880> down<00:03:27.000> yet<00:03:27.239> but<00:03:27.450> there<00:03:28.380> should<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.590> a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
to spin down yet but there should be a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.890 
to spin down yet but there should be a
price<00:03:28.860> check<00:03:29.070> coming<00:03:29.850> up<00:03:30.030> soon<00:03:30.270> I've<00:03:30.630> run<00:03:30.870> out

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
price check coming up soon I've run out

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.520 
price check coming up soon I've run out
of<00:03:30.989> things<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.380> say<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.830> yeah<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:33.239> think<00:03:34.170> I

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
of things to say so yeah I think I

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.570 
of things to say so yeah I think I
missed<00:03:34.770> out<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:36.530> papaya<00:03:37.530> seeds<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.340> this

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
missed out the papaya seeds in this

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.810 
missed out the papaya seeds in this
price<00:03:38.850> check<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.540> they<00:03:40.050> were<00:03:40.290> worth<00:03:40.580> 1.2<00:03:41.580> mil

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
price check and they were worth 1.2 mil

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.940 
price check and they were worth 1.2 mil
so<00:03:42.540> it's<00:03:42.780> probably<00:03:42.930> about<00:03:43.080> 30<00:03:43.440> meal<00:03:43.770> all

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
so it's probably about 30 meal all

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.210 
so it's probably about 30 meal all
together<00:03:44.100> which<00:03:45.030> isn't<00:03:45.209> bad<00:03:45.950> considering<00:03:46.950> i

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
together which isn't bad considering i

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.140 
together which isn't bad considering i
did<00:03:47.489> absolutely<00:03:47.940> fuck-all<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.910> here<00:03:51.060> we<00:03:51.120> go

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
did absolutely fuck-all so here we go

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.280 
did absolutely fuck-all so here we go
price<00:03:51.810> check<00:03:52.110> time<00:03:53.480> freed<00:03:54.480> up<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.780> lot<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:55.080> space

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
price check time freed up a lot of space
