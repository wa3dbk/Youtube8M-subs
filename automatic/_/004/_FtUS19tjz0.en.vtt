00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:30.380 

you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.600 

so<00:02:30.990> now<00:02:31.170> I'm<00:02:31.320> just<00:02:31.590> wiping<00:02:31.920> any<00:02:32.040> excess

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
so now I'm just wiping any excess

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.850 
so now I'm just wiping any excess
product<00:02:33.090> off<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.360> brush<00:02:33.720> I'm<00:02:34.080> just<00:02:34.140> going<00:02:34.710> to

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
product off the brush I'm just going to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.250 
product off the brush I'm just going to
lightly<00:02:35.280> lightly<00:02:36.090> brush<00:02:36.630> through<00:02:36.930> my<00:02:37.080> eyebrow

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
lightly lightly brush through my eyebrow

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.680 
lightly lightly brush through my eyebrow
hairs<00:02:37.710> at<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.920> start<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.340> my<00:02:38.520> eyebrow<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.150> don't

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
hairs at the start of my eyebrow I don't

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.300 
hairs at the start of my eyebrow I don't
like<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.110> be<00:02:40.200> too<00:02:40.410> harsh<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:40.890> I'm<00:02:41.070> just

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
like it to be too harsh so I'm just

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.620 
like it to be too harsh so I'm just
doing<00:02:41.520> this<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:41.880> gently

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
doing this really gently

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.590 
doing this really gently
I<00:02:42.660> just<00:02:43.590> think<00:02:43.740> it<00:02:43.890> gives<00:02:43.920> more<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.370> natural

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
I just think it gives more of a natural

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.300 
I just think it gives more of a natural
eyebrow<00:02:45.600> look<00:02:46.080> rather<00:02:46.440> than<00:02:46.620> really<00:02:47.040> really

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
eyebrow look rather than really really

00:02:47.310 --> 00:03:45.900 
eyebrow look rather than really really
harsh<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.930> say<00:02:48.930> yeah

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.660 

so<00:03:46.510> now<00:03:46.720> I'm<00:03:46.990> just<00:03:47.200> taking<00:03:47.380> my<00:03:47.590> conceder<00:03:48.220> from
