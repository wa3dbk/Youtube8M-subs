you<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.719> maybe<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.989> bit<00:01:01.140> cooler<00:01:01.410> than<00:01:01.680> some<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you know maybe a bit cooler than some of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.770 
you know maybe a bit cooler than some of
the<00:01:02.070> other<00:01:02.190> australian<00:01:02.730> cities<00:01:02.760> perhaps<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the other australian cities perhaps a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.870 
the other australian cities perhaps a
bit<00:01:03.930> windier<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.549> gives<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
bit windier do you think that gives you

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.190 
bit windier do you think that gives you
in<00:01:05.970> some<00:01:06.150> way<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.299> little<00:01:06.510> bit<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.840> an<00:01:06.960> advantage

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
in some way a little bit of an advantage

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.410 
in some way a little bit of an advantage
yeah<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> course<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> does<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:09.060> coming

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
yeah of course it does because coming

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.469 
yeah of course it does because coming

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
tennis and and i think really that's the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.190 
tennis and and i think really that's the
reason<00:02:17.650> why<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:19.030> just<00:02:19.209> finally<00:02:19.660> tell<00:02:20.050> us<00:02:20.140> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
reason why and just finally tell us a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.170 
reason why and just finally tell us a
bit<00:02:20.230> about<00:02:20.549> what<00:02:21.549> kind<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.790> things<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.090> were
