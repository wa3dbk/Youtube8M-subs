was<00:01:42.420> read<00:01:42.570> about<00:01:42.689> ghost<00:01:42.930> peppers<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.290> thought

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
was read about ghost peppers I thought

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.020 
was read about ghost peppers I thought
first<00:01:44.159> thing<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.340> thought<00:01:44.490> was<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.670> got<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> try

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
first thing I thought was I got to try

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760 
first thing I thought was I got to try
that<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.360> let's<00:01:45.600> here's<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.320> little<00:01:46.500> bit<00:01:46.560> more

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to keep wild elephants in bay we don't

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.089 
to keep wild elephants in bay we don't
have<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> lot<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.350> problem<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.710> Orlando

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099

keep news anchors at bay me
all<00:02:13.410> right<00:02:13.530> let's<00:02:13.740> let's<00:02:14.070> make<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.310> up<00:02:14.520> Shawn

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
all right let's let's make it up Shawn

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.130 
all right let's let's make it up Shawn
so<00:02:15.120> here<00:02:15.240> we<00:02:15.330> go<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.690> all<00:02:15.780> mixed<00:02:16.020> in

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
so here we go we got it all mixed in

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:30.140 
so here we go we got it all mixed in
okay<00:02:16.650> and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.640 

that's<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.239> lot<00:02:31.359> more<00:02:31.390> science<00:02:31.930> than<00:02:31.989> magic<00:02:32.439> but

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
that's a lot more science than magic but

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.379 
that's a lot more science than magic but
the<00:02:33.219> idea<00:02:33.489> behind<00:02:33.519> making<00:02:33.939> ice<00:02:34.090> cream<00:02:34.209> with

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
the idea behind making ice cream with

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:35.520 
the idea behind making ice cream with
liquid<00:02:34.569> nitrogen<00:02:34.840> besides<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.319> fact<00:02:35.469> that

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
liquid nitrogen besides the fact that

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.869 
liquid nitrogen besides the fact that
you<00:02:35.680> can<00:02:35.829> customize<00:02:36.249> it<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.519> it's<00:02:36.700> really

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
you can customize it and it's really

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.479 
you can customize it and it's really
cool<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.269> see<00:02:37.299> how<00:02:37.629> it's<00:02:37.780> gonna<00:02:37.930> say<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.499> and

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
cool to see how it's gonna say that and

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.559 
cool to see how it's gonna say that and
you<00:02:39.760> know<00:02:39.879> today<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.239> were<00:02:40.359> talking<00:02:40.540> about

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
you know today you were talking about

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.869 
you know today you were talking about
what<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> dry<00:02:41.049> day<00:02:41.109> it<00:02:41.379> was<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.549> know<00:02:42.609> when

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
what a dry day it was and you know when

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.280 
what a dry day it was and you know when
you<00:02:42.969> when<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.329> really<00:02:43.569> humid<00:02:43.870> summer<00:02:44.079> day

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
you when it's a really humid summer day

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.259 
you when it's a really humid summer day
this<00:02:44.499> smoke<00:02:45.159> effect<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.609> really<00:02:45.819> incredible

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
this smoke effect is really incredible

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.959 
this smoke effect is really incredible
and<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.829> also<00:02:47.950> makes<00:02:48.280> better<00:02:48.459> ice<00:02:48.639> cream

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:48.969 
and but it also makes better ice cream

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.729 
and but it also makes better ice cream
because<00:02:49.359> it<00:02:49.659> freezes<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.109> ice<00:02:50.200> cream<00:02:50.500> so

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
because it freezes the ice cream so

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.849 
because it freezes the ice cream so
quickly<00:02:51.129> that<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:53.200> ice<00:02:53.260> crystals<00:02:53.680> like<00:02:53.739> a

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
quickly that the ice crystals like a

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.530 
quickly that the ice crystals like a
chance<00:02:54.099> to<00:02:54.189> grow<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.969> it's<00:02:55.090> already<00:02:55.299> getting

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
chance to grow so it's already getting

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.729 
chance to grow so it's already getting
there<00:02:55.689> let<00:02:55.870> me<00:02:55.900> give<00:02:56.079> it<00:02:56.109> one<00:02:56.290> little<00:02:56.409> dip<00:02:56.709> here

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
there let me give it one little dip here

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.270 
there let me give it one little dip here
and<00:02:57.810> one<00:02:58.810> more<00:02:58.840> blast<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.499> will<00:02:59.620> be<00:02:59.739> basically

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
and one more blast and will be basically

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.339 
and one more blast and will be basically
what<00:03:00.459> you're<00:03:00.609> doing<00:03:00.639> is<00:03:01.090> deep<00:03:01.450> freezing<00:03:02.019> and

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
what you're doing is deep freezing and

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.809 
what you're doing is deep freezing and
then<00:03:02.500> letting<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:02.889> melt<00:03:03.189> down<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.430> little<00:03:03.639> bit

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
then letting it melt down a little bit

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.699 
then letting it melt down a little bit
is<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.180> right<00:03:04.419> no<00:03:04.750> flash<00:03:05.049> freezing<00:03:05.469> it<00:03:05.560> not

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
is that right no flash freezing it not

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.339 
is that right no flash freezing it not
will<00:03:06.489> be<00:03:06.519> he'll<00:03:06.819> be<00:03:07.000> completely<00:03:07.719> frozen<00:03:08.169> by

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
will be he'll be completely frozen by

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.129 
will be he'll be completely frozen by
the<00:03:08.379> time<00:03:10.650> should<00:03:11.650> love<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.870> because<00:03:13.870> if<00:03:14.019> I

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
the time should love that because if I

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.689 
the time should love that because if I
remember<00:03:14.560> correctly<00:03:14.919> from<00:03:15.129> chemistry<00:03:15.519> class

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:15.699
