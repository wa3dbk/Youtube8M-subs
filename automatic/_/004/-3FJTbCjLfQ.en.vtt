00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.550
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.859
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.400
 Thank you in advance The theme of today is here 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.360
 How to win with Tsutsuki vs. Tsutsuki 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.270
 I would like to introduce this is back vs. back 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.681
 In the other party Tsutsuzuki who wants to win in Tsutsuki match 

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:21.400
 In Tsutsuki game than the opponent who wants to get stuck 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.880
 This is a must-see video for those who want to be advantageous 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.010
 It is quite frequent to use it during the game 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.390
 Because it is very high, it is Tsutsuki versus Tsutsuki 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.149
 I think winning is a very important thing 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.670
 At first this Tsutsuki versus Tsutsuki 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.390
 There is actually no iron rule of how to win 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.300
 When doing Tsutsuki vs Tsutsuki each other 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.700
 Do not make mistakes as important as consciousness 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.879
 It is said that the other party makes a mistake 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.289
 It will be a very important point 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.969
 Just have you have this one consciousness 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.079
 The Tsutsuki game suddenly gets stronger 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.510
 Because it changes only by the way of consciousness 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.770
 I already recommend this, though 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.220
 The way is broken Tsutsuki is put together 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.000
 When the other party's tsutsuki is not cut 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.860
 Please try to cut off from yourself 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.680
 This is actually reasonable and very easy to win 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.700
 It is the way of the Tsutsuki war Actually, everyone Tsutsuki 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.799
 It is important that you have a sense of cutting through 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.670
 I think I'm thinking about receiving 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.560
 It is very easy to cut 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.700
 However, when the other party cuts the rumbling 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.900
 I will cut back the other party's cut 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.560
 This is quite difficult, surprisingly 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.149
 Tsutsutuki that the other party has cut fast and deep rotation amount 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.280
 Cut it back again and return it 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.340
 If you try to do it, you make a net mistake 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:00.490
 You lose the opponent's ball game 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.430
 Actually, when receiving, it is better to cut back and return 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.310
 It is very easy to do, but in the case of Tsutsuki 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.909
 Against the other party 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.450
 If you don't go too far, you should 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.310
 It's better than the other party's rotation 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.530
 The face of the racket is more than usual by using 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.610
 With the door open slightly fit together 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.310
 Please try and do so 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.630
 Tsutsuzuki is rushing freely by the rotation of the partner Tsutsuki 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.000
 That kind of experience will return 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.330
 There is also everyone, when the other party cuts down 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.410
 When you put it in place, you can make a quick tutu straight with Khan 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.090
 That Tsutsuzuki like counter Tsutsuki will return 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.920
 Make good use of your opponent's momentum 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.040
 We put together and return Tsutsuki which is out 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.731
 So everyone is Tsutsuki of the other party 

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:48.080
 Consciousness to fit when I thought it was out 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.300
 Open the surface because it is slightly open and cut 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.160
 It is only a little, really little 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.800
 Feel like lifting up later 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.050
 The face of the racket as it is without being conscious of cutting 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.629
 If you just give it out, you have a high offensive power 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:25.190
 Tsutsuki 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.390
 I'm going to match, but please say 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.670
 It's not a tsutsuki It's not a bearish tsutsuki 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.069
 Because it is a tsutsuki that the rotation that the other party is running back has returned 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.390
 It is said that the other party can not hit it easily 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.060
 Because it will be a situation 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.090
 Pong together with the cut Tsutsuzuki 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.180
 In fact, it won't be beaten by the other party 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.580
 From two merits that oneself can return stably 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.739
 It was a good match for junior high school students 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.730
 Tsutsutuki match game with high school students 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.790
 There are so many, but when 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.500
 Just unconsciously in the fore and back 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.560
 It's more difficult than getting back each other 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.989
 There is an unbroken Tsutsuki 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.280
 When I came, I went off from myself 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.689
 This is cut with a sense of 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.470
 This is a little tough 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.320
 This is a tough match too 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.959
 If it is difficult to fit together 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.780
 If it is difficult, I will put it in my mind 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.960
 There is no mistake when I do it and I can attack myself 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.820
 The other party's mistake because it can 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.930
 There is a possibility of increase and my own mistake 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.370
 Even if it means that it will decrease 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.440
 It will be said 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:54.961
 It's difficult to put it together 

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:59.570
 You only need to put in without putting together 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.199
 Sweet Tsutsuki and Normal Tsutsuki 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.729
 It's not broken. It's not so strong. 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.740
 When I came, I cut it back and cut it back 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.110
 Just be aware of these two things with 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.240
 Then the boring mistakes in Tsutsuki will disappear 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.539
 It says that you can invite the other person to make a mistake 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.360
 It's an ideal I will not make a mistake 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.620
 If the usual tsutsuki comes just to put in the difficult tsutsuki 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.720
 In terms of saying 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.550
 There is no risk at all I have a situation with few mistakes 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.760
 The other party is own Tsutsuzuki while appearing 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.289
 When I do it strictly, it returns strictly 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.120
 If you have a sweet time 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.490
 If it compares with the ordinary tsutsuki in saying that it cuts off 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.000
 By far the other party is under pressure 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.699
 Who is your partner? 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.410
 Don't overdo it when you're calmly dealing with it 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.420
 Come together and myself 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.130
 When it matches, it will cut off firmly 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.190
 What is this? 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.479
 Thank you for saying
