collector what's interesting about it is
these<00:01:37.100> almost<00:01:37.490> look<00:01:37.730> like<00:01:38.170> 997<00:01:39.170> gt3<00:01:39.530> headers

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130

these almost look like 997 gt3 headers
and<00:01:40.340> as<00:01:40.790> much<00:01:41.000> as<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.330> way<00:01:41.450> they<00:01:41.660> curve<00:01:42.050> around

really short I mean literally here's the

section<00:01:48.830> you're<00:01:49.070> looking<00:01:49.310> at<00:01:49.400> maybe<00:01:49.520> three

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
section you're looking at maybe three

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.910 
section you're looking at maybe three
inches<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.330> cat<00:01:50.540> if<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:51.110> had<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.380> speculate<00:01:51.770> I

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
inches of cat if I had to speculate I

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.160 
inches of cat if I had to speculate I
bet<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.430> cats<00:01:52.700> it's<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.510> ceramic<00:01:53.780> based

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
bet you that cats it's a ceramic based

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.719 
bet you that cats it's a ceramic based
cat<00:01:54.440> like<00:01:54.740> they've<00:01:54.890> been<00:01:55.040> doing<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.369> all<00:01:55.490> along

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
cat like they've been doing it all along

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.850 
cat like they've been doing it all along
and<00:01:55.790> it's<00:01:56.090> probably<00:01:56.390> 800<00:01:56.780> 1000<00:01:57.380> cells<00:01:57.560> per

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
and it's probably 800 1000 cells per

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.630 
and it's probably 800 1000 cells per
square<00:01:58.190> inch

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
square inch

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.370 
square inch
which<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.240> quite<00:01:59.450> restrictive<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.229> gives

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
which is quite restrictive but it gives

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.810 
which is quite restrictive but it gives
them<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.710> ability<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:01.280> have<00:02:01.430> it<00:02:01.580> in<00:02:01.670> such<00:02:01.790> a

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
them that ability to have it in such a

them that ability to have it in such a
short<00:02:01.910> distance<00:02:02.240> now<00:02:03.080> there's<00:02:03.260> gonna<00:02:03.380> be<00:02:03.470> some

short distance now there's gonna be some

other one however on this new car horses

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.600 
other one however on this new car horses
now<00:02:11.300> use<00:02:11.630> vacuum<00:02:11.900> actuated<00:02:12.320> exhaust<00:02:13.160> valves

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
now use vacuum actuated exhaust valves

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.580 
now use vacuum actuated exhaust valves
there's<00:02:13.850> one<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.150> each<00:02:14.180> side<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:15.170> can<00:02:15.290> see<00:02:15.500> it

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
there's one on each side you can see it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.290 
there's one on each side you can see it
right<00:02:15.739> there<00:02:17.410> anyway<00:02:18.440> as<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.370> pan<00:02:19.640> back<00:02:19.670> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
right there anyway as you pan back the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.630 
right there anyway as you pan back the
exhaust<00:02:20.750> comes<00:02:21.260> out<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.650> engine<00:02:22.040> goes

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
exhaust comes out of the engine goes

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.759 
exhaust comes out of the engine goes
through<00:02:22.880> this<00:02:22.970> catalytic<00:02:23.510> converter<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:24.590> is

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
through this catalytic converter this is

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.400 
through this catalytic converter this is

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
valve is closed when this valve is

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.100 
valve is closed when this valve is
closed<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:04.970> pipe<00:03:05.239> is<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> problem

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
closed this pipe is a problem

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.050 
closed this pipe is a problem
looks<00:03:06.320> like<00:03:06.470> approximately<00:03:07.250> two<00:03:07.489> inches<00:03:07.519> in

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
looks like approximately two inches in

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.539 
looks like approximately two inches in
diameter<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:09.440> could<00:03:09.650> be<00:03:09.799> even<00:03:09.920> an<00:03:10.220> inch<00:03:10.370> and

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
diameter it could be even an inch and

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.640 
diameter it could be even an inch and
7/8<00:03:10.970> but<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.239> looks<00:03:11.390> like<00:03:11.570> two<00:03:11.810> inches<00:03:11.989> which

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
7/8 but it looks like two inches which

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.710 
7/8 but it looks like two inches which
is<00:03:12.799> about<00:03:12.950> 50<00:03:13.400> millimeters<00:03:13.940> in<00:03:14.150> diameter<00:03:14.330> so

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
is about 50 millimeters in diameter so

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.810 
is about 50 millimeters in diameter so
in<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:14.900> car<00:03:15.140> is<00:03:15.230> breathing<00:03:15.680> throw<00:03:15.920> me<00:03:16.130> when

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
in this car is breathing throw me when

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.879 
in this car is breathing throw me when
that<00:03:16.970> valve<00:03:17.180> shut<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:18.200> breathing<00:03:18.680> through<00:03:18.829> a

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
that valve shut is breathing through a

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.590 
that valve shut is breathing through a
two<00:03:19.070> inch<00:03:19.220> pipe<00:03:19.489> so<00:03:19.700> it's<00:03:19.820> restricted<00:03:20.420> by

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
two inch pipe so it's restricted by

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.130 
two inch pipe so it's restricted by
Porsche<00:03:21.019> deliberately

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
Porsche deliberately

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.340 
Porsche deliberately
so<00:03:22.700> there's<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.910> valve<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:24.420> there<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.200> when

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
so there's the valve up there so when

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.410 
so there's the valve up there so when
the<00:03:25.440> valves<00:03:25.740> open<00:03:25.890> sauce<00:03:26.370> goes<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.330> the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
the valves open sauce goes in the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.780 
the valves open sauce goes in the
muffler<00:03:27.780> comes<00:03:28.140> out<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:29.010> little<00:03:29.220> bypass

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
muffler comes out this little bypass

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.190 
muffler comes out this little bypass
pipe<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.330> then<00:03:30.420> goes<00:03:30.630> back<00:03:30.660> through<00:03:31.170> the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
pipe and then goes back through the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.570 
pipe and then goes back through the
muffler<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:31.740> you<00:03:31.800> have<00:03:31.890> both<00:03:32.100> exhaust

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
muffler so you have both exhaust

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.900 
muffler so you have both exhaust
pathways<00:03:33.180> working<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:35.100> know<00:03:35.220> hence<00:03:35.550> that's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
pathways working you know hence that's

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.400 
pathways working you know hence that's
the<00:03:36.060> flavor<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.630> sound<00:03:36.900> now<00:03:37.110> and

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
the flavor of the sound now and

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.640 
the flavor of the sound now and
