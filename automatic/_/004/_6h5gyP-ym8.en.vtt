00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
potentially think about high-tech in a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.310 
potentially think about high-tech in a
different<00:00:38.400> way<00:00:38.519> basically<00:00:39.449> what<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.930> what

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
actually the idea was pretty simple if

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.760 
actually the idea was pretty simple if
that<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.059> they<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.360> these<00:00:57.539> shoes<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.590> are

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and I really let them be the characters

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.729 
and I really let them be the characters
instead<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.819> like<00:01:48.000> giving<00:01:48.179> them<00:01:48.479> lines<00:01:48.989> just

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:49.739 
instead of like giving them lines just

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.649 
instead of like giving them lines just
said<00:01:49.979> okay<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.030> your<00:01:51.239> reality

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
said okay you know this is your reality

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.139 
said okay you know this is your reality
be<00:01:53.229> on<00:01:53.439> an<00:01:53.560> angle<00:01:53.890> we<00:01:54.310> had<00:01:54.460> like<00:01:54.640> this<00:01:54.759> floating

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
be on an angle we had like this floating

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.870 
be on an angle we had like this floating
system<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:55.899> on<00:01:56.289> top<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:56.649> Stella<00:01:57.460> it's

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
system and on top of Stella it's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.059 
system and on top of Stella it's
basically<00:01:58.240> like<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.539> wooden<00:01:59.069> construction

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
basically like a wooden construction

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.130 
basically like a wooden construction
that<00:02:00.340> kind<00:02:00.640> of<00:02:00.729> moves<00:02:01.030> along<00:02:01.390> with<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.810> steps

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
that kind of moves along with the steps

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.249 
that kind of moves along with the steps
so<00:02:02.950> it's<00:02:03.100> not<00:02:03.250> just<00:02:03.310> like<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:04.149> know<00:02:04.270> Plexiglas

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
so it's not just like you know Plexiglas

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.559 
so it's not just like you know Plexiglas
but<00:02:06.039> it<00:02:06.100> wasn't<00:02:06.250> with<00:02:06.549> all<00:02:06.729> these<00:02:06.850> weights<00:02:07.209> and

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
but it wasn't with all these weights and

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.449 
but it wasn't with all these weights and
stuff<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:08.110> keep<00:02:08.349> it<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.590> place<00:02:08.799> for<00:02:08.979> good<00:02:09.099> we

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
stuff to keep it in place for good we

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.940 
stuff to keep it in place for good we
could<00:02:09.640> adjust<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.179> with<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.539> inch<00:02:10.830> kind<00:02:11.830> of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
could adjust it with the inch kind of

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.339 
could adjust it with the inch kind of
goes<00:02:12.580> with<00:02:12.970> your<00:02:13.150> steps<00:02:13.540> while<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.870> go<00:02:13.989> on<00:02:14.170> and

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
goes with your steps while you go on and

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.780 
goes with your steps while you go on and
that's<00:02:14.500> why<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.739> looks<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.010> realistic<00:02:15.400> and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
that's why it looks so realistic and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.390 
that's why it looks so realistic and
they<00:02:16.330> felt<00:02:16.750> like<00:02:16.900> they<00:02:17.530> walked<00:02:17.799> on<00:02:17.980> water<00:02:18.010> it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
they felt like they walked on water it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.610 
they felt like they walked on water it
was<00:02:19.330> like<00:02:19.540> real<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.989> became<00:02:20.319> real<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:26.500> you
