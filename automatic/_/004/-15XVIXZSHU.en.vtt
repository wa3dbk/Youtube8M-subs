00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
the other side where you want to get

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.569 
the other side where you want to get
close<00:01:04.640> into<00:01:05.120> a<00:01:05.150> square<00:01:05.570> corner<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.490> know

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
close into a square corner and you know

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.149 
close into a square corner and you know
the<00:01:07.759> actual<00:01:08.119> cutting<00:01:08.420> part<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:09.829> scraper

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
the actual cutting part of the scraper

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.510 
the actual cutting part of the scraper
itself<00:01:10.610> is<00:01:10.820> formed<00:01:11.509> by<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:11.689> burr<00:01:12.170> that's<00:01:13.040> on<00:01:13.310> the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
itself is formed by a burr that's on the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.050 
itself is formed by a burr that's on the
very<00:01:13.729> edge<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.329> the<00:01:14.630> scraper<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:16.490> that's

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
very edge of the scraper and that's

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.120 
very edge of the scraper and that's
formed<00:01:17.540> naturally<00:01:17.899> in<00:01:18.469> the<00:01:18.590> sharpening

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
formed naturally in the sharpening

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.840 
formed naturally in the sharpening
process

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
process

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.459 
process
I<00:01:20.259> generally<00:01:21.280> grind<00:01:22.280> my<00:01:22.579> edges<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.600> about<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.899> 70

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
I generally grind my edges to about a 70

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.760 
I generally grind my edges to about a 70
degree<00:01:24.649> angle<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.700> then<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.170> that<00:01:27.350> gives<00:01:27.560> me<00:01:27.740> a

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
degree angle and then so that gives me a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.789 
degree angle and then so that gives me a
little<00:01:28.009> more<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:29.420> an<00:01:29.630> angle<00:01:29.869> to<00:01:30.200> get<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.560> bird

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
little more of an angle to get the bird

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.830 
little more of an angle to get the bird
onto<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:32.119> I<00:01:32.990> have<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.649> same<00:01:33.890> angle<00:01:34.280> on<00:01:34.369> all<00:01:34.579> my

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
onto and I have the same angle on all my

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.380 
onto and I have the same angle on all my
scrapers<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.469> it's<00:01:36.920> quite<00:01:37.130> easy<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:37.759> go

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
scrapers so it's quite easy to go

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.389 
scrapers so it's quite easy to go
between<00:01:38.570> them<00:01:39.020> on<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.350> sharpener<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.159> then

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
between them on the sharpener and then

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.260 
between them on the sharpener and then
also<00:01:40.670> on<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.180> lathe<00:01:41.869> itself<00:01:43.270> another

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
also on the lathe itself another

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.899 
also on the lathe itself another
technique<00:01:44.869> for<00:01:45.140> getting<00:01:45.590> real<00:01:45.799> fine<00:01:46.159> cuts<00:01:46.609> is

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
technique for getting real fine cuts is

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.649 
technique for getting real fine cuts is
to<00:01:47.630> sharpen<00:01:48.079> it<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.469> then<00:01:48.920> file<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.119> bird<00:01:50.390> off

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
to sharpen it and then file the bird off

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.669 
to sharpen it and then file the bird off
with<00:01:51.649> like<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.810> whetstone<00:01:53.810> or<00:01:54.109> something<00:01:54.469> and

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
with like a whetstone or something and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.849 
with like a whetstone or something and
then<00:01:55.219> that<00:01:55.250> gives<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:55.939> a<00:01:56.060> very<00:01:56.649> sharp<00:01:57.649> and

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
then that gives you a very sharp and

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.499 
then that gives you a very sharp and
clean<00:01:58.670> edge<00:01:59.649> this<00:02:00.909> sharpness<00:02:01.909> of<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.149> doesn't

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
clean edge this sharpness of it doesn't

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.300 
clean edge this sharpness of it doesn't
last<00:02:02.659> too<00:02:02.840> long<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.469> it's<00:02:03.649> just<00:02:03.770> kind<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.130> for

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
last too long so it's just kind of for

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.480 
last too long so it's just kind of for
the<00:02:04.700> final<00:02:04.939> I

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the final I

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.609 
the final I
cutting<00:02:06.240> when<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.509> need<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> real<00:02:07.290> fine

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
cutting when you need to get a real fine

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.180 
cutting when you need to get a real fine
surface<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.750> but<00:02:09.750> another<00:02:10.649> big<00:02:10.890> thing

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
surface out of it but another big thing

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.430 
surface out of it but another big thing
about<00:02:11.340> scrapers<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.930> they're<00:02:13.170> quick<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
about scrapers is that they're quick and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.010 
about scrapers is that they're quick and
easy<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:14.010> sharpen<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> think<00:02:15.660> what

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
easy to sharpen you know I think what

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.020 
easy to sharpen you know I think what
I'll<00:02:16.140> do<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.349> I'll<00:02:16.620> take<00:02:16.650> one<00:02:17.069> over<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.880> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
I'll do is I'll take one over to the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.380 
I'll do is I'll take one over to the
sharpener<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:19.489> show<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.670> how<00:02:20.910> quick<00:02:21.239> it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
sharpener and show you just how quick it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.690 
sharpener and show you just how quick it
is<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.810> sharpen<00:02:22.050> before<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.769> get<00:02:23.280> started

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
is to sharpen before we get started

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.360 
is to sharpen before we get started
actually<00:02:23.849> turning<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:28.230> quite<00:02:28.650> simple<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.220> do

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
actually turning it's quite simple to do

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.790 
actually turning it's quite simple to do
and<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.610> goes<00:02:29.790> very<00:02:30.000> quickly<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.590> see

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
and it goes very quickly as you can see

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.040 
and it goes very quickly as you can see
there's<00:02:32.099> my<00:02:32.340> 70<00:02:32.940> degree<00:02:33.269> angle<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.900> then

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
there's my 70 degree angle and then

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.860 
there's my 70 degree angle and then
exactly<00:02:35.010> what<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.550> here<00:02:35.849> so<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.780> just

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
exactly what this is here so you just

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.979 
exactly what this is here so you just
turn<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.410> paper<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.610> matter<00:02:38.850> of

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
turn this paper on and it's a matter of

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.259 
turn this paper on and it's a matter of
rotating<00:02:39.989> about<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.530> back<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.040> forth

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
rotating about that back and forth

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.180 
rotating about that back and forth
against<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.540> eagle<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.110> basically<00:02:44.010> that's

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
against the eagle and basically that's

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.550 
against the eagle and basically that's
all<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.580> need<00:02:44.850> once<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.239> have<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:46.170> initial

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
all you need once you have the initial

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.860 
all you need once you have the initial
shape<00:02:46.769> ground<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.459> touching<00:02:48.030> them<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:48.299> in

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
shape ground that touching them up in

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.430 
shape ground that touching them up in
between<00:02:49.350> after<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:51.080> nothing<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.290> it

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
between after that is nothing to it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:08.270 
between after that is nothing to it
here's<00:02:52.709> here's<00:02:53.130> how<00:02:53.250> quickly

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.220 

-<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.670> scraper<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.270> all<00:03:10.450> sharp<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:10.990> ready<00:03:11.080> to

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
- that scraper is all sharp and ready to

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.090 
- that scraper is all sharp and ready to
go<00:03:11.670> okay<00:03:12.670> we're<00:03:13.060> ready<00:03:13.210> to<00:03:13.570> mount<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.470> blank

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
go okay we're ready to mount the blank

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.320 
go okay we're ready to mount the blank
on<00:03:15.490> to<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.300> delayed<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:18.550> do<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:18.940> have

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
on to the delayed and to do that I have

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.790 
on to the delayed and to do that I have
a<00:03:19.360> Jacob's<00:03:19.990> truck<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:22.440> headstock<00:03:23.440> of<00:03:23.680> the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
a Jacob's truck in the headstock of the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.640 
a Jacob's truck in the headstock of the
lathe<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.340> have<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.120> on<00:03:25.330> with<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.710> drawbar<00:03:27.400> which

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
lathe I have it on with a drawbar which

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.650 
lathe I have it on with a drawbar which
holds<00:03:29.650> or<00:03:29.770> prevents<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.520> from<00:03:30.730> coming<00:03:31.630> loose

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
holds or prevents it from coming loose

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.010 
holds or prevents it from coming loose
and<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.500> Morse<00:03:32.890> taper<00:03:33.220> just<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.210> little<00:03:34.660> safety

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
and the Morse taper just a little safety

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.810 
and the Morse taper just a little safety
device<00:03:35.350> than<00:03:35.620> some<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.100> terming<00:03:36.520> will<00:03:36.700> be

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
device than some of the terming will be

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.540 
device than some of the terming will be
doing<00:03:37.170> we<00:03:38.170> won't<00:03:38.350> be<00:03:38.500> using<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:39.040> tail<00:03:39.250> stock

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
doing we won't be using the tail stock

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.550 
doing we won't be using the tail stock
at<00:03:39.790> all<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:41.140> what<00:03:41.470> we<00:03:41.590> do<00:03:41.800> is<00:03:42.130> we<00:03:42.400> insert<00:03:42.940> the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
at all so what we do is we insert the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.630 
at all so what we do is we insert the
mandrel<00:03:44.560> into<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.520> Jacob's<00:03:46.270> Chuck<00:03:47.640> and

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
mandrel into the Jacob's Chuck and

00:03:48.640 --> 00:04:01.020 
mandrel into the Jacob's Chuck and
tighten<00:03:49.210> it<00:03:49.330> down<00:03:56.370> nice<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.400> secure<00:03:59.580> and<00:04:00.580> then

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
tighten it down nice and secure and then

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.440 
tighten it down nice and secure and then
the<00:04:01.390> sizing<00:04:01.900> ring<00:04:02.170> goes<00:04:02.800> on<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.640> know<00:04:03.820> far

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
the sizing ring goes on so we know far

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.810 
the sizing ring goes on so we know far
down<00:04:04.690> determined<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.430> course<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
down determined and of course the

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:15.620 
down determined and of course the
threaded<00:04:07.210> hole<00:04:07.450> we'll<00:04:08.020> just<00:04:08.290> screw<00:04:08.650> right<00:04:08.890> on

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.780 

as<00:04:16.630> far<00:04:16.840> as<00:04:16.900> it<00:04:17.200> goes<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.150> tight<00:04:20.610> okay<00:04:21.610> and

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
as far as it goes is it tight okay and

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.060 
as far as it goes is it tight okay and
that<00:04:21.910> order<00:04:22.150> will<00:04:22.630> slide<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.230> tail<00:04:23.410> stock<00:04:23.800> up

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
that order will slide the tail stock up

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
that order will slide the tail stock up
for<00:04:24.510> some<00:04:25.510> added<00:04:25.750> support<00:04:26.490> as<00:04:27.490> long<00:04:27.520> as<00:04:27.940> I'm

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
for some added support as long as I'm

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.150 
for some added support as long as I'm
doing<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.570> rough<00:04:28.780> turning<00:04:29.110> getting<00:04:29.890> the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
doing the rough turning getting the

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.140 
doing the rough turning getting the
blank<00:04:30.640> into<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.360> round<00:04:31.690> shape<00:04:32.820> that<00:04:33.820> will<00:04:33.970> just

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
blank into a round shape that will just

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.480 
blank into a round shape that will just
give<00:04:34.480> us<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.720> little<00:04:34.750> added<00:04:35.350> insurance<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:36.280> that

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
give us a little added insurance so that

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.480 
give us a little added insurance so that
the<00:04:37.050> blank<00:04:38.050> doesn't<00:04:38.470> come<00:04:38.590> flying<00:04:38.830> off<00:04:39.130> the

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
the blank doesn't come flying off the

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.940 
the blank doesn't come flying off the
lathe<00:04:39.880> honest<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.110> don't<00:04:41.230> want<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.740> make<00:04:41.920> a

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
lathe honest and I don't want to make a

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.120 
lathe honest and I don't want to make a
hole<00:04:42.340> in<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.760> end<00:04:43.150> of<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.510> blank<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.740> I've

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
hole in the end of the blank so I've

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.760 
hole in the end of the blank so I've
made<00:04:45.400> this<00:04:45.580> little<00:04:45.640> wooden<00:04:46.630> thing<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:47.140> the

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
made this little wooden thing that the

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.970 
made this little wooden thing that the
tail<00:04:48.070> stock<00:04:48.400> fits<00:04:49.120> into<00:04:49.420> that<00:04:49.450> hole<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.200> then

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
tail stock fits into that hole and then

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.730 
tail stock fits into that hole and then
I<00:04:51.130> can<00:04:51.400> crank<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:52.450> down<00:04:54.690> against<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.780> blank

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
I can crank it down against the blank

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.070 
I can crank it down against the blank
and<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:59.710> holds<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.700> nice<00:05:00.880> but<00:05:01.300> it<00:05:01.620> doesn't

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
and it holds it nice but it doesn't

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.360 
and it holds it nice but it doesn't
doesn't<00:05:05.080> make<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.410> mark<00:05:05.740> on<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:06.040> end<00:05:06.070> of<00:05:06.310> the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
doesn't make a mark on the end of the

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.700 
doesn't make a mark on the end of the
blank<00:05:06.610> so<00:05:06.850> when<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.030> want<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.420> shake<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.380> end<00:05:08.530> of

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
blank so when I want to shake the end of

the<00:05:27.830> reason<00:05:28.219> being<00:05:28.369> you<00:05:28.580> want<00:05:28.789> to<00:05:28.999> do<00:05:29.119> your

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
the reason being you want to do your

00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:32.119 
scraping down in this area so that your

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:34.509 
scraping down in this area so that your
tool<00:05:32.389> is<00:05:32.779> held<00:05:33.139> at<00:05:33.349> a<00:05:33.379> bit<00:05:33.679> of<00:05:33.800> a<00:05:33.889> downward

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:34.519 
tool is held at a bit of a downward

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:37.089 
tool is held at a bit of a downward
angle<00:05:34.869> that<00:05:35.869> way<00:05:36.110> if<00:05:36.259> you<00:05:36.409> would<00:05:36.679> happen<00:05:36.860> to

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
angle that way if you would happen to

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.209 
angle that way if you would happen to
get<00:05:37.249> a<00:05:37.279> catch<00:05:37.639> it'll<00:05:38.569> go<00:05:38.719> down<00:05:39.139> and<00:05:39.529> into<00:05:40.099> the

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:40.219 
get a catch it'll go down and into the

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.820 
get a catch it'll go down and into the
air<00:05:40.429> like<00:05:40.699> that<00:05:40.959> instead<00:05:41.959> of<00:05:42.169> being<00:05:42.349> up<00:05:42.559> here

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
air like that instead of being up here

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.559 
air like that instead of being up here
if<00:05:42.949> you<00:05:43.069> got<00:05:43.189> to<00:05:43.369> catch<00:05:43.580> it<00:05:43.610> would<00:05:43.909> just<00:05:44.059> pull

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
if you got to catch it would just pull

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.169 
if you got to catch it would just pull
it<00:05:44.689> right<00:05:44.839> into<00:05:45.080> the<00:05:45.289> wood<00:05:45.499> so<00:05:46.489> at<00:05:46.699> this<00:05:46.939> point

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:47.179 
it right into the wood so at this point

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:50.139 
it right into the wood so at this point
I'm<00:05:47.419> still<00:05:47.719> a<00:05:47.749> little<00:05:48.080> too<00:05:48.860> high<00:05:49.159> too<00:05:49.909> low<00:05:49.939> I

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:50.149 
I'm still a little too high too low I

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.769 
I'm still a little too high too low I
mean<00:05:50.449> so<00:05:50.689> I'm<00:05:50.779> going<00:05:50.959> to<00:05:50.989> raise<00:05:51.169> it<00:05:51.229> up<00:05:51.439> some

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
mean so I'm going to raise it up some

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.889 
mean so I'm going to raise it up some
and<00:05:53.779> we<00:05:53.989> want<00:05:54.199> to<00:05:54.289> get<00:05:54.439> it<00:05:54.589> close<00:05:54.860> in<00:05:55.159> as<00:05:55.309> we<00:05:55.459> can

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:55.899 
and we want to get it close in as we can

00:05:55.899 --> 00:06:00.089 
and we want to get it close in as we can
but<00:05:56.899> you<00:05:57.019> have<00:05:57.139> to<00:05:57.229> have<00:05:57.319> room<00:05:57.559> to<00:05:58.209> maneuver

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
but you have to have room to maneuver

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.949 
but you have to have room to maneuver
keeping<00:06:01.099> in<00:06:01.189> mind<00:06:01.399> that<00:06:01.610> we<00:06:01.849> do<00:06:01.999> have<00:06:02.269> this<00:06:02.479> 70

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:02.959 
keeping in mind that we do have this 70

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:05.979 
keeping in mind that we do have this 70
degree<00:06:03.289> angle<00:06:03.739> so<00:06:03.769> we<00:06:04.039> want<00:06:04.279> to<00:06:04.399> keep<00:06:04.819> the<00:06:05.749> flat

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:05.989 
degree angle so we want to keep the flat

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:09.189 
degree angle so we want to keep the flat
part<00:06:06.349> of<00:06:06.589> the<00:06:06.739> scraper<00:06:07.099> onto<00:06:07.969> the<00:06:08.149> surface<00:06:08.989> of

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
part of the scraper onto the surface of

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:16.869 
part of the scraper onto the surface of
the<00:06:10.479> tool<00:06:11.479> rest<00:06:11.809> and<00:06:15.069> that<00:06:16.069> should<00:06:16.339> be<00:06:16.519> just

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:16.879 
the tool rest and that should be just

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:20.769 
the tool rest and that should be just
about<00:06:17.149> right<00:06:18.399> okay<00:06:19.399> and<00:06:20.209> we'll<00:06:20.389> turn<00:06:20.599> the

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:20.779 
about right okay and we'll turn the

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:26.730 
about right okay and we'll turn the
lathe<00:06:21.139> on<00:06:22.959> crank<00:06:23.959> it<00:06:24.139> up<00:06:24.259> to<00:06:24.849> go<00:06:25.849> either<00:06:26.119> those

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
lathe on crank it up to go either those

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.060 
lathe on crank it up to go either those
start<00:06:27.740> at<00:06:27.919> about<00:06:28.899> 800<00:06:29.899> rpms

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
start at about 800 rpms

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.690 
start at about 800 rpms
and<00:06:32.760> even<00:06:33.060> going<00:06:33.180> to<00:06:33.270> use<00:06:33.390> this<00:06:33.630> paper<00:06:33.900> for

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
and even going to use this paper for

00:06:34.700 --> 00:07:09.470 
and even going to use this paper for
roughing<00:06:35.700> out<00:06:35.880> here

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.790 

we'll<00:07:10.480> get<00:07:10.600> some<00:07:10.840> flat<00:07:11.050> spots<00:07:11.080> we're<00:07:11.680> not

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
we'll get some flat spots we're not

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.290 
we'll get some flat spots we're not
quite<00:07:12.010> brown<00:07:12.340> yet<00:07:12.640> it's<00:07:12.820> running<00:07:13.180> a<00:07:13.270> little

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
quite brown yet it's running a little

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:34.719 
quite brown yet it's running a little
cockeyed

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:34.729 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:08:12.480 

just<00:07:35.960> a<00:07:36.960> little<00:07:37.919> closer<00:07:38.130> to<00:07:38.460> the<00:07:38.580> action

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:12.490 

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.210 

yeah<00:08:13.490> it's<00:08:13.730> pretty<00:08:13.970> well
