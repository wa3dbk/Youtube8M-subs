00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.090 
another meteorite right there how
beautiful<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.660> that

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.320 

I<00:04:54.800> love<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.950> and<00:04:56.700> I've<00:04:57.060> just<00:04:57.300> discovered<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:58.050> new

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
I love it and I've just discovered a new

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.210 
I love it and I've just discovered a new
zone<00:05:00.330> shot<00:05:01.230> I<00:05:01.380> guess<00:05:01.590> is<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.860> best<00:05:01.890> way<00:05:02.190> to

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
zone shot I guess is the best way to

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.720 
zone shot I guess is the best way to
describe<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:02.760> and<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:04.110> pick<00:05:05.010> up<00:05:05.160> I<00:05:05.280> follow<00:05:05.550> this

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
describe it and I pick up I follow this

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.880 
describe it and I pick up I follow this
zone<00:05:05.970> I'm<00:05:06.150> going<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.330> find<00:05:06.510> a<00:05:06.600> lot<00:05:06.750> more<00:05:06.780> today

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.630 

that's<00:05:10.890> three<00:05:11.190> for<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.430> day<00:05:13.460> so<00:05:14.460> here's

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
that's three for the day so here's

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.860 
that's three for the day so here's
another<00:05:14.790> track<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.480> I'm<00:05:15.570> just<00:05:15.690> going<00:05:15.810> to

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
another track and I'm just going to

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.459 
another track and I'm just going to
follow<00:05:16.110> it

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:23.950 

should<00:05:19.039> be<00:05:19.129> alive

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.840 

at<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.110> end<00:05:25.260> of<00:05:25.440> it<00:05:25.590> is<00:05:26.010> another<00:05:26.370> meteorite<00:05:26.820> or

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
at the end of it is another meteorite or

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.330 
at the end of it is another meteorite or
not

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
not

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.290 
not
that<00:05:28.970> would<00:05:29.090> just<00:05:29.210> be

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
that would just be

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.640 
that would just be
icing<00:05:31.960> on<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.229> cake

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:07:03.400 

nope<00:05:39.650> cow<00:05:40.340> ball

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:30.310 

some<00:07:04.410> fusion<00:07:04.680> crust

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.320 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:39.760 

big<00:07:31.040> fragment<00:07:35.680> so<00:07:36.680> besides<00:07:38.530> meteorites<00:07:39.530> this

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.770 
big fragment so besides meteorites this

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.720 
big fragment so besides meteorites this
is<00:07:39.920> why<00:07:40.040> I<00:07:40.070> really<00:07:40.400> came<00:07:40.520> to<00:07:40.730> United<00:07:41.180> States

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:42.730 
is why I really came to United States

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.420 
is why I really came to United States
because<00:07:43.730> I'm<00:07:43.910> hungry
