00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.130
 we are in spring with klaus ericsson 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.570
 on the gates of the sandbanks on early gates 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.850
 coast and the utmost is a little bit 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.860
 deeper than the innermost but the fish 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.020
 can stand on both sides 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.160
 So I have to go out here and cross 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.260
 and throw across to see where they are 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.120
 a coincidence that they are on the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.700
 middle of the sandbank on the surface 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.690
 rolled I had not thrown since 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:00.130
 I would not have seen her there before 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.380
 that is a sandbad fish in the 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.479
 Numerous underwater shots come 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.790
 we'll take you to it as ever 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.070
 we see where the fish is at 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.170
 coast stop we will see that 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.390
 There is much more fish out there 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.520
 stay as accepted and we see 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.970
 the reactions of the fish to ours 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.970
 fly 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.630
 we are there when claus the first time 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.630
 with bristles bohm fishes 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.190
 and he of his latest experiences 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.890
 reported with flies and fluorescence 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.300
 these are the fluorescent ones 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.310
 orange eyes is essential 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.860
 better fly than the standard 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.700
 Sandy fish I fish them at the same time 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.680
 I catch 80 to 90 percent on the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.229
 fluorescent the film covers everyone 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.660
 seasons off and klaus reported 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.900
 detailed about his fishing and he 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.120
 shows you the classic in practice 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.430
 summer fishing traditionally takes place at 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.149
 evening at night and early in the morning 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.649
 instead of 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.649
 But there are many exceptions
