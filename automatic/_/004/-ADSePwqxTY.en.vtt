00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
quite a while from now anyways um look I

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.150 
quite a while from now anyways um look I
mean<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.150> FK<00:03:00.510> skill<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.560> moment<00:03:01.950> it

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
mean it's a FK skill at the moment it

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.949 
mean it's a FK skill at the moment it
kind<00:03:02.550> of<00:03:02.580> reminds<00:03:02.940> me<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.090> Ruin<00:03:03.390> spanners<00:03:03.810> i'm
