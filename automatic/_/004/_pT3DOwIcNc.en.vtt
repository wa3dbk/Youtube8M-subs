00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
is renegade talent and I don't really

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.069 
is renegade talent and I don't really
know<00:00:29.759> what<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.090> supposed<00:00:30.329> to<00:00:30.599> ape<00:00:30.810> if

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
know what this is supposed to ape if

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.229 
know what this is supposed to ape if
anything<00:00:31.470> although<00:00:31.919> the<00:00:32.400> face<00:00:32.640> mask<00:00:32.910> looks

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
anything although the face mask looks

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.620 
anything although the face mask looks
shockingly<00:00:33.960> similar<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.730> from<00:00:35.970> brink<00:00:36.329> so

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
shockingly similar to one from brink so

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
shockingly similar to one from brink so
perhaps<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> inspiration<00:00:37.739> I'm<00:00:38.550> not

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
perhaps that was the inspiration I'm not

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
perhaps that was the inspiration I'm not
jealous<00:00:38.940> ooh<00:00:39.120> there's<00:00:39.270> always<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> lot<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
jealous ooh there's always a lot of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.000 
jealous ooh there's always a lot of
speculation<00:00:40.380> as<00:00:40.470> to<00:00:40.500> whether<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:40.829> these

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
speculation as to whether or not these

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.700 
speculation as to whether or not these
skins<00:00:41.280> are<00:00:41.430> inspired<00:00:41.850> by<00:00:42.300> real<00:00:43.020> things<00:00:43.410> some

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710

fitting<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> stealth<00:01:22.470> assassin<00:01:22.860> too<00:01:22.979> much<00:01:23.159> it's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
fitting a stealth assassin too much it's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.810 
fitting a stealth assassin too much it's
far<00:01:23.579> too<00:01:23.610> garish<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.689> hey<00:01:25.380> there<00:01:25.649> you<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:25.920> okay

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.510 
far too garish but hey there you go okay
let's<00:01:27.299> move<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.619> water<00:01:28.770> nonis<00:01:29.100> scanner

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
let's move on to the water nonis scanner

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.789 
let's move on to the water nonis scanner
scanner<00:01:30.299> came<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.719> couple<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.079> weeks<00:01:31.259> ago<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
scanner came out a couple of weeks ago I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.350 
scanner came out a couple of weeks ago I
was<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.490> busy<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.939> wasn't<00:01:33.090> able<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
was really busy so I wasn't able to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
was really busy so I wasn't able to
cover<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> scanner<00:01:33.930> skins<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.469> this<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
cover the scanner skins but this is the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.429 
cover the scanner skins but this is the
first<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:36.119> sans<00:01:36.450> good<00:01:36.869> scanner

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
first one that is sans good scanner

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.260 
first one that is sans good scanner
which<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.920> my<00:01:38.100> opinion<00:01:38.219> is<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> laziest<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
which in my opinion is the laziest of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.670 
which in my opinion is the laziest of
them<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.659> basically<00:01:40.020> scanner<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
them it's basically scanner with a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920 
them it's basically scanner with a
gradient<00:01:41.250> fill<00:01:41.549> over<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:42.030> can't<00:01:42.630> say<00:01:42.810> I'm<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
gradient fill over it can't say I'm a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.819 
gradient fill over it can't say I'm a
huge<00:01:43.229> fan<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.450> word<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
huge fan of that one if the word want to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.190 
huge fan of that one if the word want to
avoid<00:01:47.219> I<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.820> would<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:49.020> my

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
avoid I think it would be that one in my

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.630 
avoid I think it would be that one in my
personal<00:01:49.439> subjective<00:01:49.770> opinion<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
personal subjective opinion that

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.679 
personal subjective opinion that
actually<00:01:50.880> looks<00:01:51.030> even<00:01:51.270> worse<00:01:51.299> than<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
actually looks even worse than the
