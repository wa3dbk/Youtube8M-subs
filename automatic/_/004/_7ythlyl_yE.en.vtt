00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.950
 welcome this is your channel and in this 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.980
 occasion we are going to see the unpacking of 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.980
 the 360 ​​motorcycle and good we started 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.090
 very good guys I asked a little bit ago 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.699
 there were some amazon deals I did not think 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.960
 I got it so fast, good before 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.939
 nothing wants to tell you that I will be 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.210
 uploading blogs because I'm going to the campus 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.919
 for there I will see Martian zone alone 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.950
 here to several friends then I'm going to 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.360
 be doing some blogs and good them 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.450
 I bring the unpacking on this occasion 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.640
 It did not come to me before I left and it 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.590
 You see pretty well I ordered it in the version 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.109
 that it was metal then bathed in gold I think 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.940
 and well this is a version a little bit 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.899
 harder to get going to 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.899
 highlight it 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.720
 how beautiful is it well see it 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.760
 simply so that you can see 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.040
 who live in the box well in what 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.989
 are the typical manuals as ways of 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.660
 fast use in several languages 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.210
 let's see more ahead and here is 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.100
 something that is included that is not included 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.259
 normally in those that are like leather 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.259
 Well, that's what I think they are like 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.530
 it's like an extra add-on in case you're not 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.149
 it remains on the wrist what it is to be more 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.630
 big and some super pieces come 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.579
 tiny to be able to remove and disarm 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.500
 and put more visits and is that you do not 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:36.020
 it looks good, also what is this 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.310
 side the wireless base because this one 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.039
 will charge wirelessly 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.289
 you just have to place it and well 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.479
 start loading and then bring 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:50.060
 of course what is the charger appears 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:53.630
 Your loader appears I got it in 3400 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.110
 pesos that was very cheap because that I think 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.049
 that the normalito costs like 3 thousand 560 and 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.899
 600 new right now the leather strap 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.299
 and good this ticket that was strap 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.759
 golden and it looks super super cheap 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.530
 then I must buy it and well here 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.530
 they have it let's get it out now yes 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.250
 It is very beautiful very elegant and I 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.920
 love 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.290
 for me it is the most elegant device and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.600
 most beautiful of all the crows that you 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.120
 you can find now and see what 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.430
 nice look here we are going to remove it for 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.530
 that you can see a little more of 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.440
 detail how is 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.209
 several sensors has a reader 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.490
 pulse to measure the pulsations that 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.170
 you have to be here a little bit out there 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.720
 they say that it is very easily scratched from the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.780
 bottom part and screen not so much 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.370
 it's quite good then I think the link 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.530
 I think I can not leave them in the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.330
 description because it was like an offer 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.630
 passenger then I do not think they find 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.280
 already the offer but anyway anyway I 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.840
 I'll leave you something in the description because 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.480
 they want to see it 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.200
 it's very beautiful they synchronize with what 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.580
 is your phone via bluetooth and good 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.920
 they simply speak that download to 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.540
 android wheel and you can change it up 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.100
 what are the covers and all that type 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.790
 of things I think they inhabit in other 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.099
 downloads 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.799
 and it looks like it's already turning on 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:25.510
 device and I put it to see what 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.510
 device wonder 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.130
 incredible I love low here do not give a 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.720
 tutorial if we want we can 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.640
 admit it I'm going to skip it because 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.590
 I had just seen it, there is already the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.440
 established connection we can turn it on and 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.880
 let's wait a little bit more 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.040
 we can add the desire of the clock 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.890
 we can download you various applications 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.930
 use several things voice commands is 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.460
 quite interesting soon I will do 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.350

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.330
