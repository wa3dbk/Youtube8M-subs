00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.840
 And there, guys, beauty rafael, I'm here. 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.090
 here for you but nobody could go 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.580
 of 3 and do not even reply I want to talk 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.279
 with you a little about frank a good 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.140
 frank a is something that is essential in 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.880
 neighborhood their children and I do not see 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.619
 people making think more people 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.170
 should learn to do this because 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.940
 this would make it much easier in the life of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.800
 some players and also in the lives of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.059
 golfing teams of 300 films that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.550
 I say is when you're playing when 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.079
 You have a team there and a good internal part. 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.410
 facing the enemy and can not 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.610
 kill them but anyway no one tries 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.070
 take a turn nobody is doing 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 nothing to get the guys by or 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.000
 back and franchise in case you are doing 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.800
 a turn to take the faces aside or 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.230
 get the guy by the back get 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.059
 unsuspecting enemy and this one is going to be 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.770
 a good example is from here the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.949
 Pharmaceutical giant is such a good weapon. 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.340
 to play but I was just kidding 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.080
 with herself and here this map made a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.390
 very annoying thing when I saw that my 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.159
 team could not advance prime with the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.350
 if the baby also chemistry that she 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.689
 was not so protected but I gave a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 way to get fast and very easy 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.020
 I almost even died to get her. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.270
 but it was still easy to get and me 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.619
 that it is often more difficult and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.090
 what happens 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.450
 active emicon bm with ahb the team and has 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.790
 basically if you stop at 50 50 per 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.850
 cent for 2011 will finally have a 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.610
 side of the other drugs 2011 to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.369
 be able to hold them and often when 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 Do you take a 2011 or do you catch yourself? 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.540
 catch ab 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.610
 the whole enemy team is going to 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.049
 conquer the brow and your team will also 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.000
 have to control myself 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.860
 and it becomes much more difficult 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.020
 team is attacking catching 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.180
 semiconsciousness because in the case of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.649
 closing here is more difficult it was still 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.549
 because it is very open and willing to follow 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.979
 with ons 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.630
 then what to do in such a situation? 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.000
 this action here my team was going from 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.430
 beachfront enemy team could not 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.840
 I could not get over myself with or without 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.560
 air but could not help me 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.810
 with 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.250
 the time her explode does not 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.110
 I could do nothing, the team stayed 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.500
 basically from the punch-headed punch 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.080
 because he was not going to have to gain from the enemy 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.520
 in this m with a rectangle itself and the worst 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.610
 is that the whole team is coming all the time 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.200
 It's dying and I 've seen it no longer 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.670
 at that time I was already dying're 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.160
 grenade and I saw that the staff was 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.900
 not expand yet too large than 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.970
 seems connected at this time since it had 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.470
 ammunition side and have two grenades and 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.900
 who wants two days to make a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.910
 Related Time Spam 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.440
 but when I saw what was happening 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.209
 here the team could not put together because 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.220
 also had snip on the stones 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.040
 There were people wanting everything that is singing. 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.630
 there I think the following way 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.430
 to keep punching at the point of a knife 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.650
 it will not work, we will go 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.940
 die will die and in the end will not 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.670
 achieve but will not be able to do 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.920
 no crap will miss the game already 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.180
 first starting the first part of the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.549
 fish the subway 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.209
 for those who do not know this stop is well 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.890
 difficult 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.920
 helping parties are also difficult but 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.340
 here I find it much more difficult because the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.109
 when you have a team with the 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.060
 gun and you do not have to see 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.530
 when the team lost in semi with and as 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.910
 you can see there is a lot of local can be 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.950
 glitch network has very local one 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.989
 can stay in the energy snip stones of the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.970
 which is something that can mess up to 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.739
 My gosh, your team. 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.340
 in case my team was also playing 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.380
 here and it's not good that she then me 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.780
 I had a different idea instead of getting 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.640
 here punching my knife 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.700
 I ended up dying this biotype today. 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.650
 decided to take another route because I 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.450
 I saw that would not work was how can 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.859
 see the whole team if you look at the map 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.660
 Can you see that my whole team 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.670
 dying in that part that every team 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.489
 literally this part is dying and 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.840
 I'm due at any moment but I see 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.150
 What can not you afford to stay? 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.730
 here because a lot of people come here as 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.579
 The staff of the respol type there in the 10 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.780
 15 meters from me tells you now that 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.630
 I die, I decided to say the following. 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.130
 I decided to go back on the map because 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.200
 just connect the map if you lend 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.630
 attention all the team dying all around 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.910
 world like asshole and since there was no 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.739
 no one had a soul on this side 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.349
 playing funk so i had one 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.080
 vision that would be very good I came by 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.330
 this side and make the return on the map still 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.610
 behind or by the side of the enemy team 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.189
 and slowly killing them because it is to 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.409
 release a little decongest km with 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.639
 Because when people leave here and 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.110
 he convinced me at what point 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.830
 will be able to get there and will 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.449
 to arm 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.009
 but we have to find a way to 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.199
 pick up this part first 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.449
 at least to kill the enemy because they 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.330
 nor had time to respond already bring 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.129
 enough to defend them then I did 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.930
 I came to the personal foundation answered 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.840
 answer me and started to work 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.120
 it was already two people who have know 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.419
 killing my team that was trying 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.069
 emicon and there goes another one breaks the sni 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.990
 for he was in personal damage is 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.000
 everything normal and you can see that it is 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.159
 releasing that one in the front was a 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.680
 lot of kill without counting the more 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.419
 almost could have done and also and the team 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.669
 has also begun to advance in that 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.250
 part began to attack smoking and such and 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.590
 as I said decongesting the area and 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.479
 ended up dying but still the team 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.270
 Do not be late with agents. 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.039
 a bit to adm with what releases a 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.990
 space so the team can go there and 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.150
 She told me what they did now. 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.889
 while we're still in this part 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.379
 here trying to delay the filling of a 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.289
 enemy and also holding this part of the 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:39.690
 bridge because their team can not 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.310
 pull to defend me buy mariela and 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.719
 here you do not look that I always 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.729
 looking for the back because 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.650
 he replied carlos whenever you fan 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.900
 that there is a team and you stay close to the 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.940
 cloth in rush and you get 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.830
 More or less the back you are 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.659
 basically nothing to answer them then 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.430
 you have to be very careful and the 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.919
 Is this the funk result? 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.639
 many times you can save the match 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.289
 You can win the game by funk to the face. 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.839
 It's a very good thing that counts on 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.310
 defense also when it is difficult to defend 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:10.199
 You have been burned all cases where 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.520
 and you simply save the 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.589
 you think of your team from a 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.180
 very cool way still gets many 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:20.330
 that the only three I hope you have 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.330
 Enjoyed a hug and said more.
