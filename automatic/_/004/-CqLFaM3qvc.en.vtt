well we'll hold item taking the chance
to<00:00:15.750> look<00:00:16.110> over<00:00:16.259> the<00:00:16.700> stern<00:00:17.700> gear<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
to look over the stern gear and the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.029 
to look over the stern gear and the
propeller<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.779> shaft<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.349> the<00:00:19.439> zinc's<00:00:19.770> here

propeller and shaft and the zinc's here

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.159 
propeller and shaft and the zinc's here
look<00:00:20.759> the<00:00:20.849> propeller<00:00:21.180> looks<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.020> in

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:22.169 
look the propeller looks like it's in

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.900 
look the propeller looks like it's in
fine<00:00:22.410> shape<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.860> gave<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> bit<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.490> cleaning

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
fine shape I gave it a bit of a cleaning

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.439 
fine shape I gave it a bit of a cleaning
underwater<00:00:24.900> recently<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.090> doesn't<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.179> much

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
underwater recently and doesn't be much

underwater recently and doesn't be much
right<00:00:27.810> now<00:00:27.840> she's<00:00:28.619> moving<00:00:28.920> fine<00:00:29.400> need<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
right now she's moving fine need a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.119 
right now she's moving fine need a
little<00:00:30.869> bit<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.259> a<00:00:31.320> look<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> zinc<00:00:31.980> it

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
little bit of a look at the zinc it

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.410 
little bit of a look at the zinc it
looks<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.550> could<00:00:32.699> change<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.239> in

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
looks like we could change that in

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.259 
looks like we could change that in
another<00:00:33.629> few<00:00:33.960> months<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.589> fine<00:00:34.830> for<00:00:35.070> now

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
another few months but it's fine for now

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.119 
another few months but it's fine for now
this<00:00:36.269> is<00:00:36.449> a<00:00:36.480> very<00:00:36.780> profits<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.440> four-bladed

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
this is a very profits of four-bladed

this is a very profits of four-bladed
propellers<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.940> don't<00:00:39.089> see<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.269> lot<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.540> these

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

on sailboats if you think about

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
propeller design one of the things you

propeller design one of the things you
really<00:00:43.170> want<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.280> prop<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.180> gets

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
really want to have is a prop that gets

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.689 
really want to have is a prop that gets
the<00:00:46.050> most<00:00:46.199> Drive<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.920> most<00:00:47.129> power<00:00:47.340> from<00:00:47.579> your

and<00:00:49.050> sailing<00:00:49.770> props<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.280> often<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.699> compromise

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and sailing props are often a compromise

and sailing props are often a compromise
they<00:00:52.170> reckon<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
they reckon that you want to have the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.970 
they reckon that you want to have the
least<00:00:53.910> drag<00:00:54.270> under<00:00:54.629> sail<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.590> end<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:55.829> making

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
least drag under sail the end up making

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.459 
least drag under sail the end up making
a<00:00:56.190> small<00:00:56.489> little<00:00:56.789> two<00:00:56.969> bladed<00:00:57.239> propeller<00:00:57.469> very

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
a small little two bladed propeller very

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.900 
a small little two bladed propeller very
froth<00:00:58.739> haven't<00:00:59.070> done<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.340> they've<00:00:59.550> gone<00:00:59.670> for

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
froth haven't done that they've gone for

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.400 
froth haven't done that they've gone for
the<00:00:59.969> biggest<00:01:00.329> most<00:01:00.510> efficient<00:01:01.079> propeller

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the biggest most efficient propeller

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
the biggest most efficient propeller
design<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.280> looking<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.269> from

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
design you can get looking at it from

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.840 
design you can get looking at it from
the<00:01:03.539> stern<00:01:03.840> she's<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> huge<00:01:04.979> propeller<00:01:05.610> all

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the stern she's a huge propeller all

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.820 
the stern she's a huge propeller all
these<00:01:06.030> blades<00:01:06.360> would<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.259> slow<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.560> boat

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
these blades would really slow the boat

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.150 
these blades would really slow the boat
down

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
down

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.940 
down
so<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.570> idea<00:01:09.810> what<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.590> soon<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.830> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
so the idea what this is as soon as you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.649 
so the idea what this is as soon as you
put<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.160> in<00:01:11.340> neutral<00:01:11.490> she<00:01:12.450> immediately

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
put it in neutral she immediately

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.560 
put it in neutral she immediately
feathers<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.729> has<00:01:15.000> no<00:01:15.180> drag<00:01:15.420> at

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
feathers like this and has no drag at

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.929 
feathers like this and has no drag at
all<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.470> they're<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> bit<00:01:16.680> more<00:01:16.799> expensive<00:01:17.520> than

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
all so they're a bit more expensive than

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.359 
all so they're a bit more expensive than
a<00:01:17.970> regular<00:01:18.060> propeller<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.920> terms<00:01:20.189> of

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
a regular propeller but in terms of

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.249 
a regular propeller but in terms of
sailing<00:01:20.729> performance<00:01:21.420> most<00:01:21.600> people<00:01:21.900> reckon

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
sailing performance most people reckon

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
sailing performance most people reckon
the<00:01:22.409> feathering<00:01:23.159> or<00:01:23.340> folding<00:01:23.700> prop<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.210> gain

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
the feathering or folding prop can gain

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210 
the feathering or folding prop can gain
you<00:01:24.540> anywhere<00:01:24.810> from<00:01:24.990> half<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.439> full<00:01:25.530> nod<00:01:25.979> of

you anywhere from half to a full nod of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.399 
you anywhere from half to a full nod of
speed<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.759> light<00:01:27.600> sailing<00:01:28.079> day

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
speed a light sailing day

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.620 
speed a light sailing day
that's<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.220> need

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.120 

here<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> blades<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:34.230> feathered<00:01:34.590> but

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
here the blades are feathered but

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.680 
here the blades are feathered but
immediately<00:01:35.580> rotate<00:01:36.060> into<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.420> proper
