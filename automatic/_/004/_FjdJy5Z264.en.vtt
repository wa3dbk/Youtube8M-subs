of it slightly make an indent in the top

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.760 
of it slightly make an indent in the top
so<00:01:58.390> we<00:01:58.540> can<00:01:58.690> put<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.140> tea<00:01:59.710> in<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.650> then<00:02:02.650> you

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
can just pinch the top to redefine it

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.419 
can just pinch the top to redefine it
and<00:02:05.980> make<00:02:06.160> it<00:02:06.370> deeper<00:02:07.440> then<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.560> want<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.800> roll

out some more blue clay and cut off a
piece<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.700> then<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.840> want<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.050> attach<00:02:14.380> this

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
piece and then you want to attach this

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.740 
piece and then you want to attach this
to<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.070> side<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.730> cup<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:18.600> when<00:02:19.600> you've

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
to the side of the cup and when you've

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.750 
to the side of the cup and when you've
done<00:02:19.960> that<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.380> can<00:02:20.410> secure<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.280> smooth<00:02:21.610> it

done that you can secure and smooth it

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:39.270 
done that you can secure and smooth it
again

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.340 

it<00:02:40.280> should<00:02:40.430> look<00:02:40.550> like<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:41.050> then<00:02:42.050> you<00:02:42.200> want

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
it should look like this then you want

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.400 
it should look like this then you want
to<00:02:42.440> take<00:02:42.620> some<00:02:42.980> tan<00:02:43.520> colored<00:02:44.060> clay<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.569> roll

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
to take some tan colored clay and roll

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.790 
to take some tan colored clay and roll
it<00:02:45.470> into<00:02:45.830> a<00:02:46.130> pointed<00:02:46.990> snake<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.260> then<00:02:48.500> attach

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
it into a pointed snake and then attach

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.420 
it into a pointed snake and then attach
this<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.520> side<00:02:49.790> for<00:02:50.050> Sully's<00:02:51.080> home<00:02:51.709> things

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.940 
this to the side for Sully's home things
I<00:02:52.819> guess<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.660> then<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.170> can<00:02:54.350> secure<00:02:54.680> this

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
I guess and then you can secure this

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.230 
I guess and then you can secure this
very<00:02:56.290> subtly<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.530> then<00:02:58.490> repeat<00:02:58.850> this<00:02:58.970> for<00:02:59.209> the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
very subtly and then repeat this for the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.300 
very subtly and then repeat this for the
