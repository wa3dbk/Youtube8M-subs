00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
phone numbers so again just some things

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.170 
phone numbers so again just some things
to<00:04:35.979> think<00:04:36.039> about<00:04:36.220> there's<00:04:36.520> definitely<00:04:36.910> some

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
to think about there's definitely some

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.839 
to think about there's definitely some
room<00:04:37.710> for<00:04:38.710> improvement<00:04:38.770> here<00:04:39.460> in<00:04:39.760> the

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
room for improvement here in the

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.719 
room for improvement here in the
application<00:04:41.099> despite<00:04:42.099> the<00:04:42.280> fact<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:42.550> the

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
application despite the fact that the
