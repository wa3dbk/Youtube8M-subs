Physical Graffiti was very popular with

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.009 
Physical Graffiti was very popular with
me<00:00:11.429> at<00:00:11.580> least<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:12.179> know<00:00:12.420> how<00:00:12.599> well<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.900> did

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
me at least I know how well it did

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.390 
me at least I know how well it did
commercially<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.620> didn't<00:00:13.920> do<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.070> much

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
commercially I didn't do that much

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.980 
commercially I didn't do that much
research<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:17.359> was<00:00:18.359> actually<00:00:18.600> really

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
research on it but I was actually really

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.550 
research on it but I was actually really
looking<00:00:19.710> forward<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.960> listening<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> their

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
looking forward to listening to their

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.910 
looking forward to listening to their
follow<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:24.500> don't<00:00:25.500> know<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.740> some

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
follow up because I don't know for some

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.189 
follow up because I don't know for some
reason<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.340> had<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> feeling<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:27.990> going

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
reason I had a feeling that it was going

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.919 
reason I had a feeling that it was going
to<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.380> good<00:00:28.560> too<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.099> probably<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.269> maybe<00:00:30.689> not

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
to be good too and probably if maybe not

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.940 
to be good too and probably if maybe not
if<00:00:31.320> not<00:00:32.099> as<00:00:32.309> good<00:00:32.669> better<00:00:32.969> no<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.950> was

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
if not as good better no it was

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.200 
if not as good better no it was
basically<00:00:35.489> my<00:00:35.760> thought<00:00:36.450> process<00:00:36.960> going<00:00:37.290> into

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
basically my thought process going into

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.500 
basically my thought process going into
the<00:00:39.440> listening<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.800> presence<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:44.510> yeah

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the listening to presence and yeah

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.540 
the listening to presence and yeah
that's<00:00:45.719> getting<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:48.649> album<00:00:49.649> covered<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that's getting the album covered like a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
that's getting the album covered like a
family<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> table<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.379> something<00:00:52.710> I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
family just at a table or something I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.299 
family just at a table or something I
don't<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.100> get<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.110> don't<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.309> all

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
don't really get it but I don't know all

don't really get it but I don't know all
right<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> don't<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.820> any<00:00:57.059> strong<00:00:57.329> feelings

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
right I don't have any strong feelings

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.170 
right I don't have any strong feelings
for<00:00:58.079> against<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> don't<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.609> care

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
