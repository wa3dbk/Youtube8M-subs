usually<00:02:36.819> when<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.060> put<00:02:37.269> something<00:02:37.540> like<00:02:37.569> this

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
usually when you put something like this

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.710 
usually when you put something like this
in<00:02:38.049> it<00:02:38.650> means<00:02:38.950> something<00:02:39.400> significant<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.690> I
