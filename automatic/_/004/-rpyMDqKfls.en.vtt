00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
then we have a strange car because this

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.960 
then we have a strange car because this
is<00:02:49.240> 10,000<00:02:49.930> pounds<00:02:50.140> more<00:02:50.350> than<00:02:50.380> an<00:02:50.650> m135i<00:02:51.280> and

yet<00:02:52.240> it<00:02:53.170> has<00:02:53.890> less<00:02:54.100> talk<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:56.680> I'm<00:02:56.830> not<00:02:56.950> quite

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
yet it has less talk so I'm not quite

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.580 
yet it has less talk so I'm not quite
sure<00:02:57.630> what<00:02:58.630> they're<00:02:58.870> trying<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.290> do<00:02:59.470> in

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
wheelbase everything about it just feels

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.650 
wheelbase everything about it just feels
a<00:03:06.340> little<00:03:07.150> bit<00:03:07.420> more<00:03:07.480> grown-up<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:10.330> really

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
a little bit more grown-up and I really

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.150 
a little bit more grown-up and I really
like<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.900> rear<00:03:11.080> axle<00:03:11.440> location<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.010> rear

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
like the rear axle location the rear

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.980 
like the rear axle location the rear
axle<00:03:12.490> is<00:03:12.550> far<00:03:12.850> better<00:03:13.030> located<00:03:13.570> in<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:13.810> car

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
axle is far better located in this car

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.540 
axle is far better located in this car
than<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.440> one<00:03:14.590> series<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:15.310> deals

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
than it is in the one series it deals

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.280 
than it is in the one series it deals
with<00:03:15.640> this<00:03:15.790> talk<00:03:16.090> but<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.330> think

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
with this talk but I think

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.280 
of what an m3 might be like and it's
pretty<00:04:29.940> exciting<00:04:30.420> if<00:04:30.540> this<00:04:30.690> structure<00:04:31.140> is

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
pretty exciting if this structure is

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.710 
pretty exciting if this structure is
stiff<00:04:31.710> everything<00:04:32.670> about<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.180> is<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.330> high
