as<00:00:57.680> well<00:00:57.860> i<00:00:58.040> found<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:58.730> if<00:00:58.940> you're<00:00:59.480> gonna

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
as well i found that if you're gonna

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.330 
as well i found that if you're gonna
tackle<00:00:59.900> a<00:01:00.080> subject<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:00.590> have<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:00.890> respect<00:01:01.010> the

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
tackle a subject you have to respect the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.490 
tackle a subject you have to respect the
subject<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:01.940> we<00:01:02.180> can't<00:01:02.360> just<00:01:02.510> do<00:01:02.990> a<00:01:03.020> facade<00:01:03.440> of

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
subject so we can't just do a facade of

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.870 
subject so we can't just do a facade of
greek<00:01:03.890> architecture<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.490> have<00:01:04.520> to<00:01:04.670> really

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
greek architecture you have to really

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.540 
greek architecture you have to really
understand<00:01:05.390> what<00:01:06.080> are<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.470> proportions<00:01:06.770> how

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
understand what are the proportions how

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.450 
understand what are the proportions how
big<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.060> base<00:01:08.210> compared<00:01:08.720> to<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:08.840> column<00:01:09.259> and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
big is the base compared to a column and

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.330 
big is the base compared to a column and
compared<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.640> top<00:01:10.820> of<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:12.250> there's<00:01:13.250> gonna

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
compared to the top of it there's gonna

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.700 
compared to the top of it there's gonna
be<00:01:13.490> things<00:01:13.700> like<00:01:14.140> Cyclops's<00:01:15.140> Minotaur<00:01:15.680> things

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
be things like Cyclops's Minotaur things

and<00:01:17.900> we<00:01:17.960> wanted<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.259> make<00:01:18.410> sure<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:18.830> we<00:01:19.009> were

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
and we wanted to make sure that we were

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.760 
and we wanted to make sure that we were
faithful<00:01:19.970> to<00:01:20.149> that<00:01:20.180> type<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.660> mythology<00:01:21.259> of

faithful to that type of mythology of

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.830 
faithful to that type of mythology of
course<00:01:22.009> there's<00:01:22.280> always<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.850> slight<00:01:23.390> twist<00:01:23.660> or

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
course there's always a slight twist or

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.810 
course there's always a slight twist or
spin<00:01:24.110> that<00:01:24.470> will<00:01:24.979> put<00:01:25.130> on<00:01:25.250> things<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.670> make

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
spin that will put on things to make

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.090 
spin that will put on things to make
them<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:26.270> know<00:01:26.390> bigger<00:01:26.780> better<00:01:27.200> than<00:01:27.500> then

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
them you know bigger better than then

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.700 
them you know bigger better than then
they<00:01:28.340> may<00:01:28.640> be<00:01:29.060> represented<00:01:29.509> in<00:01:29.710> traditional

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710

mythology

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.109 

I<00:01:34.170> look<00:01:35.170> at<00:01:35.290> archetypes<00:01:35.799> these<00:01:36.580> recurring

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
I look at archetypes these recurring

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.090 
I look at archetypes these recurring
themes<00:01:37.450> in<00:01:37.720> humans<00:01:38.080> storytelling<00:01:38.710> what's<00:01:38.950> the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
themes in humans storytelling what's the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.210 
themes in humans storytelling what's the
most<00:01:39.250> efficient<00:01:39.820> way<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.590> communicate

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
most efficient way to to communicate

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.100 
most efficient way to to communicate
this<00:01:42.400> for<00:01:43.000> example<00:01:43.360> if<00:01:43.540> someone<00:01:43.570> has<00:01:43.990> to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
this for example if someone has to

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.780 
this for example if someone has to
represent<00:01:44.259> death<00:01:44.710> what<00:01:45.159> do<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.340> need<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.610> put

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
represent death what do you need to put

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.340 
represent death what do you need to put
in<00:01:45.909> there<00:01:46.150> in<00:01:46.330> order<00:01:46.720> for<00:01:46.930> him<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.080> look<00:01:47.290> like

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
we would be able to do it and as we

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.130 
we would be able to do it and as we
reach<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.790> last<00:02:52.970> game<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.480> we<00:02:53.840> push<00:02:54.020> the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
reach the last game and we push the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.480 
reach the last game and we push the
engine<00:02:54.350> as<00:02:54.440> far<00:02:54.620> as<00:02:54.709> we<00:02:54.770> could<00:02:54.920> with<00:02:55.100> one<00:02:55.250> point

requirements of a game like Ottawa we
knew<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.600> one<00:02:59.990> point<00:03:00.140> 0<00:03:00.290> was<00:03:00.440> not<00:03:00.590> gonna<00:03:00.740> be

knew that one point 0 was not gonna be

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.590 
knew that one point 0 was not gonna be
enough<00:03:01.100> so<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.520> huge<00:03:01.790> part<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.330> early

one helped us to start on you know the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.080 
one helped us to start on you know the

foundations of a game the second one

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.150 
foundations of a game the second one
will<00:03:23.330> really<00:03:23.600> really<00:03:23.870> show<00:03:24.170> people<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.739> few

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
will really really show people a few

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.440 
will really really show people a few
things<00:03:25.340> that<00:03:25.459> this<00:03:25.610> hard<00:03:25.820> ways<00:03:25.970> able<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.330> do

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
things that this hard ways able to do

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.780 
things that this hard ways able to do
and<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.900> believe<00:03:27.350> right<00:03:27.530> now<00:03:27.680> I'm<00:03:28.040> very<00:03:28.519> proud

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
and I believe right now I'm very proud

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.310 
and I believe right now I'm very proud
to<00:03:28.850> say<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.540> guys<00:03:29.690> who<00:03:29.870> actually<00:03:30.019> was

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
to say that the guys who actually was

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.930 
to say that the guys who actually was
and<00:03:30.769> they<00:03:30.920> have<00:03:31.040> pulled<00:03:31.310> off<00:03:31.430> probably<00:03:31.820> with

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
and they have pulled off probably with

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.759 
and they have pulled off probably with
the<00:03:32.209> best<00:03:32.660> technology<00:03:32.750> on<00:03:33.170> PSP<00:03:33.530> that's

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
the best technology on PSP that's

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.720 
the best technology on PSP that's
available<00:03:33.950> right<00:03:34.190> now

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.910 

sugah<00:03:40.180> ultimately<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.409> game<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.800> about

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
sugah ultimately the game is about

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.220 
sugah ultimately the game is about
brutal<00:03:42.550> combat<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.599> team<00:03:43.780> wanted<00:03:44.110> to

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
brutal combat and the team wanted to

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.530 
brutal combat and the team wanted to
make<00:03:44.379> sure<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.860> controls<00:03:45.310> were<00:03:45.760> seamless<00:03:46.330> a

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
make sure the controls were seamless a

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.110 
make sure the controls were seamless a

version<00:03:49.299> was<00:03:49.659> a<00:03:49.690> challenging<00:03:50.140> task<00:03:50.319> but<00:03:50.650> it's

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
version was a challenging task but it's

not<00:03:50.890> an<00:03:50.980> impossible<00:03:51.280> task<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:51.970> just<00:03:52.150> had<00:03:52.239> to

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
not an impossible task we just had to

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.089 
not an impossible task we just had to
really<00:03:52.599> approach<00:03:52.930> in<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.260> very<00:03:53.470> simple<00:03:53.950> manner

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.580 
really approach in a very simple manner
good<00:03:54.879> at<00:03:55.000> elements<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:55.750> start<00:03:56.230> simplifying

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
good at elements and start simplifying

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.350 
good at elements and start simplifying
controls<00:03:57.190> may<00:03:57.489> be<00:03:57.549> doubling<00:03:57.879> up<00:03:58.030> controls

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
controls may be doubling up controls

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.479 
controls may be doubling up controls
here<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:58.720> there<00:03:58.900> for<00:03:59.530> example<00:03:59.860> dodge<00:04:00.069> went

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
here and there for example dodge went

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.000 
here and there for example dodge went
from<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.849> analog<00:04:01.209> which<00:04:01.560> which<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.769> think

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
from the analog which which I think

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.559 
from the analog which which I think
would<00:04:03.069> be<00:04:03.220> natural<00:04:03.670> for<00:04:03.700> people<00:04:03.879> to<00:04:04.150> do<00:04:04.269> now

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
would be natural for people to do now

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.650 
would be natural for people to do now
having<00:04:05.319> played<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.620> God<00:04:05.799> of<00:04:05.890> all<00:04:06.010> games<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:07.000> two

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
having played to God of all games to two

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.020 
having played to God of all games to two
being<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:07.900> button<00:04:08.530> combination<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.250> first<00:04:09.760> at

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
being a button combination that first at

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.910 
being a button combination that first at
the<00:04:10.239> very<00:04:10.420> first<00:04:10.690> day<00:04:10.750> felt<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.560> little<00:04:11.769> awkward

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
the very first day felt a little awkward

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.520 
the very first day felt a little awkward
but<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:13.090> think<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.480> took<00:04:13.569> us<00:04:13.720> about<00:04:14.019> a<00:04:14.079> week<00:04:14.319> to

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
but I think it took us about a week to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.770 
but I think it took us about a week to
really<00:04:14.980> know<00:04:15.519> play<00:04:15.819> more<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.389> more<00:04:16.570> and

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
really know play more and more and

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.479 
really know play more and more and
realize<00:04:17.169> that<00:04:17.350> it<00:04:17.560> was<00:04:17.680> he<00:04:17.889> came<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.250> us

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
realize that it was he came to us

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.159 
realize that it was he came to us
naturally<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.120> now<00:04:19.419> sometimes<00:04:19.810> when<00:04:19.959> i<00:04:19.989> pick

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
naturally and now sometimes when i pick

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.110

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
windmill move which is really cool

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.670 
windmill move which is really cool
because<00:04:59.150> i<00:04:59.510> don't<00:04:59.750> think<00:04:59.780> you've<00:04:59.990> ever<00:05:00.050> got

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
because i don't think you've ever got

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
that out of god of our way before and

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:03.730 
that out of god of our way before and
what<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:02.960> get<00:05:03.080> out<00:05:03.140> of<00:05:03.320> this<00:05:03.410> is<00:05:03.560> a<00:05:03.590> very

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
what you get out of this is a very

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.200 
what you get out of this is a very
focused<00:05:03.980> attack<00:05:04.430> something<00:05:04.880> that<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.060> can

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
focused attack something that you can

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.120 
focused attack something that you can
target<00:05:05.360> on<00:05:05.570> one<00:05:05.780> enemy<00:05:05.990> that<00:05:06.560> will<00:05:06.710> do<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.860> lot

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
target on one enemy that will do a lot

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.250 
target on one enemy that will do a lot
of<00:05:07.160> damage<00:05:07.460> but<00:05:08.030> you<00:05:08.540> have<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.810> be<00:05:08.900> careful<00:05:09.080> to

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
of damage but you have to be careful to

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.750 
of damage but you have to be careful to
use<00:05:09.350> even<00:05:09.620> in<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:10.070> big<00:05:10.280> group<00:05:10.400> for<00:05:10.670> example

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
use even in a big group for example

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.450 
use even in a big group for example
because<00:05:11.300> at<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:11.900> end<00:05:11.930> of<00:05:12.080> that<00:05:12.200> move<00:05:12.440> you<00:05:13.190> end

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
because at the end of that move you end

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.100 
because at the end of that move you end
up<00:05:13.580> in<00:05:13.670> a<00:05:13.760> very<00:05:13.940> vulnerable<00:05:14.150> position<00:05:14.510> and

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
up in a very vulnerable position and

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.080 
up in a very vulnerable position and
what<00:05:15.800> we<00:05:15.980> wanted<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.370> give<00:05:16.550> with<00:05:16.700> that<00:05:16.850> was<00:05:17.060> a

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
what we wanted to give with that was a

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.670 
what we wanted to give with that was a
tactic<00:05:17.540> a<00:05:17.690> strategy<00:05:18.290> to<00:05:18.320> use<00:05:18.440> that<00:05:20.680> the

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
tactic a strategy to use that the

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.740 
tactic a strategy to use that the
puzzles<00:05:22.070> in<00:05:22.310> god<00:05:22.700> of<00:05:22.820> war<00:05:23.000> are<00:05:23.270> definitely

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
puzzles in god of war are definitely

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.240 
puzzles in god of war are definitely
very<00:05:23.780> important<00:05:24.260> elements<00:05:24.650> of<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.830> gameplay

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
very important elements of the gameplay

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.370 
very important elements of the gameplay
there's<00:05:25.940> a<00:05:26.000> lot<00:05:26.060> of<00:05:26.180> action<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:26.990> we<00:05:27.230> need<00:05:27.350> to

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
there's a lot of action and we need to

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.230 
there's a lot of action and we need to
break<00:05:27.680> up<00:05:27.710> some<00:05:28.130> of<00:05:28.160> that<00:05:28.370> with<00:05:28.640> some<00:05:28.820> downtime

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
break up some of that with some downtime

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.640 
break up some of that with some downtime
and<00:05:29.510> one<00:05:29.690> of<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:29.840> good<00:05:29.930> ways<00:05:30.110> of<00:05:30.260> doing<00:05:30.500> that

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
and one of the good ways of doing that

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.140 
and one of the good ways of doing that
is<00:05:30.710> by<00:05:31.100> giving<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.550> player<00:05:31.730> something<00:05:32.000> that

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
is by giving the player something that

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.370 
is by giving the player something that
they<00:05:32.330> have<00:05:32.450> to<00:05:32.570> do<00:05:32.720> where<00:05:32.990> they<00:05:33.080> actually<00:05:33.290> have

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
they have to do where they actually have

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.740 
they have to do where they actually have
to<00:05:33.440> exercise<00:05:33.800> in<00:05:33.950> mind

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750
