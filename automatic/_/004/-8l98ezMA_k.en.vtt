good<00:00:00.750> day<00:00:00.930> in<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.589> tutorial<00:00:01.829> I'm<00:00:02.370> gonna<00:00:02.610> show

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
good day in this tutorial I'm gonna show

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.269 
good day in this tutorial I'm gonna show
you<00:00:02.970> how<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> determine<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.470> true<00:00:04.830> length<00:00:05.040> of

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
you how to determine the true length of

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.770 
you how to determine the true length of
a<00:00:05.339> pentagonal<00:00:06.240> pyramid<00:00:08.030> here<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.150> have<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
a pentagonal pyramid here we have the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.499 
a pentagonal pyramid here we have the
