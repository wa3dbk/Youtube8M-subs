00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hello cj fans 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.790
 From cj Entus to now 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:17.520
 This is Klem Eun Hyun Woo , who was in charge of the jungle in the Frost team . 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:22.230
 Uh, today I'm going to go to Intel. 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.850
 I still want to say hello to you guys before I go 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.670
 I got a picture. 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.660
 Even if it is difficult 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:36.540
 I do not think it will be filtered as much as I do. 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.840
 I want to be very awkward but I have 80,000 won for you anyway. 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.710
 I'll try. 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.489
 Oh, the passion was 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.909
 If you are very fast 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.600
 If it was short, it seemed to be short and fast. 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:57.460
 If I look back now, it's already time. 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.460
 I think these are some of them. 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:06.260
 It seems to me that it is hard to justice a child in a tomb . 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:13.700
 What I want to say is 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:18.710
 I mean , in a word, I am expressing my appreciation for expressing myself. 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.790
 There's always something to say about it. 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.360
 It was 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:29.440
 It was not you, 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.440
 It's already so tired, it's always so hard 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:39.160
 The power that can rise and that which made it so really is now cj 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.960

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:48.450
 Because you were 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:52.210
 Well, not only me, but also the other team members do not really give up and work hard. 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.800
 I think I was able to run until now. 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.610
 I really want to thank you again for that. 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:06.520

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:18.030
 If you can really watch 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:24.250
 I would even more good grades, I Lad Jin Chi is a virtue 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:28.890
 That's why I can not leave more comfortably . 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.890
