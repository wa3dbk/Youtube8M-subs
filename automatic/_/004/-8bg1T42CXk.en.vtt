Chicago<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.500> think<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.799> third<00:01:14.189> week<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
Chicago is I think the third week of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.330 
Chicago is I think the third week of
June<00:01:15.360> Father's<00:01:15.900> Day<00:01:16.020> weekend<00:01:16.380> June<00:01:16.530> 21st<00:01:17.159> is

June Father's Day weekend June 21st is
the<00:01:17.520> public<00:01:17.820> Day<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.240> think<00:01:18.600> that's<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> first

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the public Day I think that's the first

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.520 
the public Day I think that's the first
one<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.950> anyway<00:01:20.340> here's<00:01:21.299> what<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.080> done<00:01:22.320> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
one so anyway here's what I have done so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
one so anyway here's what I have done so
far<00:01:22.770> originally<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:23.850> gonna<00:01:23.909> finish<00:01:24.720> off

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
far originally I was gonna finish off

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
far originally I was gonna finish off
the<00:01:25.080> mountain<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.979> Rock<00:01:26.340> work<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.909> me<00:01:27.000> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the mountain but Rock work for me is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
the mountain but Rock work for me is
pretty<00:01:27.540> easy<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.320> takes<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.770> lot<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> time

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
pretty easy it just takes a lot of time

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.370 
pretty easy it just takes a lot of time
so<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> decided<00:01:30.390> didn't<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.170> time

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
so I decided didn't have a lot of time

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.140 
so I decided didn't have a lot of time
so<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.590> work<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.890> some<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> design<00:01:32.610> elements

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
so I work on some of the design elements

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.359 
so I work on some of the design elements
because<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.110> do<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.350> real<00:01:34.530> fast<00:01:34.560> once

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
because I can do that real fast once

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.270 
because I can do that real fast once
school<00:01:35.640> gets<00:01:35.880> out<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.350> came<00:01:37.500> over<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.159> this

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
school gets out so I came over to this

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.609 
school gets out so I came over to this
area<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.600> area<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.140> an<00:01:40.229> exact

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
area and this area will be an exact

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.380 
area and this area will be an exact
replica<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.299> be

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
replica of this and this is going to be

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.389 
replica of this and this is going to be
a<00:01:42.420> speeder<00:01:42.960> base<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.740> able<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.189> into

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
a speeder base so be able to see into

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.749 
a speeder base so be able to see into
the<00:01:44.549> side<00:01:44.939> windows<00:01:45.630> there<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:47.189> needed<00:01:47.399> some

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the side windows there and I needed some

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.450 
the side windows there and I needed some
sort<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.119> door<00:01:48.540> design<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.380> keep<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.070> mind<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
sort of door design and keep in mind it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.249 
sort of door design and keep in mind it
will<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.850> rot<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.600> will<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.780> Rock<00:01:52.049> work

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
will be rot there will be Rock work

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.560 
will be rot there will be Rock work
right<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.759> it'll<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> same<00:01:54.360> height

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
right here and it'll be the same height

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.950 
right here and it'll be the same height
as<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.409> side<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.790> wanted<00:01:57.360> some<00:01:57.659> kind<00:01:57.869> of

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
as on this side so I wanted some kind of

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.020 
as on this side so I wanted some kind of
cool<00:01:58.259> door<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.890> would<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.759> coming

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
cool door that would kind of be coming

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.510 
cool door that would kind of be coming
out<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.329> cave<00:02:00.570> area<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:02.100> supposed<00:02:02.460> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
out of a cave area and it's supposed to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.730 
out of a cave area and it's supposed to
be<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> little<00:02:02.880> bit<00:02:03.090> secret<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.659> yet<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.469> still

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
be a little bit secret but yet you still

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.719 
be a little bit secret but yet you still
know<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.040> there<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.520> want

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
know it's there and I just want

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.639 
know it's there and I just want
something<00:02:06.060> kind<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.390> cool<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.290> came<00:02:07.350> up<00:02:07.619> with

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
something kind of cool so I came up with

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.830 
something kind of cool so I came up with
this<00:02:07.920> door<00:02:08.670> design<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> would<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.660> how

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
this door design I would really like how

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.610 
this door design I would really like how
it<00:02:09.959> turned<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.560> there<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> gap<00:02:11.790> right

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
it turned out and there is a gap right

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.800 
it turned out and there is a gap right
there

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
there

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.970 
there
right<00:02:13.989> there<00:02:14.140> but<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.319> did<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.590> purpose

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
right there but I did that purpose

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.350 
right there but I did that purpose
because<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.310> think<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.610> just<00:02:15.730> adds<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.150> look

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
because I think it just adds the look

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.830 
because I think it just adds the look
and<00:02:16.989> when<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.560> separate<00:02:18.040> them<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.720> see

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
and when I separate them you can see

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.030 
and when I separate them you can see
this<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.080> obviously<00:02:20.440> not<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.650> final

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
this is obviously not the final

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.830 
this is obviously not the final
mechanism<00:02:21.550> right<00:02:21.640> here<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:22.540> they'll<00:02:22.690> be

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
mechanism right here but they'll be

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.080 
mechanism right here but they'll be
sliding<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.349> that<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.520> see<00:02:24.940> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
sliding like that and you see the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.729 
sliding like that and you see the
windowpanes<00:02:25.630> on<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.050> sides<00:02:26.290> there<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.650> then

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
windowpanes on the sides there and then

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.589 
windowpanes on the sides there and then
they<00:02:26.860> come<00:02:27.459> perfectly<00:02:27.940> together<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.480> that's

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
they come perfectly together and that's

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.630 
they come perfectly together and that's
the<00:02:28.720> thing<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:28.959> like<00:02:29.110> but<00:02:29.290> cheese<00:02:29.620> slopes<00:02:29.860> when

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
the thing I like but cheese slopes when

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.940 
the thing I like but cheese slopes when
you're<00:02:30.790> using<00:02:30.970> them<00:02:31.209> for<00:02:31.239> doors<00:02:31.800> they're<00:02:32.800> one

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
you're using them for doors they're one

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.979 
you're using them for doors they're one
of<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.130> only<00:02:33.280> pieces<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.940> come<00:02:34.120> exactly

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
of the only pieces that come exactly

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.740 
of the only pieces that come exactly
together<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.400> if<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.580> had<00:02:36.730> all<00:02:37.030> cheese<00:02:37.540> slopes

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
together so if I had all cheese slopes

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.990 
together so if I had all cheese slopes
along<00:02:38.080> here<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.860> all<00:02:39.340> cheese<00:02:39.640> slopes<00:02:39.819> along

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
along here and all cheese slopes along

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.780 
along here and all cheese slopes along
here<00:02:40.390> there<00:02:40.900> would<00:02:41.019> be<00:02:41.050> no<00:02:41.349> gap<00:02:41.590> however<00:02:42.580> I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
here there would be no gap however I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.000 
here there would be no gap however I
think<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.090> kind<00:02:43.269> of<00:02:43.300> looks<00:02:43.360> cool<00:02:44.290> with<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.800> gap

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
think it kind of looks cool with the gap

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.000 
think it kind of looks cool with the gap
right<00:02:45.280> there<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.940> can<00:02:46.120> see<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.540> in-between

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
right there you can see it in-between

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.949 
right there you can see it in-between
right<00:02:48.010> there<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.640> right<00:02:49.120> there<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.510> really

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
right there and right there so I really

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.020 
right there and right there so I really
like<00:02:50.080> how<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.350> design<00:02:50.709> turned<00:02:51.010> out<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.400> fit

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
like how this design turned out it fit

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.180 
like how this design turned out it fit
exactly<00:02:52.180> what<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.630> was<00:02:52.780> looking<00:02:52.840> for<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.160> I

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
exactly what I was looking for and so I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.250 
exactly what I was looking for and so I
just<00:02:54.370> will<00:02:54.730> make<00:02:54.760> one<00:02:55.180> more<00:02:55.390> set<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.780> these<00:02:55.930> for

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
just will make one more set of these for

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.949 
just will make one more set of these for
the<00:02:56.350> other<00:02:56.590> side<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.630> then<00:02:58.630> I'll<00:02:58.720> come<00:02:58.930> up

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
the other side and then I'll come up

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.630 
the other side and then I'll come up
with<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.230> final<00:02:59.440> kind<00:02:59.799> of<00:02:59.950> look<00:03:00.069> for<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.340> area

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
with a final kind of look for this area

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.000 
with a final kind of look for this area
and<00:03:00.970> then<00:03:01.900> I'm<00:03:01.989> not<00:03:02.140> sure<00:03:02.200> exactly<00:03:02.799> what

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
and then I'm not sure exactly what

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.770 
and then I'm not sure exactly what
speeders<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.670> only<00:03:03.790> have<00:03:03.970> two<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.450> these<00:03:04.540> green

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
speeders I only have two of these green

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.910 
speeders I only have two of these green
ones<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.110> one<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.349> these<00:03:05.440> red<00:03:05.620> ones<00:03:05.739> so<00:03:05.890> I

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
ones and one of these red ones so I

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.970 
ones and one of these red ones so I
won't<00:03:06.069> put<00:03:06.280> these<00:03:06.760> here<00:03:06.970> I'll<00:03:07.090> probably

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
won't put these here I'll probably

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.259 
won't put these here I'll probably
modify<00:03:08.980> these<00:03:09.040> bark<00:03:09.580> speeders<00:03:09.940> because<00:03:10.150> I

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
modify these bark speeders because I

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.630 
modify these bark speeders because I
have<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> bunch<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:10.900> these<00:03:11.049> right<00:03:11.349> there<00:03:11.640> so

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
have a bunch of these right there so

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.520 
have a bunch of these right there so
I'll<00:03:12.700> probably<00:03:12.959> modify<00:03:13.959> this<00:03:14.019> I<00:03:14.230> know<00:03:14.319> Chris

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
I'll probably modify this I know Chris

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.900 
I'll probably modify this I know Chris
productions<00:03:14.980> did<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.310> pretty<00:03:15.489> cool<00:03:15.700> where<00:03:15.849> he

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
productions did it pretty cool where he

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.280 
productions did it pretty cool where he
took<00:03:16.060> off<00:03:16.209> this<00:03:16.360> front<00:03:16.599> part<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.019> it<00:03:17.080> doesn't

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
took off this front part so it doesn't

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.580 
took off this front part so it doesn't
look<00:03:17.380> like<00:03:18.359> like<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.540> regular<00:03:19.989> set<00:03:20.230> does<00:03:20.410> it

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
look like like the regular set does it

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.470 
look like like the regular set does it
looks<00:03:20.709> more<00:03:20.890> like<00:03:21.130> an<00:03:21.280> actual<00:03:21.670> speeder<00:03:22.150> and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
looks more like an actual speeder and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.390 
looks more like an actual speeder and
you<00:03:23.140> just<00:03:23.290> put<00:03:23.470> some<00:03:23.620> tiles<00:03:23.829> there<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.250> might

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
you just put some tiles there so I might

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.400 
you just put some tiles there so I might
end<00:03:24.459> up<00:03:24.640> doing<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.510> then<00:03:26.019> putting<00:03:26.260> a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
end up doing that and then putting a

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.830 
end up doing that and then putting a
three<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.070> those<00:03:27.190> in<00:03:27.519> there<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.540> then<00:03:28.600> there

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
three of those in there and then there

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.110 
three of those in there and then there
will<00:03:28.900> be<00:03:28.959> tiles<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.560> just<00:03:29.739> some<00:03:29.890> other

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
will be tiles and just some other

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.630 
will be tiles and just some other
detailing<00:03:31.120> in<00:03:31.269> there<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:32.440> what<00:03:33.100> can<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.400> hope

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
detailing in there so what can you hope

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.759 
detailing in there so what can you hope
to<00:03:33.670> see<00:03:34.060> next<00:03:34.660> week<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.140> like<00:03:35.230> I<00:03:35.350> said<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.560> will

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
to see next week so like I said I will

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.250 
to see next week so like I said I will
not<00:03:35.890> be<00:03:36.010> tackling<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.670> rest<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.940> mountain

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
not be tackling the rest of the mountain

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.300 
not be tackling the rest of the mountain
probably<00:03:38.260> till<00:03:38.380> after<00:03:38.590> school<00:03:38.709> gets<00:03:38.980> out<00:03:39.069> just

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
probably till after school gets out just

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.710 
probably till after school gets out just
because<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.670> takes<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.940> long<00:03:40.030> time<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.569> I<00:03:40.600> don't

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
because it takes a long time and I don't

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.599 
because it takes a long time and I don't
have<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:40.959> lot<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.079> time<00:03:41.350> so<00:03:42.160> we<00:03:42.280> work<00:03:42.430> out<00:03:42.579> some

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
have a lot of time so we work out some

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.520 
have a lot of time so we work out some
more<00:03:42.850> design<00:03:43.239> elements<00:03:43.450> probably<00:03:44.260> more

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
more design elements probably more

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.090 
more design elements probably more
around<00:03:44.889> on<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:46.000> floor<00:03:46.299> area<00:03:46.720> as<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.319> saw<00:03:47.530> the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
around on the floor area as you saw the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.590 
around on the floor area as you saw the
last<00:03:48.250> time<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.489> showed<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.910> MOC<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.299> did<00:03:49.450> have

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
last time I showed the MOC I did have

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.150 
last time I showed the MOC I did have
this<00:03:49.720> for<00:03:49.959> this<00:03:50.079> staircase<00:03:50.319> kind<00:03:50.829> of<00:03:50.920> area

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
this for this staircase kind of area

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.009 
this for this staircase kind of area
I'll<00:03:51.700> probably<00:03:51.970> designed<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.690> rest<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:52.959> the

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
I'll probably designed the rest of the

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.650 
I'll probably designed the rest of the
floor<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.319> goes<00:03:53.590> on<00:03:53.709> top<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:54.100> there<00:03:54.250> for<00:03:54.970> next

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
floor that goes on top of there for next

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.879 
floor that goes on top of there for next
week<00:03:55.989> there's<00:03:56.170> just<00:03:56.290> gonna<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.590> bunch<00:03:56.680> of

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
week there's just gonna be a bunch of

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.789 
week there's just gonna be a bunch of
command<00:03:57.760> computer<00:03:58.510> tables<00:03:58.900> set<00:03:59.440> those<00:03:59.590> up<00:03:59.620> for

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
command computer tables set those up for

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.280 
command computer tables set those up for
this<00:03:59.859> week's<00:04:00.130> update<00:04:00.760> again<00:04:01.420> one<00:04:01.780> more<00:04:01.930> quick

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
this summer I'll probably be building up

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.229 
this summer I'll probably be building up
a<00:04:18.130> collection<00:04:18.280> line<00:04:18.639> so<00:04:18.850> if<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:18.970> wanna<00:04:19.120> do

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
a collection line so if you wanna do

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.080 
a collection line so if you wanna do
trades<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:20.470> sort<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.769> thing<00:04:20.950> but<00:04:21.639> what

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
trades and that sort of thing but what

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.339 
trades and that sort of thing but what
the<00:04:22.240> real<00:04:22.360> question<00:04:22.690> is<00:04:22.870> where<00:04:23.080> do<00:04:23.140> you<00:04:23.169> want

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349

me to put my sig figs most people have a

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.969 
me to put my sig figs most people have a
specific<00:04:25.970> area<00:04:26.440> where<00:04:27.440> they<00:04:27.650> put<00:04:27.860> their

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
specific area where they put their

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.920 
specific area where they put their
sigfigs<00:04:28.490> or<00:04:28.699> they<00:04:28.819> make<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.270> certain<00:04:29.449> creation
