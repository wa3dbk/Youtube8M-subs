00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.410
 nice guys are diavel and well 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.690
 found on the fig tree plaza canal today 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.610
 they are black company I wanted to apologize 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.870
 first of all for my absence on 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.940
 this channel here for years in activity 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.530
 however, precisely because of my problems 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.059
 then also those holidays that are there 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.379
 been all I failed to 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.449
 organize myself well then there was 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.250
 this little nativity on my channel 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.769
 however now I will resume precisely with 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.720
 my video a week I hope to 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.300
 keep precisely I'm in anyway 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.590
 somehow i make quiet kids 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.480
 in one with our own series of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.640
 players paid today four more 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.739
 players to bring you the first of today 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.660
 the rafael goalkeeper is a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.960
 very good goalkeeper guys because a lot 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.329
 paid at a good height to good dip 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.390
 with good catches and also good reflexes 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.399
 positioning boys and also a lot 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.710
 good especially in the pararigori ie 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.360
 I can assure you that it is there 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.039
 pararigori anyone can tell when you are 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.110
 found very well because I have a series a 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.699
 I really find silver and open rigors 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.250
 very well a bit like core with a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.680
 last year's competition here maybe 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.750
 because just a dynamic goalkeeper in 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.820
 these things here the second player of 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.280
 today and lisandro lopez 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.710
 the Argentine central defender of the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.869
 benfica does not have a good speed though 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.299
 boys very bummed both in the physical and 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.259
 even his defense is truly a 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.500
 player 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.450
 let's say a hammer in defense because 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.820
 however it does not pass anyone and if there 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.710
 makes boys pass very easily 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.990
 also good at hitting on corners 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.270
 of head with its meter and 88 of 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.820
 height so guys here for the price 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.850
 which is very much 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.190
 third video today perhaps the best of 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.150
 these four quan and I say maybe because 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.940
 the attacker has to come again 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.220
 guys we find blended copies 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.740
 boys is a median who plays exactly 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.080
 in barclays he is an absurd player 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.479
 this picture can assure you how 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.640
 you see it has a very good speed 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.460
 physical because he really has 86 and for one 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.280
 silver card is really a lot but 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.380
 guys the really most powerful thing is 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.990
 the defense with player here to remember is 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.570
 a let's say it is a chip of god thee second 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.039
 me because he remembers that god a lot 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.470
 in motion and everything is the classic 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.600
 median of which does not let anyone pass 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.420
 perhaps not very technical has especially 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.459
 of physical that prevents you from doing 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.230
 restarts just to create game ai 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.390
 opponents so try it for its price 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.430
 a high hole pro kids is worth 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.980
 all those fourth and last jerks 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.110
 today's player but the pam boys a 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.540
 the pa there are no second presentations 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.280
 me for him wandered in every fear is a 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.250
 absurd player an attacker 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.230
 really high breakthrough with the physical 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.600
 excellent speed last header 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.790
 great shot even that round really 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.700
 boys is absurd is a player who 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.260
 when you send in a doorway 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.140
 inserting something like that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.510
 surely guys I don't regret it 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.130
 never because this is an absurd player 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.959
 they were the four players today though 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.310
 I can assure you guys try them 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.010
 because anyway the ones you bring are 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.600
 always the good and paid players I will 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.880
 I thank you I urge you to leave me a lot 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.190
