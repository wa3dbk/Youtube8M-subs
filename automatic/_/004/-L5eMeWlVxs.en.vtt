we're going in for a closer look
first<00:00:16.770> up<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.100> big<00:00:17.279> guy<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.910> HP<00:00:18.270> pro

first up the big guy this is the HP pro
se<00:00:19.050> 12<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.680> as<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.250> name<00:00:20.400> suggests<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.939> has<00:00:21.060> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
se 12 and as the name suggests it has a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.269 
se 12 and as the name suggests it has a
12<00:00:21.630> inch<00:00:21.900> display<00:00:22.320> as<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.890> can<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.130> it's

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
12 inch display as you can see it's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.130 
12 inch display as you can see it's
actually<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.699> four<00:00:23.939> by<00:00:24.119> three<00:00:24.150> aspect<00:00:24.630> ratio

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.689 
actually in a four by three aspect ratio
which<00:00:25.350> apparently<00:00:25.710> makes<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> more<00:00:26.340> akin<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
which apparently makes it more akin to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.580 
which apparently makes it more akin to
using<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> piece<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.420> paper<00:00:27.570> now<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.289> got<00:00:28.439> a

higher<00:00:28.859> than<00:00:29.099> HD<00:00:29.279> resolution<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
higher than HD resolution so all the

higher than HD resolution so all the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

a<00:00:39.059> bit<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.329> shame<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.809> course<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.320> be

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
a bit of a shame but of course it can be

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.100 
a bit of a shame but of course it can be

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
see it does have quite a premium look it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.569 
see it does have quite a premium look it
has<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.480> silverback<00:00:45.989> which<00:00:46.829> sure<00:00:47.309> not

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
has this silverback which sure not

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
has this silverback which sure not
exactly<00:00:47.879> stylish<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.020> exactly<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
exactly stylish but it's exactly the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.779 
exactly stylish but it's exactly the
sort<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.829> thing<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.160> imagine<00:00:50.309> pulling

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
sort of thing you can imagine pulling

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.700 
sort of thing you can imagine pulling
out<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.360> business<00:00:51.600> suitcase<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
out of a business suitcase in a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.619 
out of a business suitcase in a
boardroom<00:00:53.010> meeting<00:00:53.300> it<00:00:54.300> has<00:00:54.480> these

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
boardroom meeting it has these

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.240 
boardroom meeting it has these
front-facing<00:00:55.170> speakers<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.890> well<00:00:56.100> which

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
front-facing speakers as well which

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.369 
front-facing speakers as well which
makes<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.550> quite<00:00:56.670> reminiscent<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.390> HTC's<00:00:57.989> one

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
makes it quite reminiscent of HTC's one

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.920 
makes it quite reminiscent of HTC's one
smartphone<00:00:59.340> inside<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.480> running<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

quad-core Qualcomm processor has clocked

quad-core Qualcomm processor has clocked
at<00:01:03.660> 2.3<00:01:04.290> gigahertz<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.250> should<00:01:05.400> be

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
at 2.3 gigahertz so that should be

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.859 
at 2.3 gigahertz so that should be
plenty<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.060> power<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.450> keep<00:01:06.479> everything

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
plenty of power to keep everything

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.990 
plenty of power to keep everything
running<00:01:07.260> along<00:01:07.560> nicely<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.640> an<00:01:08.760> interesting

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
running along nicely now an interesting

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.789 
running along nicely now an interesting
addition<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> stylus<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.590> which

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
addition is a stylus with this which

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
addition is a stylus with this which
allows<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.369> not<00:01:11.520> only<00:01:11.549> handwrite<00:01:12.540> your

notes<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> screen<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.950> actually<00:01:14.250> use<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
notes on the screen but actually use it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.460 
notes on the screen but actually use it
as<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> pen<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.119> regular<00:01:15.570> paper<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.380> will

has exactly the same feature so you can

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.640 
has exactly the same feature so you can
get<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.479> depending<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.020> whatever<00:01:25.350> size<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
get that depending on whatever size you

get that depending on whatever size you
want<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.830> go<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.850> here's<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.210> smaller

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
want to go for and here's a smaller

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.480 
want to go for and here's a smaller
model<00:01:27.659> lavishes<00:01:28.229> has<00:01:28.439> an<00:01:28.590> 8<00:01:28.829> inch<00:01:29.100> screen
