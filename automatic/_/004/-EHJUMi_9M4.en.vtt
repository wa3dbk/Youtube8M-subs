00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.260
 build you will be applied not only 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.020
 a great lesson on heroes but also 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.329
 quickly clean the creep lines and pick up 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.550
 measurements on the first level we take 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.239
 composite boom increases range 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.239
 found w 20 percent on the fourth 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.200
 level we take arsenal add 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.690

 seventh level we take talent excitement 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.329
 Auto-attack battles reduce to shock and 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.270
 our basic abilities as well as 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.989
 heroic that is in battle we can 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.979

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.630
 w and gun again at the tenth level 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.340
 Ultimate take on the main situation 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.799
 perhaps shelling 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.079
 This is a very good flash drive with a small one. 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.020
 smooth but thanks to talent the excitement of battle 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:20.259
 where it will be even less but this 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.209
 the ability to easily knock down so if in 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.329
 enemy team many abilities 

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:26.529
 control we take just a shower take 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.079
 Besides 

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:30.759
 a shower of retribution is well suited for so 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.729
 called combo wombo 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.549
 if our team has a lot of mass 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.969
 camps on level 13 we take ice 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.039
 shot our w slows down opponents on 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.229
 40 percent for two seconds 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.369
 thanks to this ability we can 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.490
 kite and sly wound at level 16 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:55.450
 There are as many as three options 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.149
 foot this talent executioner paddy cause 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.310
 40 percent more delayed damage 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.840
 immobilized and stunned targets 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.859
 stacks with our talents at level 13 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.679
 deceleration from w 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:11.130
 this talent suits us if we are not 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.770
 focus in battle and we have the opportunity 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.260
 quietly shoot and deal damage 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.080
 we take blood talent for blood or 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.050
 to run and as soon as possible 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.770
 get rid of the enemy hero 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.180
 either to separate yourself from the enemy 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.670
 tanks we take talent stone skin 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.980
 if the enemy team is not so much 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.950
 fat heroes enabled whom will 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.830
 take blood for blood besides 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.709
 if the enemy team has a lot about 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.220
 E-nis better use stone 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.870
 skin to survive I'm not easy 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.310
 recover lost 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.260
 and just increase your existing talent by 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.569
 twentieth level depends on 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.610
 how well do you survive the battle 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.340
 if you are not tricks then you have 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.890
 ability to use all your 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.650
 abilities and auto-hit then you 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.930
 improve your ultimate games but if you 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.340
 There are some problems with positioning 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.110
 better go storm charge remind 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.630
 there are many options on the shaft 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.150
 buildup I showed you only the most 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.769
 effective and most used build 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.790
