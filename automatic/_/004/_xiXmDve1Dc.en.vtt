00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.340 
idea to sprinkle little water over dry
spices

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.310 

to<00:03:16.950> make<00:03:17.220> sure<00:03:17.490> that<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.180> spices<00:03:18.720> don't<00:03:19.020> stick

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
to make sure that the spices don't stick

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:28.760 
to make sure that the spices don't stick
to<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.530> pan<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:21.480> doesn't<00:03:21.930> burn<00:03:26.840> as<00:03:27.840> you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
to the pan and it doesn't burn as you

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.390 
to the pan and it doesn't burn as you
can<00:03:28.920> see<00:03:29.190> now<00:03:29.550> our<00:03:30.140> spices<00:03:31.140> have<00:03:31.620> taken<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.130> nice

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
can see now our spices have taken a nice

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.240 
can see now our spices have taken a nice
rich<00:03:32.850> color<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:36.050> it's<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.230> time<00:03:37.500> now<00:03:37.800> we<00:03:37.860> add

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
rich color so it's the time now we add

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.170 
rich color so it's the time now we add
all<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.670> remaining<00:03:39.120> ingredients<00:03:40.790> we<00:03:41.790> start

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
all the remaining ingredients we start

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:50.800 
all the remaining ingredients we start
with<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.720> potatoes<00:03:48.320> mix<00:03:49.320> them<00:03:49.590> slightly

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
with the potatoes mix them slightly

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:58.970 
with the potatoes mix them slightly
until<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:52.350> spices<00:03:54.290> put<00:03:55.290> on<00:03:55.650> each<00:03:56.100> piece<00:03:57.980> then

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
until the spices put on each piece then

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.110 
until the spices put on each piece then
we<00:03:59.130> are<00:03:59.220> going<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.580> add<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:01.140> coconut<00:04:01.380> milk

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
we are going to add the coconut milk

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.960 
we are going to add the coconut milk

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
this point you might think that I said

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.030 
this point you might think that I said
this<00:04:13.350> is<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> nice<00:04:14.040> dry<00:04:15.030> cocktail<00:04:15.600> start<00:04:16.560> up<00:04:16.770> and

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
how come there is so much of liquid

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.120 
how come there is so much of liquid
around<00:04:20.450> we<00:04:21.450> have<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.900> cook<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.380> potatoes<00:04:22.890> in
