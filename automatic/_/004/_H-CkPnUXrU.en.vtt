00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.019
 hello everyone céreq I hope that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.280
 you're good that you have potato 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.780
 in any case, I'm fine 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.340
 today we find ourselves for 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.900
 episode 5 of the card comparisons 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.220
 of 14 football with the drum cards of 15 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.810
 we're finally halfway there it starts 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.949
 to be really interesting really 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.210
 players I understand you so this 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.609
 year that I have not badly tested on all 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.590
 two that I really enjoyed 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.809
 2 I have not too too is a play 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.059
 game can not judge too much because 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.590
 I played but no more we find ourselves 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.020
 right away guys so my first 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.170
 player guys this is kabyle kiabi's 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.700
 barca which is 89.2 general who of 186 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.930
 so that's going to be a pretty season 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.379
 complicated it's true it starts to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.270
 become old 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.250
 but hey it's still a star on 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.270
 can last even a legend a semi 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.190
 legend we will say it goes from 89 to 86 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.260
 so the small least 3.2 general by 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.840
 against the stats 66 years old she says that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.000
 do not move the 73rd you go back to 72 are 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.850
 92 exceeds restricted to 91 so 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.680
 appear as said chaabi 86.2 tribe to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.229
 85 defense 3.8 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.420
 previously he had 54 of 58 model head 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.040
 currency is the second player a player 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.689
 that I have always appreciated that really 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.979
 I played a lot with fifa 14 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.170
 I wanted to buy it several fronts 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.750
 toth and many times I had the regret 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.710
 to see that I had passed credit 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.810
 frankly aguero it's really been 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.939
 for me it's a bit similar to suarez 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.850
 that two both in a team that 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.110
 would do that would be bad luck but 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.390
 will really have to look really nice 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.970
 same problem next so his general 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.009
 certainly 102 2 his speed does not move 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.900
 the shots at the mans 2-2 the passes 2 4 the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.189
 dribble -2 like all players 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.320
 offensive you know it for four 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.140
 episodes now defense vs so 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.970
 from 44 to 28 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.870
 before he was 72 of head and 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.010
 now at 66.2 physics 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.330
 so it's true that a lot of players 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.050
 lower god so then descent 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.190
 independence so all that is the state 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.290
 does everything so the general has gone down 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.810
 directly di maria a player who was 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.110
 transferred with a small change of 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.810
 post 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.040
 that's still 86.2 general 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.690
 true that real madrid he starts 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.940
 play offensive midfielder after the arrival of 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.050
 be hungry since beautiful and there I 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.790
 sense that it will be done but it all started 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.350
 the attacking midfielder I prefer them a 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.610
 offensive midfielder in the middle right but 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.750
 I find that really di maria is 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.820
 really an exceptional player 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.050
 I have not badly I have not bad test 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.460
 but I can not really give my opinion 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.050
 still above because I played 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.810
 a lot on fifa very just revenge 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.240
 very good fifa 14 a little less good but 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.430
 I think that in attacking midfield in b 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.900
 mark the forgiveness slips who can 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.250
 really hurt so the general moves 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.410
 not at the speed does not move the shots 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.940
 increase passes pass forgiveness 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.730
 do not move the dribble anymore to the 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.270
 defense - it does not take too often the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.940
 attackers and offensives descent from 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.160
 15,25 him not just - so it's okay and 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.300
 before he had 62 head he was 75 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.870
 since I did not think he was too 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.700
 the crime the fourth player is rolls 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.959
 royce had a player that I loved 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.030
 even think it's the player I've 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.350
 most appreciated this year frankly 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.820
 with the executioners frankly I did 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.330
 many times small hybrids 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.420
 aguero royce is really voice is 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.800
 really and super super strong forgiveness in 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.290
 bundesliga of times I had to ship it 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.000
 for ribery and cédric riz brri for me 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.200
 was not as good as Russian just he had 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.230
 five stars so eiffage was taking 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.000
 ribery but serves squirrels at a super 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.770
 hit a super speed super face 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.330
 super really live an excellent 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.590
 player so he takes +1 despite his 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.239
 heavy injury that him during the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.590
 season so I did not really understand the 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.510
 the healthiest vultures that are fun 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.700
 the speed does not move the shots do not 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.800
 do not move the passes +4 the dribble does not 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.680
 do not move the defense - 14 before y 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.750
 had 70 passes and 65 of that physical 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.459
 promise frankly successful first is 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.720
 a player that I have not tested too much 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.640
 it's like kiabi i'm not going too much 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.320
 test muller really muller who is 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.810
 really one for me a cutting player 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.150
 really in bundesliga it is not said 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.500
 not too me not huge we'll say by 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.880
 against everything that escapes this cup 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.230
 of the euro world and all I find that 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.790
 mueller had really always present 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.730
 that's why they earn the most 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.140
 healthy 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.250
 no changes post for him the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.739
 speed - 1 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.420
 tit re three passwords plus the 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.280
 dribble does not move the defense - 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.829
 had previously been 74 leading 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.360
 now he has 72 physics so 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.030
 I hope you enjoyed episode 5 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.590

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.659
