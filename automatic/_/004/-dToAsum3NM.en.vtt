00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
it goes in its gonna sizzle very nicely

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.010 
it goes in its gonna sizzle very nicely
and<00:00:31.579> you<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:32.759> even<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.270> wait<00:00:33.480> until<00:00:33.870> it

and you don't even have to wait until it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.139 
and you don't even have to wait until it
melts<00:00:34.380> completely<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.579> go<00:00:35.760> ahead

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
melts completely you can just go ahead

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.690 
melts completely you can just go ahead
and<00:00:36.540> put<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.500> zucchinis<00:00:38.070> inside<00:00:38.460> I'm

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and put your zucchinis inside I'm

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.510 
and put your zucchinis inside I'm
putting<00:00:39.000> them<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:40.260> will<00:00:40.440> see<00:00:40.770> now<00:00:41.070> that

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
putting them in you will see now that

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.910 
putting them in you will see now that
the<00:00:42.390> flowers<00:00:42.930> which<00:00:43.200> are<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.440> course<00:00:43.469> much

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the flowers which are of course much

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.000 
the flowers which are of course much
finer<00:00:44.340> than<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.570> actual<00:00:45.899> baby<00:00:46.230> zucchinis

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
finer than the actual baby zucchinis

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.639 
finer than the actual baby zucchinis
they<00:00:47.610> will<00:00:47.789> start<00:00:48.090> fading<00:00:48.360> much<00:00:48.780> faster<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
they will start fading much faster and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.299 
they will start fading much faster and
decreasing<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.370> volume<00:00:51.710> that<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.860> absolutely

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
decreasing in volume that is absolutely

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.299 
decreasing in volume that is absolutely
fine<00:00:53.989> you'll<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.680> bit<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.800> crunch

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
fine you'll have a little bit of crunch

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.720 
fine you'll have a little bit of crunch
with<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.090> baby<00:00:57.570> vegetables<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.160> flowers

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
with the baby vegetables and the flowers

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.459 
with the baby vegetables and the flowers
will<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.090> kind<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.390> more<00:01:00.600> mushy<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.109> very

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
will be kind of more mushy but very

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.389 
will be kind of more mushy but very
flavorful

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
flavorful

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.660 
flavorful
so<00:01:02.879> I'm<00:01:03.199> rapidly<00:01:04.199> seasoning<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.159> around<00:01:05.430> I'm

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
so I'm rapidly seasoning them around I'm

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730 
so I'm rapidly seasoning them around I'm
adding<00:01:05.909> some<00:01:06.090> salt<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.840> fade<00:01:07.290> them<00:01:07.500> even

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
adding some salt now to fade them even

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.050 
adding some salt now to fade them even
more<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.299> how<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.689> volume<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
more and you will see how the volume of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.870 
more and you will see how the volume of
the<00:01:12.060> flowers<00:01:12.600> after<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.140> salt<00:01:13.439> will<00:01:13.920> decrease

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the flowers after the salt will decrease

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.760 
the flowers after the salt will decrease
considerably

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
considerably

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.380 
considerably
we're<00:01:16.770> losing<00:01:17.220> liquid<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
we're losing liquid now and this is a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
we're losing liquid now and this is a
moment<00:01:18.810> later<00:01:19.049> we've<00:01:19.350> lost<00:01:19.560> quite<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.920> bit<00:01:20.009> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
moment later we've lost quite a bit of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800 
moment later we've lost quite a bit of
liquid<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> volume<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> dish<00:01:21.780> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
liquid we see the volume of the dish is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.350 
liquid we see the volume of the dish is
basically<00:01:22.470> shrunk<00:01:22.979> by<00:01:23.310> at<00:01:23.430> least<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.759> half<00:01:23.790> and
