in<00:00:53.219> Germany<00:00:53.699> about<00:00:53.879> 1900<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
in Germany about 1900 and this is a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.990 
in Germany about 1900 and this is a
three<00:00:57.449> note<00:00:57.719> 2<00:00:58.140> horn<00:00:58.440> example<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
three note 2 horn example and so the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.740 
three note 2 horn example and so the
clock<00:01:00.270> uses<00:01:00.719> 2<00:01:00.989> horns<00:01:02.090> but<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> movement<00:01:03.629> has

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
clock uses 2 horns but the movement has

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
clock uses 2 horns but the movement has
a<00:01:03.780> complication<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.769> causes<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
a complication that causes one of the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
a complication that causes one of the
notes<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.479> flutter<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.170> play<00:01:07.770> twice<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.990> that

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
notes to flutter and play twice and that

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.350 
notes to flutter and play twice and that
call<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.470> repeated<00:01:11.070> once<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.549> each<00:01:11.580> hour<00:01:11.970> so

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
call is repeated once for each hour so

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.289 
call is repeated once for each hour so
at<00:01:12.720> one<00:01:12.990> o'clock<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> three<00:01:14.760> note<00:01:15.000> call

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
at one o'clock you get a three note call

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.840 
at one o'clock you get a three note call
as<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.200> bugler<00:01:16.560> comes<00:01:16.950> out<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.369> large<00:01:17.610> double

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850

doors<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> top<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.900> case<00:01:19.520> we're<00:01:20.520> like

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
doors on the top of the case we're like

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.770 
doors on the top of the case we're like
12<00:01:21.030> o'clock

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
12 o'clock

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.840 
12 o'clock
you'd<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.710> 36<00:01:23.490> notes<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.860> each<00:01:25.860> hour<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.430> also

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you'd get 36 notes and each hour is also

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.140 
you'd get 36 notes and each hour is also
signified<00:01:27.450> by<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.720> strike<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.409> gum<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> it's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
signified by a strike to the gum so it's

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
signified by a strike to the gum so it's
pretty<00:01:30.360> nice<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.900> get<00:01:30.990> three<00:01:31.350> notes<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> a
