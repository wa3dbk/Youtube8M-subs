but before we get into actual different

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.269 
but before we get into actual different
guns<00:00:23.560> we<00:00:24.560> got<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:24.830> go<00:00:24.980> over<00:00:26.590> like<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.770> basics

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
guns we got to go over like the basics

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.940 
guns we got to go over like the basics
that<00:00:28.550> are<00:00:29.239> pretty<00:00:29.419> much<00:00:29.570> true<00:00:29.989> for<00:00:30.500> all<00:00:30.649> guns

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
that are pretty much true for all guns

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.770 
that are pretty much true for all guns
in<00:00:31.279> general<00:00:33.760> one<00:00:34.760> thing<00:00:34.969> that's<00:00:35.149> important<00:00:35.660> to

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
in general one thing that's important to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.120 
in general one thing that's important to
know<00:00:35.809> that<00:00:37.899> running<00:00:38.899> forward<00:00:39.469> or<00:00:39.710> running

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
know that running forward or running

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.760 
know that running forward or running
backwards<00:00:40.809> while<00:00:41.809> you're<00:00:42.050> firing<00:00:42.350> is

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
backwards while you're firing is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.120 
backwards while you're firing is
incredibly<00:00:43.670> inaccurate<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.980> it<00:00:45.980> will

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
incredibly inaccurate and it will

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.700 
incredibly inaccurate and it will
definitely<00:00:46.640> hurt<00:00:46.970> your<00:00:47.150> shot<00:00:47.450> as<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:48.500> will<00:00:48.680> show

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
definitely hurt your shot as I will show

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.770 
definitely hurt your shot as I will show
right<00:00:49.100> here<00:00:51.190> if<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:52.250> see<00:00:52.430> my<00:00:53.270> crosshair<00:00:53.750> is

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
right here if you see my crosshair is

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.040 
right here if you see my crosshair is
exactly<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.770> this<00:00:55.160> target<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:55.850> my<00:00:56.540> bullets

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
exactly on this target and my bullets

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
exactly on this target and my bullets
are<00:00:57.610> way<00:00:58.610> off<00:00:59.079> some<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.170> them<00:01:00.290> are<00:01:00.440> semi<00:01:00.800> close

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
are way off some of them are semi close

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.999 
are way off some of them are semi close
but<00:01:01.660> if<00:01:02.660> you're<00:01:02.930> aiming<00:01:03.290> for<00:01:03.470> somebody's<00:01:03.829> head

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
but if you're aiming for somebody's head

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.550 
but if you're aiming for somebody's head
you<00:01:04.159> would<00:01:04.280> have<00:01:04.430> missed<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.570> as<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.049> can<00:01:06.320> see

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
you would have missed so as you can see

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.219 
you would have missed so as you can see
running<00:01:06.920> forward<00:01:07.399> bad<00:01:07.670> idea<00:01:08.060> same<00:01:08.780> with<00:01:08.930> back

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.560 

backwards<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:12.590> look<00:01:12.710> like<00:01:12.890> I<00:01:13.159> hit<00:01:13.520> once<00:01:13.880> that's

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
backwards it look like I hit once that's

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.940 
backwards it look like I hit once that's
kind<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:14.930> luck<00:01:15.140> though<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.499> doesn't<00:01:15.679> always

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
kind of luck though it doesn't always

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.779 
kind of luck though it doesn't always
happen<00:01:16.719> but<00:01:17.719> as<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.109> can<00:01:18.229> see<00:01:18.789> incredibly

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
happen but as you can see incredibly

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.469 
happen but as you can see incredibly
inaccurate<00:01:20.210> uh<00:01:21.819> what's<00:01:22.819> a<00:01:22.909> little<00:01:23.179> bit<00:01:23.329> more

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
inaccurate uh what's a little bit more

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.440 
inaccurate uh what's a little bit more
accurate<00:01:23.990> but<00:01:24.319> still<00:01:25.280> pretty<00:01:25.460> bad<00:01:25.759> is

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
accurate but still pretty bad is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.099 
accurate but still pretty bad is
strafing<00:01:27.259> at<00:01:27.409> full<00:01:27.590> speed<00:01:30.399> actually<00:01:31.399> knots

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
strafing at full speed actually knots

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.199 
strafing at full speed actually knots
yeah<00:01:33.109> I<00:01:33.530> don't<00:01:34.009> know<00:01:34.100> if<00:01:34.219> it's<00:01:34.340> much<00:01:34.939> better

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
yeah I don't know if it's much better

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.859 
yeah I don't know if it's much better
but<00:01:36.139> yeah<00:01:36.829> that's<00:01:37.039> also<00:01:37.549> inaccurate<00:01:38.389> so

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
but yeah that's also inaccurate so

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.169 
but yeah that's also inaccurate so
basically<00:01:39.350> you're<00:01:40.340> like<00:01:40.490> well<00:01:40.700> how<00:01:40.789> do<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:40.969> keep

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
basically you're like well how do I keep

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.929 
basically you're like well how do I keep
on<00:01:41.389> the<00:01:41.509> move<00:01:41.539> and<00:01:42.200> still<00:01:42.740> hit<00:01:42.950> people<00:01:43.369> because

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
on the move and still hit people because

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.719 
on the move and still hit people because
if<00:01:44.299> I<00:01:44.450> spend<00:01:44.779> so<00:01:45.109> of<00:01:45.529> course<00:01:46.069> I'm<00:01:46.399> going<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.609> get

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
if I spend so of course I'm going to get

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.629 
if I spend so of course I'm going to get
killed<00:01:47.319> so<00:01:48.319> what<00:01:48.499> do<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.649> do<00:01:48.709> well<00:01:49.249> basically

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:49.639 
killed so what do I do well basically

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:52.929 
killed so what do I do well basically
the<00:01:50.060> best<00:01:50.240> thing<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.569> do<00:01:50.899> is<00:01:51.789> when<00:01:52.789> you're

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
the best thing to do is when you're

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.080 
the best thing to do is when you're
strafing<00:01:53.770> you're<00:01:54.770> going<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.039> strafing<00:01:55.849> and

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
strafing you're going to strafing and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.629 
strafing you're going to strafing and
switching<00:01:56.959> directions<00:01:57.429> you're<00:01:58.429> going<00:01:58.579> to

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639 
switching directions you're going to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.609 
switching directions you're going to
fire<00:01:58.999> in<00:01:59.329> that<00:01:59.719> moment<00:02:00.020> when<00:02:00.469> you're

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
fire in that moment when you're

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.649 
fire in that moment when you're
switching<00:02:00.920> directions<00:02:01.249> and<00:02:01.969> in<00:02:02.179> that<00:02:02.209> moment

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
switching directions and in that moment

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:14.520 
switching directions and in that moment
you're<00:02:03.289> pretty<00:02:03.529> accurate<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.310> as<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.610> can<00:02:13.790> see

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
you're pretty accurate so as you can see

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.770 
you're pretty accurate so as you can see
I'm<00:02:15.530> not<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.950> very<00:02:16.190> good<00:02:16.280> shot<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.120> if<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.630> was<00:02:17.750> a

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
I'm not a very good shot but if I was a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.190 
I'm not a very good shot but if I was a
better<00:02:17.990> shot<00:02:18.349> it<00:02:18.530> was

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
better shot it was

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.690 
better shot it was
would<00:02:19.739> be<00:02:19.890> more<00:02:20.129> on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:21.230> more<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.440> target

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
would be more on the more on the target

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.839 
would be more on the more on the target
but<00:02:23.700> that's<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.030> lot<00:02:24.269> better<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:25.019> gonna

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
but that's a lot better it's gonna

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.520 
but that's a lot better it's gonna
definitely<00:02:26.849> be<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.540> lot<00:02:27.780> better<00:02:27.930> than<00:02:28.260> trying

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
definitely be a lot better than trying

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:37.160 
definitely be a lot better than trying
to<00:02:30.290> spray<00:02:31.290> all<00:02:31.319> over<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.830> place<00:02:32.040> running<00:02:36.170> see

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
to spray all over the place running see

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.059 
to spray all over the place running see
another<00:02:37.590> thing<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:39.200> say<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.260> want<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.769> spray

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
another thing is say you want to spray

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.589 
another thing is say you want to spray
with<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> weapon<00:02:41.760> actually<00:02:42.750> it's<00:02:43.019> more<00:02:43.290> ammo<00:02:44.599> if

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
with a weapon actually it's more ammo if

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.900 
with a weapon actually it's more ammo if
you<00:02:45.840> want<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.170> spray<00:02:46.500> with<00:02:48.890> any<00:02:49.890> weapon<00:02:50.220> it's

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
you want to spray with any weapon it's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.539 
you want to spray with any weapon it's
going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.180> be<00:02:51.360> more<00:02:51.660> accurate<00:02:51.959> if<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:53.220> are

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
going to be more accurate if you are

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.860 
going to be more accurate if you are

correct and i will show you example of

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.600 
correct and i will show you example of
this<00:03:00.620> all<00:03:01.620> right<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:02.040> i'm<00:03:02.250> not<00:03:02.430> going<00:03:02.579> to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
this all right now i'm not going to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.690 
this all right now i'm not going to

compensate whatsoever for the the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.390 
compensate whatsoever for the the
kickback<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:07.079> it's<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:07.950> all<00:03:08.130> over

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
kickback so it's going to be all over

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.819 
kickback so it's going to be all over
the<00:03:08.519> place<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:09.030> I'm<00:03:09.269> still<00:03:09.569> gonna<00:03:09.989> just<00:03:10.349> show

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
holding it and not compensating for

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:28.000 
holding it and not compensating for
anything<00:03:23.900> okay<00:03:24.900> pretty<00:03:25.530> off<00:03:26.239> as<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.480> can<00:03:27.630> see

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.069 
anything okay pretty off as you can see
if<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.190> on<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.459> target<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:32.630> then<00:03:33.630> me

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
if you on the target and then me

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:44.420 
if you on the target and then me
crouched<00:03:37.190> not<00:03:38.190> compensating<00:03:42.380> as<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:44.040> can<00:03:44.160> see

crouched not compensating as you can see
that<00:03:44.459> both<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:45.120> if<00:03:45.359> you<00:03:45.450> don't<00:03:45.630> compensate

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
that both that if you don't compensate

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.370 
that both that if you don't compensate
but<00:03:47.239> these<00:03:48.239> bullets<00:03:48.660> are<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.810> little<00:03:48.989> bit<00:03:49.230> more

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
but these bullets are a little bit more

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.050 
but these bullets are a little bit more
controlled<00:03:49.920> than<00:03:49.980> these<00:03:50.250> these<00:03:50.519> are<00:03:50.579> all<00:03:50.819> off

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
controlled than these these are all off

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.740 
controlled than these these are all off
to<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.450> right<00:03:51.829> these<00:03:52.829> are<00:03:53.519> a<00:03:53.549> little<00:03:54.239> closer

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
to the right these are a little closer

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.140 
to the right these are a little closer
to<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.200> middle<00:03:55.500> even<00:03:56.489> though<00:03:56.609> they're<00:03:56.790> still

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
to the middle even though they're still

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.710 
to the middle even though they're still
off<00:03:57.329> but<00:03:58.609> you<00:03:59.609> know<00:03:59.760> it<00:04:00.150> gives<00:04:00.359> you<00:04:00.569> at<00:04:00.660> least

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
off but you know it gives you at least

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.199 
off but you know it gives you at least
see<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.709> if<00:04:01.889> you<00:04:02.099> look<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:02.579> is<00:04:02.790> where<00:04:03.090> the

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
see like if you look this is where the

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.849 
see like if you look this is where the
middle<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.630> target<00:04:04.109> was<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.470> look<00:04:04.680> up

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
middle of the target was you look up

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.000 
middle of the target was you look up
there's<00:04:05.700> no<00:04:06.150> bullets<00:04:06.780> here<00:04:07.049> where<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.709> middle

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
there's no bullets here where the middle

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.800 
there's no bullets here where the middle
was<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.519> if<00:04:08.760> you<00:04:08.940> were<00:04:09.060> trying<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.450> compensate

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
was so if you were trying to compensate

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.009 
was so if you were trying to compensate
and<00:04:10.260> aiming<00:04:10.859> lower<00:04:11.599> somebody's<00:04:12.599> head<00:04:12.810> was

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
and aiming lower somebody's head was

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.539 
and aiming lower somebody's head was
right<00:04:13.230> here<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.620> you're<00:04:13.799> trying<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.160> hit<00:04:14.340> all

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
right here that you're trying to hit all

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.039 
right here that you're trying to hit all
these<00:04:14.849> bullets<00:04:15.269> would<00:04:15.419> be<00:04:15.569> on<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.780> side<00:04:16.019> of

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
these bullets would be on the side of

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.129 
these bullets would be on the side of
their<00:04:16.289> head<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:17.400> one<00:04:17.729> at<00:04:18.209> least<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:19.019> know

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
their head this one at least you know

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.909 
their head this one at least you know
there's<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:19.470> good<00:04:19.680> group<00:04:20.099> of<00:04:21.289> bullets<00:04:22.289> that<00:04:22.500> hit

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
there's a good group of bullets that hit

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.710 
there's a good group of bullets that hit
the<00:04:23.099> middle<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:23.700> if<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:23.940> were<00:04:24.060> aiming<00:04:24.240> lower

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
the middle so if you were aiming lower

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.010 
the middle so if you were aiming lower
and<00:04:25.430> their<00:04:26.430> head<00:04:26.610> was<00:04:26.789> about<00:04:27.060> there<00:04:27.360> then

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
and their head was about there then

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.620 
and their head was about there then
you'd<00:04:28.260> be<00:04:28.409> able<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.710> hit

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
you'd be able to hit

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.909 
you'd be able to hit
hoping<00:04:30.630> in<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.780> video<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.169> can<00:04:31.470> see<00:04:31.770> these

hoping in the video you can see these

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:40.809 
hoping in the video you can see these
bullet<00:04:32.340> holes<00:04:36.710> so<00:04:37.710> yeah<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:39.000> compensation

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
bullet holes so yeah and so compensation

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.390 
bullet holes so yeah and so compensation
this<00:04:41.819> is<00:04:42.090> gonna<00:04:42.270> be<00:04:42.590> actually<00:04:43.590> find<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.250> better

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
this is gonna be actually find a better

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.520 
this is gonna be actually find a better
spot<00:04:44.699> working<00:04:47.840> you're<00:04:48.840> going<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.020> have<00:04:49.199> to<00:04:49.349> aim

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
spot working you're going to have to aim

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.700 
spot working you're going to have to aim
lower<00:04:50.009> than<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.520> target<00:04:51.110> see<00:04:52.110> say<00:04:52.410> this<00:04:52.590> is

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
lower than the target see say this is

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.309 
lower than the target see say this is
the<00:04:52.740> targets<00:04:53.280> head<00:04:53.460> if<00:04:53.699> you<00:04:54.509> watch<00:04:54.750> Mike<00:04:55.080> Ross

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
the targets head if you watch Mike Ross

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.170 
the targets head if you watch Mike Ross
i<00:04:55.500> will<00:04:55.710> start<00:04:56.039> where<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.370> target<00:04:56.610> is<00:04:56.849> and

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
i will start where the target is and

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.689 
i will start where the target is and
i'll<00:04:57.660> go<00:04:57.840> lower<00:04:58.139> and<00:04:58.819> this<00:04:59.819> will<00:05:01.699> yeah

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
i'll go lower and this will yeah

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.700 
i'll go lower and this will yeah
basically<00:05:03.120> i'm<00:05:03.479> trying<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:03.900> hit<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.080> head<00:05:04.380> but

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
basically i'm trying to hit the head but

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.409 
basically i'm trying to hit the head but
you<00:05:04.889> have<00:05:05.039> to<00:05:05.160> aim<00:05:05.310> lower<00:05:05.669> than<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.060> head<00:05:06.240> to

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
you have to aim lower than the head to

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:13.159 
you have to aim lower than the head to
do<00:05:06.539> it<00:05:10.190> so<00:05:11.190> as<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.460> can<00:05:11.610> see<00:05:11.910> most<00:05:12.630> of<00:05:12.810> them<00:05:12.930> hit

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
do it so as you can see most of them hit

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.219 
do it so as you can see most of them hit
pretty<00:05:13.380> much<00:05:13.650> where<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.490> head<00:05:14.699> would<00:05:14.910> be<00:05:15.229> but

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
pretty much where the head would be but

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.409 
pretty much where the head would be but
you<00:05:17.130> definitely<00:05:17.340> have<00:05:17.759> to<00:05:17.880> move<00:05:18.060> your<00:05:18.180> cross

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
you definitely have to move your cross

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.870 
you definitely have to move your cross
head<00:05:18.690> around<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.139> little<00:05:19.320> weak<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:20.610> further

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
head around a little weak the further

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.129 
head around a little weak the further
the<00:05:21.090> distances<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:22.740> further<00:05:23.070> down<00:05:23.870> like<00:05:24.870> safe

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
the distances the further down like safe

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.960 
the distances the further down like safe
this<00:05:25.289> was<00:05:25.470> somebody's<00:05:25.830> body<00:05:26.070> this<00:05:26.699> was<00:05:26.940> the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
this was somebody's body this was the
