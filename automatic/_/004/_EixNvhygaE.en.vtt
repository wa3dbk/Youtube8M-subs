00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.580
 through the dancers I have learned 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.210
 one day and it is to see that the beings with 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.470
 I worked 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.460
 were you 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.750
 they had a lot of peace 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.320
 although they are alive that is peace is not 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.560
 calm 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.290
 and that they also have a vitality 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:48.309
 incredible that comes out through the pores or 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.500
 be as if it says to feel one 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.770
 I live every day and you're doing 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.180
 what he loves and it's delicious to be all 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.600
 the days 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.600
 recognizing that 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.910
 many things many nerves but many 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.300
 want to go out and go out and do it 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.300
 we 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.640
 at the time 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.369
 by elsa's address is enriched 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.560
 everything the dancers propose 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:22.610
 because she always allows a space 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.500
 for them to contribute are 10 dancers 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.049
 on stage that are all very different 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.939
 who has different life stories 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.899
 different training stories 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:35.090
 also different contexts almost 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.619
 of births to different 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.330
 cities then 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:47.360
 sbs observes that there is a wealth of 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:51.020
 of traits that is my aesthetics 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.570
 for me soon in his eyes the first 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.260
 impression that I have on green about 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.500
 everything I'm living 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.120
 I think he's on the stage of 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.220
 soon 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.150
 let's say with all the experience of topics 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.340
 as there is 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.430
 among all as a secret now alludes to 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.540
 you that we have 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:20.620
 it is very interesting the way in which 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.250
 elsa to the teacher proposes to meet 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.409
 with the movement itself with the essence 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.980
 she describes him as the group of the group 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:32.620
 from each one the way in which each 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.129
 person feels and transmits and shows his 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.129
 rhythm 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.790
 the experience has been super important 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.010
 because we were able to find it 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.810
 for me to find myself in the age is 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.849
 find my movement find my 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.950
 body has been supremely important 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.310
 it has been fundamental is an experience 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.939
 beautiful really is a work that has 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.180
 a huge geographic wealth is a 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:00.159
 really large project 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.280
 pioneer the truth these things look very 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.219
 little one looks for them in many ways 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.200
 but a lot that the ministry of 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:11.349
 culture is supporting with the plan makes 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.959
 an aid that is more encouraged 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.109
 creation of works the movement has been 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:21.220
 much more fluid much more landed 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:24.609
 much fuller it is as if it is the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.489
 movement will radiate from the center of 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.700
 my body and transmitted each of 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.670
 the fibers that make up my heart 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.780
 throbbed 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.590
 emotion was flying because it's something very 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:46.069
 beautiful when when one starts to 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.069
 say good and this is what it is 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.630
 at every moment have their own life very 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.630
 beautiful and long 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.760
 I hope we meet in a 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.519
 imprint in any space in the 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.120
 world and what a delight to see us and 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.120
 find us
