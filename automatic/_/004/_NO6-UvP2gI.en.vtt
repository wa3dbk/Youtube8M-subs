the first important setting we're going
to<00:00:43.180> be<00:00:43.239> looking<00:00:43.360> at<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.809> game<00:00:44.110> control<00:00:44.559> all

to be looking at is the game control all
sets<00:00:45.460> have<00:00:45.670> it<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:45.969> most<00:00:46.660> sets<00:00:46.899> will<00:00:47.170> be<00:00:47.199> on

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
sets have it and most sets will be on

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.600 
sets have it and most sets will be on
automatic<00:00:47.590> when<00:00:48.129> you<00:00:48.190> first<00:00:48.370> turn<00:00:48.550> the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
automatic when you first turn the

automatic when you first turn the
machine<00:00:48.910> on<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:50.320> should<00:00:50.500> understand<00:00:50.860> however

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
machine on you should understand however

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.560 
machine on you should understand however
how<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.339> increase<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.000> decrease<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.329> game

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
how to increase and decrease the game

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.479 
how to increase and decrease the game
manually<00:00:53.050> because<00:00:53.620> there<00:00:53.890> are<00:00:54.010> times<00:00:54.219> when

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
manually because there are times when

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.889 
manually because there are times when
you<00:00:54.640> would<00:00:54.760> need<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:55.120> do<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.809> give

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
you would need to do that to give

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.899 
you would need to do that to give
yourself<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.230> more<00:00:56.379> accurate<00:00:56.620> presentation<00:00:57.550> of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
yourself a more accurate presentation of

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.000 
yourself a more accurate presentation of
what's<00:00:58.149> out<00:00:58.269> it<00:00:58.479> ok<00:00:59.440> so<00:00:59.500> we're<00:00:59.710> on<00:00:59.769> automatic

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
what's out it ok so we're on automatic

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.420 
what's out it ok so we're on automatic
and<00:01:00.850> if<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.479> increase<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.500> game<00:01:02.649> on<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.129> set

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
and if you increase the game on the set

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.240 
and if you increase the game on the set
you'll<00:01:04.210> see<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.570> you<00:01:04.690> start<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.259> get<00:01:06.190> more

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
you'll see that you start to get more

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.700 
you'll see that you start to get more

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
not necessarily be there and they're

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.139 
not necessarily be there and they're

to the point where right at the bottom
you<00:01:24.729> know<00:01:24.970> it's<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.390> better<00:01:25.450> water<00:01:25.869> for<00:01:26.530> the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
you know it's a better water for the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.040 
you know it's a better water for the
ships<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.130> dockyards<00:01:27.720> there's<00:01:28.720> pretty<00:01:28.990> much

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
ships and dockyards there's pretty much

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.560 
ships and dockyards there's pretty much
nothing<00:01:29.409> left<00:01:29.830> on<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.070> screen<00:01:30.330> so<00:01:31.330> you<00:01:31.390> need

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
nothing left on the screen so you need

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.340 
nothing left on the screen so you need
to<00:01:31.659> just<00:01:31.720> bring<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.110> out<00:01:32.819> and<00:01:33.819> just<00:01:34.110> keep<00:01:35.110> going

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
to just bring it out and just keep going

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.809 
to just bring it out and just keep going
up<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.500> couple<00:01:35.740> threes<00:01:36.009> a<00:01:36.039> time<00:01:36.369> until<00:01:36.580> you

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
up a couple threes a time until you

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.040 
up a couple threes a time until you
start<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.270> feel<00:01:37.300> that<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.750> picture

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
start to feel that the picture

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.490 
start to feel that the picture
represents<00:01:38.619> what<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.159> should<00:01:39.429> be<00:01:39.520> seeing<00:01:40.500> as

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
represents what you should be seeing as

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.169 
represents what you should be seeing as
I<00:01:41.619> say<00:01:41.770> automatic<00:01:42.310> words<00:01:42.490> most<00:01:42.759> of<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.000> time

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
I say automatic words most of the time

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:44.969 
I say automatic words most of the time
but<00:01:43.750> sometimes<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.259> just<00:01:44.289> might<00:01:44.530> do<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.860> add

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
but sometimes you just might do to add

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.680 
but sometimes you just might do to add
or<00:01:45.250> take<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.429> couple<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.759> degrees<00:01:45.849> off<00:01:46.179> just<00:01:46.630> to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
or take a couple of degrees off just to

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.370 
or take a couple of degrees off just to
give<00:01:46.810> yourself<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.140> slightly<00:01:47.349> clearer<00:01:47.619> picture

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
give yourself a slightly clearer picture

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.380 
give yourself a slightly clearer picture
that's<00:01:50.380> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.670

the clutter controls more specifically
the<00:01:58.690> scene<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.260> rain<00:01:59.409> clutter
