bread from the starter

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.969 
bread from the starter
a<00:00:54.339> few<00:00:54.909> weeks<00:00:55.059> later<00:00:55.239> I<00:00:55.390> made<00:00:55.690> this<00:00:55.870> one<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.530> I

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
a few weeks later I made this one and I

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.799 
a few weeks later I made this one and I
guess<00:00:57.249> because<00:00:57.489> it<00:00:57.699> was<00:00:57.850> a<00:00:57.879> different<00:00:58.179> time<00:00:58.449> it

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
guess because it was a different time it

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.209 
guess because it was a different time it
was<00:00:59.140> a<00:00:59.170> different<00:00:59.499> season<00:00:59.829> at<00:00:59.920> different<00:01:00.129> time

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
was a different season at different time

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.369 
was a different season at different time
of<00:01:00.249> the<00:01:00.399> year<00:01:00.579> this<00:01:01.089> captured<00:01:01.719> some<00:01:01.989> really

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
of the year this captured some really

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.290 
of the year this captured some really
really<00:01:02.499> beautiful<00:01:02.769> yeast<00:01:03.309> and<00:01:03.579> this<00:01:03.999> one

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
really beautiful yeast and this one

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.200 
really beautiful yeast and this one
reacts<00:01:05.110> even<00:01:05.620> better<00:01:05.860> than<00:01:06.010> this<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.460> tastes

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
reacts even better than this and tastes

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.090 
reacts even better than this and tastes
even<00:01:07.390> better<00:01:07.509> than<00:01:07.810> this<00:01:07.930> but<00:01:08.500> I<00:01:08.680> still<00:01:08.950> don't

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
even better than this but I still don't

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.679 
even better than this but I still don't
throw<00:01:09.310> this<00:01:09.460> one<00:01:09.640> out<00:01:09.820> yet<00:01:10.090> because<00:01:10.240> I've<00:01:10.570> been

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
throw this one out yet because I've been

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:11.940 
throw this one out yet because I've been
using<00:01:10.750> it<00:01:11.079> over<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.439> over<00:01:11.530> again<00:01:11.619> to<00:01:11.920> make

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
using it over and over again to make

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.980 
using it over and over again to make
bread<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.820> reason<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.149> have<00:01:13.390> two<00:01:13.600> starters

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
bread and the reason I have two starters

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.749 
bread and the reason I have two starters
is<00:01:14.110> because<00:01:14.380> one<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:14.979> these<00:01:15.189> starters<00:01:15.610> will

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
is because one of these starters will

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.149 
is because one of these starters will
only<00:01:15.939> give<00:01:16.210> me<00:01:16.360> one<00:01:16.540> loaf<00:01:16.750> and<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:17.649> lot<00:01:17.799> of<00:01:17.920> times

finish<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:56.720> here<00:02:57.500> I'm<00:02:57.770> adding<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.310> water<00:02:58.490> a

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
finish so here I'm adding the water a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.320 
finish so here I'm adding the water a
little<00:02:58.700> bit<00:02:58.880> at<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.060> time

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
little bit at a time

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.270 
little bit at a time
and<00:02:59.600> I'm<00:03:00.110> kneading<00:03:00.530> now<00:03:00.680> with<00:03:00.860> my<00:03:01.010> hand

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
and I'm kneading now with my hand

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.890 
and I'm kneading now with my hand
because<00:03:01.610> sometimes<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:02.300> just<00:03:02.420> best<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.810> get

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
because sometimes it's just best to get

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.540 
because sometimes it's just best to get
your<00:03:03.050> hands<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.500> here<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.680> see<00:03:03.830> how<00:03:03.950> sticky<00:03:04.310> it

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
your hands and here to see how sticky it

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.460 
your hands and here to see how sticky it
is<00:03:04.610> because<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:05.660> don't<00:03:05.810> want<00:03:05.990> it<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.200> get<00:03:06.290> too

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
is because you don't want it to get too

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.230 
is because you don't want it to get too
sticky<00:03:06.709> alright<00:03:07.130> now<00:03:07.670> it's<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:07.970> point

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
sticky alright now it's to the point

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.000 
sticky alright now it's to the point
where<00:03:08.510> I've<00:03:08.630> dumped<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.050> on<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.260> counter<00:03:09.709> my

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
where I've dumped it on the counter my

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.460 
where I've dumped it on the counter my
hands<00:03:10.310> are<00:03:10.400> still<00:03:10.670> dirty<00:03:11.000> with<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.390> flour<00:03:11.660> so

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
hands are still dirty with the flour so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.800 
hands are still dirty with the flour so
I<00:03:12.800> usually<00:03:13.340> find<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.640> best<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.940> stop<00:03:14.300> wash<00:03:14.630> my

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
I usually find it best to stop wash my

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.390 
I usually find it best to stop wash my
hands<00:03:15.140> dry<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.410> off<00:03:15.530> completely<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.280> then

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
hands dry it off completely and then

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.370 
hands dry it off completely and then
come<00:03:16.640> back<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.060> then<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.630> tend<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.990> have<00:03:18.170> more

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
come back and then I tend to have more

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.620 
come back and then I tend to have more

I'm just stretching it over the pan and

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.930 
I'm just stretching it over the pan and
I<00:04:54.830> don't<00:04:54.920> know<00:04:55.070> how<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.220> toss<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:55.700> dough<00:04:55.820> in
