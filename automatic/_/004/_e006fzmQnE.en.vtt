as<00:00:16.400> you<00:00:16.580> can<00:00:16.760> see<00:00:16.910> I've<00:00:17.090> got<00:00:17.210> two<00:00:17.450> of<00:00:17.480> them<00:00:17.660> here

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
as you can see I've got two of them here

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.080 
as you can see I've got two of them here
on<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.170> table<00:00:18.470> we've<00:00:19.189> got<00:00:19.250> our<00:00:19.520> standard

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
on the table we've got our standard

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.950 
on the table we've got our standard
model<00:00:20.509> and<00:00:20.689> then<00:00:21.230> we've<00:00:21.380> got<00:00:21.619> our<00:00:21.700> plated

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
model and then we've got our plated

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.630 
model and then we've got our plated
rust-resistant<00:00:23.960> model<00:00:24.349> that<00:00:25.009> we<00:00:25.189> send<00:00:25.489> out

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
rust-resistant model that we send out

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.880

have<00:00:25.939> it<00:00:26.029> electroplated<00:00:26.899> and<00:00:27.079> it<00:00:27.560> greatly

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
have it electroplated and it greatly

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.710 
have it electroplated and it greatly
increases<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.790> life<00:00:28.970> of<00:00:29.149> the<00:00:29.210> trap

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720

let<00:01:08.150> me<00:01:08.270> emphasize<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:08.810> this<00:01:09.320> is<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.530> lethal

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
let me emphasize that this is a lethal

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.960 
let me emphasize that this is a lethal
squirrel<00:01:11.329> or<00:01:11.570> rodent<00:01:12.320> trap<00:01:12.590> now<00:01:13.520> let<00:01:13.729> me<00:01:13.790> turn

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
squirrel or rodent trap now let me turn

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.550 
squirrel or rodent trap now let me turn
it<00:01:14.030> around<00:01:14.210> for<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.049> you<00:01:15.140> can<00:01:15.259> see<00:01:15.439> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
it around for you so you can see the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.120 
it around for you so you can see the
springs<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:17.570> got<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.810> double<00:01:18.079> torsion<00:01:18.770> spring

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
springs it's got a double torsion spring

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.480 
springs it's got a double torsion spring
right<00:01:19.460> here<00:01:20.020> those<00:01:21.020> are<00:01:21.049> also<00:01:21.409> plated<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.369> they

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
right here those are also plated so they

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.389 
right here those are also plated so they
won't<00:01:22.729> rust<00:01:23.439> and<00:01:24.439> that's<00:01:24.619> what<00:01:24.829> powers<00:01:25.219> the

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
won't rust and that's what powers the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.770 
won't rust and that's what powers the
trap<00:01:25.719> so<00:01:26.719> let's<00:01:26.899> go<00:01:27.020> ahead<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.350> set<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:28.780> well

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
trap so let's go ahead and set it well

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.120 
trap so let's go ahead and set it well
you<00:01:29.930> know<00:01:29.960> what<00:01:30.140> before<00:01:30.290> we<00:01:30.530> get<00:01:30.619> into<00:01:30.829> setting

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
you know what before we get into setting

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.459 
you know what before we get into setting
it<00:01:31.250> let's<00:01:31.670> talk<00:01:31.850> about<00:01:32.000> baiting<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:33.020> trap<00:01:33.259> can

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
it let's talk about baiting the trap can

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.209 
it let's talk about baiting the trap can
be<00:01:33.590> used<00:01:34.000> baited<00:01:35.000> or<00:01:35.210> unbated<00:01:35.930> if<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:36.890> want<00:01:37.100> to

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
be used baited or unbated if you want to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.600 
be used baited or unbated if you want to
bait<00:01:37.430> this<00:01:37.729> trap<00:01:37.960> when<00:01:38.960> it's<00:01:39.140> unset<00:01:39.799> what<00:01:40.579> I

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
bait this trap when it's unset what I

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.880 
bait this trap when it's unset what I
would<00:01:40.880> suggest<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:42.049> smear<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.710> bait

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
would suggest is that you smear the bait

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.090 
would suggest is that you smear the bait
on<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.340> inside<00:01:43.850> of<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.149> trap<00:01:44.710> directly<00:01:45.710> above

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
on the inside of the trap directly above

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.569 
on the inside of the trap directly above
the<00:01:46.280> pan<00:01:46.750> on<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:48.020> roof<00:01:48.289> of<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.680> trap<00:01:48.950> inside

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
the pan on the roof of the trap inside

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.090 
the pan on the roof of the trap inside
so<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:50.600> when<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.899> animal<00:01:51.289> comes<00:01:51.469> up<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.979> the
