00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:04.040
 continuing with what they exceed 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.180
 file work or 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.330
 olic matos 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.440
 also mentioned then not yet very used that he is vj 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.670
 15 that allows us and has compatibility between versions 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.050
 of the same program 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.050
 i linking one try with the other 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.170
 for example to the rancor guard and j we have explained wench 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.739
 given the possibility 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.399
 April no inconvenience in the files in any version of 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.130
 mainly because of the reference to modeling b 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.130
 We are giving references to a berlocq havoc in modeling 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.190
 and possibly because we can also take into account that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.280
 I can d perform modeling in 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.170
 for saying something in marx 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.050
 and link it later maya or vice versa 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.580
 even with other types of programs 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.150
 he has not forgotten the lie 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.350
 nevertheless outcrops 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.920
 melÃ©ndez that allow to have this compatibility and then as such no 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.920
 is exclusive to inventors is a universal format 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.370
 but which we can take advantage of 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.370
 in that sense he had mossad moehler the same piece 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.690
 previous headlines 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.070
 which we explain 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 It is to highlight aspects 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.660
 and what I love doing is 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.660
 exported all selections 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.830
 in the vj format now that we have the obvious is that it is also 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.310
 an advanced missile and especially the clubs 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.350
 even when we were going to 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.290
 transport the default sculpture program that has this house that is the 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.560
 martos 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.600
 i 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.720
 but it's not the case yet as well as the way we do not have 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.200
 it does not work for the example 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.489
 that by not having it then we must link it as a club and 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.729
 for it we go to windows I followed prevenimss 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.449
 luis magallanes 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.449
 and there are who this window we have to look for 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.399
 the laurel the option or bj sport 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.569
 alphabetical order is used 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:28.789
 here we have it 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:31.929
 well that has kio your option is one that is loading 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:36.529
 after chelsea then automatically towers if we go file 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.089
 export everything 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.489
 here we are going to count between the option 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.879
 or ego size charged yes 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.899
 percent 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.889
 we have the other one here is simple 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.109
 Franco 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.149
 autonomous 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.339
 which tells me that 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:58.579
 ape every time the time approached does not support beach the face by right is 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.449
 say I do not have to feel breasts cooperation let's address the what 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.069
 that interests us for now 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.159
 sorry to export it 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.249
 let's see to export 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.249
 like good j 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.849
 very well and we have to believe 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.549
 for example in this case 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.549
 I have open frames forgive me the climax 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.409
 rarely as of the matter 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.509
 let's import 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.509
 let's eat with this 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.109
 Victorian 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.899
 here we have at peak times 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.349
 they think assumption 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.899
 also highlights that 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.429
 we create and 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:05.049
 and on the move 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.049
 well now what are we going to continue with ccs 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.439
 That's the same thing, we're going to 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.259
 here to maya 2011 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.259
 if to compare the giles then he 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:24.770
 we peel and analyzed that has this format 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.789
 Endesa Biden 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.789
 team that we have it 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.059
 the piece is exactly the same 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.059
 now a 2012 version 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.110
 in manipulating it 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.110
 Without inconveniences 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.439
 this is to say nothing 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:54.120
 an option that we have there
