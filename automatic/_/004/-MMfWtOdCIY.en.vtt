00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hi everyone, to start with 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.390
 put on makeup and decided to turn on the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.250
 camcorder because I'm about to use a 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.110
 new product and therefore it seemed to me a 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.880
 good opportunity to test it together 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.660
 since I put away so many 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.910
 expectations 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.359
 it is the new solar compact from 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.810
 the oreal of the fan line I just have 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.580
 received by type 2 3 days I have not 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.250
 still got to try it here is 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.140
 just a compact foundation so yes 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.720
 presents as if it were a kind of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.840
 face powder is totally powdered from this 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.550
 part is the mirror and also 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.559
 the applicator that we will now go to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.110
 it seems to me to use this here 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.570
 a great discovery indeed I said I must 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.809
 try it absolutely with them because it is 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.539
 you know a protective solar compartment 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.300
 that in summer I don't use it 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.430
 nothing on the face and so it often happens to me 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.199
 to have redness or otherwise 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.420
 small burns 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.940
 if you follow them in blogs now that I have 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.250
 a third did so much and so this 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.110
 product immediately attracted me anyway 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.900
 because it could be a good one 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.540
 solution for not having to make up anymore 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.610
 from time to time continue to maintain 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.369
 my idea for which summer me and face do not 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.729
 the trick I go with goes wrong 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.380
 intervene on the imperfections e 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.479
 just putting this here 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.430
 I use sunscreen as I had 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.070
 recommended you and more probably 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.350
 from what bed should also 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.909
 standardize the complexion so when 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.530
 I saw it I said ok this is the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.689
 product for me but it seemed right 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.430
 trying it together today seemed like it 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.900
 ideal day to try it for yourself 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.470
 because I have to be around a lot of 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.200
 hours 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.970
 I'll go out for lunch now and I'll come back for more 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.250
 less around 5 and 6 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.710
 but the good thing is that I wo n't be in 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.210
 office but above all the day 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.369
 outdoors so it's the best time 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.190
 to understand if it can actually 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.140
 work as a sunscreen with 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.880
 it's the sunniest day in the world 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.070
 in the sense that there is the sun that goes and that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.570
 but I usually succeed 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.480
 listen to them also on these occasions 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.970
 so it's the ideal day for 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.820
 find it and if we go to apply it e 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.740
 I use the sponge finally supplied and me 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.720
 I also use the mirror because I don't 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.690
 I brought so much on the mirror 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.390
 said I say only this foundation e 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.000
 then I'm going to finish the rest I'm not at 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.860
 stress you to let me see you show yourself 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.350
 as of makeup also because I have 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.020
 going to just use this here is a 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.970
 little bit of mascara eyeliner is 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.880
 the first is really impalpable 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.060
 impression is already excellent in the sense that 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.550
 the skin is certainly standardized 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.620
 I hope you see but all the blushes that 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.330
 I had all this morning already 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.600
 covered and in addition does not have the effect 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.030
 dusty it seems to me that it is covering e 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.270
 at the same time photoshop ante then 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.700
 great thing the effect as you see is 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.060
 supernatural and very well covered 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.040
 blushes I have since yesterday because unfortunately 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.830
 precisely always coming out without protection 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.930
 the sun hits me all the time not 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.650
 once upon a time there is no such thing 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.720
 ah no oh well and covered everything well has 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.480
 made this effect photoshopped however 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.730
 the one does not seem at all heavy 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.180
 what it doesn't totally cover are the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.500
 imperfections then in those android on 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.870
 those android intervene with the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.530
 concealer or even a past that 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.390
 big brush 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.700
 I like doing this thing it seems to me that 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.400
 better still the writing of each 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.709
 powder product I always do it from 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.350
 that I have this brush is something that 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.540
 I do this here perpetually now 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.400
 I leave it at home even if the format was 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.319
 quite compact and I could keep it in 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.940
 handbag to re-apply it 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.280
 but I really want to see if it has one 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.470
 good duration as I had read then 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.720
 this should last a lot of hours e 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.190
 should give me total protection the way 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.530
 best to know is definitely 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.769
 test it so we will meet again 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.780
 later when he returned as a returned to 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.970
 end is almost dinner time so I am 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.820
 been around a lot more than expected not 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.340
 I thought I would come back so late but I did 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.040
 it seems that the situation is excellent not 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.650
 the blushes are particularly evident 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.190
 so I still have this morning 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.950
 covered the effect is not not visible 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.979
 that is, it is not that effect you say 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.169
 remains dusty than on me at 100 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.240
 a lot and then the products 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.160
 too dusty or in any case with one 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.100
 too thick powder I can't 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.919
 use because I have this pore problem 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.410
 nobody noticed anything so no 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.780
 Mom told me how badly she looked or 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.419
 my mom how it marks your skin not you 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.740
 note is totally imperceptible though 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.950
 I think he made me a screen 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.620
 solar because I don't feel absolutely 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.390
 I do not feel hot and I burned 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.820
 just that the whole lasted 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.919
 afternoon I didn't sweat because it's like 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.260
 having nothing on the skin, that is, it is me 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.270
 really liked it in fact I know that i 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.400
 file directly into the products saves 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.950
 time for this morning here too 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.380
 positive thing I noticed is that at one 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.070
 universal shade precisely because a 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.930
 this powder becomes so fine that it becomes 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.699
 almost 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.400
 and transparent on the face for ciava 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.190
 adapt perfectly to the color of 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.620
 departure then remains if you see it that way 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.479
 it's super clear however when you go to 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.350
 I am not very clear on the 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.600
 face 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.120
 then goes right to inform a range from 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.250
 probably adapt to heat and to 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.580
 starting color seems to me right 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.710
 that the test is passed ie fantastic 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.639
 this first very well also for 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.949
 go swimming 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.630
 you will have to be there next week 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.850
 I have to go to the pool I have to try 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.949
 put it in the cream's own place 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.960
 solar because in any case at the factor of 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.419
 protection 30 and today there really was 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.300
 the sun that beat me in the head for 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.070
 now in fact if you see yourself a little weird is 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.710
 simply because I also took a 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.139
 lot of heat and now just that 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.389
 sweater because I'm cold though in 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:09.360
 general was a very busy day 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.910
 very hot so if you see yourself a little 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.650
 road is only the fault of the sun for a row 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.690
 or absolutely try it to go in 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.910
 swimming pool and also in the morning to go to 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.520
 work because anyway immediately 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.560
 the idea of ​​being made up but without 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.789
 need to combine who knows which ones 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.260
 other products 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.479
 in the end I put him a little bit of 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.610
 eyeliner a little pencil the mascara does not 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.710
 I have made up for nothing else 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.750
 today I don't even have a trick 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.360
 super simple in short, also because I 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.820
 in the summer I really hate makeup 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.479
 too much or in any case use too many 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.430
 products 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.530
 I have to say that I think this is me 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.750
 will solve the problem and not me 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.820
 you will hear more I got burned 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.620
 even though I didn't want to be in the sun 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.110
 I have to take a shower today that there is not 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.419
 I can do more I hope to have been 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.090
 useful with this road video test 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.860
 road tests and let me know if any 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.889
 you want to see others for other products 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.110
 so I work to test myself together with 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.820
 I'll send you a kiss I'll see you at 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.720
 next one 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.720
 Hello
