00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.620
 to 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.180
 and today we are going to prepare a sweet rice 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.470
 of seafood then here I present to you 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.180
 all the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 use first of all let's 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.939
 use a broth that offers the link 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.800
 how to prepare a fish stock 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.900
 seafood we will use squid some mussels 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.690
 some prawns a rice shrimp 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.860
 so put some tomato oil the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.790
 salt an onion a green pepper and a 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.210
 pair of garlic cloves coloring rice and 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.670
 the sweet paprika 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.090
 We put our pan to heat with a 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.329
 little oil that covers us what is 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.600
 the culete of the pan and first 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.670
 place let's fry our 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.239
 shrimp but of course they have to 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.630
 be raw raw shrimp 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.720
 since we have a very fried face 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.470
 we turn around to finish frying 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.470
 on the flip side 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.790
 when we have it 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.190
 to the points we remove them on a plate 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.190
 to add our rice pad 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.970
 you know that you will get a very rice 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.970
 tasty 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.460
 we add a little bit of salt 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.150
 and we remove 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.880
 since we also have it at its point what 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.159
 we retire and little by little then we will go 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.950
 peeling our camba and not only 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.250
 shrimp to finally incorporate it into 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.619
 in the rice or in the broth better said 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.850
 now let's add every evil we have 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.570
 chopped we put a little bit of salt and 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.570
 we remove 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.310
 since we also have it at its point 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.790
 We will also proceed to remove it in a 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.239
 plate 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.689
 since we 're going to use the pan for 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:23.340
 make our mussels 8 or 10 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.340
 approximately we will come well 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.160
 as they are opening as we are going 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.920
 withdrawing 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.610
 we move them also a bit 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.120
 so that the steam opens and the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.990
 we are withdrawing and also of course 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.570
 we will remove the shell 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.120
 and we'll leave it from now on we're going to 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.400
 add our onion with a little bit 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.860
 of salt that we have chopped previously 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.980
 well to very small pieces 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.620
 and since we have it as well as 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.470
 caramelized we can already 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.290
 and conclude that we have it at its point and 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.269
 we also add the green pepper that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.360
 we have also chopped to pieces 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.670
 little ones we have bitten and also 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.090
 add a little bit of salt and stir 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.090
 all 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.319
 since we have it advanced because we put 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.319
 the clove of garlic 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.180
 and of course we remove everything well 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.140
 so that all the flavors go away 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.140
 intermingling 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.300
 already when we see that we have everything 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.120
 all our vegetables so let's add 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.640
 the tomato we add a few spoonfuls of 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.640
 fried tomato two or three approximately 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.230
 and of course we also remove 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.230
 all good 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.300
 and since we have it advanced then 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.410
 we add the sweet paprika 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.070
 more or less a teaspoon of 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.490
 of these desserts can come in handy 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:17.690
 we also remove 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.690
 and finally we add the coloring 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.100
 and at this point we add to the broth 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.889
 we raise the fire to the maximum so that 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.889
 boil our broth 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.570
 and we are moving 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.830
 we add the seafood 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.230
 already when it started to boil 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.230
 and we would have a few minutes to boil 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.930
 the prawns islands and the prawns the 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.259
 I have peeled so that at lunchtime 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.449
 so be more pleasant and we do not have to 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:13.180
 be peeling our prawns with the 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.979
 spoon or as we are eating then 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.490
 that we do not find any kind of 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.490
 teacher 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.560
 and let it boil a few minutes I have 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.260
 removed some broth for another day 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.990
 and so we can have a broth 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.620
 base since a few minutes have passed since 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.740
 we add a 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.389
 a little rice a little handful 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.990
 approximately per person and 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:41.860
 we will remove the rice 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.289
 to release the starch and thicken the 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.430
 broth 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.240
 approximately we will have about 20 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.580
 minutes cooking over medium heat 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.199
 and here we have the final result I hope 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.509
 that you liked it and that is that you go to 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.960
 channel how it is done and what you can to 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.960
 I like it
