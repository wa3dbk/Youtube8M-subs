time-lapse well this is exactly what
happened<00:00:46.949> to<00:00:46.980> me<00:00:47.129> recently<00:00:47.570> but<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.840> wasn't<00:00:49.109> my

happened to me recently but it wasn't my
first<00:00:49.440> time<00:00:49.620> lapse<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.879> say<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> was<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
first time lapse so to say I was a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.090 
first time lapse so to say I was a
little<00:00:51.780> bit<00:00:52.140> confused<00:00:52.589> would<00:00:52.859> be<00:00:53.010> an

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
little bit confused would be an

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.130 
little bit confused would be an
understatement

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
understatement

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.349 
understatement
it<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.410> pretty<00:00:55.679> disappointing<00:00:56.489> since<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.149> was

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
it was pretty disappointing since it was

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.470 
it was pretty disappointing since it was
the<00:00:57.629> total<00:00:57.899> lunar<00:00:58.199> eclipse<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.670> pretty

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the total lunar eclipse and it's pretty

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.200 
the total lunar eclipse and it's pretty
rare<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.890> wasn't<00:01:02.249> like<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.579> could<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:02.969> go

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
rare so it wasn't like I could just go

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.340 
rare so it wasn't like I could just go
out<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.080> try<00:01:04.620> again<00:01:04.980> another<00:01:05.309> night<00:01:06.320> after<00:01:07.320> I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
out and try again another night after I

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.200 
out and try again another night after I
had<00:01:07.740> uploaded<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.460> finished<00:01:08.790> video<00:01:09.120> to

had uploaded my finished video to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.810 
had uploaded my finished video to
YouTube<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.050> was<00:01:10.770> looking<00:01:11.220> through<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
YouTube I was looking through the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.090 
YouTube I was looking through the
comments<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.600> were<00:01:12.720> left<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.260> my<00:01:13.590> time-lapse

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
comments that were left on my time-lapse

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.810 
comments that were left on my time-lapse
video<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.260> there<00:01:16.260> was<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> comment<00:01:16.830> left<00:01:17.040> by<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
video and there was a comment left by a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.080 
video and there was a comment left by a
user<00:01:18.420> learned<00:01:18.930> time-lapse<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:20.490> mentioned

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
user learned time-lapse that mentioned

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.870 
user learned time-lapse that mentioned
mechanical<00:01:21.659> inconsistencies<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.040> possible

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
mechanical inconsistencies as a possible

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.719 
mechanical inconsistencies as a possible
source<00:01:24.149> of<00:01:24.540> time-lapse<00:01:25.140> flicker<00:01:25.579> well<00:01:26.579> this

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
source of time-lapse flicker well this

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.330 
source of time-lapse flicker well this
is<00:01:26.850> something<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.299> had<00:01:27.540> never<00:01:27.689> heard<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.110> before

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
is something I had never heard of before

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.080 
is something I had never heard of before
so<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> went<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.820> his<00:01:29.969> page<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.600> investigate<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
so I went to his page to investigate and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.969 
so I went to his page to investigate and
his<00:01:33.090> featured<00:01:33.450> video<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:34.140> specifically

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
his featured video was specifically

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.410 
his featured video was specifically
about<00:01:35.540> aperture<00:01:36.540> inconsistencies<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:38.420> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
about aperture inconsistencies and the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
about aperture inconsistencies and the
problem<00:01:39.840> lies<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.320> fact<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
problem lies in the fact that if you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.730 
problem lies in the fact that if you
have<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:42.000> lens<00:01:42.270> set<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.719> anything<00:01:43.229> other

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
have your lens set to anything other

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.319 
have your lens set to anything other
than<00:01:44.210> light<00:01:45.210> open<00:01:46.100> when<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.250> camera<00:01:47.670> shoots

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
than light open when your camera shoots

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.010 
than light open when your camera shoots
a<00:01:48.420> picture<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:50.210> cranks<00:01:51.210> your<00:01:51.360> aperture<00:01:51.570> wide

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
a picture it cranks your aperture wide

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.230 
a picture it cranks your aperture wide
open<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> split<00:01:53.219> second<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
open for a split second on the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.749 
open for a split second on the
millisecond<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.159> closes<00:01:56.159> back<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.640> you

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
millisecond and closes back to what you

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.990 
millisecond and closes back to what you
had<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> set<00:01:57.299> at<00:01:58.189> every<00:01:59.189> time<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> does<00:01:59.579> this

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
had it set at every time it does this

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.499 
had it set at every time it does this
and<00:02:00.420> opens<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.079> closes<00:02:01.289> it<00:02:02.130> creates<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.030> slight

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and opens and closes it creates a slight

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.880 
and opens and closes it creates a slight
deviation<00:02:03.750> in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
deviation in

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.389 
deviation in
Zek<00:02:05.580> size<00:02:05.910> of<00:02:06.150> your<00:02:06.270> aperture<00:02:06.660> opening<00:02:07.050> and

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
Zek size of your aperture opening and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.999 
Zek size of your aperture opening and
this<00:02:08.399> slight<00:02:08.789> deviation<00:02:09.509> causes<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.710> very

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
this slight deviation causes the very

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.700 
this slight deviation causes the very
slight<00:02:11.280> change<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.700> your<00:02:11.790> exposure<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:13.530> in

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
slight change in your exposure so in

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.520 
slight change in your exposure so in
between<00:02:14.160> shots<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:15.690> there's<00:02:16.020> any<00:02:16.290> slight

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
between shots if there's any slight

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.410 
between shots if there's any slight
change<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.040> exposure<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.730> going<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.150> cause

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
change in exposure it's going to cause

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.750 
change in exposure it's going to cause
that<00:02:18.950> appearance<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.100> flickering<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:20.640> your

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
that appearance of flickering in your

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.870 
that appearance of flickering in your
timelines<00:02:21.320> so<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.620> decided<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.220> test<00:02:23.610> this

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
timelines so I decided to test this

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.790 
timelines so I decided to test this
theory<00:02:24.270> by<00:02:24.510> shooting<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.020> time-lapse

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
theory by shooting a time-lapse

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.420 
theory by shooting a time-lapse
and<00:02:25.920> doing<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.940> side-by-side<00:02:27.270> comparison<00:02:28.430> one

another with that partially closed and
the<00:02:35.220> results<00:02:35.640> were<00:02:35.850> pretty<00:02:36.390> irrefutable

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.960 

it's<00:02:58.180> clearly<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.380> substantial<00:03:00.340> problem<00:03:00.790> with

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
it's clearly a substantial problem with

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.430 
it's clearly a substantial problem with
lenses<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.750> are<00:03:01.810> set<00:03:02.170> for<00:03:02.350> automatic

my<00:03:06.310> previous<00:03:06.970> time<00:03:07.360> lapses<00:03:07.870> were<00:03:08.050> at<00:03:08.170> night

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
my previous time lapses were at night

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.150 
my previous time lapses were at night
and<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:10.120> had<00:03:10.330> my<00:03:10.540> effort<00:03:10.900> sure<00:03:11.050> set<00:03:11.410> wide<00:03:11.710> open

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
and I had my effort sure set wide open

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.580 
and I had my effort sure set wide open
which<00:03:12.850> is<00:03:13.060> clearly<00:03:13.390> why<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.750> did<00:03:14.020> encounter<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
which is clearly why I did encounter the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.090 
which is clearly why I did encounter the
problem<00:03:14.770> before<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.730> was<00:03:16.600> also<00:03:16.900> using<00:03:17.380> my<00:03:17.410> only

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
problem before I was also using my only

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.350 
problem before I was also using my only
lens<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.880> has<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:20.460> manual<00:03:21.460> aperture<00:03:21.790> ring<00:03:22.120> on

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
lens that has a manual aperture ring on

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.780 
lens that has a manual aperture ring on
it<00:03:22.600> it's<00:03:22.780> fully<00:03:23.050> manual<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.220> didn't

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
it it's fully manual so I didn't

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.420 
it it's fully manual so I didn't
encounter<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.210> problem<00:03:25.540> on<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:25.840> one<00:03:25.990> even

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
encounter the problem on that one even

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.340 
encounter the problem on that one even
well<00:03:27.430> there<00:03:27.610> was<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.760> solution<00:03:28.290> mentioned<00:03:29.290> in

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
well there was a solution mentioned in

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.480 
well there was a solution mentioned in
his<00:03:29.530> video<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:31.590> required<00:03:32.590> tricking<00:03:33.370> the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
his video that required tricking the

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.280 
his video that required tricking the
camera<00:03:33.940> into<00:03:34.270> thinking<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:34.720> had<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.870> manual

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
camera into thinking you had a manual

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.630 
camera into thinking you had a manual
lens<00:03:35.620> on<00:03:36.480> well<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.510> tried<00:03:37.960> this<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.470> it

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
lens on well I tried this and it

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.670 
lens on well I tried this and it
involves<00:03:39.640> unlocking<00:03:40.630> your<00:03:41.020> lens<00:03:41.290> and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
involves unlocking your lens and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.000 
involves unlocking your lens and
slightly<00:03:41.980> disengaging<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:44.500> disengages

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
slightly disengaging it so it disengages

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.670 
slightly disengaging it so it disengages
the<00:03:45.370> context<00:03:46.270> from<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.840> camera<00:03:47.170> body<00:03:47.320> in<00:03:47.560> the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
the context from the camera body in the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.200 
the context from the camera body in the
lens

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
lens

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.080 
lens
well<00:03:49.210> this<00:03:49.450> seemed<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.840> work<00:03:50.140> by<00:03:51.000> leaving<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
well this seemed to work by leaving the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.480 
well this seemed to work by leaving the
camera<00:03:52.360> at<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.540> same<00:03:52.630> settings<00:03:53.320> produce<00:03:54.280> a

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
camera at the same settings produce a

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.990 
camera at the same settings produce a
really<00:03:54.940> underexposed<00:03:55.930> photo<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.880> had<00:03:57.880> to

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
really underexposed photo I had to

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.450 
really underexposed photo I had to
increase<00:03:58.240> my<00:03:58.660> or<00:03:59.290> decrease<00:03:59.830> my<00:04:00.100> shutter<00:04:00.370> speed

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
increase my or decrease my shutter speed

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.510 
increase my or decrease my shutter speed
and<00:04:01.000> increase<00:04:01.690> my<00:04:01.900> ISO<00:04:02.560> quite<00:04:02.800> significantly

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
and increase my ISO quite significantly

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.810 
and increase my ISO quite significantly
just<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.570> get<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:05.020> same<00:04:05.560> exposure<00:04:06.070> with<00:04:06.520> the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
just to get the same exposure with the

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:28.110 
just to get the same exposure with the
lens<00:04:07.140> properly<00:04:08.140> attached

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.630 

so<00:04:29.120> it's<00:04:29.750> an<00:04:29.930> option<00:04:30.440> but<00:04:30.860> I<00:04:30.890> wasn't<00:04:31.190> too

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
so it's an option but I wasn't too

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.570 
so it's an option but I wasn't too
satisfied<00:04:32.180> with<00:04:32.390> it<00:04:32.650> well<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.860> can't<00:04:34.190> shoot

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
satisfied with it well you can't shoot

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.060 
satisfied with it well you can't shoot
time-lapses<00:04:35.450> with<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.900> apertures<00:04:36.470> that<00:04:36.830> wide

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
time-lapses with the apertures that wide

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.220 
time-lapses with the apertures that wide
open<00:04:37.100> all<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:37.880> time<00:04:37.910> it's<00:04:38.540> just<00:04:38.840> not<00:04:38.990> an<00:04:39.140> ideal

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
open all the time it's just not an ideal

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.790 
open all the time it's just not an ideal
scenario<00:04:40.330> especially<00:04:41.330> if<00:04:41.630> you<00:04:42.290> want<00:04:42.650> to

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
scenario especially if you want to

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.130 
scenario especially if you want to
incorporate<00:04:43.450> objects<00:04:44.450> into<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.720> foreground

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
incorporate objects into the foreground

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.860 
incorporate objects into the foreground
to<00:04:45.320> create<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.680> nice<00:04:46.130> perspective<00:04:46.520> or<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:47.630> have

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
a fast lens there are a few things you

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.500 
a fast lens there are a few things you
can<00:04:51.710> do<00:04:51.890> to<00:04:52.640> help<00:04:52.760> you<00:04:53.000> in<00:04:53.300> these

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
can do to help you in these

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.090 
can do to help you in these
circumstances<00:04:53.870> assuming<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.800> don't<00:04:54.950> have<00:04:55.070> a

circumstances assuming you don't have a
manual<00:04:55.520> lens<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:57.050> can<00:04:57.260> use<00:04:57.440> a<00:04:57.470> neutral

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
manual lens you can use a neutral

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.060 
manual lens you can use a neutral
density<00:04:58.220> filter<00:04:59.090> so<00:04:59.540> you<00:04:59.630> can<00:05:00.070> significantly

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
density filter so you can significantly

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.300 
density filter so you can significantly
slow<00:05:01.760> down<00:05:01.970> your<00:05:02.540> shutter<00:05:03.350> speed<00:05:03.440> depending

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
slow down your shutter speed depending

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.550 
slow down your shutter speed depending

on what kind of neutral density filters

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.550 
on what kind of neutral density filters
you<00:05:06.680> have<00:05:06.710> or<00:05:07.280> if<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.360> stack<00:05:08.660> them<00:05:08.930> or<00:05:09.380> ease<00:05:09.530> a

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
circular polarizing filter which is what

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.330 
circular polarizing filter which is what
I<00:05:16.220> utilized<00:05:16.820> I<00:05:17.210> would<00:05:18.170> highly<00:05:18.590> suggest<00:05:18.620> using

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
I utilized I would highly suggest using

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.320 
I utilized I would highly suggest using
a<00:05:19.610> Cpl<00:05:20.150> regardless<00:05:20.930> when<00:05:21.470> you're<00:05:21.590> outside

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
a Cpl regardless when you're outside

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.580 
a Cpl regardless when you're outside
because<00:05:23.330> it<00:05:23.510> gives<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.780> really<00:05:24.080> nice<00:05:24.230> color

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
because it gives a really nice color
