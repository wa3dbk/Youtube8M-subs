me<00:00:14.790> up<00:00:14.820> tighten<00:00:15.389> me<00:00:15.450> up<00:00:15.480> now<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.560> feel<00:00:17.369> like

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
me up tighten me up now I feel like

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.529 
me up tighten me up now I feel like
y'all<00:00:19.289> out<00:00:19.470> there<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:20.070> hearing<00:00:20.789> me<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.060> you

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
y'all out there is hearing me but you

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.960 
y'all out there is hearing me but you
ain't<00:00:21.570> feelin<00:00:22.380> me<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.980> how<00:00:23.279> tight<00:00:23.730> this

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
ain't feelin me on how tight this

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.470 
ain't feelin me on how tight this
alternative<00:00:24.660> setup<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.400> said<00:00:26.670> this

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
alternative setup is like I said this

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.019 
alternative setup is like I said this
thing<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:28.109> doing<00:00:28.380> me<00:00:28.590> right<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.550> want<00:00:29.820> try<00:00:29.970> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
thing is doing me right so I want try to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.759 
thing is doing me right so I want try to
understand<00:00:30.539> about<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.990> explain<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
understand about the explain it to you a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.850 
understand about the explain it to you a
little<00:00:31.949> bit<00:00:32.070> better<00:00:33.079> this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.320> alternator

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
little bit better this is the alternator

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.610 
little bit better this is the alternator
that<00:00:35.040> runs<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.610> truck<00:00:35.940> separate<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.440> this

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that runs the truck separate from this

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.880 
that runs the truck separate from this
one<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> new<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.079> turn<00:00:40.559> is

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
one this one the new one is the turn is

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.690 
one this one the new one is the turn is
externally<00:00:41.820> voltage<00:00:42.329> regulator

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
externally voltage regulator

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.250 
externally voltage regulator
it's<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> voltage<00:00:45.300> regulator<00:00:45.750> over<00:00:46.079> here

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
it's the voltage regulator over here

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
it's the voltage regulator over here
that<00:00:46.469> one's<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.890> high<00:00:47.129> output<00:00:47.579> alternator

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that one's that high output alternator

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.420 
that one's that high output alternator
it's<00:00:48.390> got<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.840> knob<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.320> there<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.860> can

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it's got a little knob in there I can

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.459 
it's got a little knob in there I can
adjust<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.239> wherever<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.840> want<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> voltage

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
adjust it to wherever I want the voltage

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.950 
adjust it to wherever I want the voltage
to<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.370> could<00:00:53.670> take<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.149> 18<00:00:54.539> volts

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to be at I could take it up to 18 volts

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.350 
to be at I could take it up to 18 volts
if<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.230> want<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.739> right<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.850> think<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.149> gotta

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
if I want but right now I think I gotta

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.830 
if I want but right now I think I gotta
set<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.719> about<00:00:57.989> fourteen<00:00:58.920> nine<00:00:59.840> fourteen

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
set it about fourteen nine fourteen

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.479 
set it about fourteen nine fourteen
eight<00:01:01.020> something<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.829> sometimes<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
eight something like that sometimes it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.990 
eight something like that sometimes it
hit<00:01:02.670> 15<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.989> cold<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.369> heated<00:01:05.850> up

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
hit 15 when it's cold but is heated up

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.830 
hit 15 when it's cold but is heated up
now<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.659> we're<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:08.390> I'll<00:01:09.390> let<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.659> see

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
now so we're going here I'll let you see

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.740 
now so we're going here I'll let you see
this<00:01:09.900> voltage<00:01:10.640> stop<00:01:11.640> better<00:01:11.970> explain

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.040 

all<00:01:16.750> right<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:19.000> my<00:01:19.180> truck<00:01:19.450> food<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:19.900> right

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
all right that's my truck food is right

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.610 
all right that's my truck food is right
there<00:01:20.290> off<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.470> truck<00:01:20.830> battery<00:01:22.380> these<00:01:23.380> are<00:01:23.530> my

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
there off the truck battery these are my

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.590 
there off the truck battery these are my

14 eight my truck for this is 13th floor
so<00:02:10.470> never<00:02:11.470> find<00:02:11.740> me<00:02:11.920> attractive<00:02:12.010> play<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
so never find me attractive play on the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.960 
so never find me attractive play on the
system

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:03:48.210 

since<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.930> lost<00:02:19.200> my<00:02:19.500> other<00:02:19.590> one

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.370 

check<00:03:49.220> my<00:03:49.430> video<00:03:49.959> something<00:03:50.959> happen<00:03:51.200> on<00:03:51.230> my

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
check my video something happen on my

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.050 
check my video something happen on my
audio<00:03:51.590> at<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.069> end<00:03:52.220> of<00:03:52.310> that<00:03:52.400> video<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:52.910> don't

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
audio at the end of that video I don't

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.030 
audio at the end of that video I don't
know<00:03:53.209> maybe<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.959> said<00:03:54.050> something<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.920> the

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
know maybe I said something and the
