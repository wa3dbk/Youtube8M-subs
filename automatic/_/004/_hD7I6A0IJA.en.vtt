and well worth it okay first things

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
and well worth it okay first things
first<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:08.250> you're<00:01:08.430> pulling<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> body<00:01:09.060> apart

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
first when you're pulling the body apart

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.090 
first when you're pulling the body apart
Cheyenne<00:01:10.710> uses<00:01:11.070> some<00:01:11.280> sort<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.670> putty<00:01:12.479> or

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
Cheyenne uses some sort of putty or

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
Cheyenne uses some sort of putty or
epoxy<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> thread<00:01:14.909> lock<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:16.049> can

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
epoxy as like a thread lock and it can

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.859 
epoxy as like a thread lock and it can
be<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.860> difficult<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> apart<00:01:18.479> so

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
be really difficult to get it apart so

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.480 
be really difficult to get it apart so
if<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> run<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> heat<00:01:20.159> gun<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
if you run if you have a heat gun and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.300 
if you run if you have a heat gun and
you<00:01:20.909> run<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.150> over<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> seams<00:01:21.920> just<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> little

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you run it over the seams just a little

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.789 
you run it over the seams just a little
bit<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.670> few<00:01:24.180> seconds<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.570> each<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:25.140> each<00:01:25.290> area

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
bit a few seconds on each on each area

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.370 
bit a few seconds on each on each area
here<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:26.880> it'll<00:01:27.600> help<00:01:27.689> loosen<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.170> some

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
here and here it'll help loosen up some

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.690 
here and here it'll help loosen up some
of<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> putty<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.070> makes<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.579> bit

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
of that putty and makes it a little bit

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.630 
of that putty and makes it a little bit
easier<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.720> pull<00:01:30.869> apart<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:32.009> reason<00:01:32.579> you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
easier to to pull apart the reason you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.390 
easier to to pull apart the reason you
wrap<00:01:32.880> your<00:01:33.030> channel<00:01:33.420> locks<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.840> because<00:01:34.400> you

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
wrap your channel locks is because you

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.980 
wrap your channel locks is because you
don't<00:01:35.670> want<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.689> don't<00:01:36.750> want<00:01:36.930> to

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
don't want to do that you don't want to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
don't want to do that you don't want to
scratch<00:01:37.229> your<00:01:37.439> body<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.520> doesn't<00:01:38.670> affect

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
scratch your body and it doesn't affect

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.130 
scratch your body and it doesn't affect
how<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> machine<00:01:39.329> works<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.869> doesn't

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
how the machine works but it doesn't

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.670 
how the machine works but it doesn't
look<00:01:40.290> great

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
look great

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.700

three<00:01:59.219> grub<00:01:59.820> screws<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:01.579> basically<00:02:02.579> all

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
three grub screws out basically all

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.609 
three grub screws out basically all
they're<00:02:03.000> doing<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.600> holding<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
they're doing is just holding the the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.950 
they're doing is just holding the the
connector<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.700> place

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:20.880 

and<00:02:11.790> three<00:02:16.830> okay<00:02:17.880> once<00:02:18.880> that's<00:02:19.120> done<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:20.740> kind

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
and three okay once that's done you kind

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.290 
and three okay once that's done you kind
of<00:02:21.040> loosen<00:02:21.430> your<00:02:21.550> connectors<00:02:21.910> going<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.120> list

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
of loosen your connectors going to list

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.700 
of loosen your connectors going to list
you're<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.600> pull<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.810> out<00:02:22.960> this<00:02:23.290> way<00:02:23.470> and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
you're going to pull it out this way and

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.970 
you're going to pull it out this way and
then<00:02:24.190> you're<00:02:24.280> going<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.460> unscrew<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.360> body<00:02:25.980> so

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
then you're going to unscrew the body so

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.700 
then you're going to unscrew the body so
unscrew<00:02:27.910> that<00:02:29.190> once<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.310> get<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.580> all<00:02:30.670> open

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
unscrew that once you get it all open

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.990 
unscrew that once you get it all open
what<00:02:32.710> you're<00:02:32.830> going<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:32.980> see<00:02:33.160> inside<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:33.820> going

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
what you're going to see inside is going

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.940 
what you're going to see inside is going
to<00:02:34.090> be<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.990> so<00:02:35.410> you've<00:02:35.530> got<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.680> little

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
to be this so you've got a little

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.470 
to be this so you've got a little
circuit<00:02:36.250> board<00:02:36.280> attached<00:02:37.210> to<00:02:37.570> your<00:02:38.410> mini

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
circuit board attached to your mini

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.040 
circuit board attached to your mini
connector<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.920> is<00:02:42.550> soldered<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.330> positive

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
connector it is soldered to the positive

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.870 
connector it is soldered to the positive
and<00:02:44.140> negative<00:02:44.470> terminals<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.670> motor

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
and negative terminals on the motor

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.660 
and negative terminals on the motor
itself<00:02:46.380> it's<00:02:47.380> my<00:02:47.710> understanding<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:48.400> could<00:02:48.550> be

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
itself it's my understanding it could be

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.500 
itself it's my understanding it could be
wrong<00:02:48.820> on<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.270> it's<00:02:49.390> my<00:02:49.480> understanding

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
wrong on this but it's my understanding

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.750 
wrong on this but it's my understanding
that<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.320> circuit<00:02:50.680> boards<00:02:50.980> main<00:02:51.190> function<00:02:51.640> is

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
that the circuit boards main function is

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.310 
that the circuit boards main function is
to<00:02:51.820> just<00:02:52.150> keep<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:52.390> machine<00:02:52.690> from<00:02:52.960> running

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
to just keep the machine from running

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.260 
to just keep the machine from running
over<00:02:53.440> 13<00:02:54.220> volts<00:02:54.580> if<00:02:54.700> you're<00:02:54.820> careful<00:02:55.060> with

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
over 13 volts if you're careful with

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.820 
over 13 volts if you're careful with
your<00:02:55.360> volts<00:02:55.660> you're<00:02:56.140> not<00:02:56.290> going<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.530> need<00:02:56.650> it

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
your volts you're not going to need it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.710 
your volts you're not going to need it
and<00:02:57.010> in<00:02:57.370> my<00:02:57.520> opinion<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:58.060> feel<00:02:58.090> like<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.480> makes

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
and in my opinion I feel like it makes

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.440 
and in my opinion I feel like it makes
the<00:02:58.870> machine<00:02:59.170> run<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.470> lot<00:02:59.680> smoother<00:03:00.100> okay<00:03:00.520> so<00:03:01.120> I

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the machine run a lot smoother okay so I

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.300 
the machine run a lot smoother okay so I
just<00:03:01.480> heat<00:03:02.350> up<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.560> soldering<00:03:02.800> iron<00:03:02.950> on<00:03:03.160> those

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
just heat up the soldering iron on those

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.210 
just heat up the soldering iron on those
terminals<00:03:03.760> terminals<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.740> pull<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.890> circuit

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220

gauge wire and make note of where the
positive<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.390> negative<00:03:16.840> terminals<00:03:17.560> are

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
positive and the negative terminals are

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.010 
positive and the negative terminals are
and<00:03:17.980> solder<00:03:18.730> just<00:03:19.000> extension<00:03:19.330> leads<00:03:19.600> on<00:03:19.780> there

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
and solder just extension leads on there

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.640 
and solder just extension leads on there
okay<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.160> usually<00:03:21.880> mark<00:03:22.120> them<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.500> pull<00:03:23.500> them

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
okay I usually mark them and pull them

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.670 
okay I usually mark them and pull them
out<00:03:23.770> through<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.940> body<00:03:25.120> here<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.680> once

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
out through the body here and once

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.730 
out through the body here and once
they're<00:03:26.920> on<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.310> outside<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.910> body<00:03:28.120> you

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
they're on the outside of that body you

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:37.860 
they're on the outside of that body you
just<00:03:29.740> screw<00:03:30.070> your<00:03:30.220> body<00:03:30.370> back<00:03:30.580> on<00:03:36.810> get<00:03:37.810> a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
just screw your body back on get a

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.900 
just screw your body back on get a
little<00:03:38.020> bit<00:03:38.230> tight<00:03:38.410> there<00:03:38.650> okay<00:03:39.490> when<00:03:39.790> you

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
little bit tight there okay when you

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.150 
little bit tight there okay when you
solder<00:03:40.240> now<00:03:40.990> you're<00:03:41.140> going<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.320> have<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.620> empty

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
solder now you're going to have to empty

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.710 
solder now you're going to have to empty
wire<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.640> bare<00:03:42.790> wire<00:03:42.970> leads<00:03:43.240> coming<00:03:43.390> out<00:03:43.600> of

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
wire to bare wire leads coming out of

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.790 
wire to bare wire leads coming out of
here<00:03:43.810> make<00:03:43.959> sure<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.230> have<00:03:44.350> your<00:03:44.440> positive

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
here make sure you have your positive

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.110 
here make sure you have your positive
and<00:03:44.860> negative<00:03:44.920> marked<00:03:45.400> or<00:03:45.880> you're<00:03:45.970> going<00:03:46.060> to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
and negative marked or you're going to

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.230 
and negative marked or you're going to
take<00:03:46.390> your<00:03:46.510> body<00:03:46.600> apart<00:03:46.900> again

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
take your body apart again

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.900 
take your body apart again
now<00:03:49.240> when<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.450> solder<00:03:49.660> your<00:03:50.430> RCA<00:03:51.430> on<00:03:51.700> there

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
now when you solder your RCA on there

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.430 
now when you solder your RCA on there
what<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.630> want<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.870> do<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.080> solder<00:03:53.260> your

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
what you want to do is solder your

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.740 
what you want to do is solder your
positive<00:03:53.890> lead<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.280> this<00:03:54.400> terminal<00:03:54.610> here<00:03:54.970> okay

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
positive lead to this terminal here okay

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.620 
positive lead to this terminal here okay
and<00:03:55.959> solder<00:03:56.709> your<00:03:56.920> negative<00:03:57.280> lead<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.850> the

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
and solder your negative lead to the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.430 
and solder your negative lead to the
threads<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.520> then<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:00.820> just<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.900> heat<00:04:02.260> right

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
threads and then I just a heat right

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.410 
threads and then I just a heat right
heat<00:04:02.709> shrink<00:04:02.950> wrapped<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.820> whole<00:04:03.970> thing

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
heat shrink wrapped the whole thing

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.120 
heat shrink wrapped the whole thing
so<00:04:04.570> once<00:04:04.780> your<00:04:04.900> solder<00:04:05.110> is<00:04:05.260> on<00:04:05.380> there<00:04:05.590> you

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
so once your solder is on there you

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.760 
so once your solder is on there you
stuff<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.580> all<00:04:06.670> back<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.209> body<00:04:10.080> okay<00:04:11.080> once

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
stuff it all back in the body okay once

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.710 
stuff it all back in the body okay once
it's<00:04:12.070> in<00:04:12.220> there<00:04:14.790> put<00:04:15.790> your<00:04:15.970> grub<00:04:16.209> screws<00:04:16.510> back

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
it's in there put your grub screws back

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.060 
it's in there put your grub screws back
in<00:04:17.280> now<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:19.810> grub<00:04:20.109> screws<00:04:20.440> are<00:04:20.620> basically

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
in now the grub screws are basically

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.350 
in now the grub screws are basically
going<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:21.609> float

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
going to float

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.180 
going to float
the<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:24.550> RCA<00:04:24.909> connector<00:04:25.419> so<00:04:26.009> put<00:04:27.009> them<00:04:27.069> in

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
the the RCA connector so put them in

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.279 
the the RCA connector so put them in
kind<00:04:27.340> of<00:04:27.490> loose<00:04:27.729> until<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.270> get<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
kind of loose until you get the the

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.409 
kind of loose until you get the the
connector<00:04:29.710> kind<00:04:30.699> of<00:04:30.759> situated<00:04:31.090> where<00:04:31.330> you

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
connector kind of situated where you

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.860 
connector kind of situated where you
want<00:04:31.599> it<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:33.190> then<00:04:33.250> you<00:04:34.180> can<00:04:34.360> kind<00:04:34.569> of<00:04:34.599> tighten

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
want it and then you can kind of tighten

00:04:34.870 --> 00:05:00.320 
want it and then you can kind of tighten
them<00:04:34.960> all<00:04:35.020> down<00:04:35.400> once<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.490> get<00:04:36.759> that<00:04:37.030> together

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:09.770 

secure<00:05:01.290> that<00:05:01.470> guy<00:05:01.650> down<00:05:01.980> there<00:05:07.850> so<00:05:08.850> not<00:05:09.390> moving

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
secure that guy down there so not moving

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.200 
secure that guy down there so not moving
it's<00:05:10.020> on<00:05:10.170> there<00:05:10.320> really<00:05:10.440> good<00:05:10.730> then<00:05:11.730> you<00:05:11.970> put

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
it's on there really good then you put

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.130 
it's on there really good then you put
your<00:05:13.220> back<00:05:14.220> cover<00:05:14.550> back<00:05:14.790> on<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.330> again<00:05:16.020> if

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
your back cover back on and again if

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.270 
your back cover back on and again if
you're<00:05:16.260> not<00:05:16.350> knocking<00:05:16.560> these<00:05:16.860> machines

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
you're not knocking these machines

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.470 
you're not knocking these machines
around<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.730> not<00:05:17.820> really<00:05:17.850> rough<00:05:18.240> with<00:05:18.360> them

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
around and not really rough with them

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.150 
around and not really rough with them
you<00:05:18.690> shouldn't<00:05:19.230> need<00:05:19.320> much<00:05:19.530> more<00:05:19.740> than<00:05:19.800> hand

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
you shouldn't need much more than hand

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.370 
you shouldn't need much more than hand
tighten<00:05:20.610> to<00:05:20.850> keep<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.750> body<00:05:21.900> and<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.170> cover

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
tighten to keep the body and the cover

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.720 
tighten to keep the body and the cover
on<00:05:22.590> there<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:22.800> wouldn't<00:05:23.070> recommend<00:05:23.310> wrenching

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
on there I wouldn't recommend wrenching

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.130 
on there I wouldn't recommend wrenching
it<00:05:23.820> back<00:05:23.970> down<00:05:24.180> because<00:05:24.600> if<00:05:24.720> you<00:05:24.810> have<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:25.020> get

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
it back down because if you have to get

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.180 
it back down because if you have to get
back<00:05:25.260> in<00:05:25.410> there<00:05:25.560> it's<00:05:25.680> going<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.860> be<00:05:25.920> a<00:05:25.950> royal

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
back in there it's going to be a royal

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.380 
back in there it's going to be a royal
pain<00:05:26.370> to<00:05:26.880> get<00:05:27.360> back<00:05:27.510> to<00:05:27.720> it<00:05:27.870> so<00:05:28.140> let's<00:05:29.360> put<00:05:30.360> a

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
pain to get back to it so let's put a

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.550 
pain to get back to it so let's put a
cartridge<00:05:30.750> in<00:05:30.930> here<00:05:31.790> and<00:05:32.790> just<00:05:33.540> a<00:05:33.720> standard

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
cartridge in here and just a standard

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:42.320 
cartridge in here and just a standard
RCA<00:05:35.160> cord<00:05:37.580> we're<00:05:38.580> about<00:05:39.210> six<00:05:39.540> volts<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:41.330> there

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
RCA cord we're about six volts and there

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.630 
RCA cord we're about six volts and there
you<00:05:42.420> go

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
you go

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.520 
you go
not<00:05:44.640> a<00:05:44.670> whole<00:05:44.940> lot<00:05:45.150> to<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.480> I<00:05:45.870> did<00:05:46.140> make<00:05:46.290> a<00:05:46.320> few

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
not a whole lot to it I did make a few

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.140 
not a whole lot to it I did make a few
mistakes<00:05:46.590> especially<00:05:47.010> as<00:05:47.490> far<00:05:47.520> as<00:05:47.670> scratching

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
mistakes especially as far as scratching

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.800 
mistakes especially as far as scratching
the<00:05:48.240> body<00:05:48.420> and<00:05:48.630> whatnot<00:05:48.980> but<00:05:50.300> I<00:05:51.300> would<00:05:51.630> say

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
the body and whatnot but I would say

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.680 
the body and whatnot but I would say
it's<00:05:51.930> well<00:05:52.170> worth<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:52.620> for<00:05:53.370> me<00:05:53.490> anyway<00:05:53.790> I<00:05:53.970> can

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
it's well worth it for me anyway I can

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.690 
it's well worth it for me anyway I can
use<00:05:54.810> an<00:05:54.960> RCA<00:05:55.230> cord<00:05:55.590> like<00:05:55.980> I<00:05:56.160> do<00:05:56.220> with<00:05:56.460> all<00:05:56.610> the

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
use an RCA cord like I do with all the

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.070 
use an RCA cord like I do with all the
rest<00:05:56.850> of<00:05:56.910> my<00:05:56.970> machines<00:05:57.390> and<00:05:57.630> not<00:05:57.690> have<00:05:57.870> to<00:05:57.960> keep

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
rest of my machines and not have to keep

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.600 
rest of my machines and not have to keep
switching<00:05:58.230> cords<00:05:58.770> over<00:05:58.920> to<00:05:59.130> go<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.340> my

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
switching cords over to go to my

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.270 
switching cords over to go to my
Cheyenne<00:05:59.940> machines<00:06:00.300> and<00:06:03.620> again<00:06:04.620> I<00:06:04.800> feel<00:06:05.100> like

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
Cheyenne machines and again I feel like

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.760 
Cheyenne machines and again I feel like
it<00:06:05.430> runs<00:06:05.610> smoother<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:06.270> lower<00:06:06.450> volts<00:06:06.990> with

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
it runs smoother and lower volts with

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.100 
it runs smoother and lower volts with
the<00:06:08.160> RCA<00:06:08.550> in<00:06:08.730> the<00:06:08.820> circuit<00:06:09.120> board<00:06:09.270> are<00:06:09.660> the<00:06:09.720> RCA

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
the RCA in the circuit board are the RCA

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.860 
the RCA in the circuit board are the RCA
installed<00:06:10.470> and<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:10.740> circuit<00:06:11.010> board<00:06:11.160> removed

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
installed and the circuit board removed

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.260 
installed and the circuit board removed
but<00:06:12.870> it's<00:06:13.230> up<00:06:13.380> to<00:06:13.500> you<00:06:13.590> anyway<00:06:14.520> thanks<00:06:15.240> for
