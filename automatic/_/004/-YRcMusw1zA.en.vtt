00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
a little bit more drying so if you have

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.120 
a little bit more drying so if you have
dry<00:01:24.930> lips<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.409> wouldn't<00:01:25.590> recommend<00:01:25.860> this

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
dry lips that I wouldn't recommend this

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.660 
dry lips that I wouldn't recommend this
if<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.170> put<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> nice<00:01:28.770> bomb<00:01:29.070> underneath<00:01:29.369> it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
if you put a nice bomb underneath it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.330 
if you put a nice bomb underneath it
will<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:30.390> fine<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.409> nice<00:01:31.590> gloss<00:01:31.860> over<00:01:32.040> top<00:01:32.310> of

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
will be fine or a nice gloss over top of

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460 
will be fine or a nice gloss over top of
it<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> color<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.079> really
