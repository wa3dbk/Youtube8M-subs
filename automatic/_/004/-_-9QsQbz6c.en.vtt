00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:19.420

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.470

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.270
 grams of cookies 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.880
 I have used yeste but it can be 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.720
 any 3 tablespoons of cocoa in 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.119

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.180
 filling 750 grams of philadelphia cheese 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.700

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.680
 to crush the cookies in the thermomix 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.020
 you do not need to do it in brno to me 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.760
 It can be done with a roller or with a 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.200
 mortar at home but as I have it 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.630
 Well, I use it 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.600
 we have melted also in the microwave 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.860
 the butter then it is now 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:13.040
 of a base to spray the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.040
 cookies we give turbo blows 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:27.470
 when we see that it is already 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:30.220
 powdered we open the lid and add 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.220
 cocoa 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.050
 brown sugar 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.430
 and butter that will show the 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.430
 microwave oven 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.180
 let's mix the whistle that can be 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.180
 pass perfectly with some 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.950
 ah 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.330
 and when we are already going to cover 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.310
 a removable mold all the base 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.310
 gently pointing 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.590
 that is a cloth nothing happens 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.770
 English 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.420
 let's put the base we have made 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.340
 with the cookies in the oven at 180 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.180
 degrees 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.180
 for 10 minutes 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.989
 the next step is to beat the cheese to 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.319
 the stuffing let's first let's beat 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.319
 First 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.739
 a soft cream and then we will add 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.739
 the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.530
 we have had the base 10 in the oven 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.180
 minutes like we said and we're 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.879
 waiting for it to cool to grease 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.890
 a little bit with olive oil in the 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.370
 laterals so then they serve us not 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.520
 will stick 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:37.340
 yes 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.530
 let's beat it a smooth speed 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:45.459
 at home with some rods if you do not have 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.459
 thermomix you can do the same 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.580
 we incorporate the eggs 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.810
 the four eggs 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.810
 and we beat again 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.360
 let's incorporate sugar and sugar 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.150
 and we beat again 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.870
 once it's all smooth we're going to 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.200
 take about half of the mixture 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.200
 or bowl 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.520
 more or less 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.270
 OK 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.720
 and half left us Here 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.390
 we are going to add the chocolate that we have 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.800
 become with a little water so that 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.800
 do not burn us in the microwave 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.639
 of chocolate are 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.639
 with melting drops of mercadona 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.470
 but it can be chocolate since 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.020
 come from 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.430
 of desserts in that or any brand 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.430
 with a little water 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.720
 we beat again 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.720
 Mix 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.380
 once we have the two masses the 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.360
 white and the cocoa table tail let's go 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.610
 we are going to intersperse so that they leave 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.720
 So let's see if we get the cake 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.630
 stripes of the ncoa cake there will be then 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.870
 that we throw in the center 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.160
 before mixing 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.160
 and we let it spread 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.919
 two 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.909
 when it is already scattered we are going to throw 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.909
 in the center the dark mass 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.930
 we let that effort 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.470
 we go back to chat hammock 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.070
 the darkest 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.860
 the last thing is to put in the oven during a 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:29.580
 hour and 10 minutes 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.530
 at 160 degrees if after a while we see 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.120
 it is very toasted the top part what 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.360
 we can cover with a little paper 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.360
 albal
