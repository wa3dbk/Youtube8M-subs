00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.910 
everything that I'm trying to do is that
obviously<00:02:14.519> life<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.420> throw<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.769> not<00:02:16.769> only

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
obviously life can throw you not only

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.380 
obviously life can throw you not only
lemons<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:17.610> sometimes<00:02:18.090> grenades<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:20.390> things

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
lemons but sometimes grenades and things

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.110 
lemons but sometimes grenades and things
may<00:02:21.569> not<00:02:21.599> go<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.049> way<00:02:22.079> you<00:02:22.170> want<00:02:22.560> or<00:02:22.920> expect<00:02:23.370> as

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
may not go the way you want or expect as

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.240 
may not go the way you want or expect as
long<00:02:24.329> as<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.690> can<00:02:24.810> all<00:02:24.959> hold<00:02:25.230> out<00:02:25.410> together<00:02:25.680> and

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
long as we can all hold out together and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.930 
long as we can all hold out together and
do<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.849> better<00:02:26.970> over<00:02:27.299> time<00:02:27.329> and<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:29.190> hope<00:02:29.640> that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
do get better over time and I hope that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.789 
do get better over time and I hope that
