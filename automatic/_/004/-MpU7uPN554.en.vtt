00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
we have a yellow flag here at Lamar and

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.030 
we have a yellow flag here at Lamar and
the<00:00:08.940> exclusion<00:00:09.510> zone<00:00:09.540> or<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:09.990> slow<00:00:10.500> zone<00:00:10.800> is

the exclusion zone or the slow zone is

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.980 
the exclusion zone or the slow zone is
right<00:00:11.370> here<00:00:11.670> as<00:00:11.910> we're<00:00:12.330> standing<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.719> can<00:00:12.870> see

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
right here as we're standing you can see

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.539 
right here as we're standing you can see
the<00:00:13.110> Porsche<00:00:13.349> coming<00:00:13.590> past<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.099> yellow<00:00:14.250> flag

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
the Porsche coming past the yellow flag

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.870 
the Porsche coming past the yellow flag
now<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.120> race<00:00:15.690> control<00:00:16.139> are<00:00:16.590> controlling<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
now and race control are controlling the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.939 
now and race control are controlling the
speed<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.750> particular<00:00:18.990> car<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.560> 60

the<00:00:22.140> yellow<00:00:22.439> flag<00:00:22.769> zone<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.820> means<00:00:24.029> we

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
the yellow flag zone and it means we

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.609 
the yellow flag zone and it means we
don't<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> safety<00:00:25.140> car<00:00:25.380> as<00:00:25.500> you

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
don't have to have a safety car as you

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.620 
don't have to have a safety car as you
can<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.369> Aston<00:00:26.699> Martin<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.269> flying

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
can see the Aston Martin was flying

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.900 
can see the Aston Martin was flying
along<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> straight<00:00:28.500> flat-out<00:00:29.250> speed<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
along the straight flat-out speed and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.089 
along the straight flat-out speed and
now<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.510> yellow<00:00:30.689> flag<00:00:30.990> zone<00:00:31.289> has<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.949> do

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
now in the yellow flag zone has to do

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.150 
now in the yellow flag zone has to do
that<00:00:32.309> 60<00:00:32.880> kilometres<00:00:33.450> an<00:00:33.540> hour<00:00:33.770> all<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.070> way

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that 60 kilometres an hour all the way

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.500 
that 60 kilometres an hour all the way
through<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.670> yellow<00:00:35.880> flag<00:00:36.120> zone<00:00:36.420> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
through this yellow flag zone and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
through this yellow flag zone and
they'll<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.780> limited<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.440> speed<00:00:37.739> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
they'll be limited to that speed and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040 
they'll be limited to that speed and
then<00:00:38.399> once<00:00:38.610> they've<00:00:38.820> passed<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.360> danger<00:00:39.719> area

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
then once they've passed a danger area

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.319 
then once they've passed a danger area
and<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.260> green<00:00:40.469> flag<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.790> car<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.180> do

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and the green flag then the car can do

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
and the green flag then the car can do
full<00:00:42.780> speed<00:00:43.110> around<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.829> rest<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.190> circuit

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
full speed around the rest of circuit

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
full speed around the rest of circuit
that<00:00:44.969> means<00:00:45.239> they<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.600> these<00:00:45.930> cars<00:00:46.230> aren't

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that means they all these cars aren't

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.680 
that means they all these cars aren't
sitting<00:00:47.010> behind<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.489> safety<00:00:47.879> car<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
sitting behind a safety car for the

sitting behind a safety car for the
whole<00:00:49.020> lap<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.739> therefore<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.730> course

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.920 

just<00:00:59.350> let<00:00:59.530> someone<00:00:59.769> go<00:01:00.070> through<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.719> it's<00:01:01.870> a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
just let someone go through but it's a

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.649 
just let someone go through but it's a
very<00:01:02.140> strange<00:01:02.649> situation<00:01:03.039> to<00:01:03.610> see<00:01:03.969> cars

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
very strange situation to see cars

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.899 
very strange situation to see cars
racing<00:01:05.170> towards<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.920> yellow<00:01:06.100> flag<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.759> then

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
racing towards a yellow flag and then

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.850 
racing towards a yellow flag and then
once<00:01:07.090> it<00:01:07.270> gets<00:01:07.390> late<00:01:07.630> yellow<00:01:07.810> flag<00:01:08.110> zone<00:01:08.380> all

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
once it gets late yellow flag zone all

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.760 
once it gets late yellow flag zone all
doing<00:01:09.430> exactly<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.360> same<00:01:10.600> speed<00:01:10.990> sort<00:01:11.710> of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
doing exactly the same speed sort of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.680 
doing exactly the same speed sort of
thing<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.070> might<00:01:12.190> see<00:01:12.490> at<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.670> go-cart<00:01:13.150> circuit

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
thing you might see at a go-cart circuit

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.440 
thing you might see at a go-cart circuit
or<00:01:14.040> arrive<00:01:15.040> in<00:01:15.250> drive<00:01:15.520> karting<00:01:16.030> but<00:01:16.149> certainly

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
or arrive in drive karting but certainly

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.910 
or arrive in drive karting but certainly
not<00:01:16.570> something<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:16.869> see<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.110> long<00:01:17.320> but<00:01:17.710> what

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
not something you see in a long but what

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.980 
not something you see in a long but what
it<00:01:18.100> does<00:01:18.310> mean<00:01:18.340> is<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.210> we<00:01:19.420> can<00:01:19.600> still<00:01:19.810> have

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
it does mean is that we can still have

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.930 
it does mean is that we can still have
racing<00:01:20.440> down<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.860> Mulsanne<00:01:21.310> straight<00:01:21.670> and

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
through the Porsche curves it's only

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.940 
through the Porsche curves it's only
this<00:01:23.860> small<00:01:24.090> area<00:01:25.090> where<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.500> problem<00:01:26.890> is

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
this small area where the problem is

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.010 
this small area where the problem is
occurring<00:01:27.009> that<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.060> cars<00:01:28.299> will<00:01:28.479> do<00:01:28.659> this

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
occurring that the cars will do this

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.570 
occurring that the cars will do this
speed<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.659> track<00:01:31.899> very<00:01:32.409> very<00:01:32.770> busy<00:01:33.159> at

the moment we're not quite sure why this

the moment we're not quite sure why this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
yellow flag is out at the moment we'll

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.380 
yellow flag is out at the moment we'll
let<00:01:37.539> you<00:01:37.810> know<00:01:37.840> as<00:01:38.319> the<00:01:39.009> day<00:01:39.310> progresses<00:01:39.819> but<00:01:40.360> a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
let you know as the day progresses but a

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.080 
let you know as the day progresses but a
fantastic<00:01:41.110> new<00:01:41.350> innovation<00:01:42.100> from<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.670> ACO

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
fantastic new innovation from the ACO

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.029 
fantastic new innovation from the ACO
very<00:01:43.750> very<00:01:43.990> safety-conscious

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
very very safety-conscious

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.889 
very very safety-conscious
but<00:01:45.340> also<00:01:45.490> allows<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.179> racing<00:01:46.539> to<00:01:46.600> progress

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
but also allows the racing to progress

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.749 
but also allows the racing to progress
around<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.500> rest<00:01:47.710> of<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.830> circuit<00:01:48.220> we<00:01:48.580> will

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
around the rest of the circuit we will

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.450 
around the rest of the circuit we will
still<00:01:49.119> see<00:01:49.149> safety<00:01:49.929> cars<00:01:50.170> at<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.979> 24<00:01:51.340> Hours

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
still see safety cars at the 24 Hours

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.639 
still see safety cars at the 24 Hours
Aleman<00:01:51.819> this<00:01:52.000> year<00:01:52.270> but<00:01:52.690> probably<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.200> lot<00:01:53.229> less

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
Aleman this year but probably a lot less

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.190 
Aleman this year but probably a lot less
frequently
