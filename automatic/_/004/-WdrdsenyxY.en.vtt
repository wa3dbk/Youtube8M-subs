00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 moin moin and welcome to one of 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.799
 video of merck co today i show you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.139
 like you have an encrypted usb stick 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.389
 and mac os 6 mountain lions as well 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.920
 Mavericks can create the whole thing 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.450
 works with in-house means 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 means the programs are already in 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.529
 celle does not need any extra 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.910
 programs still down to load but 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.010
 you really only need one usb stick 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.869
 because you can format it here so 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.170
 means everything can delete what's on it 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.730
 is and that's it 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.929
 and that's exactly what we do now 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.690
 First put such a usb stick 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.190
 pure what I have just done 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.120
 that means he will be equal to my system 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.180
 turn up too 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.570
 there is the usb stick tricks on it all 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.690
 Great 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.230
 wonderful cool first we do 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.500
 Now a fine window to go around 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 there a folder program and in the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.059
 folder utilities and find here 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.930
 Now the program 's hard disk 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.510
 utility so for beginners it 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.219
 you do not need it and you have it now 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.600
 first a listing of all yours 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.479
 hard disks you see my two 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.420
 hard drives in it and what else here 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.070
 holding is the usb stick and that's exactly what it is 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.290
 important now that is before us that is 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.080
 we mark the usb stick go 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.830
 delete on top and say here 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.060
 format beautiful stop encrypted important 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.470
 that we might not be these big ones 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.049
 lowercase journal encrypted 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.549
 makes couple where actually private 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.380
 program was got with problems 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.869
 but just do the best 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.840
 encrypted forgive another name 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.780
 for the usb-stick i say now 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.000
 kribbelt looks again 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.380
 security options in there to get 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.200
 everything so first let this and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.880
 say delete 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.799
 Now he asks me if I am the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.180
 really wants to delete hard disk and 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.740
 just a party key 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.909
 I would like to create partitions 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.700
 of course wants to do 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.259
 that means I defined password there 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.259
 I just make more goes out a 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.869
 carebot note I give myself too 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.869
 never is a channel called 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.210
 and says delete now formatted the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.290
 whole usb stick creates a new one 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.460
 volume and that just takes a while 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.380
 a bit longer than the normal one 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.260
 formatted and if he just then 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.400
 finished we have a usb stick the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.500
 mind you only on a mac 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.690
 can not work on one 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.250
 windows calculator 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.320
 but once you have that usb stick next to it 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.130
 he gets stuck in your system 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.580
 definitely ask for a password and 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.290
 yes then you can do that, so to speak 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.820
 this password just attract the usb 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.260
 stick could put on files next to it 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.850
 or save it to read with sarah 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.620
 so that takes a few seconds 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.040
 I'm sure I'll cut that 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.040
 video here 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 and here I am again so so only 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.740
 finished with the assistant one 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.900
 skaterbahn usb stick is back 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.130
 as scripted and also here we can 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.600
 Now we look at the partition 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.210
 click stands for encrypted 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.280
 logical partition is super great that is 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.450
 exactly what we want 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.240
 the hard disk utility can 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.970
 we close and I will now 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:34.410
 Just test my usb stick 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:39.030
 just out and once out and for coach 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.980
 Now you have to go back to the device 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.790
 but this time asking for the question 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.230
 password and without this camp place can 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.670
 Now we do not use the usb stick anymore 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.670
 our system a mountain 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.450
 or use at all 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.030
 and there it is great that you have 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.220
 now its own password protected 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.170
 as well as encrypted usb stick created 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.450
 the under mac os 6 easily 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.410
 works under windows 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.780
 probably less even if 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.459
 you installed a hts plus driver 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.050
 should have windows under it could 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.190
 may give problems but tried 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.660
 the mouse and write it in the 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.330
 comments because I can grab that 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.310
 currently without windows computer 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.470
 Hard buttons and virtual machines 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.910
 I do not currently like it either 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.580
 said the comments like to write 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.860
 it works and if you still 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.540
 any questions have hints htc 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.490
 is also like in the comments 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.410
 first leica subscribes to both channel 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.310
 if you liked the video and we did 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.520

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.520
