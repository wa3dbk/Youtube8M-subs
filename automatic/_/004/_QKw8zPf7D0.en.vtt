you also got a tension adjust just on
the<00:00:53.470> top<00:00:53.650> there<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.699> for<00:00:55.089> scratch<00:00:55.299> djs<00:00:55.750> they

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
the top there so for scratch djs they

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.200 
the top there so for scratch djs they
prefer<00:00:56.619> a<00:00:56.650> bit<00:00:56.949> tight<00:00:57.220> you<00:00:57.580> can<00:00:57.699> adjust<00:00:57.820> that

when<00:02:25.810> he's<00:02:25.900> playing<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:27.130> then<00:02:27.819> set<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.300> other

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
when he's playing and then set the other

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.960 
when he's playing and then set the other
check<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.959> me<00:02:29.110> sink<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:29.920> using<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.730> sinc

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
check to me sink to that using the sinc

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.700 
check to me sink to that using the sinc
functions

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.300 

like<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:34.550> then<00:02:35.390> you've<00:02:35.570> also<00:02:35.690> got<00:02:36.310> shift

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
like so then you've also got shift

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.420 
like so then you've also got shift
access<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.450> second<00:02:38.930> bank<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.620> controls<00:02:40.070> on

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
access is the second bank of controls on

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.080 
access is the second bank of controls on
the<00:02:40.550> mixer<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:41.450> we've<00:02:41.600> got<00:02:41.810> real<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.580> absolute

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
the mixer so we've got real and absolute

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.300 
the mixer so we've got real and absolute
control<00:02:44.420> for<00:02:44.930> jumping<00:02:45.380> from<00:02:45.590> real<00:02:46.040> and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
control for jumping from real and

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.190 
control for jumping from real and
absolute<00:02:46.670> control<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.300> software<00:02:47.630> we've

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
absolute control on the software we've

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.800 
absolute control on the software we've
also<00:02:48.380> got<00:02:48.770> pitch<00:02:49.430> Bend<00:02:49.730> if<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.300> actually<00:02:50.420> want

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
also got pitch Bend if you actually want

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.970 
also got pitch Bend if you actually want
to<00:02:51.400> pitch<00:02:52.400> bend<00:02:52.640> your<00:02:52.760> tracks<00:02:53.590> moving<00:02:54.590> down

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
to pitch bend your tracks moving down

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.980 
to pitch bend your tracks moving down
the<00:02:55.190> mixer<00:02:55.550> we've<00:02:56.000> obviously<00:02:56.120> got<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.510> 3-band

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
the mixer we've obviously got a 3-band

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.150

EQ<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.740> headphone<00:02:58.250> controls<00:02:58.640> here<00:03:00.160> along

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
EQ and headphone controls here along

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.790

with<00:03:01.190> our<00:03:01.550> twin<00:03:02.330> effects<00:03:02.990> banks<00:03:03.440> which<00:03:03.590> work

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
with our twin effects banks which work

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.320 
with our twin effects banks which work
in<00:03:04.010> conjunction<00:03:04.160> with<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.670> software<00:03:05.030> so

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
in conjunction with the software so

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.990 
in conjunction with the software so
there's<00:03:05.480> no<00:03:05.600> actual<00:03:05.900> effect<00:03:06.170> on<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:07.000> mixer

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
there's no actual effect on the mixer

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.120 
there's no actual effect on the mixer
controller<00:03:08.390> these<00:03:09.110> are<00:03:09.320> all<00:03:09.350> specifically

for<00:03:10.280> controlling<00:03:10.850> tractors<00:03:11.510> effects<00:03:11.840> which

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
for controlling tractors effects which

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.500 
for controlling tractors effects which
now<00:03:12.830> come<00:03:13.130> in<00:03:14.860> group<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.100> single<00:03:16.490> mode<00:03:16.670> so

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
now come in group and single mode so

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.540 
now come in group and single mode so
instead<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.810> advanced<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.590> chain<00:03:18.770> mode<00:03:19.010> we

instead of advanced and chain mode we

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.460 
instead of advanced and chain mode we
have<00:03:19.730> effects<00:03:20.090> in<00:03:20.390> group<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:20.900> single<00:03:21.200> mode<00:03:21.350> if

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470

which if I access you can hear so

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.380 
which if I access you can hear so
ram<00:04:06.620> delay<00:04:06.950> sounds<00:04:07.460> like<00:04:07.640> this

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.050 

it's<00:04:13.110> an<00:04:13.260> offer

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.900 

coming<00:04:34.960> out<00:04:35.220> yeah<00:04:36.220> another<00:04:36.580> nice<00:04:36.880> little

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
coming out yeah another nice little

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.029 
coming out yeah another nice little
feature<00:04:37.360> which<00:04:37.840> has<00:04:37.990> been<00:04:38.169> incorporated<00:04:38.860> for

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
feature which has been incorporated for

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.089 
feature which has been incorporated for
the<00:04:39.160> new<00:04:39.280> software<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.620> effect<00:04:41.620> in<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.889> fog

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
the new software is the effect in a fog

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.420 
the new software is the effect in a fog
control<00:04:42.520> so<00:04:43.210> by<00:04:43.990> accessing<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.500> ship

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
control so by accessing the ship

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.600 
control so by accessing the ship
punching<00:04:46.139> we've<00:04:47.139> got<00:04:47.319> an<00:04:47.410> LFO<00:04:47.860> control<00:04:48.400> for

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
punching we've got an LFO control for

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.300 
punching we've got an LFO control for
each<00:04:48.789> effect<00:04:49.509> if<00:04:50.259> I<00:04:51.150> sign<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.449> effect<00:04:52.990> 3

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
each effect if I sign it to effect 3

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.529 
each effect if I sign it to effect 3
need<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:55.940> assign<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:56.390> effect<00:04:56.690> first

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.610 

can't<00:05:01.539> effect<00:05:01.869> on<00:05:02.050> there

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.800 

yeah<00:05:06.620> by<00:05:07.100> assigning<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:07.550> affect<00:05:07.820> one<00:05:08.060> you<00:05:08.660> can

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
yeah by assigning to affect one you can

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.020 
yeah by assigning to affect one you can
see<00:05:08.840> it<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.890> effect<00:05:10.160> instantly<00:05:10.490> starts

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
see it the effect instantly starts

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.000 
see it the effect instantly starts
