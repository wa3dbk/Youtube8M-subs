00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hi everyone! Okay, okay, good morning, then I. 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.089
 here again the cocoa 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.700
 Today I came to give a little dinner for the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.969
 girls on duty that just like me 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.370
 are in love with liquid lipstick 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.740
 max and they are having a bit of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.680
 difficulty with some colors really 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.310
 some things at least of the lipsticks that 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.369
 I have dailus and dailus pro 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.240
 liquid is the problem so on time 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.390
 to apply as it is the case of 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.300
 I'm using here, what 's this? 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 that is in my mouth and that way 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.950
 that I'm using people do not give 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.530
 problem does not fail 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.390
 spotted and I then decided to do this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.000
 video to leave from here to you 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.559
 This is what I'm going to say. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.210
 you here now I particularly 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.320
 ends up killing two rabbits with a 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.199
 I only came back to use my 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.390
 Cream lipsticks, right? 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.670
 when I discover the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.369
 liquids, especially those of light 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.710
 which I love and I leaned against and I 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.350
 I do not care because after all 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.280
 Beads are pretty good lipsticks some good 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.860
 expensive 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.600
 This one, for example, one from LancÃ´me I 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.509
 I bought at a time when there was a novel 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.369
 there the country is isolated scallop I do not know 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.100
 I forgot the name of the actress that mulatta 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.110
 country, something she was using in the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.320
 Her wedding a lipstick and there was a lot of 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.600
 beautiful and by the time I left behind a 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.170
 I agree more closely with her than I 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.810
 I got there and it's super 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.720
 I have been leaning for a long time because I am 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.610
 in love with martin liquid lipsticks 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.850
 So what do I do when I have a 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.189
 cooks so the family of the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.090
 gives this pigmentation problem is 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.729
 Axe 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.810
 I'm going to use it here underneath as 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:59.130
 base and then apply the liquid 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.439
 max on top of that alone without this 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.439
 How bad it works when it comes to applying 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:10.979
 I've got a great cup. 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.510
 take it normal and you will not have a side 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.670
 spotted then this is the video 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.519
 what I wanted to do for you to okay 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.409
 there for the staff who 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.360
 How I fell in love with this lipstick? 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.489
 11 that some are even giving up for 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.069
 think it is not worth it because 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.190
 ax is too rather gives people the valley 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.849
 Feeling calming is you buy button 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.459
 I have button is all the colors of the 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.010
 other than those of heading No 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.000
 trademarks to be used as a basis 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.150
 if you do not have those lipstick 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.970
 $ 1 knows and buys one of each color 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.319
 similar to the liquors you have to 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.889
 I assure you it will be worth it. 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.260
 because I like lipstick people a lot 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:59.019
 but there are actually some 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.989
 complicates at the time of application and always 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.870
 that you see a lipstick is in my 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.120
 lips and like if it has been a 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.099
 liquid match sure it was not 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.349
 applied alone in my mouth so 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.209
 that sometimes I do not even talk because I'm 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.489
 afraid to talk because after all 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.280
 It's still a mix-up, but I 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.190
 I do not think it's out of the color 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.980
 original than me than I really 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.040
 I want to use that sekita that cold 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.389
 it's really like a base he does not 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.790
 interferes with the color of the male 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.919
 Go ahead, it's okay, it 's just a little video. 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.829
 Dedicate, I really want to thank you. 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.419
 affection around the world all new 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.859
 I do not know where it is 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.209
 happening is coming a lot of 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.069
 new people on the channel 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.989
 I want to thank everyone who 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.790
 showed affection after I started 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.620
 in a video that I like to see the staff 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.590
 arriving but I still like 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.510
 see the faces many people gave the faces 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.400
 I feel very happy 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.650
 I try to answer everyone as far as I can. 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.750
 of the possible is in something else that I 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.519
 I want to thank you for the comments there. 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.040
 about the hair, right? 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.419
 I liked the hair and also liked 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.159
 have to wait a little bit to grow 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.079
 more up here to give a 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.650
 framed the most I also found that 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.269
 It was really cool, I did not cut too much. 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.940
 I left it a little bit long there 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.430
 because this case did not work 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.810
 time of some good hairdresser is 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.840
 fix it 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.560
 But there are a lot of people asking for 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.180
 do 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.830
 show how I'm doing this 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.550
 Hair people have no secret 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:37.169
 My hair is semi natural, I'm alone. 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.550
 wash seko more or less with a 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.240
 dryer then I tidy up the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.860
 fringe and comes with non-rinse cream giving 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.870
 one step in it but I'll make one
