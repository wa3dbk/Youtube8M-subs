00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.710 
close the skate up you just push this
BOA<00:01:42.479> dial<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> twist<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:44.579> pulls<00:01:45.329> from

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
BOA dial and twist and this pulls from

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.569 
BOA dial and twist and this pulls from
the<00:01:45.780> bottom<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.649> you're<00:01:46.799> getting<00:01:47.070> an<00:01:47.159> even

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the bottom so you're getting an even

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.429 
the bottom so you're getting an even
closure<00:01:48.060> throughout<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> whole<00:01:48.899> skate<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
closure throughout the whole skate and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.380 
closure throughout the whole skate and
getting<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> nice<00:01:49.979> snug<00:01:50.310> fit<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:51.000> quite

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
getting a nice snug fit it's quite

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.359 
getting a nice snug fit it's quite
amazing<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.560> latch<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.130> power

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
amazing and then you latch up this power

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.580 
amazing and then you latch up this power
strap<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.210> ready<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.810> Mike<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
strap and you are ready to go Mike I

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.080 
strap and you are ready to go Mike I
just<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.979> say<00:01:56.130> something<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.909> we've

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
just like to say something so we've

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.850 
just like to say something so we've
talked<00:01:57.299> about<00:01:57.420> boa<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.960> other<00:01:58.140> skates<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.829> I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
talked about boa in other skates and I

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.620 
talked about boa in other skates and I
think<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> fact<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.430> k2<00:01:59.850> puts<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.390> in

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
think the fact that k2 puts this in

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.450 
think the fact that k2 puts this in
their<00:02:01.020> high-end<00:02:01.710> top-of-the-line

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
their high-end top-of-the-line

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.940 
their high-end top-of-the-line
performance<00:02:02.790> gate<00:02:03.360> proves<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.140> boa<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.710> not

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
performance gate proves that boa is not

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.590 
performance gate proves that boa is not
a<00:02:04.979> gimmick<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:05.850> not<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
a gimmick and it's not just a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.949 
a gimmick and it's not just a
recreational<00:02:07.469> feature<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.250> performance

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
recreational feature it's a performance

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.630 
recreational feature it's a performance
fitting<00:02:09.959> product<00:02:10.500> yeah<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.129> mean<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.580> could

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
fitting product yeah I mean if I could

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.530 
fitting product yeah I mean if I could
have<00:02:11.849> bow<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.180> pretty<00:02:12.569> much<00:02:12.720> everything<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.200> own

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
have bow on pretty much everything I own

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.509 
have bow on pretty much everything I own
she<00:02:13.659> wise<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.870> would<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.769> if<00:02:14.980> they<00:02:15.099> are<00:02:15.219> that

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
she wise I would it is if they are that

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.069 
she wise I would it is if they are that
good<00:02:15.549> and<00:02:16.030> they<00:02:16.120> are<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.450> easy<00:02:16.689> to<00:02:16.870> work<00:02:17.019> with

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
good and they are that easy to work with

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.929 
good and they are that easy to work with
I<00:02:17.500> know<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.159> have<00:02:18.400> them<00:02:18.519> on<00:02:18.609> your<00:02:18.730> k2

that's gonna give you the support you
need<00:02:38.349> carbon<00:02:39.099> fiber<00:02:39.280> base<00:02:39.639> which<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.209> really

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
need carbon fiber base which is really

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.970 
need carbon fiber base which is really
going<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.599> transfer<00:02:41.109> that<00:02:41.230> energy<00:02:41.290> from<00:02:41.859> your

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
going to transfer that energy from your

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.099 
going to transfer that energy from your
foot<00:02:42.189> to<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.849> milled<00:02:43.120> aluminum<00:02:43.239> frame<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
foot to this milled aluminum frame and

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.080 
foot to this milled aluminum frame and
it's<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.290> performance<00:02:44.650> high-low<00:02:45.219> frame<00:02:45.549> so<00:02:46.060> you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
it's a performance high-low frame so you

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.509 
it's a performance high-low frame so you
get<00:02:46.599> 110<00:02:47.530> millimeter<00:02:47.920> wheels<00:02:48.129> in<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> back

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
get 110 millimeter wheels in the back

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.699 
get 110 millimeter wheels in the back
the<00:02:48.849> biggest<00:02:49.180> wheel<00:02:49.510> out<00:02:49.720> there<00:02:49.989> right<00:02:50.170> yes<00:02:50.439> it

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
the biggest wheel out there right yes it

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.199 
the biggest wheel out there right yes it
is<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:50.980> biggest<00:02:51.220> wheel<00:02:51.370> out<00:02:51.549> there<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:52.060> get<00:02:52.150> a

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
is the biggest wheel out there you get a

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.420 
is the biggest wheel out there you get a
hundred<00:02:52.540> millimeters<00:02:53.230> up<00:02:53.379> front<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.859> out

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
hundred millimeters up front and out

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.640 
hundred millimeters up front and out
what<00:02:54.639> it<00:02:54.730> does<00:02:54.760> it's<00:02:55.299> you<00:02:55.569> know<00:02:55.689> it's<00:02:55.870> speed

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
what it does it's you know it's speed

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.319 
what it does it's you know it's speed
with<00:02:56.889> the<00:02:57.010> back<00:02:57.189> wheels<00:02:57.489> maneuverability

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
with the back wheels maneuverability

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.789 
with the back wheels maneuverability
with<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.569> front<00:02:58.810> wheels<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.230> you've<00:02:59.560> got<00:02:59.769> a

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
with the front wheels and you've got a

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.530 
with the front wheels and you've got a
big<00:03:00.280> wheel<00:03:00.489> setup<00:03:00.790> here<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.180> you're<00:03:01.299> gonna<00:03:01.389> go

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
big wheel setup here so you're gonna go

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.420 
big wheel setup here so you're gonna go
faster<00:03:01.989> than<00:03:02.139> you're<00:03:02.560> gonna<00:03:02.620> go<00:03:02.829> on<00:03:02.950> any<00:03:03.250> other

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
faster than you're gonna go on any other

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.280 
faster than you're gonna go on any other
