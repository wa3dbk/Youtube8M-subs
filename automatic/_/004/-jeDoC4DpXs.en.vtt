00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello in touch with you love it 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.679
 you today we study in the cracked posts 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.070
 choose a color for from me connected 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.070
 sample 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.779
 Here we will study the columns with 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.000
 naquids 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.119
 for this we have created a chain of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.760
 air loops for lifting 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.859
 rows we need to skip four 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.739
 air loops 1 2 3 and 4 and hook 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.770
 output 5 loop for this we do 2 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:46.789
 nakida and enter the hook into the fifth loop from 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:50.070
 hooks grab the working thread and 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.800
 we drag through the loop through the air 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.829
 loop pull the loop on the hook with us 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.620
 4 loops are captured 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.730
 working thread and pull through two 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.290
 loop on the hook, we have three loops 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.770
 put the hook over and put the hook in 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.750
 bottom row through the loop here is this loop 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.280
 skip the next loop enter the hook 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.330
 and bottom row hook bottom row 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.060
 grabbing a working thread and pulling out 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.530
 the loop on the hook forms 5 loops 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.549
 called him grip hands jerk work 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.400
 thread and port I through two loops then 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.220
 again grab the worker thread and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.960
 drag through two loops again 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.799
 came to grab jobs 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.079
 drag through two loops again 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.810
 grabbing a working thread. he will give them 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.320
 through two loops 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.390
 doing we knit one air loop 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:56.820
 we put on a hook and a hook we enter 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.270
 crossed loops here are the bottom two 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.180
 in two loops with us and we are right here in 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.680
 the middle of the shooting is greeted by entering 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.099
 hook we grab a working thread with a hook 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.489
 pull out through 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.330
 and now through crossed loops here 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.880
 formed on the hook 3 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.250
 three but also about melancholy seize the worker 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.710
 thread of risk and pull through two 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.760
 loops again grab the worker thread and 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:28.480
 once again about this mushroom glue do 2 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:34.150
 nakida hook and enter the bottom hook 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.970
 row next loop pull out again 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.640
 loop hook crochet working thread and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.970
 pull through two loops again 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.530
 hook up 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.690
 skip one loop in the bottom row and 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.780
 enter the hook below poke the bottom row 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.990
 through one we capture a working thread and 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.990
 take out 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.970
 grabbing the thread again 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.970
 knit all the loops in pairs 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.020
 we knit one air loop on 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.200
 hook do a cap and enter the hook into 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.730
 the middle 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.730
 connected to 2 5 crossed 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.790
 grab the working thread pull out on 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.640
 hook 3 loops 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.950
 grab the worker thread again and in pairs 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:33.400
 knit do 2 nakida and again 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.570
 hook enter the next loop bottom 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.459
 tying a row onto a photon 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.670
 seized too work the thread and 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.880
 provyazyvaem two loops again doing sc 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.970
 skip the bottom row one loop you 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.810
 drive the next loop of the bottom row 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:56.610
 hook grab crochet working thread and 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.610
 knit all the loops in pairs 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.120
 knit 1 air loop do 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.960
 put on the hook and enter the hook again in the middle 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.880
 two crossed loops 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:22.910
 pull out a loop and knit 5 pairs 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.930
 do 2 nakida so we knit 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.930
 to end of row 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.730
 we have the last loop in the row 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:39.140
 so do a double coat and 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:39.140
 knit a column with two nakida 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.040
 We end this row with columns 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.470
 two naqida 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.130
 for lifting we knit four 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.130
 air loops 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.510
 the work unfold again doing 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:07.620
 double wrap and enter the hook in the first 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:11.760
 loop the bottom row do a cape 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:15.480
 skip one loop of the bottom row and 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.150
 you enter here we have a loop was not air 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.830
 tied but also and skip and type in 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.830
 next loop of the bottom row 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.110
 knit 1 air loop do 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:41.220
 nakid and the middle of the meeting on the loop 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:46.230
 we enter the hook into it with our own loop and again 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:50.100
 knitting loops in pairs doing double 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:55.140
 put on the hook enter the next loop 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:57.770
 bottom row and pull out and knit 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.450
 in the same way the middle is ruled 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.880
 miss one loop of air which 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:07.160
 was knit in it in our bottom row 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:12.350
 and enter the next loop of the bottom row 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.350
 again we knock all the loops again 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:33.840
 that's what we get is the same 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:36.819
 the picture is a piggy bank 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.330
 practice, I think you have everything 

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:42.330
 I need to say goodbye to you 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
 date
