then<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:04.519> get<00:01:04.640> down<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.939> grass<00:01:05.180> clippings

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
then you get down to grass clippings

that we got are interesting it took
about<00:01:12.040> about<00:01:13.040> six<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.549> eight<00:01:13.700> weeks<00:01:13.970> before<00:01:14.329> we

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
about about six to eight weeks before we

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.219 
about about six to eight weeks before we
had<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.840> final<00:01:15.229> compost<00:01:15.920> created<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:17.229> the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
had the final compost created and the

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.649 
had the final compost created and the
bins<00:01:18.469> that<00:01:18.649> were<00:01:18.770> in<00:01:18.920> front<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.310> here<00:01:19.729> are<00:01:19.939> the

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
bins that were in front of here are the

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.319 
bins that were in front of here are the
the<00:01:21.560> open<00:01:21.920> standing<00:01:22.369> bins<00:01:22.670> rather<00:01:22.999> than<00:01:23.210> the

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
the open standing bins rather than the

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.169 
the open standing bins rather than the
tumblers<00:01:23.749> the<00:01:24.649> bins<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.280> general<00:01:25.819> had<00:01:26.030> the

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
tumblers the bins in general had the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.499 
tumblers the bins in general had the
highest<00:01:26.359> temperatures<00:01:27.280> recording<00:01:28.280> up<00:01:28.429> 240<00:01:29.329> or

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
highest temperatures recording up 240 or

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.200 
highest temperatures recording up 240 or
more<00:01:30.020> degrees<00:01:30.439> but<00:01:30.950> we<00:01:31.069> also<00:01:31.280> did<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.759> screening

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
more degrees but we also did a screening

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.959 
more degrees but we also did a screening
so<00:01:32.869> we<00:01:32.960> had<00:01:33.109> mesh<00:01:33.740> wire<00:01:34.130> mesh<00:01:34.429> that<00:01:34.789> was

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
so we had mesh wire mesh that was

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.520 
so we had mesh wire mesh that was
quarter<00:01:35.719> inch<00:01:36.429> squares<00:01:37.429> in<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.450> mesh<00:01:38.659> what<00:01:39.380> we

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
quarter inch squares in the mesh what we

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.480 
quarter inch squares in the mesh what we
found<00:01:39.710> was<00:01:40.009> that<00:01:40.329> this<00:01:41.329> vesper<00:01:42.259> oh<00:01:42.319> sorry<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
found was that this vesper oh sorry the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.819 
found was that this vesper oh sorry the
Presto<00:01:44.709> composter<00:01:46.389> provided<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:48.409> greatest

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
Presto composter provided the greatest

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.609 
Presto composter provided the greatest
ratio<00:01:49.249> of<00:01:49.490> screened<00:01:49.909> material<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:51.229> material

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
ratio of screened material to material

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.849 
ratio of screened material to material
that<00:01:51.979> didn't<00:01:52.310> go<00:01:52.459> through<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.789> screen<00:01:53.619> so<00:01:54.619> it

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
that didn't go through the screen so it

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.459 
that didn't go through the screen so it
did<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.369> best<00:01:55.520> job<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:55.939> composting<00:01:56.509> it's<00:01:57.229> all

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
did the best job of composting it's all

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.120 
did the best job of composting it's all
fairly<00:01:57.829> close<00:01:58.459> to<00:01:58.969> the<00:01:58.999> other<00:01:59.329> bins<00:02:00.079> but<00:02:00.950> this

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
fairly close to the other bins but this

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.809 
fairly close to the other bins but this
was<00:02:01.429> our<00:02:01.609> best<00:02:02.259> result<00:02:03.259> with<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.740> one<00:02:03.950> we

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
was our best result with this one we

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.419 
was our best result with this one we
also<00:02:04.999> did<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.299> visual<00:02:05.539> rating<00:02:06.100> we<00:02:07.100> looked<00:02:07.310> at

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
also did a visual rating we looked at

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.550 
also did a visual rating we looked at
the<00:02:07.490> compost<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.179> did<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> visual<00:02:08.660> evaluation

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
the compost and did a visual evaluation

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.630 
the compost and did a visual evaluation
of<00:02:09.679> them<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.069> found<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.270> Presto<00:02:11.690> was

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
of them and found that the Presto was

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.390 
of them and found that the Presto was
slightly<00:02:13.640> better<00:02:13.970> than<00:02:14.120> any<00:02:14.420> other<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:16.099> this

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
slightly better than any other and this

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.420 
slightly better than any other and this
one<00:02:16.610> was<00:02:16.790> second<00:02:17.209> this<00:02:18.140> one<00:02:18.349> is<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:19.250> home

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
one was second this one is the the home

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.030 
one was second this one is the the home
composter<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.810> nice<00:02:20.990> thing<00:02:21.230> about<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.800> has

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
composter the nice thing about it is has

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.580 
composter the nice thing about it is has
a<00:02:22.070> lid<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:22.730> notice<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.840> doesn't<00:02:24.050> have<00:02:24.200> as<00:02:24.440> much

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
a lid but notice it doesn't have as much

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.590 
a lid but notice it doesn't have as much
air<00:02:24.860> circulation<00:02:25.510> okay

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
air circulation okay

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.390 
air circulation okay
you<00:02:26.660> want<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.960> air<00:02:27.230> circulation<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.100> that's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
you want that air circulation and that's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.640 
you want that air circulation and that's
really<00:02:28.610> good<00:02:29.060> but<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.840> does<00:02:29.990> have<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> lid<00:02:30.440> for

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
really good but it does have a lid for

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.530 
really good but it does have a lid for
the<00:02:30.740> winter<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.160> if<00:02:31.280> it's<00:02:31.430> raining<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.820> lot<00:02:31.970> this

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
the winter so if it's raining a lot this

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.210 
the winter so if it's raining a lot this
will<00:02:32.750> protect<00:02:32.930> your<00:02:33.230> compost<00:02:33.740> a<00:02:33.860> little<00:02:34.100> bit

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
will protect your compost a little bit

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.040 
will protect your compost a little bit
better<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.670> keep<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.540> little<00:02:35.690> warmer

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
better and keep it a little warmer

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.020 
better and keep it a little warmer
during<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.590> winter<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> earth

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
during the winter this is the earth

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.510 
during the winter this is the earth
engine<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:39.560> talk<00:02:39.860> about<00:02:40.130> good<00:02:40.340> air

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
engine and talk about good air

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.280 
engine and talk about good air
circulation<00:02:41.060> great<00:02:41.660> air<00:02:41.870> circulation<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:44.290> it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
circulation great air circulation and it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.560 
circulation great air circulation and it
had<00:02:45.470> really<00:02:46.340> good<00:02:46.490> results<00:02:46.940> also<00:02:47.090> it's<00:02:47.510> just

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
had really good results also it's just

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.010 
had really good results also it's just
that<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.990> Presto<00:02:48.410> we<00:02:48.890> found<00:02:49.160> did<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.730> best<00:02:50.020> so

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
that the Presto we found did the best so

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.230 
that the Presto we found did the best so
here<00:02:51.320> we<00:02:51.440> have<00:02:51.620> our<00:02:51.800> tumblers<00:02:52.280> what<00:02:52.820> we<00:02:53.000> found

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
here we have our tumblers what we found

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.960 
here we have our tumblers what we found
was<00:02:55.000> they<00:02:56.000> generally<00:02:56.600> didn't<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.700> bins

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
was they generally didn't the the bins

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.640 
was they generally didn't the the bins
are<00:02:59.210> smaller<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.810> containers<00:03:00.230> are<00:03:00.380> smaller

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
are smaller the containers are smaller

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.930 
are smaller the containers are smaller
so<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:02.000> have<00:03:02.690> less<00:03:02.930> mass<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:03.940> generally

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
so you have less mass and generally

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.780 
so you have less mass and generally
lower<00:03:05.270> temperatures<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.190> even<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.490> our

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
lower temperatures and even in our

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.940 
lower temperatures and even in our
current<00:03:08.660> batch<00:03:08.870> we<00:03:09.230> have<00:03:09.380> our<00:03:09.500> second<00:03:09.830> batch

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
current batch we have our second batch

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.240 
current batch we have our second batch
going<00:03:10.340> now<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:11.720> temperatures<00:03:12.230> are<00:03:12.260> lower

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
going now the temperatures are lower

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.280 
going now the temperatures are lower
slightly<00:03:14.060> lower<00:03:14.390> in<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.660> hundred<00:03:14.990> and<00:03:15.080> thirty

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
slightly lower in the hundred and thirty

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.380 
slightly lower in the hundred and thirty
two<00:03:15.380> hundred<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.740> forty<00:03:16.010> degree<00:03:16.250> range<00:03:16.460> this

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
two hundred and forty degree range this

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.960 
two hundred and forty degree range this
is<00:03:17.450> after<00:03:17.870> only<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.410> week<00:03:18.730> whereas<00:03:19.730> our

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
is after only a week whereas our

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.890 
is after only a week whereas our
composters<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.380> bins<00:03:21.650> are<00:03:22.520> up<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.880> 160

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
composters the the bins are up to 160

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.040 
composters the the bins are up to 160
so<00:03:24.560> generally<00:03:25.190> warmer<00:03:25.520> on<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.730> bins<00:03:26.050> the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
so generally warmer on the bins the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.850 
so generally warmer on the bins the
enviros<00:03:27.500> cycle<00:03:27.890> actually<00:03:28.250> did<00:03:28.430> fairly<00:03:28.790> well

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
enviros cycle actually did fairly well

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.230 
enviros cycle actually did fairly well
at<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.010> end<00:03:31.160> of<00:03:31.280> our<00:03:31.400> trial<00:03:31.700> we<00:03:31.880> had<00:03:32.030> pretty

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
at the end of our trial we had pretty

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.960 
at the end of our trial we had pretty
good<00:03:32.360> compost<00:03:32.930> made<00:03:33.170> from<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:33.580> so<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:34.760> worked

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
good compost made from this so it worked

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.230 
good compost made from this so it worked
pretty<00:03:35.270> well<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:36.770> tumbleweed<00:03:37.220> also<00:03:37.670> maybe

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
pretty well the tumbleweed also maybe

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.580 
pretty well the tumbleweed also maybe
not<00:03:38.390> quite<00:03:38.720> as<00:03:38.990> good<00:03:39.610> and<00:03:40.610> our<00:03:40.760> first<00:03:41.000> batch

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
not quite as good and our first batch

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.490 
not quite as good and our first batch
notice<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:43.370> air<00:03:43.550> circulation<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.600> not<00:03:45.110> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
notice the air circulation is not the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.920 
notice the air circulation is not the
best<00:03:45.770> there's<00:03:46.250> only<00:03:46.430> four<00:03:46.730> holes<00:03:46.970> here<00:03:47.360> and

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
best there's only four holes here and

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.920 
best there's only four holes here and
then<00:03:48.080> there's<00:03:48.290> four<00:03:48.530> holes<00:03:48.740> on<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.040> bottom

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
then there's four holes on the bottom

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.150 
then there's four holes on the bottom
but<00:03:50.930> talk<00:03:51.140> about<00:03:51.350> an<00:03:51.440> easy<00:03:51.560> way<00:03:51.800> to<00:03:51.830> turn<00:03:52.100> a

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
but talk about an easy way to turn a

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.240 
but talk about an easy way to turn a
compost<00:03:52.720> tumbler<00:03:53.720> it's<00:03:54.440> very<00:03:54.650> simple<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.070> turn

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
compost tumbler it's very simple to turn

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.870 
compost tumbler it's very simple to turn
it<00:03:56.470> but<00:03:57.470> again<00:03:57.740> you<00:03:58.130> want<00:03:58.340> good<00:03:58.610> air

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
it but again you want good air

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.390 
it but again you want good air
circulation<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.780> the<00:04:00.500> tumblers<00:04:00.980> just<00:04:01.220> don't

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
circulation and the tumblers just don't

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.610 
circulation and the tumblers just don't
have<00:04:01.610> quite<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:02.000> circulation<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:03.290> some<00:04:03.530> of

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
have quite the circulation that some of

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.280 
have quite the circulation that some of
these<00:04:03.710> standing<00:04:04.160> bins<00:04:04.580> have<00:04:04.850> so<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:05.870> wanted<00:04:06.230> to

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
these standing bins have so I wanted to

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.100 
these standing bins have so I wanted to
talk<00:04:06.620> about<00:04:06.800> this<00:04:07.130> enviro<00:04:07.820> cycle<00:04:08.420> which<00:04:08.960> I

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
talk about this enviro cycle which I

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.860 
talk about this enviro cycle which I
have<00:04:09.290> in<00:04:09.440> my<00:04:09.560> house<00:04:09.800> and<00:04:10.100> I'm<00:04:10.220> not<00:04:10.870> composting

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
have in my house and I'm not composting

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.810 
have in my house and I'm not composting
correctly<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.920> want<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.160> talk<00:04:13.370> about<00:04:13.670> the

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
correctly and I want to talk about the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.940 
correctly and I want to talk about the
results<00:04:14.270> of<00:04:14.390> what<00:04:14.870> happens<00:04:15.200> if<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.470> don't<00:04:15.680> add

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
results of what happens if you don't add

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.840 
results of what happens if you don't add
both<00:04:16.910> green<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.630> brown<00:04:17.900> material<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:19.460> we

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
both green and brown material so we

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.700 
both green and brown material so we
started<00:04:20.299> with<00:04:20.480> material<00:04:21.080> that<00:04:21.230> was<00:04:21.410> both

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
started with material that was both

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.560 
started with material that was both
green<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.010> brown<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.640> included<00:04:23.150> some<00:04:23.330> straw

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
green and brown it included some straw

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.710 
green and brown it included some straw
some<00:04:23.960> clippings<00:04:24.490> from<00:04:25.490> plants<00:04:26.000> as<00:04:26.120> well<00:04:26.450> as

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
some clippings from plants as well as

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.750 
some clippings from plants as well as
lawn<00:04:27.170> clippings<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.710> little<00:04:27.920> bit<00:04:28.040> and<00:04:28.220> then<00:04:28.640> we

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
lawn clippings a little bit and then we

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.330 
lawn clippings a little bit and then we
kept<00:04:29.000> adding<00:04:29.240> kitchen<00:04:29.810> waste<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.350> I<00:04:31.100> never

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
kept adding kitchen waste and I never
