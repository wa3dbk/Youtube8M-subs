00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.660
 the helm went right for us on autoradio 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.150
 who of us literally did not lose his temper 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.259
 from the long wait staff traffic police on 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.389
 place of accident 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.949
 Yes, probably anyone who had an accident 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.630
 it will be easier now 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.820
 fixed the traffic made 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.330
 changes that are intended to substantially 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.119
 ease the plight of everyone who got into an accident 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.330
 what exactly now we will understand so 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.390
 dull thud scraping metal 4 corporate 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.790
 pawed where you are if you disagree with 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.309
 by guilty in crash or disagree that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.620
 all the damage is done by you 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.480
 of course you should call guy 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.730
 but not to call an employee 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 and to ask the attendant and 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.950
 what to do if the attendant says they say 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.590
 go for clearance on 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.710
 nearest post dps or in division 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.140
 gai means go wherever they say but 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.879
 take a picture of everything beforehand 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.340
 is related to the accident 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.129
 but not to call the police at all 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.409
 have rights if you and your 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.170
 the enemy admitted that they were to blame 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.350
 you what exactly did you smash the magician door and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.360
 wing in this case you can 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.369
 having photographed crash sites and damage 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.259
 machines go to your own choice 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.590
 or in a traffic police unit 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.930
 or for the post dps well and if caused 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.689
 your damage in your mutual opinion is not 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.970
 exceeds 50,000 rubles in traffic police can and 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.270
 not at all being filled in for 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.290
 insurance notice crash and parted you 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.119
 be surprised 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.799
 there are some documents and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.430
 traffic accident you do not 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.220
 are needed 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.680
 there are only cars that hit 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.070
 for example the telegraph pole vga and you 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.600
 This may or may not communicate and 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.899
 leaving the place of the accident in that case 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.329
 will be absolutely legal and perhaps the most 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.030
 important if your scattered 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.250
 roadway vehicles 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.159
 create an obstacle for other cars you 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.500
 duty to photograph the crash sites and 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.049
 free up the roadway for example 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.600
 put the car to the side of the rules 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.970
 Starting July 1, the following 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:19.160
 years but start getting used to them 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.160
