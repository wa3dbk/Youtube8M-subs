00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello people welcome to one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.759
 another vice bees tutorial and today 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.319
 it's all about the curry for the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.690
 people do not know what a chris 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.240
 mcquarrie, so to speak, a mining turtle 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.219
 with the command extras hotter up 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.590
 digs to the bottom and holds everything 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
 degrades and then a box does only the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.480
 the advantage is that the energy 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.039
 is operated so with eu and that the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.460
 things just headed directly into the box 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.810
 become 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.810
 and now for the first time how the whole 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.519
 builds up so first we need for 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.759
 three landmarks and we put it that way 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.219
 that it gives a total square and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.059
 yes , then there is one, for example 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.629
 Animal and one after there so a review 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.910
 a maximum of 64 64 april 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.920
 and yes, if we are here then the three country 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.379
 we have clicked on the merckx 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.420
 middle with a right click on it and 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.370
 then the red quadrangle appears 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.180
 and here we put our career 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.890
 and then this red spot becomes 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.210
 lockable box and yes now need 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.879
 we still have the curve with electricity 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.350
 we do that with electricals engines 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.880
 and last and so on and so on 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.220
 then we have to go with one 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 Lambs or stop with Nelson Torch 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.390
 operate and just do it and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.799
 then they would pump a power though 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.320
 we do not have any electricity yet 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.909
 That's why we close here 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.680
 so that together with fiber optic cables 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.540
 each connects and then we sit down 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.540
 a power storage for example a mf 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.490
 is and these sentences become 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.860
 For example, a solar cell for 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.579
 example in high voltage or so 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.150
 something similar 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.400
 but it must have at least two low voltage 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.590
 be solar gensets with them 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.360
 works consistently and see now 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.149
 We made that they been here a frame 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.500
 frames and yes if that's done 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.680
 is it going? 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.240
 first a little tip if so 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.220
 The prairie is digging down so far 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.720
 until she either encounters lava or 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.820
 stop on bedrock and therefore as 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.710
 small tip just in a corner here 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.710
 Make a water bucket downstairs 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.490
 so and so would the whole lava too 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.129
 become oxidized and the cradle itself 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.629
 really down to the bottom by now 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.280
 First, what really happens when 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.930
 the frame is full and that comes then 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.670
 so laser beam out and build the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.040
 whole blocks off and then this will be here 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.370
 pumped up and put out like eg 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.140
 second crack pipe one way and so and so 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.650
 Here we can then our boxes 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.830
 put in the yes in the boxes 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.549
 just pumped in all the time like that or 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.880
 either way stop and as we shall see 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.709
 we now pumped the things rhine and 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.989
 yes, here comes the laser beam out and 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.030
 everything is great now if you want the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.140
 Quali built a long way from home 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.849
 you can and indeed you can easily 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.790
 use a breath test directly and the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.530
 you just sit up here like this and 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.209
 because you have to say how stop that 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.980
 frequency is where i'm paid 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.760
 just call it 23 so the free 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.099
 to be familiar 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.150
 and then we have to be back here 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.790
 ever something prepared 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.519
 a second aspect is and must be 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.739
 also be on frequency 23 and then 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.810
 we see that the items are the same here 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.459
 come out and here we are 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.489
 now already at the next point 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.500
 and here a storage system and indeed 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.849
 comes from the query a lot of shit 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.889
 out eg so earth or gremmel or 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.349
 cobblestone which is not that much 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.920
 that's why a little tip here needs one 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.389
 make diamond transport pipeline and 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.790
 You can stop it with a filter 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.799
 populate and here in the red because here 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.970
 the red end in this type in there 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.919
 goes with cobblestone earth and gremmel 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.290
 and then it will stop there 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.599
 deducted and then in this world 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.120
 transport pipeline and this destroyed 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.459
 go back in all the items and then 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.590
 Another tip here is the credit 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.090
 produces a lot of items and would 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.260
 let all your boxes be full then 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.180
 maybe they would still be valuable 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.400
 Tips at the bottom are lost 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.500
 that's why a filter here too 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.440
 Example of diamonds travel 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.329
 the split blue or red and then stop 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.430
 into the special boxes if you 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.379
 do not know how something is tasted then 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.030
 you go into your inventory and he pushes 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.960
 and then you see how the whole 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.480
 is looked at 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.690
 So I will not show you if you have something 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.700
 everything because we will do everything and yes 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.560
 I hope you like the tutorial 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.090
 And he still keeps it very fast 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.830
 a time- proven source 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.390
 really works and yes i hope so 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.810
 yes the tutorial fell to the 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.810
 next time
