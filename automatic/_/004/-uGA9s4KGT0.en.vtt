 Yoshi Yoshi This time the grief that ended in the last fall is not so active 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.770
 Certainly, there was activity there in there 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:10.660
 This should increase the number of users of grief 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:12.650
 I think it's better to give up a flower ride than to grief 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:17.830
 It 's not so good 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.830
