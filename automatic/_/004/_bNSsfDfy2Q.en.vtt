00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
control with a slight lean forward as

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.750 
control with a slight lean forward as
far<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.530> body<00:01:07.799> lean<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> things<00:01:08.700> that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
far as body lean one of the things that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.520 
far as body lean one of the things that
you'll<00:01:09.000> find<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.689> often<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you'll find is that often the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.290 
you'll find is that often the
interviewer<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.580> lean<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> little<00:01:11.910> bit

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
interviewer will lean a little bit

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.330 
interviewer will lean a little bit
toward<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.870> as<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.770> ask<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.190> two<00:01:14.310> questions

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
toward you as they ask you two questions

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.270 
toward you as they ask you two questions
and<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.750> good<00:01:15.960> idea<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.320> respond<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.250> kind

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and it's a good idea to respond in kind

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700 
and it's a good idea to respond in kind
if<00:01:17.940> you<00:01:18.300> find<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.660> they<00:01:18.840> don't<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.470> any

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
if you find that they don't do any

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.770 
if you find that they don't do any
leaning<00:01:20.160> you<00:01:20.280> might<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> very<00:01:21.090> slight<00:01:21.450> lean

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
leaning you might do a very slight lean

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.480 
leaning you might do a very slight lean
because<00:01:22.440> one<00:01:22.620> of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> one<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.280> things

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
because one of the one of the things

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
because one of the one of the things
that<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.760> know<00:01:23.940> from<00:01:24.090> non-verbal<00:01:24.690> studies<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that we know from non-verbal studies is

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.950 
that we know from non-verbal studies is
that<00:01:25.710> behavioral<00:01:26.670> matching<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.270> important<00:01:27.840> so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
that behavioral matching is important so

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.620 
that behavioral matching is important so
when<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.860> behaving<00:01:29.420> physically<00:01:30.420> in

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
when they see you behaving physically in

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.690 
when they see you behaving physically in
ways<00:01:31.110> similar<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.980> how<00:01:32.160> they're<00:01:32.430> behaving

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
ways similar to how they're behaving

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.400 
ways similar to how they're behaving
then<00:01:33.480> they're<00:01:33.690> going<00:01:33.870> to<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.260> as<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
then they're going to see that as a

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.140 
then they're going to see that as a
positive<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:35.010> you<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.430> as<00:01:35.580> similar<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
positive if you see you as similar to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.390 
positive if you see you as similar to
them<00:01:36.300> and<00:01:36.540> similarity<00:01:37.320> enhances<00:01:37.920> liking

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
them and similarity enhances liking

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.930 
them and similarity enhances liking
liking<00:01:39.030> enhances<00:01:39.510> credibility<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.430> match

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
liking enhances credibility so so match

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.060 
liking enhances credibility so so match
their<00:01:42.270> behavior<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.720> some<00:01:43.020> extent<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.770> want

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
their behavior to some extent you want

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.830 
their behavior to some extent you want
at<00:01:44.220> least<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.550> little<00:01:44.730> bit<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.060> lean<00:01:45.300> for<00:01:45.570> but

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
at least a little bit of lean for but

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.740 
at least a little bit of lean for but
