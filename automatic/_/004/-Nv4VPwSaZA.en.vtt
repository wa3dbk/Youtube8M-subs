00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.699
 plastic and upper case 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.890
 fan hole is located

 in addition to the body of the handle there 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.909

 heated plastic 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.040
 the principle of operation is very simple 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.110
 the heating element of the handle warms up 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.580
 about with plastic which is in the air 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.060
 instantly freezes and so we connect 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.649
 power adapter 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.479
 we press the button of reception of plastic and

 buttons to the far right 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.649
 plastic release rate will increase 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.229
 availability time is 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.450

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.160
 plastic 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.709
 drawing 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.660
 itâ€™s best to start from the surface to 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.300
 create a foothold for the material 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.819
 and in the process you can raise 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.519
 handle air leaving a trail of 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.620

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.480
 all this is a bit like working with

 color options both of plastic can 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.570
 be very different for example such with 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.920
 using 3d pens can be made 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.320
 geometric shapes for 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.900
 educational process and various 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.800
 decoration toys and useful things like 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.900
 in our case 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.920
 unusual look of paper clips 3d pen 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.970
