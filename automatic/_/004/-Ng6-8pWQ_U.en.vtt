00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.880
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.130
 continue somehow on the german 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.599
 automaker my name is robin and me 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.220
 Show yourself today as one almost 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.169
 I created this fully automatic form 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.890
 first my creative - and that one the 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.780
 great box 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.449
 You see it already tried more often 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.610
 to show but there was recommend again 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.400
 because we are pursuing it for us 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.900
 need for a gas plant several 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:49.890
 puzzle torches redstone repeater sticking 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:54.449
 dispenser water no tool but one 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.870
 hoe whatever samuel and wool 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.120
 instead of being able to roll this arbitrary 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.320
 use parents 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.390
 and yes we are now working first with 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.920
 all the stuff and how the whole 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.030
 is contingent I show you now as 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.770
 First we place here 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.409
 because I should have one again 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.180
 creative has to go 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 premiere our wool blocks place 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.049
 on it 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.619
 our dispens from two blocks of it 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.080
 remove 12 and how a spencer and 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.409
 Bites into the ground from rats 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.390
 all its activated is on it 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.100
 you put the trick blog on me 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.450
 later we will place our wheat 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:38.310
 when the extended yet more comfortable and 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.280
 also here on another slopes 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.420
 Now we are looking at the slopes here 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 once wool frame and here where the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.350
 gone out that comes to a joke 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.840
 and torch the last thing we do now 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.909
 to let execute here and yourself 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.850
 the whole block is calling it that way 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.670
 it will then look to the net of 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.330
 you still flow to the side and one 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.729
 block up and then further and here 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.170
 a riddle question but then comes 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.759
 still a blog on it and here at the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.380
 page 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.780
 here comes another redstone 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.820
 repeaters must be on, that is to say 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.360
 if you put that of her he is 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.570
 not on 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.810
 So nice 100 should place the whole thing 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.489
 here is a blog ramona 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.630
 place it fully on it and do that 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.780
 all the same 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.489
 that's what happens in the redstone case and 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.610
 you have already heard the donor 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.890
 already active it activates here you see 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.890
 the whole as the construction of the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.300
 But the reaction torch still has to be here 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.610
 long to rank in this blog and this one 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.220
 to switch off the facts 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.930
 yes we have all here on port 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.780
 and what you are under show it to you 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.810
 water makes it easy 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.720
 you just want or yours 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.410
 materials then do it here in the blog and 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.830
 the one blog 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.990
 At these blocks can be here with water 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.740
 in and yes you can do that here now 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.360
 already close down 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.180
 just as you are or as I am right now 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.739
 I am not 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.050
 and yes, the whole thing a bit 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.520
 hide around keeps the whole thing too 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.720
 But it is totally unnecessary 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.910
 we can do it but as I said that 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.260
 is actually totally unnecessary and that 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.790
 I do not fall now then 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.370
 we'll meet even the school 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.880
 construction so now i'll go here 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.010
 in the normal mode place here 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.770
 seed in the left and right 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.360
 arm me so i hope i have now 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.220
 nothing forget otherwise it is 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.290
 We even use it once 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.060
 our hoe we can do it afterwards 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.190
 theoretically throw away and I see 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.310
 here already 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.739
 yes I am here too 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.069
 yes, that's the way I am right 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:00.160
 I fan I was right 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.319
 what do i hope came back gone 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.770
 here, of course 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.300
 Of course, I also said that 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.250
 and I can hardly see a tree 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:15.150
 you have to jump out of it 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.760
 actually more in the way 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.050
 very briefly our hacker once and that 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.540
 it was already with the hoe cells 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.940
 activated you can already see emotions samus 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.240
 unsightly sperm donors place the 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.580
 and still get so lonely at the front 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.250
 supplied pushed left as it is put 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.020
 Get the right click from me here 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.300
 get a seed from left to right 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.790
 happiness sounds right click from me 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.670
 right click get crisan from left 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.660
 was me from the right so today 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.210
 the whole thing works 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.830
 you recently the only one if the seeds 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.230
 the inventory comes then you have to over 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.230
 switch briefly via router switches 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:57.919
 that's why distance is not 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.839
 I banned now show times throughout 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.689
 and yes, place it on it main 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:05.789
 I take a bit more distance and 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:08.009
 yes you see the water works that way 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.899
 that works too and I just want it now 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.399
 times pressed 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:12.899
 and yes I'll show you a short one now 

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:14.699
 clip how the whole looks like if that 

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:18.860
 for a minute and how far you can go 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.860
 it gets out right now people 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:25.150
 that is a full minute i am using this 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.740
 has run machines resp 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.160
 or my middle finger on mine 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.740
 right mouse button has pressed and 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:38.820
 after a minute what do we get out of 61 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:41.040
 cereals 64 36 6 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.700
 that means we have a total 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.860
 very much the only thing less 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.990
 there is more to us than ours 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.600
 Hard to walk almost full again 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.800
 can was not quite you not demand 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.840
 so people that a minute machines run 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.860
 over 60 wheat within a minute 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.560
 bring this whole machine and yes me 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.040

 Of course we can write a reminder 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.100
 Of course we do not write to us 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.210
 to demand new ideas or to 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.180
 to make suggestions 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.930
 to make it through a claw was that 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.940
