trying this time on dead space 2 so what
you're<00:01:40.470> gonna<00:01:40.560> wind<00:01:40.860> up<00:01:40.979> seeing<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.600> even

felt made the Necromorphs so interesting
to<00:02:12.060> people<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.959> know<00:02:13.080> they<00:02:13.230> do<00:02:13.290> have

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
to people is that you know they do have

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.649 
to people is that you know they do have
you<00:02:13.950> know<00:02:14.220> being<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.819> they<00:02:14.939> were<00:02:15.000> human<00:02:15.390> at

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
you know being that they were human at

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.140 
you know being that they were human at
one<00:02:15.810> time<00:02:16.049> there<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:17.010> relatability<00:02:17.760> there

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
one time there is a relatability there

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.619 
one time there is a relatability there
with<00:02:18.569> them<00:02:18.980> from<00:02:19.980> kind<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.459> their<00:02:20.640> topology<00:02:21.389> so

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
with them from kind of their topology so

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.569 
with them from kind of their topology so
to<00:02:21.689> speak<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.079> way<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.349> they<00:02:22.469> look<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.489> know

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
to speak the way that they look you know

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.670 
to speak the way that they look you know
you<00:02:23.639> can<00:02:23.849> tell<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.239> there's<00:02:24.450> some<00:02:25.049> humanity

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
you can tell that there's some humanity

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.640 
you can tell that there's some humanity
left<00:02:25.889> in<00:02:26.099> them<00:02:26.249> still

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
left in them still

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.949 
left in them still
so<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.250> same<00:02:27.489> applies<00:02:27.879> to<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.930> other

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
so the same applies to the other

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.830 
so the same applies to the other
Necromorphs<00:02:29.680> we're<00:02:29.830> really<00:02:30.010> looking<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.840> look

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
Necromorphs we're really looking to look

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.899 
Necromorphs we're really looking to look
at<00:02:32.049> them<00:02:32.260> find<00:02:32.709> things<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.220> are<00:02:33.489> again

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
at them find things that are again

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.240 
at them find things that are again
relatable<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:35.319> people<00:02:35.769> that<00:02:35.860> are<00:02:35.980> playing<00:02:36.129> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
relatable to people that are playing the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.180 
relatable to people that are playing the
game<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.959> twist<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.500> chest<00:02:38.860> enough

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
game and if you twist it chest enough

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.949 
game and if you twist it chest enough
and<00:02:39.430> kind<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.790> make<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.120> screwed<00:02:40.599> up<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
and kind of make it screwed up and

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.440 
and kind of make it screwed up and
creepy<00:02:41.590> it's<00:02:42.340> usually<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.790> good<00:02:43.030> way<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.269> get

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
creepy it's usually a good way to get

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.449 
creepy it's usually a good way to get
people<00:02:43.659> grossed<00:02:44.140> out<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:44.650> that's<00:02:45.159> one<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.340> the

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
people grossed out and that's one of the

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.729 
people grossed out and that's one of the
things<00:02:45.610> we<00:02:45.730> really<00:02:45.970> strive<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.269> do<00:02:46.480> -<00:02:46.739> Michael

things we really strive to do - Michael
Daniel<00:02:48.400> Richards<00:02:48.909> asks<00:02:49.540> will<00:02:50.170> Isaac<00:02:50.620> react<00:02:51.069> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
Daniel Richards asks will Isaac react to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.670 
Daniel Richards asks will Isaac react to
things<00:02:51.400> in<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.700> game<00:02:52.049> for<00:02:53.049> example<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
things in the game for example in the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.229 
things in the game for example in the
first<00:02:53.860> game<00:02:54.190> when<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.489> lurker<00:02:54.700> kills<00:02:55.090> the

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
first game when the lurker kills the

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.300 
first game when the lurker kills the
worker<00:02:55.450> in<00:02:55.690> level<00:02:55.959> 2<00:02:56.170> Isaac<00:02:56.680> was<00:02:56.829> just<00:02:57.099> like

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
worker in level 2 Isaac was just like

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.130 
worker in level 2 Isaac was just like
that's<00:02:57.819> cool

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
that's cool

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.259 
that's cool
Michael<00:02:59.769> actually<00:03:00.250> that's<00:03:00.760> something<00:03:01.120> that

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
Michael actually that's something that

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.080 
Michael actually that's something that
we<00:03:01.359> did<00:03:01.569> look<00:03:01.840> into<00:03:02.019> trying<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.799> enhance<00:03:03.519> this

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
we did look into trying to enhance this

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.789 
we did look into trying to enhance this
time<00:03:04.329> around<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:04.900> kind<00:03:05.109> of<00:03:05.260> thought<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.560> same

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
time around I kind of thought the same

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.740 
time around I kind of thought the same
thing<00:03:06.069> it<00:03:06.250> was<00:03:06.310> kind<00:03:06.579> of<00:03:06.640> weird<00:03:06.849> like<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.599> know

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
thing it was kind of weird like you know

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.750 
thing it was kind of weird like you know
not<00:03:08.290> only<00:03:08.500> did<00:03:08.650> he<00:03:08.769> never<00:03:09.160> say<00:03:09.459> anything

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
not only did he never say anything

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.399 
not only did he never say anything
because<00:03:10.120> he<00:03:10.269> didn't<00:03:10.569> talk<00:03:10.720> in<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.959> first<00:03:11.200> game

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
because he didn't talk in the first game

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.039 
because he didn't talk in the first game
but<00:03:11.730> he<00:03:12.730> never<00:03:12.879> reacted<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.629> know<00:03:13.750> he<00:03:13.930> never

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
but he never reacted you know he never

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.920 
but he never reacted you know he never
kind<00:03:14.829> of<00:03:14.920> cowered<00:03:15.250> back<00:03:15.459> or<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.480> know<00:03:16.599> did<00:03:16.780> any

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
kind of cowered back or you know did any

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.110 
kind of cowered back or you know did any
of<00:03:16.959> those<00:03:17.079> kind<00:03:17.409> of<00:03:17.440> cool<00:03:17.650> things<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.190> we're

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
of those kind of cool things so we're

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.880 
of those kind of cool things so we're
absolutely<00:03:19.269> trying<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.230> do<00:03:20.379> more<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.739> in

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
absolutely trying to do more of that in

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.550 
absolutely trying to do more of that in
Dead<00:03:21.190> Space<00:03:21.340> 2<00:03:21.519> but<00:03:22.450> one<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.019> things<00:03:23.260> that

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
Dead Space 2 but one of the things that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.860 
Dead Space 2 but one of the things that
makes<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.099> challenging<00:03:24.819> is<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.359> when

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
makes that challenging is that when

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.149 
makes that challenging is that when
people<00:03:25.900> are<00:03:26.260> playing<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.739> game<00:03:26.769> when<00:03:27.069> they're

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
people are playing the game when they're

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.759 
people are playing the game when they're
on<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.370> sticks<00:03:27.989> like<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.109> say<00:03:29.290> they're<00:03:29.530> on<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
on the sticks like to say they're on the

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.589 
on the sticks like to say they're on the
sticks<00:03:30.069> when<00:03:30.790> they're<00:03:30.910> on<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.120> sticks<00:03:31.419> and

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
sticks when they're on the sticks and

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.559 
sticks when they're on the sticks and
trying<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.930> you<00:03:32.349> know<00:03:32.380> do<00:03:32.620> their<00:03:32.739> business

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
trying to you know do their business

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.150 
trying to you know do their business
sometimes<00:03:34.569> people<00:03:35.410> don't<00:03:35.500> want<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.769> be<00:03:35.829> slowed

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
sometimes people don't want to be slowed

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.300 
sometimes people don't want to be slowed
down<00:03:36.190> by<00:03:36.510> reaction<00:03:37.510> animations<00:03:38.109> we<00:03:38.950> actually

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
down by reaction animations we actually

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.370 
down by reaction animations we actually
heard<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.790> some<00:03:39.849> of<00:03:40.000> our<00:03:40.090> focus<00:03:40.480> test<00:03:40.750> people

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
heard and some of our focus test people

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.650 
heard and some of our focus test people
really<00:03:41.769> didn't<00:03:42.760> like<00:03:42.910> being<00:03:43.120> knocked<00:03:43.419> down

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
really didn't like being knocked down

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.210 
really didn't like being knocked down
because<00:03:44.049> how<00:03:44.200> long<00:03:44.379> it<00:03:44.500> took<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:44.799> get<00:03:45.040> back

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
because how long it took you to get back

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.430 
because how long it took you to get back
up<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.730> it's<00:03:46.359> a<00:03:46.450> fine<00:03:46.720> line<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:47.200> need<00:03:47.379> to

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
up so it's a fine line you need to

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.159 
up so it's a fine line you need to
balance<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.540> hopefully<00:03:49.540> we<00:03:49.660> kind<00:03:49.870> of<00:03:49.930> nailed

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
balance and hopefully we kind of nailed

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.960 
balance and hopefully we kind of nailed
it<00:03:50.440> with<00:03:50.889> some<00:03:51.099> of<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.250> reactions<00:03:51.849> that

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
it with some of the reactions that
