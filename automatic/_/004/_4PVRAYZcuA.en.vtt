00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.420
 robotics today is one of the most 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.269
 promising areas of development in 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.970
 world many science fiction not without reason tied 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.830
 human future with robots in the world already 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.680
 came very close to that moment 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.710
 which fiction is called the future i 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.689
 I can not imagine modern society 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.880
 without robotics since it is now very 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 much can be said talk day but 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.120
 from the ideas of his conversations embody these 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.860
 Works turnkey student installation which 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.430
 which can be claimed which 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 You can sell that you need to someone I would 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.250
 even itself needs an emergency 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 titanic efforts in many 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.600
 technology centers procured the most 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.719
 modern equipment machine tools 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.829
 components over creation 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:04.799
 high-tech machines are working 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:07.650
 the best minds of the whole world engineering staff 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.400
 our future and bring them up need with 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.400
 very young age 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.130
 as 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.260
 now the form of robots is about 700 guys 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.590
 Novosibirsk are engaged in the section on 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.729
 robotics and they are engaged in the club 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.410
 engineering creativity 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:37.009
 10 we call it that which mission 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.320
 which involve schoolchildren and work 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.540
 on school Gent teach teach 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.520
 schoolchildren from different ages start 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.820
 July 9 years there 8 to 18 years of 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.979
 According to the left equipment further 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.390
 chips over text language gradually 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.759
 step by step we have more and more 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.500
 smart devices appear and so or 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.979
 otherwise it will soon appear in the service 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.560
 work 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.030
 medicine and care robots 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.020
 tables let's say for and some 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.050
 social strata of society and everywhere 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.430
 need an army of engineers because 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.010
 deal with this all the points that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.520
 create even deal with breakdowns 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.900
 or how to launch that particular robot with 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.360
 other mode 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.209
 already difficult because I am a little bit 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:33.430
 comes off doing handwork by hand 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:36.430
 for darkness the league of robots revives 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.410
 brings up real engineers who 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.780
 become valuable professionals and 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.200
 part of the innovation systems in our 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.200
 country
