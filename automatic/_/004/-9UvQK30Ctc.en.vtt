00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.410
 hey i 'm angry and this is fine 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.570
 a little new nice video 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.549
 I'm coming from outside the forest 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.590
 I did a bit of a shot and there 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.410
 await me in the mailbox 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.000
 again such a small envelope and 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.640
 so extra funny and me 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.369
 to have the address and yes it is not 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.710
 normal letter but it us 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.260
 that's one of my viewers 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.420
 probably sent again 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 probably send me again 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.680
 probably send me again 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.489
 a nice little surprise and me 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.260
 I'm curious 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.350
 this time she is steal from seat 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.460
 and I'm curious what you are for me 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.460
 here wrapped up the goal 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:03.300
 so I'm a bit on par with court 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.930
 something to it and I see 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.570
 little letter and you know that mine 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.580
 thank you videos always like to look 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.080
 First of all, I have to go to the eponymous rockki 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.120
 be honest i have been very long 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.680
 I wonder what I thank you for the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.740
 great videos can send 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.840
 grinning at mr person'm very much 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.420
 We value our own recycling 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.410
 Environment already I thought that would be here 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.479
 a good idea 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.180
 I have a used one 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.130
 Foxtail lake used 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.800
 Foxtail saw blade two emergency 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.580
 better made for you the little one 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.400
 knife it with parade is untreated that 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.440
 I tried a little bigger msi 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.260
 just like you showed in your video 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.540
 have as I have the msa with me 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.530
 paragon wrapped with barak place in the handle 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.110
 and with a small fire stall at the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.369
 bend so you have it 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.610
 you always fire at the man 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.070
 oh yes, with my test the knife 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.619
 I stress tried out for the knife 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.119
 that was not a problem 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.840
 I hope we both like it 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:19.770
 Yours sincerely , and then it is 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:23.310
 there was a picture down there 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:28.050
 see if I understood correctly 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.630
 I have now almost two 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.790
 get this knife and what you can 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.819
 on the picture, that's just one more thing 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.069
 third knife on this saw blade 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.080
 is drawn 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:44.640
 that will probably be the third one 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.110
 has cut out that he namely one 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.440
 little bit of my old days 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.120
 So about a million years ago 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.000
 so that we also get a knife out of the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.370
 saw blade built because that was what 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.590
 This makes an old rusty in the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.540
 found my father's workshop and me 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.800
 I was in a book or something somewhere 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.280
 I've read that too 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.960
 It was a funny idea, unfortunately I have 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:15.930
 no idea where this thing came from 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:19.690
 is it is not there anymore so out of there 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.870
 now written on it so m &amp; s 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.850
 that's the size and me 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.220
 was the first time that it was more 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.890
 He specially cut out the blade like that 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.410
 bit wrapped in paper with it 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.770
 nothing can go wrong 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:43.050
 and there we have it the knife I have it 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:48.190
 again in a recording show 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:50.550
 beautifully shaped handles cut out 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.220
 in the back with it so a few short 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:58.300
 the knife back can be that is that 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.760
 old saw blade very fine saw payment 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.380
 So from solar with part very much 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.640
 it probably always works 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.550
 still and then give the blade out 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.380
 grinded now is hard for me 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.060
 say how art and he as they 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.330
 has sanded off with one 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:20.230
 machine or just one 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.940
 whetstone or something it looks very nice 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.100
 finely made can almost with the 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.540
 meat then happens and in total 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.360
 he also has the saw blade 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.780
 bit ground off 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.060
 something like that gets a lot and often from bush 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.830
 Crafts beginners are made as a handicraft 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.800
 and I find that cool as I said that 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.060
 at that time also fun but quite a lot 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.610
 make because then I have 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.950
 get rid of many questions 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.940
 What do I have to do afterwards? 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.350
 The hardening of course is one 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.000
 Another step is not for 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.860
 everyone at his home so easy 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.690
 It is basically possible to imitate 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.910
 say that is not necessary so 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.270
 even such a homemade sound 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.370
 here 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.160
 out of this steel is usually then 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.320
 hss is steep with these saw blades 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.010
 keep relatively cut and if you have to 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.690
 one should therefore make it clear that 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.910
 contingent on the podium at it like 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.500
 Cut out the knife and how 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.900
 if it did when you did that 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.210
 just with arrows and with 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.740
 then it is 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.960
 wonderful if you do it all now 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.910
 Of course, that's what Flex did 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.860
 or with a dremel so with many 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.780
 turns the material really hot 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.260
 then it may be purely theoretical 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.050
 that the whole outer surfaces are quasi 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.690
 annealed if it was really 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.550
 bluish discolored almost say there 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.820
 she looks very hot and 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.490
 that means that the steel is relative 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.010
 has become soft then you have to get in 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.340
 Theoretically this steel would again 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.080
 We are talking about knives 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.970
 that means you would have to heat them up and 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.720
 So bring back to life and then 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.940
 cooling down 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.830
 but honestly, this is still around 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.520
 to deal with simple things with oneself 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.990
 Tinker 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.300
 and then do not make a big one 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.280
 thoughts or something I built 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.790
 something like that and you will be satisfied with it 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.760
 his 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:12.610
 you can do a whole lot with it 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.740
 and where to go later for one 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.170
 buy another knife or build yourself 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.260
 who knows is then for completely different 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:24.690
 story it's about to do so then 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:27.180
 Of course he still held the knife 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:32.260
 Hold them together so something 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:36.130
 each one of them even includes the grip piece 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:39.880
 paragon is developing a cool thing here 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:43.210
 small piece of flint made super 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.290
 Cool here is the knife too 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.540
 been ground down and here 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.100
 wrote that has brought 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.830
 written as I did 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:55.900
 So probably then in hot vinegar 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:07:00.010
 also back here is the award 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.320
 old saw and then ring out 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.270
 polished 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.820
 Cool thing I had to look something 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.600
 I have to do something with it 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.910
 make me think that a little 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.550
 and a small disc manufacturer 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.340
 come also relatively easy with 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.690
 little leather or whatever 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.430
 if we do not have it at home you can 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.050
 only with parking disc main thing 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.040
 because it is a bit protected and 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.290
 do not cut 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.330
 Do not take off the backpack or something 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.820
 then you can do something for many 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:35.050
 use and invest things outside 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.550
 proudly built myself and yes me too 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.080
 if use it in any way 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.530
 I do not know how in any case 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.140
 a knife gets the knife 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.660
 so small honor place because as I said 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.600
 They remind me of my old days 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.370
 I would not have it round so well 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.300
 shaped for me it was a bit longer 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:56.980
 and bigger beautiful beautiful thing many 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:02.370
 thanks so much that you thought of me 

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.370
 have a wonderful gift
