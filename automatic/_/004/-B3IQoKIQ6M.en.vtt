another application is in the brazing
arena<00:00:19.500> where<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.039> use<00:00:20.220> one<00:00:20.730> gas<00:00:21.000> where<00:00:21.390> they're

arena where we use one gas where they're

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.050 
arena where we use one gas where they're
normally<00:00:21.869> using<00:00:22.170> two<00:00:22.350> gases<00:00:22.850> we<00:00:23.850> get<00:00:24.029> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
normally using two gases we get a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
normally using two gases we get a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
stronger braise we get it faster and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.150 
stronger braise we get it faster and
it's<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.150> done<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.840> gas<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.410> steel

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
it's all done with one gas in steel

a<00:00:38.640> number<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.030> ten<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.570> use<00:00:39.690> less<00:00:39.960> gas<00:00:40.260> this

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
a number of ten so we use less gas this

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
is from the gas itself and you can't do

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.030 
is from the gas itself and you can't do
anything<00:02:03.570> about<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.380> you're<00:02:04.649> stuck<00:02:04.890> with

profound thing about HH o guess is that

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.060 
profound thing about HH o guess is that

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
it represents something that is so

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.699 
it represents something that is so

totally unique so completely different
and<00:04:19.890> so<00:04:20.370> absolutely<00:04:20.940> knew<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.989> I<00:04:22.140> think<00:04:22.440> that
