00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
some another thing that you've actually

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.640 
some another thing that you've actually
sandwiches<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> never<00:01:22.470> really

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
sandwiches that you never really

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.469 
sandwiches that you never really
considered<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.159> lot<00:01:23.310> electronic<00:01:23.820> music<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.330> be

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
considered a lot electronic music to be

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
considered a lot electronic music to be
kind<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.350> very<00:01:25.409> important<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> wasn't<00:01:26.250> really

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
kind of very important it wasn't really

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.600 
kind of very important it wasn't really
part<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.090> journey<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.509> all<00:01:27.630> why<00:01:27.900> was<00:01:28.049> that

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
part of the journey at all why was that

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
part of the journey at all why was that
it<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.880> didn't<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.479> occur<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.869> me<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> kind

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it just didn't really occur to me I kind

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.870 
it just didn't really occur to me I kind
of<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.770> thought<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.520> something<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
of I thought of it as something that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.140 
of I thought of it as something that
might<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.299> been<00:01:33.740> cold<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.000> doves

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
might have been cold and then when doves

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.060 
might have been cold and then when doves
that<00:01:36.299> came<00:01:36.509> along<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.960> was<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.770> was<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that came along and I was it was the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.340 
that came along and I was it was the
only<00:01:38.220> time<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.970> thought<00:01:39.329> right<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.110> need<00:01:40.259> to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
only time that I thought right I need to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.690 
only time that I thought right I need to
know<00:01:40.439> how<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.799> made<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.670> I

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
know how that is made and that's when I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.550 
know how that is made and that's when I
got<00:01:41.909> into<00:01:42.380> production

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:02:04.529 

I<00:02:01.560> felt<00:02:02.560> like<00:02:03.009> there<00:02:03.430> was<00:02:03.580> such<00:02:03.939> an<00:02:04.090> attention

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
I felt like there was such an attention

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.710 
I felt like there was such an attention
to<00:02:04.570> detail<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:05.710> rhythmic<00:02:06.640> sort<00:02:07.030> placement

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
to detail in rhythmic sort placement

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.990 
to detail in rhythmic sort placement
I'd<00:02:08.050> never<00:02:08.289> sensed<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.700> sense<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.910> many

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
I'd never sensed a sense of so many

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.620 
I'd never sensed a sense of so many
people<00:02:13.650> enjoying<00:02:14.650> an<00:02:14.830> intricacy<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.480> piece

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
people enjoying an intricacy of a piece

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.900 
people enjoying an intricacy of a piece
of<00:02:16.660> music<00:02:16.920> I'd<00:02:17.920> never<00:02:18.099> heard<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.580> kind<00:02:18.819> of

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
of music I'd never heard that kind of

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.030 
of music I'd never heard that kind of
stuff<00:02:19.090> before<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:19.720> was<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.260> feeling<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.830> I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
stuff before that was a feeling that I

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.870 
stuff before that was a feeling that I
tried<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.340> recreate<00:02:22.739> but<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.830> had<00:02:23.980> everything

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
tried to recreate but it had everything

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.660 
tried to recreate but it had everything

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
recently where I've sat down and played

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.479 
recently where I've sat down and played
them<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:13.139> it's<00:04:13.590> just<00:04:13.829> come<00:04:13.950> out<00:04:14.099> in<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.430> way

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
them and it's just come out in the way

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.949 
them and it's just come out in the way
that<00:04:14.609> it's<00:04:14.730> come<00:04:14.849> out<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.359> I've<00:04:15.810> not

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
changed them up it was because I felt

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.779 
changed them up it was because I felt
that<00:04:18.750> if<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:18.989> did<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:20.190> would<00:04:20.310> lose<00:04:20.489> what<00:04:20.760> I

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
that if I did that it would lose what I

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.990 
that if I did that it would lose what I
had<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.359> it<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:23.010> know<00:04:23.130> would<00:04:23.280> sound<00:04:23.550> designed
