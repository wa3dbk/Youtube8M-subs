and the battery and what I did was I I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.600 
and the battery and what I did was I I
ran<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.360> battery<00:01:08.689> line<00:01:09.369> straight<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:10.490> the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
ran the battery line straight to the

smoothly<00:03:07.010> ran<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.159> around<00:03:08.400> 2,000<00:03:09.209> rpms<00:03:09.659> off

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
smoothly ran it around 2,000 rpms off

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.940 
smoothly ran it around 2,000 rpms off
and<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.769> for<00:03:11.129> 20<00:03:11.400> minutes<00:03:12.110> varied<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.349> RPMs<00:03:13.829> a

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
and on for 20 minutes varied the RPMs a

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.300 
and on for 20 minutes varied the RPMs a
little<00:03:14.189> bit<00:03:14.310> while<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.519> was<00:03:14.730> doing<00:03:14.879> it<00:03:16.310> ran

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
little bit while I was doing it ran

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.780 
little bit while I was doing it ran
beautifully<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:19.079> timing<00:03:19.530> was<00:03:19.709> factory<00:03:20.430> set

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
beautifully the timing was factory set

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.699 
beautifully the timing was factory set
and<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.299> checked<00:03:21.599> it<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.959> looked<00:03:22.170> good<00:03:22.349> I

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
and I checked it and it looked good I

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.899 
and I checked it and it looked good I
didn't<00:03:23.340> have<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.579> mess<00:03:23.730> with<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:25.670> but<00:03:26.670> it's<00:03:26.819> a
