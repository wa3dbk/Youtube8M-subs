00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.549
 sad and shabby time of many years

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.739
 diva for me because we do not know 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.739

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.130
 super nice detail

 thank you very much love and good quickly 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.190
 I will go through the books that I know is 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.840
 what really interests you one of 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.310
 the books that I received this month was if the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.440
 love is an island of esther sanz a 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.060
 author that I loved in his trilogy of 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.220
 forest published by montena in this 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.630
 case is published by destination and the 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.910
 truth is that it has quite enough 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.890
 very good looking from vd books in this 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.930
 case I saw pocket I got final or 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.180
 finals or whatever fitzpatrick scholarship 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.750
 is the fourth book of the Hush Hush saga 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.850
 and therefore the last and good is 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.680
 rather fatter than I thought and 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.860
 in general the criticisms are 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.239
 disappointing then it was one of my 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.460
 priorities but I think now the 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.860
 truth does not occupy one of my priorities 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.450
 I'll read it but I think I 'll fix the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.270
 I do not know before, I do not remember 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.820
 from nothing of international planet I receive 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.690
 nobody like you of j 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.690
 merz 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.790
 and good reviews are good 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.560
 normal simple is a normal book of 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.870
 love and such looks like it 's pretty 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.270
 fast it looks fat but not really 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.150
 it is so much and good 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.070
 kind of that by the way is the end of 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.280
 book that we see you teach I will do 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.280
 Magic 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.710

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.210
 of magic power total grace that goes to you 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.310
 without saying goodbye is the new book of 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.810
 salud aysén published by my go as 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.580
 all the files from sara lezana in 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.680
 Spain is the fattest they have published 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.229
 until now and I have so many 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.509
 very much desire but that is very many 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.699
 you get a lot of this that I 'm going to 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.590
 read either maeva also reaches 10 of 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.900
 craig in macneil all the world that has 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.699
 read says it's not a great novel 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.580
 but that hooks a lot very much 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:50.009
 very much that catches and all these things 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.599
 and there are novels that do not have where 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.379
 catch them but as they hook 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:57.419
 if they have something good and good 10 for me 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.770
 it catches my attention, it's also a 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.509
 re telling of an agatha book 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.180
 christie I think it 's ten little blacks and 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.669
 nothing and I want to read it and finally from 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.770
 maeva yang arrives rarita and adorable from 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.000
 be a manning that is a book that 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.279
 I thought it would be more short 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.770
 also and that looks great 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:16.139
 it's kind of a bit of stem room had 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.509
 I do not dislike the cover 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.120
 and that and I want to gain a lot from 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.310
 long ago and I want to read it because 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.940
 I love you will have seen surely 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.370
 talk about 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.249
 the bar book the movie because it's from 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.199
 jordi serra i fabra and going to see movies 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.759
 talks about for a handful of kisses like I've 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.609
 Jordi Sierra i Fabra said that 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.109
 published two years ago created as a 

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:40.229
 little bit of april something of may all 

00:05:37.109 --> 00:05:41.549
 September scene and gap but super thin 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.109
 and like all Jordi Sierra's novels 

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:47.969
 fabra 90% are dialogues and with 

00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:49.799
 short chapters so this book will be 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.539
 of which in fact I do not know why I have not 

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:55.079
 started still after I received the 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:57.059
 passenger of jean christophe ground if I 

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:59.849
 I'm going to do franchute here a moment 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:03.299
 it's a pretty fat book worth according to 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:05.849
 amazon were exact in 700 many pages 

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:08.339
 but it is that according to the official file they were 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.739
 about 400 and I said wow well in 400 is a 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:12.689
 thriller such but good said my mother 

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:14.999
 that a billet catches my attention 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:16.619
 As you saw in my post it talks about 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:19.349
 mythology mix serial murders 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:22.470
 Then I love both things 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:24.810
 so I guess when you take the tooth 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.810
 and then receive twice two 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.970
 contemporary classics 1984 and rebellion 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.060
 at the farm both books are 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.880
 published by debolsillo in his line 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.870
 contemporary as you see 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.600
 and they are from George Orwell in 1984 I have him 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.910
 something I have more desire than rebellion in the 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.770
 farm but rebellion on the farm has 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.480
 the largest letter is quite finite 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.880
 then I think I'll read it from a 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.310
 I do not know what it was before I know that the 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.890
 read in soon is to say during this month 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.330

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.570
 the camera time was running out and 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.220
