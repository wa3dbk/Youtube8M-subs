00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 how does it work with this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.030
 the device that is here from the reverse 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.849
 side on the other hand is 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.289
 grip which is proposed effort here 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.170
 in this position where she is now, she 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.869
 off then up position when 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.060
 she is in that 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.430
 preload is fed here in 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.869
 In this position, the total load is 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.279
 preload is 10 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:40.230
 kilogram full load 150 kilogram 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:45.200
 but as a sample than using here 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.200
 this one is a knife 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.449
 w yourself 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.320
 m1 i.e. white church blades model 1 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.489
 they are not released this current-current were 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.960
 hardened and slightly ground blade 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.320
 so that any can be taken polished 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.070
 measuring blade to work 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.490
 because there must be a surface 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.680
 more or less 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.659
 smooth, that is, should not be and to her 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:25.939
 because the farrier on solid than the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:25.939
 solid than the metal there now means 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.210
 generally fixed here on this 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.210
 table between tables 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.670
 products 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.430
 but it is desirable that it be parallel 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.850
 on both sides of the product were parallel 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.160
 that is, otherwise if it is slightly under 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.770
 slope 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.720
 this cone then may god could it 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:05.080
 lead to measurement errors 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:08.020
 now it means giving a preliminary 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.020
 load and when after this 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.010
 preload in this case 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.150
 she became exactly 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.810
 I will take away in general it is necessary to bring this 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.880
 big arrow on zero to zero and here 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.310
 this is a little arrow that's this 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:33.450
 should be here on this one 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:36.519
 there we are here so then I will 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.340
 It gives a full load to hold out 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:43.930
 for about three seconds and retracts 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:51.280
 while showing some value 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:55.440
 in this case, he showed 61 rockwell where 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.440
 in another place right now we do puncture 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:07.830
 we fix the preload 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:15.290
 inserted into zero full three seconds 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.290
 somewhere we hold choose 62 shows 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.510
 Now even today other blade 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:38.840
 anchoring pre pain full 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:54.459
 choose shows 68 somehow already but this 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:04:02.650
 I think it is just an error 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:02.650
 another place kokorin preliminary 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:25.730
 full remove 5768 even in general after 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:30.169
 quenching and before vacation 1095 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:32.840
 it can be hardened to 66 units 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:38.330
 after the holidays she goes down there before 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.990
 50 there is 8 60 61 that is here that looking 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.280
 what 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.820
 depending on the tempering temperature 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.030
 it is chosen 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.030
 necessary necessary 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.810
 the final hardness is obtained like this 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.050
 here's a device thank you for your attention 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.050
