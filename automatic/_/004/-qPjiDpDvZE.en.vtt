lot<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.049> thought<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.500> keeping<00:00:07.859> motivated

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
lot of thought on keeping motivated

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.430 
lot of thought on keeping motivated
despite<00:00:08.849> frequent<00:00:09.210> struggles<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:09.990> my<00:00:10.019> work

despite frequent struggles in my work

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.970 
despite frequent struggles in my work
but<00:00:11.280> isn't<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.000> usually<00:00:12.540> my<00:00:12.780> line<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.380> had

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
but isn't that usually my line I had

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.289 
but isn't that usually my line I had
thought<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.429> had<00:00:14.639> come<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.910> me<00:00:15.150> with

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
thought that you had come to me with

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.830 
thought that you had come to me with
something<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.900> were<00:00:16.080> hoping<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.500> talk<00:00:16.650> about

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
something you were hoping to talk about

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.510 
something you were hoping to talk about
actually<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.869> did<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:19.619> I'm<00:00:19.740> surprised<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.490> are

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
actually I did but I'm surprised you are

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.120 
actually I did but I'm surprised you are
losing<00:00:21.060> motivation<00:00:21.590> well<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.650> suppose<00:00:23.070> that

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
losing motivation well I suppose that

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.130 
losing motivation well I suppose that
actually<00:00:23.670> has<00:00:23.820> more<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.539> how<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.779> see

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
actually has more to do with how I see

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.710 
actually has more to do with how I see
myself<00:00:25.350> rather<00:00:26.070> than<00:00:26.310> any<00:00:26.519> external<00:00:27.240> factors

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
account was with the promise that I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.570 
account was with the promise that I

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
channel and thus far I have been doing

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.150 
channel and thus far I have been doing
exactly<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.820> but<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.690> must<00:02:22.050> admit<00:02:22.230> there's

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
exactly that but I must admit there's

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.580 
exactly that but I must admit there's
this<00:02:23.400> feeling<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.150> get<00:02:24.450> deep<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.020> my<00:02:25.170> mind

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
this feeling I get deep in my mind

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.500 
this feeling I get deep in my mind
sometimes<00:02:26.010> about<00:02:26.640> whether<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.030> work<00:02:27.270> I'm

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
sometimes about whether the work I'm

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.570 
sometimes about whether the work I'm
doing<00:02:27.540> now<00:02:27.870> will<00:02:28.380> ever<00:02:28.650> reach<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.040> point<00:02:29.310> where

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
doing now will ever reach a point where

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.520 
doing now will ever reach a point where
it<00:02:29.670> would<00:02:29.790> actually<00:02:29.820> make<00:02:30.450> sense<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:31.050> turn<00:02:31.350> it

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
it would actually make sense to turn it

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.770 
it would actually make sense to turn it
into<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.800> full-time<00:02:32.340> career<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.060> much<00:02:33.510> like

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
into a full-time career and much like

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.140 
into a full-time career and much like
how<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.020> stated<00:02:34.770> earlier<00:02:34.950> miss<00:02:35.460> Prince
