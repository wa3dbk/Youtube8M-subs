00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.959
 always looking if I am this saying 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.909
 well this was on November 6th I think 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.030
 that we already made the video 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.799
 in three minutes a new video 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.120
 over should this cover appear and is 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.590
 sitting in your queens and that already 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.840
 they finished the day in Chinese so they 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.719
 this action may be that that faith is neither 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.230
 reveal forgiveness to not agree at all 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:06.230
 simply but well here I think only 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:14.719
 participated in what we had 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.260
 Y 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.260
 and it was that 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.280
 it was just just that seriously and 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.750
 good here as we have seen 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.250

00:04:53.739 --> 00:05:01.389
 tennis players something that is not good I do not know 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.819

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.489
 of the page I leave in the 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.039
 video description 

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:13.029

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:15.360
