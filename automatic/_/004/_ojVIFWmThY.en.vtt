 until you reach these 36 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.830
 it is clear that the Roma when they passed 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.130
 for egypt 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.250
 they met the tarot to hide the oracle 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.730
 with 78 cards and these letters it is clear that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.090
 they took them there because they both 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.059
 deciphered what the 78 cards mean 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.010
 for women to have for their 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.010

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.890
 which means each letter because it is the 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.110
 the deck that chooses us this is 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.320
 important to choose you 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.810
 the deck you start there that big 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.850
 development was Madame Norm that 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.910

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:30.630
 in love with a gypsy at the fair there 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.940
 paris and with that it can go so far 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.010
 the gypsy clan when living with these 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.730
 gypsies and with the knowledge that she 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:41.670
 had she can draw the first 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.860
 It's still in her house that she lives 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.670

 the petite little sister that she 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.330
 designed how it develops 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.160
 through this passion for this deception 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.680
