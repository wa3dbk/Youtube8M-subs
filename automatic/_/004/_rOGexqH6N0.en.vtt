00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
stroke right here you see if it's in the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.020 
stroke right here you see if it's in the
stick<00:02:28.120> holder<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.590> ends<00:02:29.830> up<00:02:29.920> going<00:02:30.070> down<00:02:30.760> your

once the stick hits the drum my arm
stops<00:03:21.640> moving<00:03:21.970> ice<00:03:22.090> let<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.360> stick<00:03:22.540> bounce

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
stops moving ice let the stick bounce

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.270 
stops moving ice let the stick bounce
around<00:03:22.989> that's<00:03:23.500> one<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.800> reasons<00:03:24.010> we<00:03:24.130> have

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
around that's one of the reasons we have

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.740 
around that's one of the reasons we have
this<00:03:24.400> opening<00:03:24.850> here<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.239> stick<00:03:25.420> can<00:03:25.630> move

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
this opening here so stick can move

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.330 
this opening here so stick can move
around<00:03:25.870> without<00:03:26.200> my<00:03:26.470> hand<00:03:26.709> doing<00:03:26.980> some<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.280> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
around without my hand doing some of the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.800 
around without my hand doing some of the
work<00:03:32.580> so<00:03:33.580> try<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:33.820> a<00:03:34.000> whole<00:03:34.270> bunch<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.630> times

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810
