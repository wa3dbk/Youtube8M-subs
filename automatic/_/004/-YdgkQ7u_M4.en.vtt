inside<00:02:41.090> that's<00:02:41.569> why<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.810> like<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.140> pitch

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
inside that's why I like to pitch

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.410 
inside that's why I like to pitch
left-handers<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.849> was<00:02:43.970> one<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.239> the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
left-handers and and it was one of the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.880 
left-handers and and it was one of the
greatest<00:02:44.690> feelings<00:02:45.019> that<00:02:45.349> I<00:02:45.410> ever<00:02:45.620> had

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
greatest feelings that I ever had

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.979 
greatest feelings that I ever had
because<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.610> think<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.360> biggest<00:02:47.569> thing<00:02:47.810> is

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
because I think the biggest thing is

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.380 
because I think the biggest thing is
that<00:02:48.380> when<00:02:48.620> my<00:02:48.769> my<00:02:49.099> legs<00:02:49.370> start<00:02:49.760> shaking<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.299> I

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
that when my my legs start shaking and I

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.839 
that when my my legs start shaking and I
didn't<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.900> never<00:02:51.260> experienced<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:51.890> before<00:02:52.069> I

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
didn't I never experienced that before I

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.089 
didn't I never experienced that before I
don't<00:02:53.390> know<00:02:53.450> oh<00:02:53.540> man<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.049> is<00:02:54.200> great<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:55.069> know

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
don't know oh man this is great you know

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.559 
don't know oh man this is great you know
I<00:02:55.250> thought<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.700> was<00:02:55.790> wonderful<00:02:56.209> but<00:02:56.360> I

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
I thought it was wonderful but I

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.739 
I thought it was wonderful but I
wouldn't<00:02:56.989> want<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.140> go<00:02:57.260> through<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.470> again
