so expensive anymore in this binder used
to<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.930> guess<00:01:07.020> yeah<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.740> was<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> most

expensive<00:01:08.430> card<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:08.939> planet<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> long

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
expensive card in this planet for a long

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.140 
expensive card in this planet for a long
time<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.020> then<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> number<00:01:11.310> eighteen<00:01:11.760> still

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
time and then a number eighteen still

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.670 
time and then a number eighteen still
waiting<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.049> English<00:01:13.380> print

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
waiting on that for an English print

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.320 
waiting on that for an English print
hopefully<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.220> will<00:01:14.310> happen<00:01:14.490> pretty<00:01:15.450> soon

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330

this won't take us too long to get over
here<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> think<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.049> year<00:01:22.380> or

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
here I think it's like a year or

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.630 
here I think it's like a year or
something<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:22.950> least<00:01:23.040> we're<00:01:23.310> guaranteed

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
something but at least we're guaranteed

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.620 
something but at least we're guaranteed
to<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> mean<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.270> gonna<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to get it I mean it's gonna be in the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.050 
to get it I mean it's gonna be in the
mall<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.580> it's<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> those

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
too I guess I should kind of show it a

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.800 
too I guess I should kind of show it a
little<00:03:24.579> bit<00:03:24.669> better<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.269> light<00:03:25.419> kind<00:03:25.629> of<00:03:25.689> hits

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
little bit better the light kind of hits

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.939 
little bit better the light kind of hits
it<00:03:25.900> there<00:03:26.019> you<00:03:26.109> go<00:03:26.229> you<00:03:26.500> should<00:03:26.709> be<00:03:26.739> able<00:03:26.859> to

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
it there you go you should be able to

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:31.229 
it there you go you should be able to
see<00:03:27.129> it<00:03:27.750> waiting<00:03:28.750> on<00:03:29.340> 94<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.669> is<00:03:30.849> in<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
see it waiting on 94 that is in the

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.569 
see it waiting on 94 that is in the
dualist<00:03:31.780> pack<00:03:32.019> I<00:03:32.199> believe<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:33.280> came<00:03:33.489> out

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
dualist pack I believe that came out

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.729 
dualist pack I believe that came out
shark<00:03:33.849> and<00:03:34.000> Rios<00:03:34.239> so<00:03:34.599> that's<00:03:35.409> another<00:03:35.620> one

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
shark and Rios so that's another one

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.439 
shark and Rios so that's another one
those<00:03:35.889> two<00:03:36.129> I<00:03:36.159> don't<00:03:36.519> know<00:03:36.669> maybe<00:03:37.030> they'll<00:03:37.269> if

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
those two I don't know maybe they'll if

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.610 
those two I don't know maybe they'll if
they<00:03:37.599> bring<00:03:37.810> out<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.049> other<00:03:38.079> exclusives

they bring out the other exclusives

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.249 
they bring out the other exclusives
maybe<00:03:38.769> we'll<00:03:38.889> get<00:03:38.979> that<00:03:39.099> thrown<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:39.519> who<00:03:39.819> knows

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
- I believe it's secret on that set I'm

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.069 
- I believe it's secret on that set I'm
trying<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.359> member<00:03:46.509> all<00:03:46.629> the<00:03:46.720> Rangers<00:03:46.959> have

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
them number 101 that's probably I guess

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.640 
them number 101 that's probably I guess
the<00:03:51.280> most<00:03:51.430> expensive<00:03:51.699> number<00:03:51.939> card<00:03:52.470> by<00:03:53.470> now

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
number cards and there we go

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.130 
number cards and there we go
kind<00:04:37.760> of<00:04:37.790> a<00:04:37.880> shorter<00:04:38.210> video<00:04:38.450> I<00:04:38.510> know<00:04:38.660> but<00:04:39.110> uh

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
number cards from that which I don't

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.160 
number cards from that which I don't
think<00:05:05.210> it's<00:05:05.300> gonna<00:05:05.390> be<00:05:05.450> too<00:05:05.600> hard<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:05.810> do<00:05:05.960> I

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
think it's gonna be too hard to do I

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.360 
think it's gonna be too hard to do I
think<00:05:06.470> they're<00:05:06.590> all<00:05:06.680> like<00:05:06.800> stickers<00:05:07.100> and

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
think they're all like stickers and

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.700 
think they're all like stickers and
stuff<00:05:07.550> but<00:05:07.760> I<00:05:08.000> don't<00:05:08.780> think<00:05:08.930> they'll<00:05:09.110> be<00:05:09.140> that

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
stuff but I don't think they'll be that

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.770 
stuff but I don't think they'll be that
expensive<00:05:10.190> at<00:05:10.340> least<00:05:10.520> so<00:05:10.760> can't<00:05:11.330> wait<00:05:11.480> and

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
expensive at least so can't wait and
