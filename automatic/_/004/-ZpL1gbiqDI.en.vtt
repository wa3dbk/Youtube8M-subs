00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hey guys so I was on the forms the other

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.660 
hey guys so I was on the forms the other
day<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.740> someone<00:00:04.740> mentioned<00:00:05.279> what<00:00:05.400> was<00:00:05.520> your

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
day and someone mentioned what was your

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.910 
day and someone mentioned what was your
best<00:00:05.759> Scoob<00:00:06.120> time<00:00:07.460> and<00:00:08.510> I<00:00:09.510> had<00:00:10.110> asked<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.530> or<00:00:10.889> I

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
best Scoob time and I had asked you or I

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.980 
best Scoob time and I had asked you or I
have<00:00:11.190> asked<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.610> as<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:12.000> see<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.660> I

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
have asked you as you can see and I

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.660 
have asked you as you can see and I
hadn't<00:00:13.349> learned<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.769> solve<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.099> yet<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.549> that

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
hadn't learned to solve it yet and that

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
hadn't learned to solve it yet and that
prompted<00:00:15.059> me<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.210> solve<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:17.510> I'm<00:00:18.510> really

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
prompted me to solve it and I'm really

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.160 
prompted me to solve it and I'm really
into<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.320> really<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.859> puzzle

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
into it I really like the puzzle

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.340 
into it I really like the puzzle
this<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.320> aqj<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.990> it's<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.080> very<00:00:25.260> interesting

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
this is aqj and it's a very interesting

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.339 
this is aqj and it's a very interesting
puzzle

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.650 

it<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:31.560> ball<00:00:31.920> bearings<00:00:32.309> let's<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:35.480> on<00:00:36.480> each

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
it has ball bearings let's see on each

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.830 
it has ball bearings let's see on each
side<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.850> corners<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.660> you<00:00:42.660> can

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
side so of the corners so it's you can

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.110 
side so of the corners so it's you can
feel<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.500> pieces<00:00:43.829> click<00:00:44.100> here's<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.550> center

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
feel the pieces click here's a center

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:57.280 
feel the pieces click here's a center
cap<00:00:45.539> piece<00:00:46.670> come<00:00:47.670> on

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:10.450 

there<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.850> anyway<00:01:01.150> here's<00:01:02.150> the<00:01:02.240> poor

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.220 

they're<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:12.790> interesting<00:01:13.790> way<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.780> puzzle<00:01:15.110> is

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
they're so interesting way the puzzle is

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.260 
they're so interesting way the puzzle is
put<00:01:15.440> together<00:01:16.300> interesting<00:01:17.300> how<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.600> works<00:01:17.890> I

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
put together interesting how it works I

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.219 
put together interesting how it works I
learned<00:01:20.270> from<00:01:20.570> monkey<00:01:21.020> dude<00:01:21.170> 1313<00:01:22.000> tutorial

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
learned from monkey dude 1313 tutorial

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.180 
learned from monkey dude 1313 tutorial
it's<00:01:24.229> a<00:01:24.290> really<00:01:24.500> good<00:01:24.620> tutorial<00:01:25.100> I<00:01:25.190> think<00:01:25.460> and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
it's a really good tutorial I think and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.150 
it's a really good tutorial I think and
it<00:01:28.190> only<00:01:28.340> uses<00:01:28.580> one<00:01:28.880> algorithm<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:29.890> my<00:01:30.890> best

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
it only uses one algorithm and my best

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.550 
it only uses one algorithm and my best
time<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.460> far<00:01:31.760> is<00:01:32.330> five<00:01:32.660> point<00:01:32.930> seven<00:01:33.110> seven

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
time so far is five point seven seven

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.609 
time so far is five point seven seven
and<00:01:33.850> all<00:01:34.850> I<00:01:34.880> had<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.210> do<00:01:35.360> was<00:01:35.630> insert<00:01:36.170> two

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
and all I had to do was insert two

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.390 
and all I had to do was insert two
corners<00:01:37.180> so<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:38.290> did<00:01:39.290> this<00:01:39.619> pretty<00:01:39.860> much<00:01:40.040> anyway

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
corners so I did this pretty much anyway

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.600 
corners so I did this pretty much anyway
boom<00:01:40.760> boom<00:01:41.830> that's<00:01:42.830> pretty<00:01:43.100> much<00:01:43.220> all<00:01:43.399> I<00:01:43.460> had

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
boom boom that's pretty much all I had

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.630 
boom boom that's pretty much all I had
to<00:01:43.700> do<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.910> solve<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.300> um<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:48.130> very<00:01:49.130> lucky<00:01:49.310> solve

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
to do to solve it um so very lucky solve

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.270 
to do to solve it um so very lucky solve
I'm<00:01:49.850> averaging<00:01:50.479> 22<00:01:51.350> I<00:01:51.560> think<00:01:51.740> something

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
I'm averaging 22 I think something

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.480 
I'm averaging 22 I think something
around<00:01:52.520> there<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:53.000> get<00:01:53.660> a<00:01:53.690> lot<00:01:53.899> of<00:01:53.990> 27<00:01:54.619> but<00:01:55.160> I

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
around there I get a lot of 27 but I

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.999 
around there I get a lot of 27 but I
just<00:01:56.180> wanted<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.479> do<00:01:56.660> a<00:01:56.690> couple<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.680> quick

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
just wanted to do a couple of quick

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:06.370 
just wanted to do a couple of quick
solves<00:01:58.490> for<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.820> guys<00:02:04.360> it<00:02:05.360> does<00:02:05.570> pop<00:02:05.869> every<00:02:06.200> so

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
solves for you guys it does pop every so

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.859 
solves for you guys it does pop every so
often<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.800> is<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.070> I<00:02:07.310> think<00:02:07.670> this<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.570> QJ

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
often this is it I think this is a QJ

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.270 
often this is it I think this is a QJ
but<00:02:09.709> it's<00:02:09.860> not<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.190> big<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.520> deal<00:02:10.670> okay<00:02:15.280> so

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
but it's not that big of a deal okay so

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.460 
but it's not that big of a deal okay so
I<00:02:16.670> guess<00:02:17.180> I'll<00:02:17.390> do<00:02:17.570> more<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.110> walk

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
I guess I'll do more of like a walk

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.890 
I guess I'll do more of like a walk
through<00:02:18.799> salt<00:02:19.100> first<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:22.340> what<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.480> do<00:02:23.630> is<00:02:23.780> you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
through salt first so what you do is you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.100 
through salt first so what you do is you
first<00:02:24.140> solve<00:02:24.380> one<00:02:24.680> side<00:02:25.420> by<00:02:26.420> putting<00:02:26.750> each<00:02:26.959> of

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
first solve one side by putting each of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.240 
first solve one side by putting each of
the<00:02:27.170> corners<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.560> want<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.799> make<00:02:27.920> sure<00:02:28.100> they

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
the corners you want to make sure they

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.150 
the corners you want to make sure they
match<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.320> so<00:02:30.320> I'm<00:02:30.470> gonna<00:02:30.590> put<00:02:30.799> in<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:30.980> one

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
match up so I'm gonna put in this one

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.000 
match up so I'm gonna put in this one
next<00:02:32.320> this<00:02:33.320> way<00:02:34.780> now<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:35.959> right<00:02:36.709> with<00:02:36.890> that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
next this way now it's right with that

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.100 
next this way now it's right with that
one<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.580> then<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.330> one<00:02:38.390> I'm<00:02:39.019> gonna<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:40.310> there

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
one and then this one I'm gonna in there

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.360 
one and then this one I'm gonna in there
so<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.260> then<00:02:42.350> you<00:02:42.470> use<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.860> one<00:02:43.070> algorithm

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
so and then you use the one algorithm

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.830 
so and then you use the one algorithm
and<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.060> switches<00:02:44.390> these<00:02:44.840> two<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.530> these<00:02:46.310> two

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
and it switches these two and these two

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.729 
and it switches these two and these two
so<00:02:47.840> I'm<00:02:48.320> gonna<00:02:48.440> put<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.739> blue<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:51.650> I'll

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
so I'm gonna put the blue in and I'll

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.770 
so I'm gonna put the blue in and I'll
put<00:02:51.920> black<00:02:52.130> on<00:02:52.340> top<00:02:52.370> which<00:02:53.239> is<00:02:53.360> what<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.540> needed

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
put black on top which is what I needed

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.410 
put black on top which is what I needed
because<00:02:53.930> yellow<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.500> bottom<00:02:55.150> there's<00:02:56.150> two

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
because yellow is on bottom there's two

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.440 
because yellow is on bottom there's two
cases<00:02:57.549> you<00:02:58.549> have<00:02:58.640> one<00:02:58.850> where<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.090> have<00:02:59.239> two

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
cases you have one where you have two

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.770 
cases you have one where you have two
corners<00:02:59.690> oriented<00:03:00.350> correctly<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.600> art

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
corners oriented correctly to that art

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.960 
corners oriented correctly to that art
and<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.530> want<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:04.549> one<00:03:04.820> right<00:03:04.850> here<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
and you want this one right here and you

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.569 
and you want this one right here and you
do<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.090> algorithm<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:11.500> then<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:13.280> have<00:03:13.430> this

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
do the algorithm and then you have this

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.699 
do the algorithm and then you have this
one<00:03:13.760> more<00:03:13.910> than<00:03:14.060> no<00:03:14.209> corners<00:03:14.540> are<00:03:14.690> oriented<00:03:15.560> we

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
one more than no corners are oriented we

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.180 
one more than no corners are oriented we
have<00:03:15.890> these<00:03:16.220> two<00:03:16.850> headlights<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.079> these<00:03:18.919> two

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
have these two headlights and these two

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.830 
have these two headlights and these two
handles<00:03:19.669> or<00:03:19.910> whatever<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.269> want<00:03:20.389> to<00:03:20.419> call

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
handles or whatever you want to call

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.979 
handles or whatever you want to call
and<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.260> have<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.770> hand<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.989> the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
and you have it to the hand this the

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.309 
and you have it to the hand this the
headlights<00:03:24.650> are<00:03:24.800> facing<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.280> your<00:03:25.430> left<00:03:25.700> and

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
headlights are facing to your left and

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:34.000 
headlights are facing to your left and
it's<00:03:30.099> this<00:03:31.099> is<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.459> algorithm<00:03:32.650> push<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:33.860> one

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
it's this is the algorithm push that one

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.880 
it's this is the algorithm push that one
away<00:03:34.270> push<00:03:35.270> that<00:03:35.420> one<00:03:35.630> away<00:03:35.720> pull<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.680> back

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
away push that one away pull that back

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.670 
away push that one away pull that back
and<00:03:37.040> pull<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:37.310> back<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:39.080> you<00:03:39.230> do<00:03:39.349> it<00:03:39.440> twice

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
and pull that back and you do it twice

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.530 
and pull that back and you do it twice
and<00:03:40.670> that's<00:03:41.540> opposite<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:43.330> yeah

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
and that's opposite so yeah

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.300 
and that's opposite so yeah
and<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:46.610> really<00:03:46.819> like<00:03:46.940> this<00:03:47.090> puzzle<00:03:47.450> so

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
and I just really like this puzzle so

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.400 
and I just really like this puzzle so
yeah<00:03:49.310> you<00:03:49.610> can<00:03:49.700> get<00:03:49.849> it<00:03:49.940> at<00:03:50.030> cube<00:03:50.239> Depot<00:03:50.540> it's<00:03:51.349> a

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
yeah you can get it at cube Depot it's a

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.630 
yeah you can get it at cube Depot it's a
really<00:03:51.680> fun<00:03:51.830> puzzle<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.280> solve

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
really fun puzzle to solve
