00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
quite a bit of quartz in it and that's

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.250 
quite a bit of quartz in it and that's
one<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> telltale<00:00:45.390> signs<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.230> might

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
one of the telltale signs that you might

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.430 
one of the telltale signs that you might
be<00:00:46.620> around<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.160> quartz<00:00:47.550> vein<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:49.110> lot<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
be around a quartz vein and a lot of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.830 
be around a quartz vein and a lot of
times<00:00:49.649> gold<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.610> associated<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> court

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
times gold is associated with the court

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.229 
times gold is associated with the court
so<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.770> stuff<00:00:53.039> starting<00:00:53.489> back<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.059> hole

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
so and stuff starting back in the hole

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.850 
so and stuff starting back in the hole
that<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.570> was<00:00:54.809> digging<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.260> begin<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.710> I'm

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that I was digging to begin with I'm

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.200 
that I was digging to begin with I'm
going<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.129> down<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> creek<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.850> little<00:00:57.059> bit

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210

and see where other people have dug and
try<00:01:00.570> another<00:01:00.780> area<00:01:01.260> out<00:01:01.410> before<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> get<00:01:02.129> back

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
try another area out before I get back

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.119 
try another area out before I get back
in<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.489> same<00:01:02.910> hole<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> I'm<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> do

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
in that same hole so I'm going to do

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.890 
in that same hole so I'm going to do
that<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:06.119> back<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:08.210> ok<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.630> trip

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
number four and day three I believe it's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.020 
number four and day three I believe it's
day<00:01:14.580> three<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> anyway<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.790> didn't<00:01:17.790> shoot<00:01:17.909> a

digging things that I've learned you
know<00:01:26.549> look<00:01:26.790> how<00:01:26.970> deep<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.509> shovel<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.340> work

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
know look how deep your shovel is work

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.730 
know look how deep your shovel is work
across<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.090> layer<00:01:30.329> sample<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> different

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
across the layer sample the different

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.910 
across the layer sample the different
layers<00:01:31.970> things<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.479> I've<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.500> been

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
layers things like that I've just been

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.460 
layers things like that I've just been
panning<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.640> today<00:01:36.540> i<00:01:36.570> decided<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.259> come<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
panning and today i decided to come to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.490 
panning and today i decided to come to
lower<00:01:37.770> coker<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:38.970> some<00:01:39.180> crevice<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.750> and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
lower coker and do some crevice in and

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.010 
lower coker and do some crevice in and
and<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.970> can<00:01:43.150> see<00:01:43.360> here<00:01:43.600> i'm<00:01:43.720> going<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.900> show

and you can see here i'm going to show

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.380 
and you can see here i'm going to show
you<00:01:44.050> here<00:01:44.380> some<00:01:45.190> like<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.640> little<00:01:46.150> cracks

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
you here some like the little cracks

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.730 
you here some like the little cracks
that<00:01:46.750> i'm<00:01:46.900> working<00:01:47.080> in<00:01:49.050> these<00:01:50.050> things<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.650> the

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
that i'm working in these things in the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.820 
that i'm working in these things in the
bedrock<00:01:51.220> and<00:01:51.550> stuff<00:01:52.450> like<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:52.660> and<00:01:52.840> i've<00:01:53.170> got

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
bedrock and stuff like that and i've got

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.780 
bedrock and stuff like that and i've got
a<00:01:53.860> little<00:01:54.070> hose<00:01:54.370> here<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:56.170> i'm<00:01:56.320> using<00:01:56.350> i<00:01:57.010> was

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
a little hose here that i'm using i was

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.109 
a little hose here that i'm using i was
using<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.270> classifier<00:01:58.810> there<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.790> i<00:02:00.820> found

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
using the classifier there but i found

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.240 
using the classifier there but i found
out<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.540> wasn't<00:02:01.690> really<00:02:01.900> necessary<00:02:02.170> i<00:02:02.830> needed

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
out it wasn't really necessary i needed

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.850 
out it wasn't really necessary i needed
to<00:02:03.340> get<00:02:03.490> my<00:02:03.520> bigger<00:02:03.910> classifier<00:02:04.630> so<00:02:05.530> i<00:02:05.560> walk

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
to get my bigger classifier so i walk

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.730 
to get my bigger classifier so i walk
back<00:02:06.250> down<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.580> stream<00:02:07.360> i'll<00:02:07.990> show<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.350> here

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
back down the stream i'll show you here

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.300 
back down the stream i'll show you here
this<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.729> upstream<00:02:10.300> part<00:02:10.950> really<00:02:11.950> remote

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
this is the upstream part really remote

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.229 
this is the upstream part really remote
