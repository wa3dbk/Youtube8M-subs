hey<00:00:28.950> guys<00:00:29.480> I'm<00:00:30.480> videoing<00:00:31.350> this<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.860> case<00:00:32.070> it's

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
hey guys I'm videoing this in case it's

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.860 
hey guys I'm videoing this in case it's
of<00:00:32.460> interest<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:33.030> anybody<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.720> bit

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
of interest to anybody it's a bit

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.799 
of interest to anybody it's a bit
different<00:00:34.700> from<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> usual<00:00:37.670> yesterday<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:39.000> was

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
different from the usual yesterday I was

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.970 
different from the usual yesterday I was
checking<00:00:40.080> something<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> mill<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:42.980> when

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
checking something on the mill and when

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.150 
checking something on the mill and when
I<00:00:44.010> need<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.550> hyper<00:00:44.760> accurate<00:00:45.330> I<00:00:45.510> use

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
I need to be hyper accurate I use

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.090 
I need to be hyper accurate I use
particularly<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> y-axis<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.300> use

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
particularly on the y-axis I use

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.140 
particularly on the y-axis I use
indicators<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.160> thought<00:00:53.400> I<00:00:53.460> better<00:00:53.790> check

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
indicators but I thought I better check

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.389 
indicators but I thought I better check
something<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.780> here<00:00:55.080> because<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.410> couple<00:00:56.309> of

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
something on here because a couple of

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.040 
something on here because a couple of
things<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> past<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.420> made<00:00:57.630> me<00:00:57.780> slightly

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
things in the past have made me slightly

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.090 
things in the past have made me slightly
suspicious<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.980> I've<00:00:59.070> never<00:00:59.250> looked<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
suspicious and I've never looked into it

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.480 
suspicious and I've never looked into it
so<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.989> table<00:01:05.600> moves<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:06.990> would<00:01:07.259> expect

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
so the table moves as you would expect

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.859 
so the table moves as you would expect
according<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.830> graduated<00:01:12.350> collar<00:01:13.350> job

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
according to the graduated collar job

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.210 
according to the graduated collar job
can't<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> right<00:01:16.380> name<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:16.649> it<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.760 

graduated<00:01:20.220> scale<00:01:20.960> let's<00:01:21.960> call<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.410> that<00:01:22.560> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
graduated scale let's call it that I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.210 
graduated scale let's call it that I
don't<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.100> soft<00:01:23.640> brain<00:01:23.970> today<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.920> one

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
don't know soft brain today so one

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.580 
don't know soft brain today so one
rotation<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:28.259> moves<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.770> hundred<00:01:29.130> thou

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
rotation and it moves a hundred thou

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.930 
rotation and it moves a hundred thou
these<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.830> not<00:01:31.950> graduated<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
these are not graduated and that

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.419 
these are not graduated and that
graduated<00:01:33.929> from<00:01:34.140> two<00:01:34.380> thousand<00:01:34.860> currents<00:01:35.280> but

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
graduated from two thousand currents but

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.680 
graduated from two thousand currents but
that's<00:01:35.610> quite<00:01:35.759> adequate<00:01:36.300> for<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.539> lot<00:01:36.660> of

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
that's quite adequate for a lot of

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.999 
that's quite adequate for a lot of
purposes<00:01:38.270> but<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> y-axis<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.679> was<00:01:40.830> what<00:01:40.979> I

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
purposes but the y-axis that was what I

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.279 
purposes but the y-axis that was what I
was<00:01:41.630> thinking<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.720> better<00:01:42.929> check<00:01:43.229> properly<00:01:43.560> and

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
was thinking I better check properly and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.359 
was thinking I better check properly and
when<00:01:46.289> I<00:01:46.319> came<00:01:46.440> to<00:01:46.619> check<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:48.110> found<00:01:49.220> it's<00:01:50.220> not

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
when I came to check it I found it's not

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.059 
when I came to check it I found it's not
doing<00:01:50.849> what<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.179> should<00:01:51.259> this<00:01:52.259> has<00:01:52.470> also<00:01:52.649> got

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
doing what it should this has also got

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.600 
doing what it should this has also got
us<00:01:53.190> descent<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:54.000> same<00:01:54.209> scale<00:01:54.890> its<00:01:55.890> graduated

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
us descent the same scale its graduated

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.809 
us descent the same scale its graduated
in<00:01:57.619> 2000<00:01:58.619> revolutions<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> should<00:01:59.610> give<00:01:59.789> a

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
in 2000 revolutions it should give a

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.609 
in 2000 revolutions it should give a
hundred<00:02:02.450> thousands<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:03.599> my<00:02:03.780> dial<00:02:04.080> indicator

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
hundred thousands with my dial indicator

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.770 
hundred thousands with my dial indicator
or<00:02:04.979> dial<00:02:05.250> indicators<00:02:05.940> I'm<00:02:06.179> comparing<00:02:06.690> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
or dial indicators I'm comparing a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.690 
or dial indicators I'm comparing a
metric<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.289> in<00:02:07.410> imperial<00:02:07.950> inch<00:02:08.849> one<00:02:09.619> okay<00:02:13.700> now

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
metric and in imperial inch one okay now

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.080 
metric and in imperial inch one okay now
the<00:02:14.760> camera<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.270> really<00:02:15.599> perched<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:17.700> may<00:02:17.849> even

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the camera is really perched we may even

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.250 
the camera is really perched we may even
get<00:02:18.560> movement<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.800> wobble<00:02:20.900> look<00:02:21.900> at<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.080> two

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
get movement and wobble look at the two

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.490 
get movement and wobble look at the two
dial<00:02:22.500> indicators<00:02:23.480> if<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.690> reflection<00:02:25.050> isn't

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
dial indicators if the reflection isn't

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.050 
dial indicators if the reflection isn't
too<00:02:25.620> bad<00:02:25.830> set<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.550> zero<00:02:27.260> set<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.440> zero<00:02:29.060> yeah

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
too bad set to zero set to zero yeah

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.750 
too bad set to zero set to zero yeah
almost<00:02:30.360> exactly<00:02:31.340> now<00:02:32.340> watch<00:02:32.519> what<00:02:32.700> happens

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
almost exactly now watch what happens

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.960 
almost exactly now watch what happens
when<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.920> go<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:35.129> full<00:02:35.400> rotation

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.110 

you<00:02:40.970> see<00:02:41.180> we're<00:02:41.330> coming<00:02:41.450> round<00:02:41.750> towards<00:02:42.170> zero

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
you see we're coming round towards zero

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.710 
you see we're coming round towards zero
and<00:02:44.380> we're<00:02:45.380> coming<00:02:45.590> up<00:02:45.710> to<00:02:45.890> zero<00:02:49.420> about<00:02:50.420> their

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
and we're coming up to zero about their

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.130 
and we're coming up to zero about their
best<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.200> can<00:02:51.350> judge<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.810> what<00:02:53.960> do<00:02:54.050> you

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
best I can judge it so what do you

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.180 
best I can judge it so what do you
notice<00:02:54.320> oh<00:02:55.810> it's<00:02:56.810> gone<00:02:57.080> just<00:02:57.320> past<00:02:57.560> zero<00:02:57.890> I

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
notice oh it's gone just past zero I

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.890 
notice oh it's gone just past zero I
must<00:02:58.520> have<00:02:58.670> just<00:02:58.700> gone<00:02:59.030> hang<00:02:59.270> on<00:02:59.420> let<00:02:59.690> me<00:02:59.780> just

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
must have just gone hang on let me just

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.600 
must have just gone hang on let me just
get<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.530> zero<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.840> close<00:03:03.050> enough<00:03:03.610> so

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
get that to zero it's close enough so

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.890 
get that to zero it's close enough so
we've<00:03:04.790> done<00:03:05.000> two<00:03:05.090> revolutions<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.470> metric

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
we've done two revolutions on the metric

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.420 
we've done two revolutions on the metric
which<00:03:08.900> is<00:03:09.050> 200<00:03:09.680> times<00:03:09.860> point<00:03:10.190> zero<00:03:10.400> one<00:03:10.940> and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
which is 200 times point zero one and

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.710 
which is 200 times point zero one and
we're<00:03:13.430> actually<00:03:13.580> showing<00:03:14.060> on<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:15.190> inch<00:03:16.190> one

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
we're actually showing on the inch one

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.570 
we're actually showing on the inch one
it's<00:03:17.720> actually<00:03:18.200> just<00:03:18.560> under<00:03:18.890> 79<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:22.100> if<00:03:22.430> you

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
it's actually just under 79 and if you

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.060 
it's actually just under 79 and if you
do<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.850> math<00:03:23.060> if<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.140> multiply<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.680> two

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
do the math if you multiply the two

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.590 
do the math if you multiply the two
hundred<00:03:26.830> indications<00:03:27.830> on<00:03:28.010> here<00:03:28.430> times<00:03:29.239> two

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
hundred indications on here times two

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.800 
hundred indications on here times two
point<00:03:29.870> five<00:03:30.080> four<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:31.850> should<00:03:31.880> get<00:03:32.270> seventy

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
point five four you should get seventy

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.540 
point five four you should get seventy
eight<00:03:32.959> point<00:03:33.260> eight<00:03:33.560> or<00:03:33.950> something<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.520> that

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
eight point eight or something of that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.260 
eight point eight or something of that
sort<00:03:34.700> nearly<00:03:35.270> seventy<00:03:35.660> nine<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:37.700> is<00:03:37.970> what

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
sort nearly seventy nine that is what

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
sort nearly seventy nine that is what
we've<00:03:38.450> got<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:40.400> I'm<00:03:40.459> going<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.640> come<00:03:40.850> back<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
we've got so I'm going to come back the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.210 
we've got so I'm going to come back the
way<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.470> cooked<00:03:43.390> come<00:03:44.390> back<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.720> way<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:44.870> came

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.229 

come<00:03:49.220> back<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:50.480> zero<00:03:51.790> not<00:03:52.790> one<00:03:52.850> hundred

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
come back to zero not one hundred

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:01.330 
come back to zero not one hundred
they'll<00:03:54.070> just<00:03:55.070> nearly<00:03:55.340> seventy<00:03:55.850> nine<00:04:00.340> so

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
they'll just nearly seventy nine so

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.490 
they'll just nearly seventy nine so
arguably<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:02.269> should<00:04:02.690> have<00:04:02.810> checked<00:04:03.019> that<00:04:03.230> long

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
arguably I should have checked that long

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.600 
arguably I should have checked that long
ago<00:04:03.880> but<00:04:05.440> because<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:06.590> haven't<00:04:06.890> relied<00:04:07.220> on<00:04:07.280> the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
ago but because I haven't relied on the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.710 
ago but because I haven't relied on the
scale<00:04:07.910> much<00:04:08.180> for<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.739> y-axis<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:11.299> I'll<00:04:11.480> say

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
scale much for the y-axis and I'll say

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.539 
scale much for the y-axis and I'll say
generally<00:04:12.170> I've<00:04:12.290> got<00:04:12.530> an<00:04:12.680> indicator<00:04:13.160> tucked

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
generally I've got an indicator tucked

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.719 
generally I've got an indicator tucked
on<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.850> back<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:15.440> hadn't<00:04:16.010> really<00:04:16.250> noticed<00:04:16.280> a

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
on the back I hadn't really noticed a

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.090 
on the back I hadn't really noticed a
discrepancy<00:04:18.100> so<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.370> well<00:04:20.979> we're<00:04:21.979> getting

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
discrepancy so that well we're getting

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.270 
discrepancy so that well we're getting
inch<00:04:22.400> on<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:23.060> X<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:24.080> we're<00:04:24.680> getting<00:04:24.770> metric

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
inch on the X and we're getting metric

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.170 
inch on the X and we're getting metric
on<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.490> Y<00:04:25.760> which<00:04:27.580> it's<00:04:28.580> not<00:04:28.760> really<00:04:28.970> what<00:04:29.120> I

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
on the Y which it's not really what I

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.130 
on the Y which it's not really what I
want<00:04:30.040> so<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.070> spoke<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.490> grizzly<00:04:32.000> today<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.660> the

want so I spoke to grizzly today and the
customer<00:04:33.560> service<00:04:33.950> is<00:04:34.100> very<00:04:34.340> good<00:04:34.520> very

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.500 
customer service is very good very
pleasant<00:04:35.180> people<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:37.060> although<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.330> guy

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
pleasant people and although the guy

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.740 
pleasant people and although the guy
initially<00:04:39.200> I'd<00:04:39.290> anything<00:04:39.530> believed<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.750> and

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
initially I'd anything believed it and

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.480 
initially I'd anything believed it and
it<00:04:42.020> took<00:04:42.169> a<00:04:42.200> bit<00:04:42.350> of<00:04:42.380> explaining<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:43.070> make<00:04:43.310> sure

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
it took a bit of explaining to make sure

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.900 
it took a bit of explaining to make sure
he<00:04:43.610> got<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:44.229> you<00:04:45.229> know<00:04:45.349> the<00:04:45.530> details

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
he got the you know the details

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.750 
he got the you know the details
but<00:04:47.510> he<00:04:48.020> went<00:04:48.170> off<00:04:48.410> he<00:04:48.830> said<00:04:48.980> hang<00:04:49.160> on<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.340> minute

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
but he went off he said hang on a minute

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.930 
but he went off he said hang on a minute
so<00:04:49.970> he<00:04:50.120> went<00:04:50.300> off<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.510> spoke<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.730> associates<00:04:52.730> I

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
so he went off and spoke to associates I

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.310 
so he went off and spoke to associates I
guess<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.390> he<00:04:53.450> came<00:04:53.600> back<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:53.990> he<00:04:54.050> said<00:04:54.230> oh

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
guess and he came back and he said oh

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.980 
guess and he came back and he said oh
yeah<00:04:54.500> is<00:04:54.770> this<00:04:55.010> there<00:04:55.760> are<00:04:55.850> two<00:04:56.030> instances

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
yeah is this there are two instances

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.280 
yeah is this there are two instances
where<00:04:57.050> this<00:04:57.380> has<00:04:57.560> happened<00:04:57.740> before<00:04:59.080> so<00:05:00.080> long

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
where this has happened before so long

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.240 
where this has happened before so long

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
fun of tearing things down to install

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.460 
fun of tearing things down to install
and<00:05:12.320> at<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.070> moment<00:05:13.630> he<00:05:14.630> won't<00:05:14.870> see<00:05:15.140> it<00:05:15.170> he

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
and at the moment he won't see it he

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.730 
and at the moment he won't see it he
went<00:05:15.920> seed<00:05:16.190> on<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.430> air<00:05:16.670> but<00:05:16.820> there<00:05:17.000> are<00:05:17.090> to

went seed on the air but there are to
somebody<00:05:18.740> else<00:05:18.890> where<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.220> grizzly<00:05:19.580> will

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
somebody else where the grizzly will

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.190 
somebody else where the grizzly will
probably<00:05:20.060> know<00:05:20.240> but<00:05:20.480> there<00:05:20.630> are<00:05:20.720> two<00:05:20.870> screws

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
probably know but there are two screws

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.690 
probably know but there are two screws
there<00:05:21.470> account<00:05:21.800> for<00:05:21.920> the<00:05:21.980> life<00:05:22.190> we<00:05:22.220> think

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
there account for the life we think

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.390 
there account for the life we think
exactly<00:05:23.060> what<00:05:23.420> they<00:05:23.600> do

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
exactly what they do

the<00:05:39.050> screws<00:05:39.500> function<00:05:40.190> before<00:05:40.430> I<00:05:40.640> actually

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
the screws function before I actually

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.980 
the screws function before I actually
pull<00:05:41.180> things<00:05:41.330> apart<00:05:42.940> so<00:05:43.940> that's<00:05:44.390> some<00:05:44.630> fun<00:05:44.810> in

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
pull things apart so that's some fun in

in cases of interest I should probably

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.390 
in cases of interest I should probably
get<00:05:59.900> my<00:05:59.960> dear<00:06:00.290> wife<00:06:00.530> to<00:06:00.740> help<00:06:00.860> me<00:06:01.040> lift<00:06:01.220> the
