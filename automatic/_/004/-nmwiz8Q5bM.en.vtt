00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.829
 Hi everyone 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.780
 here we are again together today I will make a 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:38.760
 little dress in elastic fabric 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.250
 completely elastic I will not use the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.930
 team but we prepare a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.480
 pattern and by yourself without the help of 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.070
 nothing we do a rectangle of the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.059
 half the width of the circumference 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.540
 hips and length that clearly 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.600
 we want this dress 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.700
 practically a single seam on the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.420
 left side while the right side is 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.820
 on the fold of the fabric and that we have 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.790
 folded in two parts and putting it on skis 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.210
 move on the selvage ok 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.659
 let's take the length below the turn 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.130
 armpit sleeve from below 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.350
 so if you are sure you are not wrong 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.350
 because at the top we don't really have the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.900
 shoulder we have the neck so this is it 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.960
 the point we go down as many centimeters 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.550
 what we want 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.210
 this is the part we will put on 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.390
 fold 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.710
 we folded the fabric putting the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.460
 selvedge on the selvage here so then them 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.300
 we will cut and we will have the seam 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.510
 this is the armhole we have the part 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.430
 the nightmare is a shoulder 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.310
 imaginary where we could possibly 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.650
 even get out a sleeve if you do 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.260
 we wish 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.049
 here from this point there is a hint for 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.540
 just hint of shoulder then 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.700
 continues with the neck we have a neck 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.060
 falling ring e 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.959
 and which also falls on the shoulder 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.200
 there too there will be a seam here 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.629
 then at that point then it will turn from 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.400
 a part will come down on our shoulder 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:36.640
 they will have a little bit of movement 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:41.709
 ok now we need another one too 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:46.420
 opening for our sleeve so 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:49.750
 let's take the conference part voice 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.780
 the bcb of the upper part before the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.250
 shoulder of our arm 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.180
 more or less at the same height 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.660
 armpit 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:06.010
 we mark a line that is equal to a 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.980
 fourth of the circumference of ours 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:20.940
 upper arm of the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:23.950
 arm we do like a triangle though 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.819
 there is no thin arm either 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.549
 need just open that straight part 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.590
 which I drew depends a bit on 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.000
 all however this is the point where it is 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.000
 takes the circumference 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.250
 ok now we practically have it as said 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.370
 this part the seam we have the round 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.389
 sleeve that will remain open we will open 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:55.690
 this part to let out the hand e 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:04:00.040
 so surely we can go to 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:04.060
 cut our dress with I have you 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.090
 said we fold the fabric then 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.340
 we have two layers on one side 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.370
 we will have precisely the 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.720
 the fold of the fabric on the other will be 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:26.000
 open and will be part where we will then leave 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:29.240
 the dress is now practically cut 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.360
 He was cut to this part at the bottom 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:38.510
 and then we can go and sew ok 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.820
 here is the dress already cut with left 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.370
 a little less than an inch beyond 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:49.400
 paper pattern to go out with the size e 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.620
 sews and practically left open the 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.600
 armhole 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.790
 the other part to get the hand out e 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.669
 clearly the top for the 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:04.010
 so here's how you see I immediately 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.669
 both the dress and a t-shirt but there 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.680
 still holds it upside down with braque 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.419
 left like this to let you see that I have 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.860
 sewn with the size and sews me 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:18.800
 I recommend four children and this is the 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.280
 neck annoyed we return to the dress ho 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.120
 left open the two parts for the 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:29.090
 arm and clearly finished this is 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.880
 the neck on this side the neck falls 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.820
 a bit from the shoulder to the dredging 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.930
 on the other side it leaves the shoulder 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.400
 completely discovered this is the dress 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.770
 if you have a little bit more lard 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.630
 add a few centimeters 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.630
 have fun next time
