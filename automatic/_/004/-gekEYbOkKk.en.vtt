00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.810
 and now very good like all kids 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.160
 once again by georgios comments a 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.109
 white gameplay we started 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.700
 dying like a pig and this is a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.370
 rapid team gold match 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.470
 runs like the wind peluche 36 2 in the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.760
 that I die twice in a row that are the 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.109
 first two deaths of moon you go to 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.509
 start the game without killing anyone 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.980
 and then I do the 36 pull downs 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.109
 look here I confused him as 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.269
 partner and it does not turn out that he was enemy 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.470
 but now I do not die anymore in all the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.419
 gameplay were only those two deaths 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.650
 I wanted to create feet so that I wanted 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.380
 six because there are many mistrusted by 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.300
 this world are no longer 36 casualties in which 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.970
 I'm playing with the shotgun like 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.160
 I always carry marks but the series 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.350
 It should be exactly with a long barrel 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.750
 and of gusts of casualties I have the agr 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.400
 furtive helicopter and sat orbital 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.810
 good gusts very good that I recommend 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.160
 and apart is that the comments also the 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.170
 I recommend it because it's tremendous or I 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.540
 I thought the shotgun in the whites 2 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.970
 It was not worth it but you play a little and 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.710
 you see that always amazing and good 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.800
 kids in this gameplay good nothing else 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.920
 tell you I'm too busy 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 that I do not have time even to breathe and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.999
 I'm stuffed with things like 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.480
 create a web page that plays 

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:07.890
 for 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.500
 this week that I have to finish 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.820
 Etc. Duties by a tube 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.700
 exams that now come to me in April 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.450
 well I'm too busy fixing or 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.870
 whether you have me added to the play com 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.220
 for irony he will put that as ten 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.740
 days that I do not connect because I have two 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.720
 weeks without playing at least either no 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.890
 play fifa or talk as if nothing is 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.510
 everything I'm taking from you 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.640
 imply that I have piled up here 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.230
 how do I have three or four more of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.790
 good in total are six or seven but two 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.090
 games are very old be more 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.830
 normalitas are in plan 60 10 euros 70 10 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.810
 that I have them out there saved by themselves 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.390
 maybe one day I die without gameplays and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.430
 so what I can get from him 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.540
 stored but what I tell you in two 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.210
 weeks without playing the play and start 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.760
 easter holidays this day 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.670
 Thursday or the first day of vacation 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.900
 it's Friday and therefore I'll start 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.180
 will make this vacation to play a little 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.340
 more good though you know that the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.380
 institute the exams everything goes a lot 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.740
 before video games this is like 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.470
 a young man 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.180
 I can allow it to put other 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.880
 most important things from behind 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.620
 so then that is whenever I can 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.780
 play ea for I have also my life 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.040
 social I have to do what good 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.420
 we were lately quite then 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.460
 let's say I'm too busy 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.560
 now I will try to throw some 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.870
 afternoons playing and so on to get some 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.970
 gameplay 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.500
 Well, do not leave the abandoned canal. 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.910
 because lately I'm going up every 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.740
 three days a gameplay that's because 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.060
 I am very very busy but good 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.850
 I promise you that from 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.890
 now it will not happen then wait 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.120
 what do I say to people more or less 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.410
 it would stay the same because it is that when 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.450
 come the exams I will have a lot 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.350
 more complicated but good the channel never 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.120
 I'm going to abandon it, I will not have 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.190

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.870

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.280

 I have many reproductions maybe it's 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.950

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.330
 Esparta stress but if you see me 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.430

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.670

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.349
 pulling everything apart from the enemies 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.810
 I can not find them, I pass the whole map 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.910
