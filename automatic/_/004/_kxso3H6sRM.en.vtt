00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.029
 very good all the frames lookers and 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.430
 welcome to vter fil 4 today as you see 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.769
 play part number 2 of the guide for 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.049
 first- timers the one that goes up the week 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.749
 past was quite successful you liked it 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.510
 you received it very well, so 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.220
 today it is therefore necessary to improve a little more in 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.130
 the battlefield 4 let's see what we can 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.800
 do to get out of that rookie state 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.450
 total and extreme to do so a 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.700
 little more and not become a 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.710
 player a tad more experienced in 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.839
 this battlefield of course the first thing 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.249
 and the most important thing is to play no if not 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:36.379
 you play if you do not drive for hours to 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.059
 game you're never going to improve that's 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.929
 clear and if you have a terrible connection 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.879
 Well, it's going to cost you true but good 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.309
 removing those two little things that are then 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.039
 more or less obligatory than you have 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.019
 and what do you do then let's go to the topic 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.749
 because in the first episode I was 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.850
 commenting on which game modes to play if 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:58.489
 you come from the call of duty like sighting 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.100
 because there are no gusts in this very game 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.889
 spy and is therefore a mandatory let's say 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.409
 have the sighted button always love 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:08.329
 or not like which in patrol how to look 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.999
 and how to adapt to the principle the 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.219
 battlefield 4 because today we are going to improve 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:15.049
 the guide a little bit more let's talk 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.689
 about weapons on how to handle weapons 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.030
 on how to do well with different 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.770
 types of weapons not something for beginners 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.479
 because this guide already told you that it is for 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.849
 novice is not for experienced like this 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.950
 which are simply bases that I give you 

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:29.659
 to start and to improve in the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.929
 battlefield 4 or the battlefield saga 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.459
 directly as long as then 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.349
 we just started not because I started 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.479
 does nothing like I said I started two years ago 

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:40.280
 months or so I've learned enough 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.829
 things enough things that I can 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.259
 advise you to improve a 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.420
 tint more in this game in this first 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.159
 person shooters because the weapons 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.020
 compared to the call of duty are 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.719
 completely different you can not 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.129
 compare them are not equal there is mp7 in the 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.989
 call of duty and if there is a pesito of 

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:58.549
 battle fit yes but that the two weapons are 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:00.859
 same as they are handled exactly the same 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.780
 not for nothing and that of what I'm going to 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.019
 speak today not because here by the way the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.519
 flashes of this hall meters when 

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:09.109
 are the lights off those are 

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:10.910
 brutal these graphics are great 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.050
 this game sometimes surprises a lot 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.420
 but 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.980
 with respect to the heat it is clear but 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.470
 good talking about guns that is 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.870
 of which is the guide of today you have 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.480
 that shooting always in bursts is the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.850
 advice that I will give you never shoot 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.950
 to full unless it is from the hip 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.360
 unless the uncle may have a 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.060
 subway to two meters that you have it 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.190
 practically in the face because if not of 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.100
 little use is not the bullet dispersion that 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.660
 there is in this game it is very high it is brutal 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.640
 especially with the light ones that is what 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.950
 I'm using and right now at least I 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.570
 I speak from my point of view from the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.000
 track are four that's where I play 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.010
 I started at the best it's different I do not know 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.080
 but company is a 4 dispersion of 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.150
 bullet the truth is that it's pretty big 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.250
 it's huge and you have to always play 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.480
 not bursts and if you are very newbies and not 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.090
 you have no idea what playing means 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.760
 to bursts because playing bursts means 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.860
 shoot two three bullets four bullets 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.840
 stop shooting shoot again two 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.150
 three bullets let shoot back to 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.480
 shoot two or three bullets is simply 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.330
 stop having the trigger I have always 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.190
 pressed and what you have to do is like 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.660
 until pearl or not I do not know how to say 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.250
 word in Spanish but you have to 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.250
 but you have to be like that 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.240
 I do not know if you have caught the subject but it is 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.370
 just shoot stop shooting 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.170
 shoot stop shooting no and do it 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.270
 as quickly as possible is clear because 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.400
 the faster you do it the more cadence 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.380
 you will have and more probabilities you will have 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.350
 to kill the uncle in front of you 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.630
 not so that 's the advice more 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.880
 fundamental that could have given you at the time of 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.820
 use the weapons in the battlefield because 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.740
 it's no good shooting at full auto 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.810
 call it what you want is not worth anything 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.540
 because the scattering of bullets is huge 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.870
 you can have the guy 20 meters away shoot 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.430
 blue and apparently the peephole does not move 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.040
 of your head but still you are not going to 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.660
 give so it can already be more than 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.960
 connection or by themes of any other 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.310
 thing but always shoot blasts to 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.930
 not that it makes sense before what 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.030
 three meters and may have disparate 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.100
 blue hip that if the dispersion of 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.350
 gusts is still there not by the 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.080
 Hip dispersion or dispersion of 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.609
 bullets is still there but it's a lot 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.500
 minor is not that it's much smaller but 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.040
 you have the shot so close that it's pretty 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.100
 likely that some will end up giving 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.050
 so when it comes to situations of 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.150
 panic you can shoot full if you are 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.880
 at very short distances and if it's half 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.610
 long distances you can use weapons to 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.290
 bursts are always very good from 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.120
 recoil or very bad recoil 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.730
 I would always recommend but always 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.950
 always use weapons with bursts or 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.350
 micro bursts as they always say in the 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.670
 battlefield 4 does not make one and as 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.440
 main weapon that I'm going to recommend 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.710
 so that you start playing in the 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.170
 battlefield is sar 21 is a rifle 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.200
 assault and I recommend you a 6 because 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.850
 is the rifle and the weapon that less 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.010
 recoil has at least one game 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.930
 of which less recoil has so 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.090
 kids, see you next video in 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.860
 the next guide I hope that this one has 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.480
 liked to put me in the section of 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.640
 comments that is what crisis that 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.930
 there is in the next video what advice 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.390
 they are digging me and you want to listen 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.400
 also the experienced ones here 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.500
 you are not to help me also to help 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.270
 to the novices who are awaiting the 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.100
 next part of the guide so good 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.530
 the new ones of the next video a greeting and 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.680
 see you again in the next video 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.680
