 class a little there are five seven pieces above 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:50.520
 thoughts 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:53.400
 Well, you can see at the top there is a mulberry 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.040
 but the mulberry harvest is just this year 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.770
 no so much as 57 here with 1 place 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.740
 comes out and the most interesting is that the bulbs 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.759
 she sat down behind the trees dissolved strongly 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:09.299
 worth absolutely not yet bloomed 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:13.409
 buds and begins to bloom somewhere in 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.039
 the first half of the first days of the decade of June 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.060
 not after that by the end of June already 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.840
 twenties 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.640
 she has already ripened well start to ripen and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.630
 attacked keep up falls raised until 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.840
 most frost 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.520
 you can once again be a worm to breed Ghana 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.999
 this is kind of leaves i have here john 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:38.219
 due live with a worm i 'm talking 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:41.240
 I have one tree first now 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:46.020
 queue for this most for saplings 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 here is this bulb all chicken because 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.450
 it turns out so here it is the mulberry here 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.909
 these all leaves mean by the time these roots are well 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.850
 the roots touch she will not she very 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.709
 good lowers sugar and for diabetics 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.959
 that is, when she came to me here 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.610
 superior varieties to test on the plot there 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.280
 somewhere here buried 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.020
 I gave a hint about mulberries they don't care there 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.820
 for everything else grows in the garden not 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.880
 ran straight to this tree 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.850
 no tree and not lead not declared there 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:23.190
 urchins grown here gave him a 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.050
 This is what it means to 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.870
 dial when a pediatrician is to be 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.910
 patients with diabetes, she said 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.360
 confirmed information before helps and 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.610
 therefore , the article where I wrote now 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:42.240
 first who is natural about this in this 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:45.239
 queue became doctors handed doctors yes here 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.520
 they now mean so new from the tree 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.630
 you are old enough for him 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.150
 years she is not probably in what year 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.550
 they sued him for ten years 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.370
 here she is all the same to some extent with us 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.400
 freezes well yes and if you take but she 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.280
 mulberry singer bending over mulberry 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.340
 then it turns out to be the same South Ural 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.070
 and took it when the soldiers return with 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.420
 front after World War II he 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:18.450
 This was brought from the Koreans mulberry 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.140
 at a distance the enemies when he brought it 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.780
 after the war put the forks forks forks 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.660
 this inhabited walked there for kilometers one 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.450
 and she died only four years there 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.989
 you must imagine that it is to read 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.540
 with 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:40.200
 somewhere 46 47 years an hour 2013 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.260
 she lived for more than 50 years and you are from there 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.390
 took 10 and I took out from there but I did not take 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.350
 from there I took from my south here to grow 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.769
 it means and I eyes a variety of mulberry 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.040
 he was brought well thirty years ago 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:01.860
 Hurray from this same from the same you already area 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:04.560
 from Mogilev and therefore they are celebrated 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.989
 those. that's how I go she how 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.260
 it turns out like a typical sort of cherry seed 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.250
 No, but above the green layings only 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.769
 and may be diluted as a pack of just there in 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.780
 the firs of which she just fell berries they 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.030
 emanated from it's silky 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.780
 so below we will now show us 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:35.419
 Here it grows very close look but it 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:39.979
 here is the place of grapes here and lead 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:42.740
 see this no solid here young yes 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.960
 here young did not dream so wide then 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.479
 there is a very way to apply 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.260
 simple you take these leaves 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.729
 cut off like yes and then dry 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:57.440
 grind on a coffee grinder add 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:01.400
 as seasoning like salt pepper does not affect 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.460
 the very taste of food is understandable in this way 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.510
 but send here further after going to grow 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:21.800
 mulberry where yes here it is right more 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:23.930
 no that's over your head see this 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.510
 leaflet themselves are hauling on one side and 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.699
 not that is another yet another yes not 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.880
 I speak to each other from another little forest 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.889
 another mulberry scoop 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:39.610
 it is on the one hand this leaf with 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.610
 two cut just find 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:50.690
 well here's a big cut and small yes yes 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:54.140
 I see you see they are different there with us 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:58.540
 still have a missile that is too few 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.540
 varieties and we have them here 4 photos 1
