00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.420
 see where the keys are for 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.880
 then open the giant first 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.770
 we say that the giant is in the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.660
 cottage in front of the battery for 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.670
 enter it booklet enter from the roof like 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.590
 I just showed you and the keys 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.189
 you will find immediately next to the black chol 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.990
 that something you will open it is immediately behind 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.019
 of him as you can see there will be 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.239
 some alcohol to get it out you'll have to 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.520
 you will have to pick it up give it to him on 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.219
 guardian of Sicily of 180 degrees will break through 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.770
 the wall in front of it once done 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.930
 you can carry around only one thing 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.450
 certainly during the game 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.399
 will happen to shoot him by mistake with 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.469
 a weapon that you will have because the zombies of 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.600
 they will be close if this happens like 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.809
 you will see the guardian will avoid himself 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.660
 as if it was hurting you more 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.239
 the weapon and the guardian we say yes 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.859
 it will hurt first and run into the cage 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.920
 as soon as you walk away from you a little 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.630
 from him he will shut himself in like he does for 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.850
 freeing it must find the various 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.320
 keys scattered around the map then the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.450
 first place where you can find it is 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.470
 always there beside the guardian the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.090
