00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.450
 today we have to improve everything we have 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.550
 done everything wrong and not only that 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.870
 practically almost almost everything is wrong 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.019
 that's why the result has been given 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.019
 had given 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.480
 when you play so badly when you offer 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.060
 not like we have offered 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.260
 today it is not a matter of improving a 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.760
 thing or improve another is not a matter 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.110
 to improve the group improve the group 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.289
 to improve everything that is done because 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.190
 today we really have not deserved anything 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.420
 more than what has happened in the field 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.789
 when 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.159
 as we find you in front of us 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.530
 a rival as strong as the Madrid 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:45.030
 Well, the best thing that can happen to you is that 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.739
 that the result is only 5 playing with 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.179
 when you were with a very 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.390
 bulky against is difficult is 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.390
 complicated 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.000
 and good was already done all 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.490
 ashamed humiliated 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.260
 and it does not hurt what happened but it's that 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.730
 Nor have we deserved more than we were 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.379
 done nothing to deserve more then 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.580
 I think what happened today in the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.900
 field we have not won us 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.610
 pulse 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.050
 this suits us well I hope it comes to us 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.660
 well to get down a bit because I 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.720
 I think we're going a meter from the ground but 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.130
 everything is from the president to the one 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.450
 cut the field I think we had lost 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.950
 totally the perspective we had 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.900
 won 3-0 at Elche and wanted 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.160
 this was and we are the most team 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.390
 small of the category that some 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.000
 has not yet entered that within the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.200
 head we are the smallest there are 19 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.420
 We are the 20 of us 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.710
 below and when we are able to be 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.060
 aware of that about us 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.950
 It costs a lot to do things 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.300
 very much channel party then 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.950
 we will enter through the dynamics good 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.810
 meanwhile we have gone to the field 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.020
 Believing that what we had in front 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.340
 it was a band of friends so that's why 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.110
 We are five and thank God that 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.250
 it sounds we have five we are the ones 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.080
 the smallest the most shit of the 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.479
 category is us when we 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.890
 let's lose that perspective we can 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.300
 compete with the rest meanwhile not 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.340
 we have no option but not with the 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.070
 animals with none with any absolute 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.720
 whenever you are telling me that 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.700
 He came here to put us with his uncle 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.070
 madrid because he also did not deserve 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.099
 we have other fridays i have i is 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.090
 totally different by our way of 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.050
 play with our way of being the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.050
 things for our 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.430
 let's say that for our little one in 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.540
 how much team later when not 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.970
 we face the big ones can happen to us 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.989
 this can not happen, there's no need to 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.760
 tell him a lot if they know that 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.080
 perfectly and perfectly feel what 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.970
 that what happened to say what I wanted 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.290
 tell them that this is over 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.180
 that draw positive conclusions there 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.290
 to focus on Friday that thank you 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.489
 to God we have a very very match 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.049
 close that is Friday that is 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.569
 perfect for us after 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.849
 something like that happen and that these things happen 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.930
 other things to all to surely to almost 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.579
 most teams are going to have 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.019
 during during the season it's going to 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.549
 spend sometime good because we 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.080
 spend a second game we hope that 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.940
 this is not worth for us to put the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.410
 the necessary books and we continue 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.100
 working as we are working to 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.100
 that does not happen again
