00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
me but we went to rubber a couple years

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.970 
me but we went to rubber a couple years
back<00:00:11.660> especially<00:00:12.289> out<00:00:12.410> in<00:00:12.500> Missouri<00:00:12.590> we're

doing a lot of my fishing and I like
rubber<00:00:15.949> I<00:00:16.039> like<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:16.490> ecological<00:00:17.330> part<00:00:17.600> of<00:00:17.779> it

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
rubber I like the ecological part of it

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.259 
rubber I like the ecological part of it
and<00:00:18.140> like<00:00:18.350> doing<00:00:18.619> what<00:00:18.710> I<00:00:18.740> can<00:00:18.859> to<00:00:19.070> you<00:00:19.609> know<00:00:20.119> to

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
and like doing what I can to you know to

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.310 
and like doing what I can to you know to
avoid<00:00:20.960> invasive<00:00:21.529> species<00:00:22.189> but<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.579> rubber<00:00:22.789> is

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
avoid invasive species but the rubber is

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.980 
avoid invasive species but the rubber is
just<00:00:24.320> slick<00:00:24.560> much<00:00:25.490> slicker<00:00:25.730> than<00:00:25.880> then<00:00:26.810> the

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
just slick much slicker than then the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.669 
just slick much slicker than then the
the<00:00:27.499> old<00:00:27.679> stuff<00:00:28.009> and<00:00:28.480> so<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:30.050> solution<00:00:30.499> to<00:00:30.589> the

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
the old stuff and so the solution to the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.589 
the old stuff and so the solution to the
problem<00:00:31.069> I<00:00:31.159> found<00:00:31.429> here<00:00:31.759> is<00:00:31.849> these<00:00:32.029> goat<00:00:32.360> head

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
problem I found here is these goat head

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.250 
problem I found here is these goat head
sole<00:00:33.290> spikes<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:36.670> these<00:00:37.670> are<00:00:37.850> found<00:00:38.060> at<00:00:38.420> Seoul

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
sole spikes and these are found at Seoul

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.990 
sole spikes and these are found at Seoul
spikes<00:00:39.710> calm<00:00:40.640> Sol<00:00:41.360> e<00:00:41.600> spikes<00:00:42.350> calm<00:00:43.190> they<00:00:43.730> come

spikes calm Sol e spikes calm they come

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.240 
spikes calm Sol e spikes calm they come
in<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.210> pack<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:45.250> 34<00:00:46.690> 1995<00:00:47.690> they<00:00:48.680> also<00:00:48.860> come<00:00:49.220> with

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
in a pack of 34 1995 they also come with

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.810 
in a pack of 34 1995 they also come with
a<00:00:49.460> nice<00:00:50.800> magnetic<00:00:51.800> adapter<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:53.020> so<00:00:54.820> we're

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
a nice magnetic adapter and so we're

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.550 
a nice magnetic adapter and so we're
going<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:57.310> simply<00:00:58.310> put<00:00:59.060> in<00:00:59.180> a<00:00:59.320> few<00:01:00.320> of<00:01:00.470> these

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
going to simply put in a few of these

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.999 
going to simply put in a few of these
here<00:01:00.950> today<00:01:01.340> for<00:01:01.400> you<00:01:02.230> in<00:01:03.230> a<00:01:03.320> pattern<00:01:03.590> on<00:01:03.890> the

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
here today for you in a pattern on the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.429 
here today for you in a pattern on the
bottom<00:01:04.339> of<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.519> boots<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.089> again<00:01:05.600> like<00:01:06.409> the

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
bottom of the boots and again like the

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.810 
bottom of the boots and again like the
magnetic<00:01:06.950> part<00:01:07.340> because<00:01:08.980> it's<00:01:09.980> in<00:01:10.190> there<00:01:10.400> hard

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
magnetic part because it's in there hard

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.620 
magnetic part because it's in there hard
to<00:01:11.560> mess<00:01:12.560> up<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:12.980> a<00:01:13.040> whole<00:01:13.280> bunch<00:01:13.520> but<00:01:14.450> we're

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
to mess up that a whole bunch but we're

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.899 
to mess up that a whole bunch but we're
going<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.780> start<00:01:15.080> at<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.290> top<00:01:15.580> using<00:01:16.580> the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
going to start at the top using the

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:24.600 
going to start at the top using the
pre-drilled<00:01:17.630> holes<00:01:17.960> here<00:01:18.440> on<00:01:18.590> these<00:01:22.030> boots

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
pre-drilled holes here on these boots

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.090 
pre-drilled holes here on these boots
and<00:01:26.140> just<00:01:27.140> simply<00:01:27.409> put<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.470> series<00:01:30.740> there

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
and just simply put in a series there

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.590 
and just simply put in a series there
you<00:01:31.220> can<00:01:31.370> see<00:01:32.260> got<00:01:33.260> one<00:01:33.470> up<00:01:33.650> at<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.799> top<00:01:34.100> so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
you can see got one up at the top so

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.390 
you can see got one up at the top so
these<00:01:35.600> Sims<00:01:35.960> boots<00:01:36.290> are<00:01:36.500> already<00:01:36.920> pre-drilled

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
these Sims boots are already pre-drilled

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.710 
these Sims boots are already pre-drilled
and<00:01:38.380> we're<00:01:39.380> going<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.560> put<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.770> pattern<00:01:40.720> maybe

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
and we're going to put a pattern maybe

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.760 
and we're going to put a pattern maybe
12<00:01:42.560> or<00:01:42.710> 15<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.340> these<00:01:47.380> now<00:01:48.380> give<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.710> few

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
12 or 15 of these now give you a few

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.570 
12 or 15 of these now give you a few
extra<00:01:49.220> in<00:01:49.400> case<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:50.830> lose<00:01:51.830> some<00:01:52.130> along<00:01:52.430> the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
extra in case you lose some along the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.350 
extra in case you lose some along the
way<00:01:52.729> but<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.119> think<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:53.600> is

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.499 

gonna<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> good<00:01:57.710> solution<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:59.520> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
gonna be a good solution for the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.490 
gonna be a good solution for the
slipping<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.530> goes<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:02.659> on<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> streams<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
slipping that goes on on the streams and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.080 
slipping that goes on on the streams and
I'll<00:02:05.009> tell<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:06.060> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
I'll tell you what that's just one of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.930 
I'll tell you what that's just one of
the<00:02:06.210> things<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.929> don't<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.940> sliding

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the things that I don't like sliding

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729 
the things that I don't like sliding
around<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.539> down<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> good

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
around and going down is it's not a good

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.850 
around and going down is it's not a good
thing<00:02:10.769> so<00:02:10.979> anyway<00:02:12.170> once<00:02:13.170> again<00:02:13.440> Goathead

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
