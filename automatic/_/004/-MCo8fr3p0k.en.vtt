00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
here and today I'll be going over 2 apps

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.220 
here and today I'll be going over 2 apps
on<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.009> hole<00:00:05.220> count<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.819> novel<00:00:06.180> extend<00:00:06.629> with

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
on a hole count and a novel extend with

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.890 
on a hole count and a novel extend with
you<00:00:07.440> um<00:00:07.649> which<00:00:08.490> help<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:09.000> manage<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.540> save

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
you um which help you manage and save

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.980 
you um which help you manage and save
data<00:00:10.460> an<00:00:11.460> alpha<00:00:11.790> count<00:00:12.030> helps<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.780> manage

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
data an alpha count helps you manage

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.049 
data an alpha count helps you manage
they<00:00:13.679> don't<00:00:13.889> see<00:00:14.190> where<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.549> use<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> most

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
they don't see where you use the most

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.599 
they don't see where you use the most
data<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.540> going<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.750> open<00:00:15.900> up<00:00:16.199> first<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
data so it's going to open up first and

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.370 
data so it's going to open up first and
you<00:00:17.789> can<00:00:17.940> see<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:18.480> are<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> app<00:00:18.960> it's

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
you can see here we are in the app it's

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.609 
you can see here we are in the app it's
I<00:00:20.070> think<00:00:20.310> app<00:00:20.609> usage<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.990> get<00:00:22.230> either<00:00:22.439> of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
I think app usage and to get either of

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.170 
I think app usage and to get either of
these<00:00:22.830> apps<00:00:23.100> working<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.640> do<00:00:23.820> need<00:00:24.029> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
these apps working you do need to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.700 
these apps working you do need to
install<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.510> profile<00:00:25.019> which<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.350> actually

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
install a profile which is actually

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.679 
install a profile which is actually
really<00:00:25.920> straightforward<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.640> install<00:00:27.060> so

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
really straightforward to install so

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.179 
really straightforward to install so
you'll<00:00:27.990> hopefully<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.619> no<00:00:28.800> problem

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
you'll hopefully have no problem

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.580 
you'll hopefully have no problem
installing<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.060> once<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.590> install

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
installing it but once you do install

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
installing it but once you do install
the<00:00:31.800> profile<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:32.700> use<00:00:32.940> data<00:00:33.450> for<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the profile and then use data for a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.660 
the profile and then use data for a
couple<00:00:34.050> days<00:00:34.170> they<00:00:34.440> gather<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:35.070> data<00:00:35.100> which

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
couple days they gather some data which

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.940 
couple days they gather some data which
it<00:00:35.880> has<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.450> case<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.710> see<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it has in this case and you can see it

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.560 
it has in this case and you can see it
shows<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> nice<00:00:38.940> graphical

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
shows that in a nice graphical

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.740 
shows that in a nice graphical
representation<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.530> also<00:00:41.000> in<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.149> list<00:00:42.420> here

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
representation and also in a list here

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.650 
representation and also in a list here
and<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.309> app<00:00:44.550> uses<00:00:45.120> more<00:00:45.420> data

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and you can see which app uses more data

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.529 
and you can see which app uses more data
or<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.500> app<00:00:46.739> you're<00:00:47.489> using<00:00:47.700> more<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.329> data

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
or which app you're using more for data

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.450 
or which app you're using more for data
so<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.230> my<00:00:49.350> case<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.739> Safari<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
so you can see in my case is Safari and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
so you can see in my case is Safari and
it<00:00:50.610> shows<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.000> top<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.600> doing<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> blue

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
it shows on top here doing the blue

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.799 
it shows on top here doing the blue
color<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.399> scroll<00:00:53.699> down

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
color and you can see as I scroll down

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.099 
color and you can see as I scroll down
the<00:00:54.809> bar<00:00:55.140> moves<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.390> shows<00:00:57.390> those<00:00:57.690> less

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the bar moves and it shows those less

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.639 
the bar moves and it shows those less
used<00:00:58.829> colors<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.520> example<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.469> find<00:01:01.469> my

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
used colors so for example here find my

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.770 
used colors so for example here find my
frenzy<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.219> sees<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:02.879> small<00:01:03.180> bar<00:01:03.539> right

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
frenzy and sees a really small bar right

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.280 
frenzy and sees a really small bar right
here<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.060> Facebook

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
here and so is Facebook

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.710 
here and so is Facebook
and<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.980> forth<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> idea<00:01:08.940> really

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and so forth so you get the idea really

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600 
and so forth so you get the idea really
nice<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.290> also<00:01:10.410> tap<00:01:10.800> each<00:01:11.070> app<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
nice and you can also tap each app and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.630 
nice and you can also tap each app and
see<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.780> you've<00:01:12.990> used<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:14.130> amount<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.490> data

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
see when you've used the amount of data

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.420 
see when you've used the amount of data
you've<00:01:14.880> used<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.480> far<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.040> also<00:01:17.160> share

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
you've used so far you can also share

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.640 
you've used so far you can also share
with<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:17.730> friends<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.090> want<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.510> and<00:01:19.260> you

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
can also go to settings nothing really

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.000 
can also go to settings nothing really
to<00:01:22.050> configure<00:01:23.750> just<00:01:24.750> whether<00:01:25.440> you<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
also me a Navajo County also saw this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300 
also me a Navajo County also saw this
right<00:01:39.690> here<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:40.110> people<00:01:40.170> install<00:01:40.800> both<00:01:41.009> apps

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
right here my people install both apps

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.490 
right here my people install both apps
it<00:01:41.610> shows<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.450> much<00:01:42.660> you've<00:01:42.869> saved<00:01:43.200> using

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
it shows you how much you've saved using

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.200 
it shows you how much you've saved using
the<00:01:43.770> other<00:01:43.950> app<00:01:44.190> which<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.490> pretty<00:01:44.670> cool<00:01:44.880> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the other app which is pretty cool so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.749 
the other app which is pretty cool so
they're<00:01:45.479> kind<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:46.280> integrated<00:01:47.280> into<00:01:47.640> each

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
they're kind of integrated into each

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.660 
they're kind of integrated into each
other<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.570> we'll<00:01:48.660> go<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.869> report<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.680> far<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
other so we'll go to report so far and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.060 
other so we'll go to report so far and
for<00:01:51.119> November<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.660> can<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:51.960> how<00:01:52.050> you<00:01:52.320> save

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
for November you can see how you save

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.130 
for November you can see how you save
thirteen<00:01:53.820> point<00:01:54.090> six<00:01:54.270> five<00:01:54.540> megabytes<00:01:54.990> which

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
thirteen point six five megabytes which

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.280 
thirteen point six five megabytes which
is<00:01:55.290> actually<00:01:55.650> quite<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> bit<00:01:57.020> for<00:01:58.020> how<00:01:58.140> much

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
is actually quite a bit for how much

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.030 
is actually quite a bit for how much
data<00:01:58.530> use<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.300> actually<00:02:00.300> good<00:02:00.509> stay<00:02:00.750> here

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
data use that's actually good stay here

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.650 
data use that's actually good stay here
somewhere<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.180> go<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:03.360> session

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
somewhere so we can go to a session

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.260 
somewhere so we can go to a session
break<00:02:03.869> down<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.540> see<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.930> 17%<00:02:07.530> of

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
break down and you can see that 17% of

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.630 
break down and you can see that 17% of
all<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.690> data<00:02:09.899> I've<00:02:10.259> used<00:02:10.890> since<00:02:11.190> November

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
all the data I've used since November

second which is when I installed this
app<00:02:13.410> which<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.160> actually<00:02:14.459> pretty<00:02:14.640> good<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.910> mean

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
app which is actually pretty good I mean

being on a limited data plan this is

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.630 
being on a limited data plan this is
really<00:02:18.660> nice<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.070> haven't<00:02:20.370> really<00:02:20.610> noticed

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
really nice and I haven't really noticed

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.229 
really nice and I haven't really noticed
any<00:02:21.090> significant<00:02:22.430> download<00:02:23.430> speed<00:02:23.760> decrease

any significant download speed decrease
but<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.500> have<00:02:25.769> heard<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.630> download<00:02:27.630> speeds<00:02:27.930> or

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
but I have heard that download speeds or

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.720 
but I have heard that download speeds or
download<00:02:28.410> tests<00:02:28.860> are<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> little<00:02:29.190> bit<00:02:29.400> slower

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
download tests are a little bit slower

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.800 
download tests are a little bit slower
on<00:02:29.850> those<00:02:30.090> not<00:02:30.299> sure<00:02:30.540> if<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:33.330> will<00:02:33.450> see<00:02:33.660> any
