a need for speed I was in charge of

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.919 
a need for speed I was in charge of

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.570 
speed undercover one of the challenges
this<00:00:22.509> year<00:00:22.570> was<00:00:22.960> creating<00:00:23.650> an<00:00:23.769> action<00:00:24.160> title

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
this year was creating an action title

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.279 
this year was creating an action title
that<00:00:25.060> was<00:00:25.179> very<00:00:25.419> accessible<00:00:25.960> with<00:00:26.199> the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
that was very accessible with the

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.349 
that was very accessible with the
physics<00:00:26.679> we<00:00:27.490> wanted<00:00:27.759> to<00:00:27.820> create<00:00:27.939> a<00:00:28.089> whole

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
physics we wanted to create a whole

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.839 
physics we wanted to create a whole
bunch<00:00:28.390> of<00:00:28.689> crazy<00:00:28.960> cool<00:00:29.289> maneuvers<00:00:29.740> that<00:00:30.429> you

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
bunch of crazy cool maneuvers that you

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.760 
bunch of crazy cool maneuvers that you
know<00:00:31.150> with<00:00:31.300> essentially<00:00:31.900> a<00:00:31.929> flick<00:00:32.560> of<00:00:32.590> the

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
know with essentially a flick of the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.180 
know with essentially a flick of the
button<00:00:33.400> or<00:00:33.640> a<00:00:33.670> flick<00:00:34.180> of<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.360> stick<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.890> place

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
button or a flick of the stick in place

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.389 
button or a flick of the stick in place
into<00:00:36.699> the<00:00:36.789> hands<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:38.050> user<00:00:38.260> you<00:00:39.039> know<00:00:39.160> a<00:00:39.190> very

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
into the hands the user you know a very

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.349 
into the hands the user you know a very
enjoyable<00:00:39.640> easy<00:00:40.410> experience<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.850> this<00:00:43.149> year

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
enjoyable easy experience so this year

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.750 
enjoyable easy experience so this year
we<00:00:43.809> started<00:00:44.050> off<00:00:44.199> with<00:00:44.320> a<00:00:44.379> simple<00:00:44.559> burnout<00:00:45.039> so

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
we started off with a simple burnout so

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.369 
we started off with a simple burnout so
essentially<00:00:46.359> you're<00:00:46.510> just<00:00:46.539> holding<00:00:46.809> both<00:00:47.170> the

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
essentially you're just holding both the

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.740 
essentially you're just holding both the
LTR<00:00:48.039> two<00:00:48.190> triggers<00:00:48.550> down<00:00:48.730> it's<00:00:49.329> cool<00:00:49.510> enough

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
LTR two triggers down it's cool enough

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.020 
LTR two triggers down it's cool enough
those<00:00:49.960> tires<00:00:50.260> getting<00:00:50.590> smoked

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
those tires getting smoked

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.660 
those tires getting smoked
the<00:00:52.120> defenders<00:00:52.990> there<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:54.250> all<00:00:54.370> I'm<00:00:54.520> gonna

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
the defenders there then all I'm gonna

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.160 
the defenders there then all I'm gonna
do<00:00:54.880> here<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:55.240> just<00:00:55.450> like<00:00:55.540> when<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:55.960> brakes

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
do here is just like when the brakes

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.200 
do here is just like when the brakes
hold<00:00:56.470> the<00:00:56.590> throttle<00:00:56.739> down<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.430> we're<00:00:57.640> off

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
hold the throttle down and we're off

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.720 
hold the throttle down and we're off
that<00:00:58.870> essentially<00:00:59.530> started<00:01:00.070> okay<00:01:00.250> that<00:01:00.640> was

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
that essentially started okay that was

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.979 
that essentially started okay that was
pretty<00:01:00.910> generic<00:01:01.059> where<00:01:01.570> can<00:01:01.720> we<00:01:01.780> go<00:01:01.900> from

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
pretty generic where can we go from

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:02.460 
pretty generic where can we go from
there

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
there

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.650 
there
to<00:01:02.739> accept<00:01:02.980> you<00:01:03.280> know<00:01:03.400> start<00:01:03.700> with<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.910> 360<00:01:04.479> so

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
to accept you know start with the 360 so

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.420 
to accept you know start with the 360 so
do<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:04.930> same<00:01:05.080> thing<00:01:05.410> we<00:01:05.860> release<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.190> brake

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
do the same thing we release the brake

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.010 
do the same thing we release the brake
and<00:01:06.580> pull<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.940> steering<00:01:07.210> all<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.570> way<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.750> one

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
and pull the steering all the way to one

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.800 
and pull the steering all the way to one
way<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:09.190> was<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.610> car<00:01:09.790> into<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.030> beautiful

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
way that was the car into a beautiful

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.070 
way that was the car into a beautiful

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
360 in the car you see all that

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.970 
360 in the car you see all that
realistic<00:01:18.940> suspension<00:01:19.540> has<00:01:19.900> no<00:01:20.610> quality

realistic suspension has no quality
physics<00:01:23.940> is<00:01:24.090> all<00:01:24.240> doing<00:01:24.510> it<00:01:24.660> naturally

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140

we<00:01:27.180> went<00:01:27.510> basically<00:01:28.410> from<00:01:29.040> forty<00:01:29.820> attributes

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
we went basically from forty attributes

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.200 
we went basically from forty attributes
say<00:01:31.020> six<00:01:31.470> seven<00:01:31.740> years<00:01:31.890> ago<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.970> four

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
say six seven years ago to up to four

say six seven years ago to up to four
hundred<00:01:33.240> everything's<00:01:34.020> based<00:01:34.260> on<00:01:34.440> curves

speed<00:01:35.960> we<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.080> tune<00:01:37.320> essentially<00:01:37.860> every

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
speed we can tune essentially every

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.390 
speed we can tune essentially every
parameter<00:01:38.760> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> car<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.040> got<00:01:41.190> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
parameter of the car so then we got the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.610 
parameter of the car so then we got the
got<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:42.990> brakes<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:43.380> with

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
got the you know the brakes down with

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.100 
got the you know the brakes down with
360<00:01:44.370> so<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.300> said<00:01:45.480> why<00:01:45.720> can't<00:01:45.900> we<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.080> a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
360 so then we said why can't we do a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.980 
360 so then we said why can't we do a
180<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.710> essentially<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> flick<00:01:47.550> of<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
180 so essentially with a flick of the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.600 
180 so essentially with a flick of the
ebrake<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.470> flick<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.830> steering<00:01:50.130> we're

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
ebrake and a flick of the steering we're

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.410 
ebrake and a flick of the steering we're
into<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.910> 180

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
into a 180

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.810 
into a 180
let's<00:01:52.170> leave<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.650> camera<00:01:52.980> stationary<00:01:53.580> there

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
let's leave the camera stationary there

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.820 
let's leave the camera stationary there
and<00:01:54.060> all<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.870> have<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.050> do<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.380> camera<00:01:55.800> is

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
and all we have to do now the camera is

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.370 
and all we have to do now the camera is
perfect<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:57.030> reverse<00:01:57.300> driving<00:01:57.570> camera

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
perfect for reverse driving camera

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.230 
perfect for reverse driving camera
rotates<00:01:58.770> around<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.400> now<00:01:59.760> we're<00:01:59.940> reverse

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
rotates around and now we're reverse

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.450 
rotates around and now we're reverse
driving<00:02:00.480> so<00:02:01.230> it's<00:02:01.500> very<00:02:01.680> touchy<00:02:02.010> as<00:02:02.220> in<00:02:02.310> real

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
driving so it's very touchy as in real

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.490 
driving so it's very touchy as in real
life<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.930> sensitive<00:02:04.290> for

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
life you have to be really sensitive for

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.920 
life you have to be really sensitive for
the<00:02:04.590> stick<00:02:04.830> little<00:02:05.310> taps<00:02:05.640> will<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.690> now

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the stick little taps will do but now

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.420 
the stick little taps will do but now
we're<00:02:07.230> actually<00:02:07.350> driving<00:02:07.650> reverse<00:02:08.190> something

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
we're actually driving reverse something

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.580 
we're actually driving reverse something
we've<00:02:08.640> never<00:02:08.850> ever<00:02:09.480> had<00:02:09.780> before<00:02:09.960> in<00:02:10.200> any<00:02:10.350> need

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
we've never ever had before in any need

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.640 
we've never ever had before in any need
for<00:02:10.619> speed<00:02:11.010> and<00:02:12.000> essentially<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.500> get<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
for speed and essentially you get a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.560 
for speed and essentially you get a
totally<00:02:14.040> different<00:02:14.310> perspective<00:02:14.490> looking<00:02:15.480> at

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
totally different perspective looking at

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.260 
totally different perspective looking at
the<00:02:15.630> front<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.960> car<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.200> out

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
the front of the car and out

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.910 
the front of the car and out
so<00:02:17.840> now<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:17.990> we<00:02:18.140> have<00:02:18.230> reversed<00:02:18.560> driving<00:02:18.860> we

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
so now that we have reversed driving we

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.910 
so now that we have reversed driving we
said<00:02:19.070> okay<00:02:19.250> very<00:02:19.550> cool<00:02:19.790> let's<00:02:20.510> do<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:21.590> we<00:02:21.650> do<00:02:21.770> J

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
said okay very cool let's do can we do J

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.890 
said okay very cool let's do can we do J
turns<00:02:22.160> for<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.490> flick<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.910> switch<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.780> all

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
turns for the flick of a switch so all

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.080 
turns for the flick of a switch so all
we<00:02:24.020> do<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.290> flick<00:02:24.620> boom<00:02:25.280> or<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.790> other<00:02:25.910> way

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
we do is flick boom or the other way

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.900 
we do is flick boom or the other way
let's<00:02:26.660> see<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.110> combine<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.310> let's<00:02:28.460> go<00:02:28.610> into

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
let's see that combine so let's go into

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.800 
let's see that combine so let's go into
a<00:02:28.940> j-turn<00:02:29.830> goes<00:02:30.830> into<00:02:31.130> reverse<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:32.510> like<00:02:32.690> of

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
a j-turn goes into reverse it's like of

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.880 
a j-turn goes into reverse it's like of
a<00:02:32.870> switch<00:02:34.780> or<00:02:35.780> back<00:02:35.960> going<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> other<00:02:36.620> way

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
a switch or back going the other way

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.180 
a switch or back going the other way
put<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.820> J<00:02:37.970> turn<00:02:38.180> there<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:39.350> we<00:02:39.500> said<00:02:39.650> okay<00:02:39.890> all

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
put the J turn there so we said okay all

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.700 
put the J turn there so we said okay all
all<00:02:40.520> that's<00:02:40.700> separating<00:02:40.850> now<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.630> do<00:02:41.750> 360s<00:02:42.410> is

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
all that's separating now to do 360s is

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.800 
all that's separating now to do 360s is
just<00:02:42.890> doing<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.160> faster<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:44.450> let's<00:02:44.690> get

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
just doing that faster so let's get

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.630 
just doing that faster so let's get
gathered<00:02:45.290> some<00:02:45.440> speed<00:02:45.680> here

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.020 

so<00:02:50.570> there's<00:02:50.780> one<00:02:51.680> there<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.100> nice<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.850> it's

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
so there's one there so nice and it's

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.420 
so there's one there so nice and it's
sharp<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.510> crisp<00:02:53.780> let's<00:02:54.230> do<00:02:54.380> one<00:02:54.530> more<00:02:54.560> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
sharp and crisp let's do one more to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.400 
sharp and crisp let's do one more to
show<00:02:55.460> it<00:02:55.790> shows<00:02:56.000> an<00:02:56.150> eye<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.900> one<00:02:57.080> wasn't<00:02:57.380> a

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
show it shows an eye that one wasn't a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.730 
show it shows an eye that one wasn't a
fluke<00:02:58.450> it's<00:02:59.450> as<00:02:59.600> simple<00:03:02.110> they're<00:03:03.110> nice<00:03:03.710> and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
fluke it's as simple they're nice and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.690 
fluke it's as simple they're nice and
reactive

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
reactive

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.520 
reactive
just<00:03:05.000> showing<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.360> how<00:03:05.390> flicks<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.410> the

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
just showing you how flicks of the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.710 
just showing you how flicks of the
switch<00:03:06.800> flicks<00:03:07.370> are<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.550> controls<00:03:07.940> allow<00:03:08.660> you

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
switch flicks are the controls allow you

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.260 
switch flicks are the controls allow you
just<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:09.110> dance<00:03:09.380> around<00:03:09.650> finish<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.220> car<00:03:10.430> I'm

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
just to dance around finish the car I'm

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.180 
just to dance around finish the car I'm
going<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.600> show<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:11.840> now<00:03:12.170> how<00:03:12.530> that's

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
going to show you now how that's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.330 
going to show you now how that's
possible<00:03:13.610> if<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.840> pretty<00:03:15.740> much<00:03:15.860> spin<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.190> car

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
possible if you pretty much spin the car

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.700 
possible if you pretty much spin the car
around<00:03:16.610> in<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:16.880> light<00:03:17.260> first<00:03:18.260> time<00:03:18.440> again

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710

everywhere you're able to see the side
of<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.450> car<00:03:20.660> completely<00:03:21.460> you'll<00:03:22.460> notice<00:03:22.760> the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
of the car completely you'll notice the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.750 
of the car completely you'll notice the
fenders<00:03:23.300> here<00:03:23.710> how<00:03:24.710> much<00:03:25.310> suspension

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
fenders here how much suspension

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.010

movement<00:03:26.060> there<00:03:26.210> is<00:03:26.240> effect<00:03:26.660> in<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.840> car

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
movement there is effect in the car

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.050 
movement there is effect in the car
that's<00:03:27.830> all<00:03:28.040> happening<00:03:28.310> naturally<00:03:28.640> that's

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
that's all happening naturally that's

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
gonna keep the drift going so there you

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.050 
gonna keep the drift going so there you
go<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:23.990> saw<00:04:24.380> Jeff<00:04:25.220> right<00:04:25.400> into<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.669> corner

go you saw Jeff right into that corner
let's<00:04:26.660> get<00:04:26.810> some<00:04:26.960> speed<00:04:27.080> here<00:04:27.470> again<00:04:27.910> that's

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
let's get some speed here again that's

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.930
