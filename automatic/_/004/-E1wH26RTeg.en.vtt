00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.070
 hello all guys be of the 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.559
 latest staff undermined there and I 'm here 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.900
 with a super scott bild a score 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.529
 builder with three teams of the year three 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.800
 toti players and lots of quality 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.200
 we go immediately with the porter here you have 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:35.630
 two choices or put salvatore sirigu 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.440
 promise goalkeeper here it is iker 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.410
 casillas 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.240
 I sincerely preferred the savior 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.400
 sirigu which is in my opinion 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.890
 so far the goalkeeper of the game 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.290
 really all parades of all 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.310
 really strong colors really strong 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.250
 tall is perfect as a right back 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:58.040
 let's go to league in france 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.739
 we can put van der veer gregory 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.510
 van der wiel Dutch right-back of the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.390
 paris saint germain other normal of 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.939
 great work fast enough player 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.619
 good statistics 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.499
 then we go with the first team of the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.439
 year thiago silva totti 

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:19.340
 the defender to me stronger than what in 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.679
 absolute 86 of defense speed 95 89 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.939
 of normal high physique of works thing 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:27.560
 more important 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:30.499
 this player is great guys me 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.420
 takes all away all assholes 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:34.789
 fast team attackers 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.749
 really there are teams fast 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:41.920
 opponents really too strong 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:41.920
 second central defender 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.899
 let's go to liga pp via 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.520
 sergio ramos toti talks according to toti 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.229
 of the team he is the only one against maybe 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.680
 warcraft but it's so fast 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.810
 so physical that with an acceleration vi 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.250
 return immediately you return to 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.060
 really position the player 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.520
 fantastic 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.530
 as you see here first state owner 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.780
 found in a truly player pack 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.280
 wonderful left if you free from 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.950
 via you can choose between against marcelo 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.959
 jordi alba I would say to put marcelo 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.209
 which I liked more than all three 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.090
 81 speed of physical 79 which is a lot 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.860
 important even if it is fast and has a 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.410
 good dribbling this player there 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.269
 manages to counter attackers well 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.030
 adversaries in particular loyal than later 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.400
 we are not very say very physical of 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.739
 usually we go with the midfield the 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.739
 the first center that is central to me 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.170
 smart tweetie of paris st germain ha 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.040
 he also warcraft high one 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.780
 we can say that it is a kind of occult director 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.790
 because it doesn't look like it is very good 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.519
 passing statistics is good 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.450
 defend apple with good speed and 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.810
 even if bassino takes several 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.590
 several high balls so that's okay 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:10.209
 according to ccc we always put in 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.750
 binds the liga bbva and here not not in 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.880
 bundesliga 2 ccc talks we sin tones 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.010
 kroos nif I didn't want to take the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.180
 pressure toti 5 stars weak foot 89 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.630
 in passing these are the characteristics 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.920
 most important a wonderful player 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.780
 wonderful makes you passages of 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.120
 fantastic launches and it is very important 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.190
 in this team maybe the most player 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.040
 important because the one who succeeds in 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.320
 trigger with the triangle then with i 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.299
 filtering passages the two wings that are 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.340
 then the devastation of this team 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.720
 how we change championships in fact 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.470
 this is a scoop builder with three 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.989
 championships 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.970
 let's go here we'll put cesc fabregas 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.370
 chelsea spanish 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.190
 other work by now is fantastic too 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.030
 he 88 passing through so here you have 88 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.190
 and 89 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.170
 he is a wonderful player for me one 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.819
 of the stronger cc after he put gas 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.060
 for me the strongest of all that goes to 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.340
 make strong links with him diego costa 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.459
 strong league perfect link with diego 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.100
 he also costs Spanish to chelsea 82 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.570
 glossy 83 of physique shooting 88 for me is 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.850
 strongest attacker I have 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.070
 just tried the strongest striker 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.510
 had tried along with benzema really 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.400
 very strong, maybe even a little bit 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.380
 in dribbling, however, to four stars 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.640
 weak foot has a good speed that 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.360
 looks super 82 a super player 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:39.020
 then we conclude the team to the right 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.580
 you already understand lucas a very good one 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.740
 player also four stars 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.320
 triple possibility well I have to say that gives 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.180
 even a good hand in defense is a lot 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:52.370
 fast though defense 44 though 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.010
 you know that it helps a little but then we have to 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.190
 go for it and take him the 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.280
 strongest player in the fifa story 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.919
 cristiano ronaldo toki 99 overall of 98 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.220
 speed 99 withdrawal and 90 passing through 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.710
 99 dribbling from 89 to 5-star physique 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.340
 possibility 4 weak foot a player 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.280
 phenomenal guys it was a dream 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.340
 try it is the strongest player that 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.979
 has ever tried is perfect 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.020
 according to me it actually makes better by 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.360
 central tip rentals but in this one 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.860
 team obviously is better as as 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.640
 we must also give a center of understanding 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:35.750
 rightly guys if you give him some 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:40.280
 space he will not not fail you 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.050
 never triple crazy pulls from 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.940
 out of the crazy bombs you saw 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.160
 several clips in my review that I in 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.650
 meanwhile, I invite you to see 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.300
 and I have to say that for me more player 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.530
 strong that I have ever felt then the 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.510
 team is this 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.880
 for me it is the team more 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.190
 strong that I have ever tried above all 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.110
 this year, in my opinion , what is the 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.150
 strongest team 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.130
 let me know with the link in foot and 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.780
 in the comments let me know if this 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.940
 I obviously like the team there 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.390
 advice if you have all these money if 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.100
 you don't have them 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.770
 you can also try it to do with the 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.840
 versions and nif but still a lady 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.790
 team perhaps the strongest team of the 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.960
 game we'll see you in the next video 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.960
 beautiful to all from well
