00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 after the dunedin 0 2 here we are 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.730
 in the beginning from 7 minutes when brown 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.660
 accounts find the way of the goal but the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.030
 linesman shows the referee the best 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.130
 French too little that there was one 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.890
 offside position probably of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.960
 two players from Graziani and Pruzzo 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.410
 that they were offside 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.849
 in the previous action here we are at 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.340
 moment perhaps the only real moment 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.349
 difficult short Doric big danger 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 the action is born on the right where it is well 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.059
 not making this cross missed by 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.340
 two second-min players peaking from 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.110
 good location 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.450
 and here we are at the corner kick 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.090
 beaten by brown accounts he gets up very well 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.440
 pruzzo di testa in the center of the area 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.969
 small and runs unpretentiously on the net is 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.120
 the one to zero with which the Rome begins the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.430
 rapprochement march to cancel 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.250
 the liabilities of 0 2 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.519
 here is the joy of pruzzo that launched by 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.340
 hundredth goal scored in the league it was 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.290
 repeated to truly amazing levels 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.100
 in and cup perhaps its most beautiful 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.240
 international match 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.409
 here we are on the second goal still beautiful 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.259
 the control of pruzzo 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.150
 the action comes from bartolomei the long one 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.360
 launch and for maldera that spins of 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.280
 head serves in the middle pruzzo very good 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.470
 in the air among the adversaries a 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.290
 check the chest ball if it does 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.170
 slip and then find the low shot 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.450
 angled beating the Scottish goalkeeper 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.770
 beautiful action rule of the third goal is 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.640
 of graziani the postponement to accounts with 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.860
 who made himself who served pruzzo landed 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.619
 from the goalkeeper mcalpine and down penalty 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.440
 that of bartolomei transforms for the 3 to 0 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.780
 and at this point the Rome 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.420
 it is an advantage over Scottish education 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.760
 dundee united is at this point must 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.320
 administer her the advantage after you 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.390
 overturned the situation 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.110
 the last few minutes are full of pathos 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:14.270
 here is the tancredi goalkeeper who stops 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:17.180
 one of the rare attempts of the dandi is thus 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.510
 brown counts that steals the ball with a 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.550
 arm with the hand marks the fourth goal 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.060
 in short, the game opens and closes 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.860
 with two goals from bruno accounts coming 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.870
 canceled and after this is the whistle 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.210
 conclusive and here we hear the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.010
 interviews conducted by colleagues 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.910
 popular in the locker rooms with the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.910
 protagonists of the game 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.740
 maybe what happened is nils lydon 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.090
 he had always imagined a final 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.730
 at the Olympic on May 30th 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.860
 rome liverpool but we bet 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.270
 much about champion cup this year 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.040
 certainly because 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.890
 very important to represent well 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.230
 Italy and of great prestige it is 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.930
 for the company of the city of Rome 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.370
 feel mister she knows too well 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.910
 I ask the liverpool even has 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.420
 already something in mind to beat these 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.690
 terrible English or a little bit this 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.690
 done
