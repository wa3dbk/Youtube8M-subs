we've already discussed the epidermis

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.690 
we've already discussed the epidermis
which<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.790> as<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:37.680> look<00:01:37.979> at<00:01:38.189> the

will supply nutrients to the epidermis

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.850 
will supply nutrients to the epidermis
and<00:04:26.770> dermis<00:04:27.330> it's<00:04:28.330> especially<00:04:29.170> important<00:04:29.830> to

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
and dermis it's especially important to

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.400 
and dermis it's especially important to
the<00:04:30.040> epidermis<00:04:30.730> because<00:04:31.480> all<00:04:31.720> epidermal

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
the epidermis because all epidermal

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.590 
the epidermis because all epidermal
tissue<00:04:32.590> is<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.040> vascular<00:04:33.760> so<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.180> is<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.450> only

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
tissue is a vascular so this is the only

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.500 
tissue is a vascular so this is the only
way<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:35.110> they<00:04:35.290> can<00:04:35.350> get<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.950> nutrients<00:04:36.730> that

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
way that they can get the nutrients that

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.380 
way that they can get the nutrients that
they<00:04:37.750> need<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:41.620> larger<00:04:42.310> vessels<00:04:42.760> are<00:04:43.000> along

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
they need the larger vessels are along

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.740 
they need the larger vessels are along
the<00:04:43.770> particular<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.310> subcutaneous<00:04:45.850> border

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
the particular and subcutaneous border

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.510 
the particular and subcutaneous border
and<00:04:46.900> then<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.170> have<00:04:47.380> smaller<00:04:47.890> vessels

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
and then you have smaller vessels

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.850 
and then you have smaller vessels
projecting<00:04:49.150> in<00:04:49.330> from<00:04:49.600> that<00:04:49.780> into<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.410> dermis

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
projecting in from that into the dermis

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.180 
projecting in from that into the dermis
and<00:04:51.070> dermal<00:04:51.490> papillae<00:04:52.440> these<00:04:53.440> play<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.740> very

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
and dermal papillae these play a very

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.160 
and dermal papillae these play a very

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
deeper structures this is occurring when

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.480 
deeper structures this is occurring when
you<00:05:15.790> are<00:05:15.940> trying<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.510> conserve<00:05:17.110> heat<00:05:17.830> which<00:05:18.310> is

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
you are trying to conserve heat which is

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.510 
you are trying to conserve heat which is
why<00:05:18.670> you<00:05:18.730> look<00:05:19.180> pale<00:05:19.480> in<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:21.010> cold

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
why you look pale in the cold

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.520 
why you look pale in the cold
then<00:05:22.120> there's<00:05:22.330> vasodilation<00:05:23.200> and

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
then there's vasodilation and

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.770 
then there's vasodilation and
vasodilation<00:05:24.460> that's<00:05:25.330> where<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.570> blood

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
vasodilation that's where the blood

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.560 
vasodilation that's where the blood
vessel<00:05:26.140> diameter<00:05:26.290> increases<00:05:27.000> it<00:05:28.000> shunts<00:05:28.450> the

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
vessel diameter increases it shunts the

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.900 
vessel diameter increases it shunts the
blood<00:05:28.810> close<00:05:29.170> to<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.530> body<00:05:29.710> surface<00:05:30.040> it

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
blood close to the body surface it

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.750 
blood close to the body surface it
occurs<00:05:31.630> when<00:05:32.140> we<00:05:32.380> are<00:05:32.530> needing<00:05:32.950> to<00:05:32.980> lose<00:05:33.370> heat

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
occurs when we are needing to lose heat

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.750 
occurs when we are needing to lose heat
which<00:05:34.030> is<00:05:34.240> why<00:05:34.420> we<00:05:34.810> appear<00:05:35.410> flushed<00:05:35.830> during

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
which is why we appear flushed during

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.480 
which is why we appear flushed during
exercise
