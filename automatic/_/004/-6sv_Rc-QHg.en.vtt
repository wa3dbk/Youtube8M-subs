00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.790
 dear friends today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.710
 now we will show you show and 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 tell you why the registrar 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.660
 datakam video recorder g5 series catches 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.269
 best of all other registrars 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.609
 we have gathered for you here 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.050
 models that we have at all we 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.670
 we investigate all models we buy all 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.619
 competitors model we are looking at 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 technologies we study then do some 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.990
 the conclusions and we all managed to compare with 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.820
 models 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.160
 that is, here we have collected for you the main 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.309
 models they are all good for you 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.930
 familiar that is, let's start for example with 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.790
 this case she will open it very 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.610
 Already pre- cogs removed to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.590
 do not pull your time and do not bother 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.620
 that's all we do is open here 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.140
 please open model number one 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:58.640
 here it is the antenna open model number 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:01.280
 two and number two so here we open 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.430
 the curve is so lacking 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.689
 but they just didnâ€™t remove 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.640
 pulled the antenna that is here the antenna 2 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.799
 devices I hope you can see well here 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.330
 also already prepared everything shot here too 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.490
 just remove the cap 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.390
 here's how you see please torrents a 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.140
 Now we look at the datakam recorder 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.270
 done as follows then why 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.970
 then I will give you because we are starting 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.220
 compare the size of the stone of the antenna itself 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.780
 stone is on the jargon pay attention 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.939
 15 millimeters respectively here too 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.110
 15 millimeters with this recorder 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.960
 stone size 18 millimeters 15 15 15 15 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.439
 18 17 we have here such an antenna 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.680
 such a measure of 25 to 25 millimeters 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.380
 there is 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.640
 overall antenna capacity significantly 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.050
 surpasses all these you specified 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.430
 Well, besides this, the most important is that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.020
 the difference exists we manufacturer 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.150
 we order at the same company already 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.620
 many years the company transistor taiwan 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.090
 she is the antenna supplier for 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.740
 Taiwanese high-speed trains and easier 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.600
 another here is state 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.870
 railway technology 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.120
 that is, this antenna worked for two years 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.850
 we use it no complaints 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.030
 she is not in size you see that she 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.640
 thus differs greatly arranged 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.520
 we have a microcosm battery here 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.380
 backup memory for storing logs that 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.810
 do we have in this antenna 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.030
 why is she so good so different 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.000
 here come compared comparative 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.010
 small we have first 99 channels 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.390
 on reception of course so many satellites still in 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.090
 the sky doesn't fly but however we have 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.489
 Be sure the antenna supports in advance 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.930
 principle, all existing standards 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.700
 now gps glonass 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.680
 japanese chinese peyton instead glonass 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.390
 And you can flash to include instead of our 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.400
 because our technology is 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.170
 we sold them for a penny to the Chinese 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.250
 now called before used here 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.030
 Japanese is supported 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.860
 q sss and here is already supported in advance 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.620
 future when will appear in europe 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.750
 Galileo's tint liza system 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.420
 not well, our antenna is ready 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.090
 I have long been able to take all 99 channels 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.860
 accept from other registrars at most 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.160
 even clever 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.350
 here are no more than 66 channels a trifle as it was 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.330
 nice besides that we have 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:41.430
 very good sensitivity 160 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:44.170
 decibel at the reception with us that we have 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.820
 datasheet if you watch a cold start 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.950
 with perfect datasheet this is indicated 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.960
 under ideal conditions cold start 35 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.070
 seconds warm start 34 seconds hot 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.510
 one is experimental data 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.690
 who make special boxing 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.310
 for measurement in life of course it will be 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.780
 more because the sky is not open everywhere 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.990
 signal all day and absolutely but 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:08.620
 almost such we have here applied 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:11.710
 technology and steel iz i fayt and 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.020
 still other different technologies for example 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.150
 one of them is remembered 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.220
 the position of the satellites you turn off 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.540
 logger sale algorithm and 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.250
 continues to calculate approximate 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.260
 trajectories you came to the car 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.760
 after 10 hours the recorder was turned on 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
 the antenna had already calculated a 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.220
 where the satellites will move 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.740
 and 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.080
 already in this 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.250
 in this in this sector will look 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.120
 satellites accordingly provide 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.680
 imagine a quick search 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.160
 here we support the standard 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.389
 data transfer me versions 301 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.210
 supported any update rate 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.910
 up to five times per second but it loads 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.800
 processor so we default to 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.190
 firmware set only twice in 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.319
 second you can put 5 1 second 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.500
 that he is here and the temperature regime from 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.410
 minus 40 to plus eighty and 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.729
 by humidity 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.220
 Sorry I do not remember what humidity is well 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:06.169
 any humidity withstands parameter 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.590
 the antenna allows you to measure the speed 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.029
 then 515 mexico meters per second that is 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.009
 it is well in the plane you will see a lot 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.229
 examples of aircraft our antenna catches everything 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.740
 fine and good any speed in 900 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.469
 km per hour 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.939
 1000 30 meters an hour everything catches amazingly 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.750
 same with height 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:25.320
 antenna capable 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.190
 to fix the height to 18 thousand meters 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.990
 same plane 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.140
 we have video examples you will see there 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.810
 10 and 12-15 thousand 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.990
 here accordingly this advantage 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.040
 the antennas are therefore on catches well therefore 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.690
 datakam recorder is better than its 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.280
 competitors in terms of accuracy 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.490
 positioning speeds and 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.980
 functionality 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.530
 and another important note, our only 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.330
 the antenna here is among the examples given 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.330
 supports glonass in general glonass 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.160
 practically no one supports 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.590
 The company that wrote that they have 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.260
 the recorder supports glonass but we 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.480
 salih sample bought tried to read 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.660
 data unfortunately data glonass 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.280
 glonass is quite apart about not with this int 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.440
 n and do not go out we will not call all 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.910
 the same company does not make sense well 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.550
 Do some companies go on tricks 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.600
 They write that there is glonass gps in fact 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.520
 there just as the DPS angle we are here in 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.890
 such good perfect products we 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.880
 offer you our dear viewers 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.880
 the buyer
