00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
it's real pretty green by having that
eight<00:02:06.929> millimeter<00:02:07.380> you're<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> still

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
eight millimeter you're going to still

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.249 
eight millimeter you're going to still
be<00:02:08.910> able<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.119> get<00:02:09.209> some<00:02:09.390> movement<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.869> tried<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
be able to get some movement I tried it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.960 
be able to get some movement I tried it
with<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.380> six<00:02:10.709> millimeter<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.550> was<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:11.850> a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
with a six millimeter and it was just a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.030 
with a six millimeter and it was just a
little<00:02:12.120> bit<00:02:12.360> too<00:02:12.540> close<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.110> too<00:02:13.170> tight<00:02:13.680> and

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
little bit too close and too tight and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.550 
little bit too close and too tight and
so<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.420> do<00:02:15.569> see<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.049> I<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.439> another

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so you do see that I do have another

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.830 
so you do see that I do have another
hole<00:02:16.799> on<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> other<00:02:17.040> side<00:02:17.370> which<00:02:18.120> i<00:02:18.330> also<00:02:18.510> have

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
hole on the other side which i also have

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.280

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.899 
with this
earring<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.069> really<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.579> all<00:02:20.879> that

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.699 
earring but it's really not all that
noticeable<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:21.840> I'm<00:02:21.989> just<00:02:22.230> going<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.469> leave<00:02:22.680> it

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
noticeable so I'm just going to leave it

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.830 
noticeable so I'm just going to leave it
when<00:02:23.430> you're<00:02:23.579> wearing<00:02:23.760> these<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.450> won't<00:02:24.629> see

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
when you're wearing these you won't see

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.349 
when you're wearing these you won't see
that<00:02:24.989> other<00:02:25.200> hole<00:02:25.469> so<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.819> addition<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.209> the

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
that other hole so in addition to the

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.720 
that other hole so in addition to the
neons<00:02:27.689> we<00:02:27.959> also<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.439> these<00:02:28.590> wonderful<00:02:28.920> like

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
neons we also have these wonderful like

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.270 
neons we also have these wonderful like
almost<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.329> marble<00:02:31.109> crackle<00:02:31.680> look<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.099> them

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
almost a marble crackle look to them

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.890 
almost a marble crackle look to them
where<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.549> see<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.909> veins<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.599> deeper

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
where you see the veins in the deeper

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.380 
where you see the veins in the deeper
color<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.980> back<00:02:35.189> side<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.819> much<00:02:36.060> darker

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
color so the back side is a much darker

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.759 
color so the back side is a much darker
color<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:38.329> then<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.510> top<00:02:39.810> side<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.439> lighter

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
color and then the top side is lighter

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.530 
color and then the top side is lighter
and<00:02:40.920> then<00:02:41.189> you<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.489> see<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.760> color<00:02:41.939> seeping

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
and then you can see the color seeping

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.270 
and then you can see the color seeping
through<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.049> these<00:02:43.170> really<00:02:43.530> have<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> very

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
through so these really have a very

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.059 
through so these really have a very
interesting<00:02:44.569> complex<00:02:45.569> look<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.109> them<00:02:46.260> they

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
interesting complex look to them they

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.009 
interesting complex look to them they
too<00:02:47.129> are<00:02:47.370> faceted<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.450> they'll<00:02:48.599> catch<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
too are faceted so they'll catch the

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.420 
too are faceted so they'll catch the
light<00:02:49.200> as<00:02:49.379> well<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:49.859> can<00:02:50.010> see<00:02:50.129> they<00:02:50.250> come

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
light as well and you can see they come

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.190
