00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
I feel the best when I am being a little

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.110 
I feel the best when I am being a little
bit<00:00:37.170> more<00:00:37.410> careful<00:00:38.340> about<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:38.610> I'm<00:00:38.730> eating

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
bit more careful about what I'm eating

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.549 
bit more careful about what I'm eating
honestly<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.690> haven't<00:00:39.870> even<00:00:40.020> weighed<00:00:40.350> myself

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
honestly I haven't even weighed myself

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.290 
honestly I haven't even weighed myself
since<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> first<00:00:41.370> time<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.030> weighed<00:00:42.270> myself

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
since the first time I weighed myself

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180 
since the first time I weighed myself
with<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> couple<00:00:43.050> weeks<00:00:43.379> ago<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.860> that's<00:00:44.010> just

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
with a couple weeks ago and that's just

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.619 
with a couple weeks ago and that's just
because<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.640> don't<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.239> wrapped<00:00:45.450> up

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
because I don't like to get wrapped up

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.880 
because I don't like to get wrapped up
in<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> numbers<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.800> many

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
in the numbers there are so many

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.910 
in the numbers there are so many
different<00:00:47.309> things<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.719> factors<00:00:49.620> when

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
different things that are factors when

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.889 
different things that are factors when
it<00:00:50.010> comes<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> weighing<00:00:50.520> yourself

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
it comes to weighing yourself

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.689 
it comes to weighing yourself
water-retention<00:00:51.899> fat<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.039> versus<00:00:53.460> muscle

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
water-retention fat and versus muscle

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.520 
water-retention fat and versus muscle
there's<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.270> many<00:00:54.360> things<00:00:54.600> when<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.930> comes<00:00:54.960> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
there's so many things when it comes to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.380
