00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.319
 the energy expended in the goal is where the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.330
 the square you spend is located 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.760
 less energy and is the only blow that does 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.530
 with the detran coup I spent a bit 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.090
 more energy is usually a blow 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.900
 that the characters in the consignment 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.760

 rounds saw the gameplay simple and 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.530
 and a little bit of an asset is not 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.810
 very short and that character for the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.670
 character changes the style of the blows 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.110
 the graphics are colored which draws 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.180
 always clean and beautiful

 sprinfield place the sound effects 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.959
 are that dubbing is done by the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.330
 original voice-overs in English and 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.700

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.230
 drawing and then will be released mode 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.480

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.840
 other secret characters in quotation marks 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.379

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.930
 lots of fight and urban plays magenta bomb 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.590
 the wing while and the itch against the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.349
 and Paraguayan macabre system 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.450
 the gaming community and was able to play 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.799
 Most reviews have less than six 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.049
 points of 10 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.390
 I particularly found it very good and neither 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.190
 very bad a medium game is one of those 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.049
 who amuses us an entire afternoon and 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.180
 then we forgot in the drawer 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.159
 if you played games so it's good at 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.040
 one afternoon and then you can forget the 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.930
 Forever comments and is always one of the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.180
 Funniest series for me this game 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.500
 can bring some of her mood 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.330
 I do not have much more to talk about 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.849
 game is really very simple maybe 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.819
 because of this people think it's bad 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.830
 note it was released in 2001 this year 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.930
 We already had Playstation 2 with 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.019
 beautiful and innovative graf 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.599
 I think that this game had come out in 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.280
 97 his memories would be the album 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.030
 remembers that the game fight form of the 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.489
 simpsons 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.540
 but as in 2001 and with only one game 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.550
 obsolete 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.740
