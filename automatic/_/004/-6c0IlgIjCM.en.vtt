deal<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:58.549> think

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
deal is but I think

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.389 
deal is but I think
I<00:02:02.509> think<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:04.109> audiences<00:02:04.920> getting<00:02:05.219> were

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
I think that audiences getting were

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.660 
I think that audiences getting were
pickier<00:02:05.939> than<00:02:05.999> usual<00:02:06.890> if<00:02:07.890> hasbro<00:02:08.429> made<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
pickier than usual if hasbro made a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.520 
pickier than usual if hasbro made a
perfect<00:02:09.239> transformer<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.140> didn't<00:02:10.410> need

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
perfect transformer that didn't need

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.400 
perfect transformer that didn't need
anything<00:02:10.970> then<00:02:11.970> need<00:02:12.510> much<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:13.049> don't<00:02:13.170> about

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
it so not much expected from the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.259 
it so not much expected from the
electronics<00:03:00.599> though<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:02.090> thought<00:03:03.090> the

electronics though but I thought the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.849 
electronics though but I thought the
figure<00:03:03.660> itself<00:03:03.870> was<00:03:04.230> gonna<00:03:04.410> be<00:03:04.500> like<00:03:04.530> trying

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
figure itself was gonna be like trying

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.680 
figure itself was gonna be like trying
but<00:03:05.160> just<00:03:05.370> like<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:06.230> leader<00:03:07.230> class<00:03:07.489> ultimate
