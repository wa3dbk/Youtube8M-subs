see if I can do this test I'm going to

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.620 
see if I can do this test I'm going to
put<00:01:01.269> a<00:01:01.300> little<00:01:01.539> bit<00:01:01.809> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.730> Weber<00:01:04.030> fire

starter<00:01:05.230> on<00:01:05.490> the<00:01:06.490> top<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:09.460> a<00:01:09.490> whole<00:01:09.820> lot

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
starter on the top not a whole lot

starter on the top not a whole lot
what<00:01:12.100> pellets<00:01:12.490> seem<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.390> be<00:01:13.510> hard<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.930> get

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
what pellets seem to be hard to get

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.250 
what pellets seem to be hard to get
started<00:01:15.180> I've<00:01:16.180> been<00:01:16.390> told<00:01:16.570> maybe<00:01:16.810> what<00:01:17.020> I<00:01:17.050> have

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
started I've been told maybe what I have

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.210 
started I've been told maybe what I have
to<00:01:17.410> do<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.740> stir<00:01:18.070> this<00:01:18.310> up<00:01:18.550> after<00:01:18.820> it's<00:01:19.150> burning

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
to do is stir this up after it's burning

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.700 
to do is stir this up after it's burning
so<00:01:21.220> that<00:01:21.370> it<00:01:21.490> mixes<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.290> burned<00:01:23.290> with<00:01:23.590> the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
so that it mixes the burned with the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.719 
so that it mixes the burned with the
unburned

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.830 

okay<00:01:28.729> I<00:01:28.759> think<00:01:29.119> that's<00:01:29.329> going<00:01:31.509> let's<00:01:32.509> start

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
okay I think that's going let's start

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.580 
okay I think that's going let's start
the<00:01:33.020> timer<00:01:33.259> before<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:34.009> gets<00:01:34.159> soaked<00:01:34.579> and

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
the timer before it gets soaked and

00:01:35.590 --> 00:02:26.120 
the timer before it gets soaked and
let's<00:01:36.590> see<00:01:36.770> where<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.070> goes

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.740 

this<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.090> six<00:02:27.510> minutes

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.720 

that's<00:02:31.260> starting<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.740> catch<00:02:32.040> even<00:02:32.490> though

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
that's starting to catch even though

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.710 
that's starting to catch even though
it's<00:02:32.880> getting<00:02:33.000> rained<00:02:33.420> on

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.010 

and<00:02:40.320> okay<00:02:40.590> we're<00:02:40.740> working<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.250> ten<00:02:41.550> minutes

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
and okay we're working on ten minutes

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.330 
and okay we're working on ten minutes
you<00:02:43.020> can<00:02:43.200> see<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.680> flames<00:02:43.950> are<00:02:44.190> coming

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
you can see that the flames are coming

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.270 
you can see that the flames are coming
in<00:02:44.610> through<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.970> jet<00:02:45.210> holes<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:46.190> wonder<00:02:47.190> if

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
in through the jet holes I wonder if

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.070 
in through the jet holes I wonder if
maybe<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.880> should<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.180> made<00:02:48.330> large<00:02:48.630> ones<00:02:48.930> on

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
maybe I should have made large ones on

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.020 
maybe I should have made large ones on
the<00:02:49.170> bottom<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.920> regular<00:02:50.310> small<00:02:50.610> ones<00:02:50.850> on

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
the bottom and the regular small ones on

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.640 
the bottom and the regular small ones on
top<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:52.820> did<00:02:53.820> mix<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.210> up<00:02:54.450> once<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.500> was

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
top I did mix this up once that was

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.020 
top I did mix this up once that was
suggested<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.250> me<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:58.670> guess<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> flames

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
suggested to me that I guess the flames

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.790 
suggested to me that I guess the flames
up<00:03:00.210> a<00:03:00.270> hard<00:03:00.450> time<00:03:00.660> traveling<00:03:01.170> down<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.620> wood

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
up a hard time traveling down the wood

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.749 
cold out here I wasn't protecting the
stove<00:04:51.660> either<00:04:51.990> that's<00:04:52.289> exposed<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.639> it's

stove either that's exposed and it's
still<00:04:54.030> burning<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:54.900> don't<00:04:55.560> remember<00:04:55.770> this

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
still burning so I don't remember this

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.439 
still burning so I don't remember this
was<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.389> what<00:04:57.389> a<00:04:57.569> half<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.930> cup<00:04:58.139> of<00:04:58.410> wood<00:04:58.919> pellets

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
was a what a half a cup of wood pellets

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.290 
was a what a half a cup of wood pellets
about<00:05:00.449> 91<00:05:01.110> grams<00:05:01.639> 3.2<00:05:02.639> ounces

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
about 91 grams 3.2 ounces

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.570 
about 91 grams 3.2 ounces
I<00:05:05.240> had<00:05:06.240> my<00:05:06.740> clock<00:05:07.740> still<00:05:08.039> running<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.520> think

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
I had my clock still running I think

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.390 
I had my clock still running I think
this<00:05:08.940> would<00:05:09.120> still<00:05:09.360> go<00:05:09.539> on<00:05:09.690> for<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.380> couple<00:05:11.280> more

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
this would still go on for a couple more

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.540 
this would still go on for a couple more
minutes<00:05:12.470> just<00:05:13.470> mix<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:13.889> up<00:05:13.979> a<00:05:14.130> little<00:05:14.310> bit

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
minutes just mix it up a little bit

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.659 
minutes just mix it up a little bit
before<00:05:14.759> it<00:05:15.120> dies<00:05:15.330> down<00:05:16.310> that<00:05:17.310> was<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.460> good

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
before it dies down that was a good

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.899 
before it dies down that was a good
suggestion<00:05:18.150> by<00:05:18.479> a<00:05:18.509> couple<00:05:18.780> of<00:05:18.930> people<00:05:19.139> I<00:05:19.909> don't

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
suggestion by a couple of people I don't

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.580 
suggestion by a couple of people I don't
have<00:05:21.060> a<00:05:21.090> wood<00:05:21.360> stove<00:05:21.690> so<00:05:22.020> I<00:05:22.080> don't<00:05:22.289> know<00:05:22.440> about

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
have a wood stove so I don't know about

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.670 
have a wood stove so I don't know about
how<00:05:23.580> they<00:05:23.759> get<00:05:23.880> agitated<00:05:24.030> in<00:05:24.630> wood<00:05:24.840> stoves

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.330 

so<00:05:29.430> maybe<00:05:30.240> this<00:05:30.479> is<00:05:30.660> a<00:05:30.690> success<00:05:31.320> out<00:05:31.620> here<00:05:32.220> in

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
so maybe this is a success out here in

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.820 
so maybe this is a success out here in
the<00:05:32.430> cold<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.970> wet<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.630> it's<00:05:34.290> still<00:05:34.590> burning

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
the cold the wet and it's still burning

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:41.960 
the cold the wet and it's still burning
away<00:05:38.660> so<00:05:39.660> I<00:05:39.690> guess<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.110> next<00:05:40.320> test<00:05:40.789> will<00:05:41.789> be<00:05:41.940> a

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
away so I guess the next test will be a

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.120 
away so I guess the next test will be a
boil<00:05:42.300> test<00:05:42.680> that<00:05:43.680> cooked<00:05:44.669> some<00:05:45.000> spam<00:05:45.660> and<00:05:45.810> eggs

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
boil test that cooked some spam and eggs

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.159 
boil test that cooked some spam and eggs
