I'm<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> find<00:00:41.130> the<00:00:41.430> program<00:00:41.790> path<00:00:42.800> right

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
I'm going to find the program path right

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
I'm going to find the program path right
here<00:00:44.090> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.360> how<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.840> your

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.860 
of the time going to go to program files
86<00:00:54.260> it<00:00:55.260> was

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.430 

so<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.620> selected<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> click<00:01:03.270> Next<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
so now we selected it click Next and

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.899 
so now we selected it click Next and
then<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:05.190> choose<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.640> allow<00:01:05.880> the

then now I can choose to allow the

then now I can choose to allow the
connection<00:01:07.670> allow<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.180> secure<00:01:10.190> or

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
connection allow it if it's secure or

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.570 
connection allow it if it's secure or
block<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> connection

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.420 

it's<00:01:16.970> going<00:01:17.150> to<00:01:17.210> choose<00:01:17.420> whether<00:01:18.220> applies<00:01:19.220> to

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
it's going to choose whether applies to

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.770 
it's going to choose whether applies to
different<00:01:20.470> maybe<00:01:22.420> connections<00:01:23.420> whether

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
different maybe connections whether

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.640 
different maybe connections whether
you're<00:01:24.020> at<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.640> public<00:01:25.640> place<00:01:25.790> like<00:01:26.060> starbucks

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
you're at a public place like starbucks

maybe<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:31.130> office<00:01:33.010> could<00:01:34.010> mix<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:34.850> then

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
maybe the office could mix and then

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.180 
maybe the office could mix and then
you're<00:01:35.780> going<00:01:35.870> to<00:01:35.930> name<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.200> that's<00:01:36.950> going<00:01:37.100> to
