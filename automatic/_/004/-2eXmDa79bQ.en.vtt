00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
currently in the progress of making a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.270 
currently in the progress of making a
range<00:03:17.849> forward<00:03:18.300> pure<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:19.650> reason<00:03:20.010> why<00:03:20.220> is

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
range forward pure the reason why is

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.699 
range forward pure the reason why is
because<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.970> can't<00:03:21.239> really<00:03:21.450> PK<00:03:21.900> anymore<00:03:22.380> on<00:03:22.530> my

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
because I can't really PK anymore on my

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.220 
because I can't really PK anymore on my

main drill dog Jewish combat level it

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.790

just<00:03:25.530> takes<00:03:25.769> too<00:03:26.099> long<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.400> find<00:03:26.849> any<00:03:27.120> fights

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
just takes too long to find any fights

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.380 
just takes too long to find any fights
and<00:03:28.800> that's<00:03:29.069> why<00:03:29.220> I'm<00:03:29.370> making<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.880> new<00:03:30.030> account

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390
