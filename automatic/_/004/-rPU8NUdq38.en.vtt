seven nine five loader for the Pasquale
look<00:00:06.930> at<00:00:07.080> some<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.470> linkages<00:00:07.980> here<00:00:08.250> first

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
look at some of the linkages here first

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:23.660 
look at some of the linkages here first
okay<00:00:19.850> and<00:00:20.850> where<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.119> attaches<00:00:22.369> it's<00:00:23.369> right

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
okay and where it attaches it's right

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.330 
okay and where it attaches it's right
down<00:00:23.910> here<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.720> axle<00:00:27.650> comes<00:00:28.650> down<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
down here on the axle comes down and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.800 
down here on the axle comes down and
it's<00:00:29.460> got<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.820> clamp<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.359> goes<00:00:30.510> around

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
it's got this clamp that goes around

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.209 
it's got this clamp that goes around
both<00:00:31.199> sides<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:32.329> if<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.719> come<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.219> see

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
both sides here if we come up here see

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.200 
both sides here if we come up here see
we've<00:00:35.370> got<00:00:35.579> these<00:00:35.790> two<00:00:36.110> sort<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.200> takeoffs

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
we've got these two sort of takeoffs

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.750 
we've got these two sort of takeoffs
it's<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.440> safety<00:00:40.440> feature<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.250> upper<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
it's a safety feature the upper one is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.680 
it's a safety feature the upper one is
hooked<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.469> right<00:00:43.469> here<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> kingpin<00:00:44.690> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
hooked up right here to the kingpin to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.470 
hooked up right here to the kingpin to
prevent<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.820> twisting<00:00:47.820> back<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.239> forth

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
prevent it to twisting back and forth

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.020 
prevent it to twisting back and forth
the<00:00:48.719> lower<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.260> looks<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> had<00:00:50.430> use<00:00:50.760> on

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the lower one looks like it had use on

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
the lower one looks like it had use on
it<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.480> previous<00:00:51.960> owner<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.379> haven't<00:00:52.890> used

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it from a previous owner I haven't used

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.310 
it from a previous owner I haven't used
it<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.460> don't<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> difference<00:00:55.140> is

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it I don't know what the difference is

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.439 
it I don't know what the difference is
between<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.949> two<00:00:56.300> when<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.570> back<00:00:57.780> here

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
between the two when we go back here

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.529 
between the two when we go back here
from<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.770> kingpin<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.160> we've<00:01:03.090> got<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
from the kingpin here we've got like a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.649 
from the kingpin here we've got like a
safety<00:01:04.909> adjustable<00:01:05.909> safety<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.600> goes<00:01:07.310> back

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
safety adjustable safety that goes back

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.070 
safety adjustable safety that goes back
and<00:01:09.950> attaches<00:01:10.950> back<00:01:11.130> there<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.869> think

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and attaches back there I just think

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.940 
and attaches back there I just think
that's<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.390> happen<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.600> rip<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that's so if I happen to rip the the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.370 
that's so if I happen to rip the the
loader<00:01:17.189> off<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.479> totally

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
loader off it's not going to totally

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
loader off it's not going to totally
buckle<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.890> come<00:01:20.159> up<00:01:20.340> it'll<00:01:20.640> it'll<00:01:21.390> catch<00:01:21.630> on

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
buckle and come up it'll it'll catch on

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.260 
buckle and come up it'll it'll catch on
that<00:01:22.939> let's<00:01:23.939> see<00:01:24.210> let's<00:01:25.070> do<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> hydraulics

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.420 

okay<00:01:30.299> from<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:32.360> hydraulic<00:01:33.360> control<00:01:33.840> here

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
okay from your hydraulic control here

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.090 
okay from your hydraulic control here
this<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.640> goes<00:01:36.060> back<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.570> services<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.710> PTO

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
this is goes back in services the PTO

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.340 
this is goes back in services the PTO
and<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.640> steering<00:01:38.909> from<00:01:39.329> there<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.170> you've

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and the steering from there but you've

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.069 
and the steering from there but you've
got<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.680> take<00:01:40.979> off<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.600> comes<00:01:42.869> around

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
got this take off here that comes around

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.300 
got this take off here that comes around
and<00:01:44.329> comes<00:01:45.329> up<00:01:45.630> into<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> control<00:01:46.470> over<00:01:47.159> on

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and comes up into the control over on

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.770 
and comes up into the control over on
this<00:01:48.060> side<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.600> control<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.290> loader<00:01:49.590> and

this side the control for the loader and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
this side the control for the loader and
then<00:01:51.780> your<00:01:51.930> return<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.070> which<00:01:53.310> goes

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
then your return is down here which goes

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.969 
then your return is down here which goes
back<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.850> their<00:01:54.180> reservoir<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.470> I'll<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.799> do

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
back to their reservoir and I'll just do

a little detail on this so you can see

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.010 
a little detail on this so you can see
how<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.020> manifold<00:01:58.710> goes<00:01:59.270> those<00:02:00.270> come<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.659> here

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
how the manifold goes those come up here

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.529 
how the manifold goes those come up here
get<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.890> manifold<00:02:04.430> in<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.729> middle<00:02:07.539> to

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
get the manifold in the middle to

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.250 
get the manifold in the middle to
control<00:02:09.020> lines<00:02:09.289> each<00:02:10.810> coming<00:02:11.810> down<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.170> the

Pistons and you've got them coming down

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:39.509 
Pistons and you've got them coming down
here<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:19.610> these<00:02:19.730> Pistons<00:02:20.360> oh<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:38.000> also<00:02:38.239> for

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
connecting to the frame there's also

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.930 
connecting to the frame there's also
this<00:02:41.959> piece<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.440> forgot<00:02:42.799> this<00:02:43.010> bottom<00:02:43.459> piece<00:02:43.670> on

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
this piece I forgot this bottom piece on

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.140 
this piece I forgot this bottom piece on
