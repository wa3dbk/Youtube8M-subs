August 1978 which is just about six
weeks<00:00:20.189> after<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.449> discovered<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.140> fact<00:00:22.380> that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
weeks after we discovered the fact that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.890 
weeks after we discovered the fact that
Pluto<00:00:22.859> has<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.100> satellite<00:00:23.670> once<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
Pluto has a satellite once you have a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
Pluto has a satellite once you have a
satellite<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.740> planet<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.340> determine

satellite for a planet you can determine

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.599 
satellite for a planet you can determine
how<00:00:26.970> heavy<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.590> it<00:00:28.590> turns<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:29.039> Quito<00:00:29.400> was

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
how heavy it is it turns out Quito was

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.550 
how heavy it is it turns out Quito was
very<00:00:29.939> much<00:00:30.119> smaller<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.779> lighter<00:00:30.840> late<00:00:31.349> than

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
very much smaller and lighter late than

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.120 
very much smaller and lighter late than
we<00:00:31.679> had<00:00:31.859> thought

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
we had thought

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.190 
we had thought
which<00:00:32.399> meant<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.090> pedal<00:00:33.420> has<00:00:33.600> no<00:00:33.809> influence

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
which meant the pedal has no influence

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.340 
which meant the pedal has no influence
no<00:00:35.120> appreciable<00:00:36.120> influence<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> motions

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
no appreciable influence on the motions

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650 
no appreciable influence on the motions
of<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> planets<00:00:37.620> Uranus<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.520> Neptune<00:00:38.660> at

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
of the planets Uranus and Neptune at

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.319 
of the planets Uranus and Neptune at
that<00:00:39.930> point<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.710> faced<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.579> hypothesis<00:00:42.300> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that point we faced a hypothesis that

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.900 
that point we faced a hypothesis that
this<00:00:42.750> means<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.469> at<00:00:44.399> least<00:00:44.550> one

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
this means that there is at least one

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.779 
this means that there is at least one
yet<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.960> discovered<00:00:46.379> planet<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.760> outer

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
yet to be discovered planet in the outer

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
yet to be discovered planet in the outer
reaches<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.629> solar<00:00:48.840> system<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.890> just

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
reaches of the solar system and just

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.000 
reaches of the solar system and just
naturally<00:00:51.059> led<00:00:51.270> directly<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.530> your

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
naturally led directly to you and your

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.619 
naturally led directly to you and your
interest<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.670> we're<00:00:53.850> doing<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.420> that's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
interest in what we're doing and that's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.260 
interest in what we're doing and that's
when<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.050> certainly<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.920> big<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:57.239> have

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
when you certainly this big you have

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.290 
when you certainly this big you have
been<00:00:57.719> postulated<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:59.190> existence<00:01:00.350> or<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
been postulated the existence or the

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.420 
been postulated the existence or the
appearance<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:04.460> some<00:01:05.460> Sun<00:01:05.790> sometimes<00:01:06.380> ago<00:01:07.430> of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
appearance in some Sun sometimes ago of

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.630 
appearance in some Sun sometimes ago of
a<00:01:09.330> celestial<00:01:10.229> body<00:01:10.500> which<00:01:10.950> you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
a celestial body which you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.120 
a celestial body which you
I<00:01:11.670> think<00:01:12.450> named<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.140> Big<00:01:13.350> Data<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:15.330> each<00:01:15.479> other

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
I think named in Big Data and each other

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.080 
I think named in Big Data and each other
which<00:01:17.130> may<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:18.890> collided<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.840> somehow

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
which may have collided with or somehow

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
which may have collided with or somehow
turned<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.659> their<00:01:24.869> side<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.229> Uranus

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
turned on and on their side but Uranus

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.240 
turned on and on their side but Uranus
and<00:01:26.250> Pluto<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.259> did<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> lot<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:29.040> than

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and Pluto and it did a lot more than

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.069 
and Pluto and it did a lot more than
that<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> matter<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.119> fact<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.659> paper

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that as a matter of fact on that paper

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
that as a matter of fact on that paper
we<00:01:31.320> hypothesized<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.820> intruder

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
we hypothesized that this intruder

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.319 
we hypothesized that this intruder
passed<00:01:33.630> very<00:01:33.869> close<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.350> Neptune<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
passed very close to Neptune that it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
passed very close to Neptune that it
dislodged<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.799> them<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.549> didn't

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
dislodged one of them what we didn't

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880 
dislodged one of them what we didn't
think<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.210> many<00:01:39.420> satellites<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.170> Neptune<00:01:40.590> one

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
think in many satellites in Neptune one

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.319 
think in many satellites in Neptune one
of<00:01:40.979> them<00:01:41.130> became<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> planet<00:01:41.909> Peter<00:01:42.119> we

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
of them became the planet Peter we

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.789 
of them became the planet Peter we
actually<00:01:42.780> think<00:01:42.960> blue<00:01:43.200> there<00:01:43.380> was<00:01:43.500> an<00:01:43.619> escape

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
actually think blue there was an escape

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.670 
actually think blue there was an escape
satellite<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.579> Neptune<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:45.780> will<00:01:45.990> also<00:01:46.409> take

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
satellite of Neptune this will also take

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.100 
satellite of Neptune this will also take
the<00:01:47.070> orbit<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.549> Titan<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> big<00:01:48.479> satellite<00:01:48.960> of

the orbit of Titan the big satellite of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.740 
the orbit of Titan the big satellite of
Neptune<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.740> refer<00:01:50.159> civ<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.180> take<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> little

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
Neptune and refer civ and take a little

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
Neptune and refer civ and take a little
bit<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> satellite<00:01:52.590> near<00:01:52.829> lead<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
bit of the satellite near lead and

bit of the satellite near lead and
extended<00:01:53.850> outwards<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.990> produce<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.590> of

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
extended outwards we can produce all of

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.800 
extended outwards we can produce all of
the<00:01:56.009> observed<00:01:56.430> aspects<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> satellite

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the observed aspects of the satellite

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.380

of<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> things<00:02:03.869> we<00:02:04.200> did<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.979> 1978<00:02:05.909> hand

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
of the things we did in 1978 hand

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.020 
of the things we did in 1978 hand
made<00:02:06.680> this<00:02:06.860> prediction<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.640> there<00:02:07.820> wasn't

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
in biblical time and that once you allow

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.670 
in biblical time and that once you allow
for<00:04:08.120> possession<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:08.930> would<00:04:09.050> be<00:04:09.200> around<00:04:09.440> into

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
for possession it would be around into

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.250 
for possession it would be around into
Libra<00:04:09.860> by<00:04:10.160> now<00:04:10.370> yeah<00:04:11.300> which<00:04:11.600> is<00:04:11.630> again

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
Libra by now yeah which is again

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.930 
Libra by now yeah which is again
approximately<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.460> area<00:04:13.490> that<00:04:13.790> we're

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
approximately the area that we're

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.390 
approximately the area that we're
looking<00:04:14.030> in
