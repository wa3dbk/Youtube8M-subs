00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.040
Draft is finished, so move on to ink work.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.180
CLIP STUDIO PAINT has pen tools with different drawing touches.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.040
You can customize them to create original pens.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.260
Hide the previous frames so that you can easily see the screen.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.800
Create ʺVector Layerʺ for ink.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.960
In this session, I will use ʺVector Layerʺ instead of ʺRaster Layer.ʺ

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.620
This layer has some unique features. I will explain them later.First, start to ink as always.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.160
I always use a pen tool ʺG-penʺ for finish drawing.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.260
It is nice like drawing with an analogue touch with a natural contrast by using ʺStarting and ending.ʺ

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.320
If you don't get enough contrast or want more meticulous touches, try ʺPen Pressure Settingsʺ from the ʺFileʺ menu.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.780
Check ʺAdjust by multiple strokeʺ and draw several lines on the canvas with some contrast.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.080
Brush touch will be adjusted according to the pen pressure for drawing the last time.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.340
Make another adjustment for drawing touch.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.080
With CLIP STUDIO PAINT, software automatically corrects line to be nice one.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.120
In tool property, there is an item ʺStabilization.ʺ

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.200
You can configure how much to be adjusted.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.760
Ink for the first frame is finished. 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.660
Keep up ink work for other frames.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.440
Open folder of the fifth frame and create ʺVector Layerʺ with the ʺLayerʺ palette.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.200
Draw line with the ʺPenʺ tool in the same way.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.620
Drawing touch is almost the same as ʺRaster Layer,ʺ

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.680
Choose the ʺPinch vector lineʺ tool from the ʺToolʺ palette.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.820
This tool enables to move lie drawn on vector layer.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.820
Even if line is deviated from draft, you can move and adjust it later on.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:26.660
In another way, you can adjust only line width without drawing it again by using the ʺCorrect line widthʺ tool.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.980
If drawing lines energetically, they may cross each other.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.400
In this case, there is a convenient feature for vector layer.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.640
Touch the protruded part with the eraser's sub tool ʺVectorʺ...

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.940
Only the protruded part will be erased.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.340
This tool is set to erase up to the point where lines are crossing all at once.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.300
It is interesting to use this kind of feature for someone who isn't good at drawing hair, arm, leg and long curve.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.140
Now, ink work is finished except for background of the third frame.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:26.000
Drawing touch as good as analogue tool and editing features with digital technology are what I like about CLIP STUDIO PAINT.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.640
We will proceed to painting character next time.
