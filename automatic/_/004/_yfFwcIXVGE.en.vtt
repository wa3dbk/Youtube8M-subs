00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.460
 the project arises from a process that 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.140
 we live the fondem in this transition 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.660
 between a program that we had before 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.099
 many small projects towards one that 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.140
 we have now that is the alliance for the 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.900
 inclusive economic development where 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.849
 we support projects that are long 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.430
 term and that we may have results 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.410
 important in terms of improving 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.810
 income and the quality of life of the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.239
 people the partnership for development 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.399
 inclusive economy is an initiative of 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.930
 fundemex born with the purpose of 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.300
 promote the economic development of 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.970
 Mexico and detonate the potential of 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.130
 marginalized communities the artisans is 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.500
 a typical case where during 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.350
 generations have been able to generate 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.370
 value but they have not been equally 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.620
 able to capture 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.780
 in Chiapas we identified our point 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.910
 starting a Mexican state where 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.559
 the indigenous population is one of the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.200
 most vulnerable social groups of 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.840
 world and it represents 26 percent of 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.360
 your society one of the most activities 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.240
 emblematic is the technique of weaving and 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.670
 embroidery is an ancestral heritage that 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.110
 receive women from very young 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.210
 the result is products that have 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.340
 access to the market and can generate 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.810
 wealth to improve their quality of life 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.810
 in a transcendent way 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.100
 I do calmly directed because 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.100
 they pay me 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.380
 for the development of capacities we have 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.850
 carried out productive workshops in 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.100
 those that have shared tools 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.440
 of administration and entrepreneurship 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.270
 of 200 artisans we have also 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.190
 established links with designers and 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.780
 buyers to influence the creation 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.910
 of products that respond to 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.100
 needs of the market and with 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.140
 development of the material bank is 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.380
 achieved sales of over 600 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.640
 kilograms of high quality yarn 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.270
 benefiting the artisans of 14 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.270
 communities 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.100
 sales were also higher than 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.680
 the 220 thousand pesos and 7 have been created 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.440
 savings banks benefiting 121 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.470
 people all in the first six months 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.440
 operation fundemex offers the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.640
 real possibility that a person 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.350
 participate in a project that is going to have 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.220
 results that is having an impact 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.020
 real in the community and where you can add 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.100
 value in a way that has to do 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.100
 with what he knows best 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.840
 the four cardinal points 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.890
 It represents 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.260
 of life that life is very beautiful 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.060
 then life enters allows us to do 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.060
 many things breathe 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.250
 and transmit the best to others 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.090
 the project was born as an initiative of 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.220
 fundemex with the support of the foundation 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.819
 Kellogg was the first financier to be 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.620
 added to the process and then added the 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.900
 National Mount of Mercy and 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.549
 later the adecco foundation 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.739
 on the other hand we have allies in the 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.510
 part of the operation that are tec 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.180
 monterrey with social excavators to 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.340
 CristÃ³bal de las Casas and locate artists 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.409
 with the whole design part and the 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.209
 foundation lion 13 with all the part of 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.209
 human development in savings banks 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.099
 of the results that we 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.190
 we pursue is the creation of companies 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.239
 in communities that are sustainable 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.860
 but if what we want is that the 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.349
 process be from the bases 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.000
 then that process is already taking place 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.980
 so that the first 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.560
 community companies 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.870
 and making businessmen available 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.940
 who want to be an investor or we are already 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.940
 200 we are walking 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.650
 in 5 years I imagine the artisans 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.350
 that doing direct communication 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.739
 between your clients and customers with 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.919
 artisans and selling have their 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.660
 business and sharing your 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:29.250
 knowledge and I also do not know 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.110
 learning new things in the solution 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.790
 of crafts and have the 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.130
 leadership 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.440
 the security is in linking how to be 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.300
 woman in community we are not thinking 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.830
 in the artisans as a group of 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.230
 people that we are 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.330
 helping but we are looking for the way 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.860
 from among all identify the 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.470
 needs and look for the best 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.830
 solutions so there really is a can 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.050
 It's not a quality job, it's not a 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.260
 work of the riva on the contrary there is a 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.900
 opportunity 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.810
 that companies interested in 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.630
 participate in this sector and we can 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.980
 generate value for themselves through 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.310
 the generation of value in those 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.310
 communities 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.440
 we all know that there is poverty and 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.720
 inequality in Mexico many times 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.540
 we want to do something but we do not know how 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.940
 at fundemex we work to generate this 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.380
 opportunity the opportunity to add 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.220
 efforts to generate results 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.050
 tangible and sustainable is a way 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.180
 innovative and strategic to bring the 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.810
 social responsibility at a much 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.010
 more transcendent creating new jobs 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.350
 investing in profitable companies that 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.700
 besides an excellent return they contribute 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.580
 social benefits to families 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.130
 Mexican alliance for development 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.620
 inclusive economic men and women 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.690
 who enthusiastically undertake talent and 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.010
 dedication doing business 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:56.450
 responsible looking for success and 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.450
 working together for a better life
