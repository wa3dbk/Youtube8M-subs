00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.810 
parting to the side and then you can
bring<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> hair<00:01:53.490> together<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> side<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
bring the hair together to the side so I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.280 
bring the hair together to the side so I
think<00:01:56.969> we'll<00:01:57.329> keep<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.049> little

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
think we'll keep it just a little

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
think we'll keep it just a little
off-center<00:01:58.530> we're<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.159> gonna<00:01:59.310> make<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> so

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
off-center we're not gonna make it so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.730 
off-center we're not gonna make it so
perfect<00:02:02.570> okay<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:04.049> our<00:02:04.229> main<00:02:04.469> parting

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.950 

and<00:02:10.740> then<00:02:11.190> we're<00:02:12.030> gonna<00:02:12.120> section<00:02:12.600> out<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
and then we're gonna section out the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.740 
and then we're gonna section out the
front<00:02:13.310> where<00:02:14.310> we'll<00:02:14.550> do<00:02:14.760> our<00:02:15.030> individual

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
front where we'll do our individual

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.000 
front where we'll do our individual
twists<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.780> we'll<00:02:21.960> just<00:02:22.140> section<00:02:22.620> out<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.770> nice

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
twists and we'll just section out a nice

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:31.730 
twists and we'll just section out a nice
V<00:02:27.710> section<00:02:28.710> in<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.950> front<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:30.480> again<00:02:30.870> we're

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
V section in the front and again we're

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:41.040 
V section in the front and again we're
going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.950> twist<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.490> out<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.780> way

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.600 

and<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.860> tuck<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.130> in

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.240 

so<00:02:47.210> where<00:02:47.690> would<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:47.990> begin<00:02:48.110> well<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:51.130> like<00:02:52.130> to

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.290 
start in the back and give it its
direction<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.460> hairstyle<00:02:59.060> if

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300

would have them to hold the head down
what<00:03:03.680> y'all<00:03:03.860> have<00:03:04.040> her<00:03:04.160> doing<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.700> minute

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
yourself then of course you would hold

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.460

generally if you're doing a style on

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.610 
generally if you're doing a style on
yourself<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.870> don't<00:03:15.020> want<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.290> look<00:03:15.410> in<00:03:15.530> the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
yourself you don't want to look in the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.030 
yourself you don't want to look in the
mirror<00:03:15.650> because<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.520> mirror<00:03:16.760> will<00:03:16.910> kind<00:03:17.180> of

throw you off because it gives you an
opposite<00:03:20.870> impression<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.680> what<00:03:21.830> you're<00:03:21.980> doing

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
so just it's all in the fingers and it's

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.130 
so just it's all in the fingers and it's
all<00:03:25.430> about<00:03:25.700> feeling<00:03:26.360> what<00:03:26.630> you're<00:03:26.780> gonna<00:03:26.930> do

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.140 
okay that's our first section we're
gonna<00:03:31.820> do<00:03:32.060> a<00:03:32.950> relatively<00:03:33.950> thin<00:03:34.340> section<00:03:34.970> but

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
gonna do a relatively thin section but

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.720 
gonna do a relatively thin section but
we're<00:03:35.270> going<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.450> keep<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.050> twist<00:03:36.260> loose<00:03:36.730> so

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
we're going to keep the twist loose so

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.040 
we're going to keep the twist loose so
they'll<00:03:37.940> be<00:03:38.150> soft<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.720> they'll<00:03:38.840> have<00:03:38.990> a

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
they'll be soft and they'll have a

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.089 
they'll be soft and they'll have a
little<00:03:39.350> volume<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.950> them

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.069 

and<00:03:46.640> this<00:03:46.819> is<00:03:46.999> where<00:03:47.209> your<00:03:47.359> clips<00:03:47.629> come<00:03:47.930> in

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
and this is where your clips come in

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.259 
and this is where your clips come in
handy<00:03:48.560> because<00:03:49.129> they<00:03:49.310> hold<00:03:49.579> hair<00:03:49.969> out<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.150> the

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
handy because they hold hair out of the

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.449 
handy because they hold hair out of the
way<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:51.139> nice<00:03:51.319> thing<00:03:51.590> with<00:03:51.739> naturally<00:03:52.370> in

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
way the nice thing with naturally in

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.369 
way the nice thing with naturally in
most<00:03:52.670> cases<00:03:52.909> unless<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:53.510> hear<00:03:53.689> is<00:03:53.780> softer<00:03:54.349> or

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
most cases unless you hear is softer or

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.309 
most cases unless you hear is softer or
straighter<00:03:55.189> and<00:03:55.489> doesn't<00:03:56.359> stay<00:03:56.540> in<00:03:56.569> place<00:03:56.930> is

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
straighter and doesn't stay in place is

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.009 
straighter and doesn't stay in place is
that<00:03:57.499> you<00:03:57.590> can<00:03:57.739> pretty<00:03:57.859> much<00:03:57.980> comb<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:59.019> and

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
that you can pretty much comb it and

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.410 
that you can pretty much comb it and
it'll<00:04:00.379> stay<00:04:00.590> there<00:04:00.859> okay<00:04:01.849> now<00:04:02.120> we've

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
it'll stay there okay now we've

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.410 
it'll stay there okay now we've
sectioned<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.019> hair<00:04:03.519> we've<00:04:04.519> combed<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.329> in

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
sectioned the hair we've combed it in

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.300 
sectioned the hair we've combed it in
the<00:04:05.540> direction<00:04:05.840> that<00:04:06.019> we<00:04:06.230> want<00:04:06.379> the<00:04:06.620> style<00:04:06.889> to

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
the direction that we want the style to

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.599 
the direction that we want the style to
ultimately<00:04:08.239> finish<00:04:08.750> in<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.139> we've<00:04:09.950> potted<00:04:10.459> it

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
ultimately finish in and we've potted it

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.720
