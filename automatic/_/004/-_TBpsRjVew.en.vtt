00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.060
 hello friends, I'm going to go liner 1987 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.220
 today's video will be about animal abuse 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.059
 I will talk about this topic very seriously 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.039
 I'm going to talk about the mistreatment of dogs and cats, the species that are 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.460
 danger of extinction bullfights and so on 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.570
 I'll start talking about the man's best friend, I mean Peter 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.000
 pet that most people have in their home is a faithful friend the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.109
 guardian of your home 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.949
 playful and very cute 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.020
 dogs must have families with a very big heart since 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.560
 they need care and all our love 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.020
 but there are people who only have it to mistreat it hit them abruptly 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.510
 make them any kind of torture that comes to mind 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.020
 not only dogs 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.980
 they also mistreat cats 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.200
 these people do not know what they do not think 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.560
 dogs and cats feel pain just as we are hungry just like 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.550
 we ep letters just like us and have the same feelings that 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.650
 we 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.700
 those who mistreat animals 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.340
 they think it's fun but it's not like that 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.260
 are also those dog fights the owners trained them to be 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.430
 make stronger the training of the dog is painful the fist just what 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.070
 used to earn money later when the dog is badly injured what 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.070
 leave 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.850
 If you want to earn money look for a decent job and do not put these 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.800
 animals 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.330
 once a teacher from my school was talking about this topic and the words that 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.930
 he moved us all the students 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.260
 I remember that day as if it were yesterday the teacher told us 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.930
 I do not simply understand humans 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.210
 superior beings are said to be an outstanding race to all others 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.310
 species 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.310
 but explain me why get to such a degree of stupidity 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.510
 the animals, no matter how animal they are, do that or if they do it is because their 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.830
 instinct needs it and by response to the medium 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.620
 but humans lack that and it's where I live that modern man 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.190
 lost all relationship with nature and was fired from her forever 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.810
 those words touched my heart and I found him right 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.679
 and that phrase I will remember forever 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.699
 Well now let's go to the bullfights 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.060
 the bullfights is a spectacle 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.159
 where there is a bull and a bullfighter 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.029
 in the show always dies the bull make him run like a fool 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:24.239
 poor animal they make him suffer by burying the banderillas by the head until 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.179
 the bull falls to the ground and dies 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.509
 what I do not understand is why so many people go to see this what they call it 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:33.109
 show sure he likes to see how the bull suffers 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.239
 we should try to dominate the beasts that we all carry inside and not 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.239
 walk applauding bloody acts like this 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.349
 the bullfighter for killing this animal give him a lot of money 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.530
 and so they earn their living killing hundreds of bulls instead of going out to the 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.049
 street to look for work 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.489
 the bullfighters are those cowardly and ignorant people 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.269
 who have not yet assimilated the idea that animals like men 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.029
 they also feel pain 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.980
 the hour is coming when more and more people are opening their eyes 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.909
 for the first time and see what they have never seen before 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.939
 not bullfighting 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.939
 now let's talk about endangered species 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.689
 because they are becoming extinct 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.689
 human beings are becoming extinct for us 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.719
 many people kill animals with beautiful skins like the leopard for 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:22.929
 then take them off and sell them 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:27.859
 many famous people models and so on use these animal skins 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.699
 that have ever had life but they do not care as they do 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.589
 anything to look good 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:37.400
 there are also people who go hunting because they think it's a sport 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.599
 I believed that a sport was all that was played with a ball where you have 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.199
 to run 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.609
 think et cetera 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.289
 but I never thought it was a sport to go with a shotgun in the woods 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:49.079
 killing meaningless animals 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.929
 just to win a silly prize and a trophy 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:56.259
 I've seen on TV several programs that fight to save the animals 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.689
 teaching programs 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.459
 while in other programs they are just hiking in the jungle 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.249
 stepping on the property of several wild animals 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:06.849
 for that reason there are no accidents and deaths 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.849
 Wild animals do not like being disturbed 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:14.609
 It's like a stranger goes to your house and starts to bother you out 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.939
 photos etc and you what are you doing 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:19.389
 yes made to the stranger of your home 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.090
 but the wild animals to leave must attack and bite them because 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.770
 it's your animal instinct 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.849
 then kill the animal that attacked the person since always on a field trip 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.569
 in the jungle always carry a gun in case of emergency 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.710
 that way the animals are becoming extinct and in many other ways 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.780
 let's stop living these animals in peace 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.720
 all the animals of the world have the right to live as we do not 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.720
 they must suffer we must love them and give them all our affection 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.870
 always remember that animals should be taken care of 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.180
 perhaps in several more years they will disappear and there will be no return 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.199
 behind 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.169
 good friends 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.300
 thank you very much for watching the video 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.490
 that's what I think I hope you think the same 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.539
 Let's stop mistreating animals that are not to blame for anything 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:10.239
 I made this video so you can see that I am concerned about this topic and that I contribute 

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:12.319
 my little bit to society 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.960
 maybe I'll make another video in which I'll talk about our planet earth 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.409
 who also needs our help 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.680
 if I make the video leave the link in the description 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.960
 thank you very much for watching the video greetings and have a lot of luck 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.240
 1987 wishes you a good day your friend seven airliner 1987
