improved graphics and sound go factored

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.870 
improved graphics and sound go factored
into<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.340> gameplay<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:32.400> just<00:04:32.580> seemed<00:04:32.760> a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
into the gameplay it just seemed a

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.700 
into the gameplay it just seemed a
little<00:04:32.970> bit<00:04:33.180> awkward<00:04:33.419> with<00:04:33.900> Super<00:04:34.530> Mario

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
Brothers lost level but it seems to fit
