00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.340
 this file did 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.870
 ok now we go with iso file for 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.880
 open an iso file you need to have 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.200
 installed the damon tools program if not 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.450
 If you have the description of Montull 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.670

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.170
 program once we have installed 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.460
 we double- click left on the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.470
 iso file 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.970
 now we hope that the image will be assembled and 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.210
 as you see here a unit appears 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.770
 virtual then now we're going to team the 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.550
 unit that has been assembled we click 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.840
 right and we put open open when opening 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.550
 we have here the setup that is for 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.860
 install the race is I want it to be 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.240
 let's first install the game 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.240
 we double click left on the setup 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.480
 we give to next in brief we change the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.870
 an installation I'm going to install it 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.100
 here as you see I put next it puts that the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.040
 folder already exists because I installed it 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.290
 before that if the annex reads transient 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.330
 if we put next already your game is installed 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.330
 once installed we will copy the crack 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.230
 Now this seems to me because before 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.230
 had installed here we will omit 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.550
 that happens to me because when I install a test or 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.740
 game and it was to the crack vale we appear 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.410
 this to install the live you do not have 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.090
 and microsoft visual install is all but 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.560
 traveled from other games but if 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.140
 you put finish or games had to go 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.630
 same be visited games previously 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.640
 ok we give to finish vale and now we are going to 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.320
 the draw ski folder we open it and 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.620
 everything inside we click 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.790
 right we can copy and we are going now to 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.820
 where does it install now we go when 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.650
 disks installed in computer files 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.200
 x86 test 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.239
 we look for microsoft 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.489
 microsoft studios we open it and we have 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.870
 in state of decay lifeline the rector is 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.720
 another game I had that has nothing 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.879
 what to see now let's lifeline open and 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.519
 out here we click right and 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.390
 we put paste and we make this 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.670
 action for the next four 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.960
 conflicts without copying replace 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.630
 continue 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.070
 and we have to be in the archives a 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.600
 replaced instead we have to change the 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.550
 language so that it's in Spanish we're going to 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.010
 put cider or point and no options 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.020
 configuration we open it 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.629
 when he puts 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.629
 linguist we change and we put country 

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:39.569
 and also 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.110
 OK 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.479
 and here the name of the player you can 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.160
 change and put your name once 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.710
 that is spanish we make file save 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.650
 will ask us to save this file what 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.380
 keep on the desktop save 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.870
 we close this 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.060
 already folder is that is modified that 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.980
 it's in Spanish we drag it 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.980
 where the other mother was and before 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.169
 continue to deploy it 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.660
 we think that it moves now as you see 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.020
 are located and when we open this already 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.389

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.930
 application if you see it does not come out in the 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.660
 desk this we do right click 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.130
 send to write shortcut if you 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.310

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.410

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.139
 state of the kite caliber objects 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.520
 clown or altitude decay lifeline are 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.520
 all in Spanish and that's it 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.540
 to 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:59.839
