00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.819
 and it's time for a capsule of 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.719
 oxygen thanks to the ministry of tourism 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:14.090
 corsatur that happens to your skin when 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.920
 you burn in the sun you spend all day in 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.960
 the sun and you forgot to put on protective 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.539
 solar now you're burned as a 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.339
 shrimp from reader's digest magazine 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.710
 we bring the things that happen to your skin 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.029
 when you neglect it in the sun first 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.880
 right after an exhibition 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.859
 prolonged to the sun is your skin with shades 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.989
 pink this is because their glasses 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.820
 blood vessels are dilated as a reaction 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.560
 to ultraviolet rays of type ve 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.050
 These rays are the main 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.450
 causing sunburn without 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.520
 however the real burned that appears 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.770
 then it is the product of another series of 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.840
 chemical reactions then what happens 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.160
 the cells of your skin react 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.040
 segregating chemicals that cause 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.380
 inflammation then in a span of 12 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.780
 hours these cells start to die and 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.000
 the inflammation becomes a tone 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.340
 dark red rays 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.020
 ultraviolet damage DNA one of the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.150
 conditions for the appearance of cancer 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.249
 of the skin but the cells try 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.470
 also to protect yourself that's why a 

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:10.970
 cell type 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.520
 melanocytes secrete the pigment 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.830
 protector that gives you a tan that you 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.020
 protects from ultraviolet rays but 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.540
 before you assume that a good 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.460
 tan protects you considers that 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.350
 both the burned and the tan are 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.710
 caused by the same rays 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.509
 ultraviolet so a tanned skin 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.000
 it also means that it is a damaged skin 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.220
 by the sun in conclusion the damage of the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.440
 ultraviolet rays of the sun increases the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.909
 risk of skin cancer so if 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.850
 you will spend a lot of time in the sun 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.820
 make sure to use skin protector 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.190
 exposed wearing a hat or cap and wearing 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.860
 sun glasses with protection to the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.869
 Ultraviolet rays take care of your skin and 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.910
 fully enjoy your outings of 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.070
 summer do not miss Monday through Friday 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.820
 oxygen capsules at this same time 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.140
