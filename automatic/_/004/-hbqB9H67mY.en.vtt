00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
strength 1000 the recipe says to use 10

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.299 
strength 1000 the recipe says to use 10
to<00:00:53.910> 12<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.660> 750<00:00:55.350> tablets<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.220> you

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
to 12 of the 750 tablets so if you

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
to 12 of the 750 tablets so if you
calculate<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.760> out<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.809> equivalent<00:00:58.379> to

about 8 to 9 of these tablets so I have

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.990 
about 8 to 9 of these tablets so I have
9<00:01:02.820> tablets<00:01:03.330> right<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:04.339> it<00:01:05.339> also<00:01:05.489> calls<00:01:05.850> for

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
9 tablets right here it also calls for

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.930 
9 tablets right here it also calls for
the<00:01:06.240> algae<00:01:06.690> thins<00:01:07.140> or<00:01:07.530> algae<00:01:08.010> wafers<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.820> it

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
the algae thins or algae wafers but it
