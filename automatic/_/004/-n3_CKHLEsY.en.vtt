Hi, my name is Justin Lauria, and today I'm
gonna help you figure out which stance you

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.950
are on a skateboard.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.629
A skater's stance indicates which position
the skater prefers standing on their skateboard,

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.680
and can be one of two options:

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.000
"Regular" footed skaters feel most comfortable
skating with their left foot in front,

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.620
and "goofy" footed skaters feel most comfortable
skating with their right foot in front.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.019
Skateboarding is different from most other
sports because you'll eventually learn how

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.360
to ride and do tricks in both stances. However,
when you're getting started, it'll most likely

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.570
be easier for you to choose one of the two
stances and stick with it for a while so your

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.710
body can get used to it.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.880
So, a good way to find out the best stance
to start out with is just to try them both

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.960
out, and see which one feels most comfortable
to you.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.780
If you've never ridden a skateboard before
and you have no idea which one to pick, you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.760
can try out this easy trick:

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.460
Put your board on the ground and stand a few
feet behind it with your shoulders and feet

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.829
square to the board. Then, simply jog up to
the board and hop on. Usually, this forces

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:11.170
you to subconsciously decide which foot to
put in front. Whichever stance you choose

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.310
will probably end up being a good stance for
you to start with.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.689
Now, keep in mind that there are really no rules
in skateboarding, so even if your main stance

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.689
is regular, feel free to ride goofy, or...whatever
this is.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.760
Just like in baseball, where batting in both
stances is called switch hitting, skating

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.700
in the opposite stance of your main stance
is called skating switch. So if your main

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.749
stance is goofy, every time you skate with
your left foot in front, that would be considered

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:42.350
your switch stance.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.660
