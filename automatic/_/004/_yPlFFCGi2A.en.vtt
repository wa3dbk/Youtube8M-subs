working the first thing that I came
across<00:00:07.990> when<00:00:08.530> you<00:00:08.679> design<00:00:08.950> something<00:00:08.980> like

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
across when you design something like

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.329 
across when you design something like
this<00:00:09.610> is<00:00:09.940> how<00:00:10.269> do<00:00:10.330> you<00:00:10.420> turn<00:00:10.599> it<00:00:10.660> on<00:00:10.900> and<00:00:11.339> first

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:12.339 
this is how do you turn it on and first

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:13.470 
this is how do you turn it on and first
thing<00:00:12.519> you<00:00:12.580> do<00:00:12.700> when<00:00:12.730> you<00:00:12.849> walk<00:00:13.089> up<00:00:13.269> to<00:00:13.419> your

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
car is unlock it so that's right base

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.460 
car is unlock it so that's right base
the<00:00:17.410> system<00:00:17.740> I'll<00:00:17.920> go<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:19.240> far<00:00:19.269> right<00:00:20.109> now<00:00:20.260> is
