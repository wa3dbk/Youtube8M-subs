00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
but the one thing that I think cognos

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.580 
but the one thing that I think cognos
really<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:54.300> needs<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> be

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
really really needs for it for it to be

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.080 
really really needs for it for it to be
a<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:55.829> successful<00:00:56.039> call<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.610> duty<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
a really successful call of duty is the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.450 
a really successful call of duty is the
fact<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.690> needs<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.219> nuclear-armed<00:00:59.219> oh<00:00:59.430> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
fact that it needs a nuclear-armed oh I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.889 
fact that it needs a nuclear-armed oh I

I think it's gonna add like a completely

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.280 
I think it's gonna add like a completely
different<00:01:24.000> atmosphere<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.930> kind<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.140> has

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
different atmosphere and it kind of has

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
different atmosphere and it kind of has
the<00:01:25.710> reaction<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.430> MOAB<00:01:26.670> boy<00:01:26.820> just

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the reaction of a MOAB boy just

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.940 
the reaction of a MOAB boy just
completely<00:01:27.600> lays<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> whole<00:01:28.560> map<00:01:28.740> it's

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
completely lays out the whole map it's

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.830 
completely lays out the whole map it's
just<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.280> an<00:01:29.369> atomic<00:01:29.610> bomb<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
just like an atomic bomb and you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.749 
just like an atomic bomb and you
completely<00:01:31.350> lays<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.009> out<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.610> an

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
completely lays it out it's just an

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.370 
completely lays it out it's just an
insane<00:01:33.240> thing<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.229> completely

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
insane thing like it completely

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990 
insane thing like it completely
reformats<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> whole<00:01:35.549> map<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
reformats the whole map it's like a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.490 
reformats the whole map it's like a
brand<00:01:36.360> new<00:01:36.450> map<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.840> guys<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.229> know<00:01:37.320> what's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
brand new map you guys don't know what's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.200 
brand new map you guys don't know what's
going<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.799> i<00:01:37.860> mean<00:01:38.100> i'm<00:01:38.400> sure<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> guys<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.119> be

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
going on i mean i'm sure you guys to be

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.999 
going on i mean i'm sure you guys to be
able<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.450> read<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.229> remember<00:01:40.770> everything

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
able to read it to remember everything

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.010 
able to read it to remember everything
like<00:01:41.400> kind<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> down<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.810> for

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
like kind of get it down just as it for

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.480 
like kind of get it down just as it for
it<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.680> were<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.950> different<00:01:44.340> map

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it as if it were to be a different map

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.789 
it as if it were to be a different map
so<00:01:44.790> i<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.360> also<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.439> they<00:01:46.590> were<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
so i do also think that if they were to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.530 
so i do also think that if they were to
get<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> mob<00:01:47.280> which<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.610> course<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.090> 25

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
get a mob which of course is a 25

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.660 
get a mob which of course is a 25
gunstreak<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.439> course<00:01:49.860> 24<00:01:50.250> when<00:01:50.430> using

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
gunstreak of course 24 when using

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.490 
gunstreak of course 24 when using
hardline<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.329> most<00:01:51.840> mods<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
hardline because most mods are going to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
hardline because most mods are going to
be<00:01:52.590> used<00:01:52.799> while<00:01:53.009> using<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.119> specialist

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
