00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.160
 yo everyone knows it's echo 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.840
 and today we find ourselves 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.250
 I was going to say for a boxing video 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.500
 but that's not it since I already have 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.540
 unpacked the game but I had you 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.860
 spoken in the sonic video for which 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.660
 I was going on vacation so I'm from 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.840
 return my vacation went well 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.340
 and thank you for those who are worried 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.960
 so here I have received the game we bring 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.660
 united states today in more cited 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.430
 delivered a beautiful art book in 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.710
 rigid paper that's the class of 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.690
 beautifully frankly it's a rpg 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.879
 So who came out in Asia in the end 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.180
 July came out on August 6 to the states 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.329
 United 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.040
 to the states so here it is I do not know 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.500
 if he was doing well yes dragon's crown 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.040
 so the dragon crown literally 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.450
 in French with six playable classes 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.980
 so I tried to make you a little 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.780
 the types I know how it 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.880
 pass if I have not launched game yet we are going 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.170
 well see how does it go so if I 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.670
 do this little video it's because 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.040
 maybe I can surely 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.640
 interest some and so there was 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.729
 the art book 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.210
 I wanted to show it a little bit 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.869
 beautiful artbook 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.750
 so here's the cover I see myself more 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.520
 okay 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.980
 and not inside it's frankly 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.810
 beautiful the illustrations are 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:28.190
 beautiful also here for example 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.320
 the first class so the warrior the 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.600
 fighter it's called exactly you 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.150
 also have a little bit of having 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.070
 all the moves are therefore the postures 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.560
 kind when you are at the noble and a 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.600
 notary should not pronounce the case 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.210
 sorry excuse me when you attack 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.830
 and it is frankly class the Amazon 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.350
 so a little bit the role of auber jules 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.160
 rigor I'm not really really 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.930
 fan for the shot yes it's good device 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.110
 you have his move 7 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.619
 so I think I'm not a fan of 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.899
 design 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.310
 so I would not have it in my team on 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.220
 douar on the other hand that I find style and 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.250
 So did the veiled really big 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.679
 big big wood with the same behind these 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.010
 moussette his attac postures of 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.690
 defense of state alteration so I 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.670
 think I 'll have 1 1 in my team I 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.560
 think I 'll have the fighter 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.720
 you saw at the beginning the third person 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.860
 that I will play because I believe 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.769
 we can have multiple supports 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.720
 allies that will be that one of course 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.660
 you doubt an archer who in addition 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.910
 elf so here is with are mus is 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.440
 apparently if it's the most 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.280
 complicated to play play so I'm going to be 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.610
 a little bit in the shit 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.120
 since it's going to be a bit tense I 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.150
 am to my friend the wizard 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:49.100
 that's the damage of the controls of 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.480
 spells etc are 9 7 and the sorcerer who 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.549
 is the earliest crowd checks 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.170
 we are a little slush of what I have 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.140
 read 1,2 in the papers because I 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.549
 not played yet we will see yes 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.910
 she is sexy i wanted the rope she 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.519
 had a lot sexier than the amazon at 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.570
 major of the group six months later 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.019
 you have some small illustrations 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.640
 nice on the other characters we're going 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.320
 to say that they are included in the game of 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.970
 pnj characters of the royal family 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.190
 you also have a little bestiary 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.790
 but frankly the cracks tonight 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.140
 its beautiful i have art book as 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.780
 I have different games 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.020
 already the paper quality is super rebel 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.750
 super good rather rock or saas and 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.750
 tear for example 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.370
 hop here it is a day that bosses 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.760
 will be able to see in the game so it's a 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.200
 rpg 2d that does is based on the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.810
 scrolling at the same time it's a little 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.310
 with bajaur beat them all that we'll see 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.660
 all this in the first episode not this 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.040
 I'm going to make Jean do it full 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.459
 episodes frankly it's games 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.530
 I think of the beautiful nasa die there 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.980
 who played it 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.630
 wada food all foods 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.760
 so here I think you make it 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.040
 several videos even really full 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.060
 to do a little adventure followed myself 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.400
 with my characters because this game I 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.080
 did it so did this game anyway 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.250
 is already something that surprised me was 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.730
 that he is in 1080p 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.350
 so I do not know if my hd pvr can 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.930
 capture the 1080p actually I've never 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.180
 watched but the game has a resolution 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.630
 native possible if you're plugged in 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.810
 hdmi and if your TV can go from 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.070
 1080p and the game is well done for 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.560
 1080p that's interesting 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.830
 you can play to to 4 players in 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.090
 local and two to four players we go in 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.930
 line necessarily you can play with 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.940
 three other people 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.229
 so that's not bad to have two kops 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.580
 everyone will take a character you are at 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.600
 4 characters on the screen here for after 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.550
 frankly I can not wait to go put it 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.419
 in my little ps3 to do the first 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.940
 episode see how it goes and then 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.610
 I think there are quite a few hours of 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.180
 game and I think I had read 40 50 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.860
 hours of play 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.150
 after I do not know if it's for a 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.729
 class if you show the different 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.410
 checkboxes since the comment dice 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.850
 skis the tree no trees of 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.190
 talents but the dice what he will learn 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.150
 to buy so it gets married according 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.440
 classes you said what he 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.570
 commits to all classes and skis 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.419
 specific to each class I do not know 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.320
 how it will go 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.610
 the universe is beautiful I looked 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.340
 some stream because the players 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.660
 japanese long since I believe it's 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.600
 July 27 something like that 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.640
 on August 6th he went out to the states so 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.110
 here I am importing them my first game 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.090
 imported from elsewhere the second it will be 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.180
 of victory history that will be directly 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.000
 imported from Japan this time 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.860
 fighting game between toriko ichigo hunter 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.629
 x hunter finally the bellic naruto 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.810
 orrico dragon ball that's it 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.729
 all the best in nîmes du shônen 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.430
 jump to make it a fighting game I 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.840
 think this will be my second import and 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.729
 Well, at the same time, it makes you feel 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.710
 little video like that for those who 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.069
 wanted to see a little the content is this 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.000
 who will go out in europe one day I believe 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:04.789
 if I say no bullshit he's 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.360
 expected then how long time I 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:10.039
 know nothing maybe in spring winter 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.319
 I do not know there was no date 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.639
 confirmed on it I thought 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.930
 if it is released in europe 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.599
 nothing says they would be translated 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.370
 French even if for example to hans 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.020
 fehr i'm going to look at a moment ago a 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.000
 video it was really in France is 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.650
 so at the limit if there are any who want 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.569
 pass on emulator to make them 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.009
 you can not logically you are 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.979
 supposed to own the original game I the 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:32.419
 remember but that's why not but at 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.490
 worse I thought if it was in 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.379
 English it's still in English good at least 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.120
 I would have seen it before so I'm not a 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.259
 crack in English but we'll see what we 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.370
 can do if I understand the story and 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.069
 then I hope you'll be there too 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.840
 to help me in the comments here 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:47.029
 I think I went around so 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.080
 now I'm going to put them the little 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:50.690
 cake in the box 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.520
 and then we will start for the beginning of 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.659
 ventured the 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.159
 I hope it's going to happen I hope 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.690
 that the elderly will take you 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.419
 please I would actually see with 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.830
 feeling when I will be sure about the game 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:03.080
 even though I already have my little idea 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.979

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.020
