 I'm eating this delicious flan of 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.950
 strawberry so I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.140
 elaborate 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:52.950
 The first thing we are going to do is put 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:56.550
 heat our milk are two cups 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.920
 let's add sugar is a cup 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.199
 sugar 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.199
 we are also going to add cinnamon 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.820
 and let's mix well 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.859
 I will also add the spoonful of 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.859
 vanilla 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.700
 and here we are going to leave until our 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.700
 milk starts to boil 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.540
 in two tablespoons of cold water we are going to 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.270
 put to hydrate 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.270
 a spoonful of grenetina 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.579
 let's mix it 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.820
 and we are going to reserve it 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.280
 while the grenetine is hydrated and 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.110
 our milk loose boil me here 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.560
 in a quarter cup of cold water 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.550
 I'm going to dissolve 5 tablespoons of starch 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.050
 strawberry flavor corn 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.400
 let's remove the cinnamon slices 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.400
 of our milk 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.990
 and I already took the microwave oven 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.990
 grenetina for a few seconds 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.200
 to dilute it 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.330

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.219

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.310

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.480
 and well the 5 tablespoons of starch is the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.710
 equivalent to the packet that we bought 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.630
