one day I saw this great stove pipe that
had<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> cutout<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.710> thought<00:00:31.980> Oh<00:00:32.160> put

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
had a cutout in it then I thought Oh put

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.590 
had a cutout in it then I thought Oh put
a<00:00:33.000> glass<00:00:33.300> insert<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.140> eyes<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.190> it'll<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.600> Ned

blue eyes peeking out Ned Kelly from his
mask<00:01:19.520> it's<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.700> small<00:01:21.090> piece<00:01:22.189> which<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.610> makes

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
mask it's a small piece which it makes

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.440 
mask it's a small piece which it makes
it<00:01:24.299> more<00:01:24.420> difficult<00:01:24.960> even<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.680> stencils

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
it more difficult even for the stencils

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.780 
it more difficult even for the stencils
the<00:01:27.450> intricacy<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.110> pouring<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.549> comes

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the intricacy of pouring it here comes

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
the intricacy of pouring it here comes
the<00:01:30.000> blue<00:01:30.210> powder<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> eyes<00:01:33.380> because

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the blue powder for the eyes because

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.780 
the blue powder for the eyes because
it's<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.710> smaller<00:01:35.040> piece<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.729> also<00:01:36.560> that

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
it's a smaller piece it's also that

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's a smaller piece it's also that
really<00:01:38.790> careful<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:40.140> lift<00:01:40.380> those<00:01:40.619> pieces<00:01:41.130> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
really careful to lift those pieces of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.219 
really careful to lift those pieces of
paper<00:01:41.520> out<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.299> don't<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.720> drop<00:01:42.960> all

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
paper out you don't want to drop all

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.690 
paper out you don't want to drop all
sorts<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.740> sand<00:01:44.100> back<00:01:44.490> into<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> mould<00:01:46.700> here

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
sorts of sand back into the mould here

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.920 
sorts of sand back into the mould here
I'm<00:01:47.820> placing<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.619> very<00:01:49.619> small<00:01:50.280> almost<00:01:50.939> crystal

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
I'm placing a very small almost crystal

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.069 
I'm placing a very small almost crystal
of<00:01:52.110> turquoise<00:01:52.649> within<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.610> blue<00:01:53.850> eye<00:01:54.240> shapes

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
of turquoise within the blue eye shapes

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:03.469 
of turquoise within the blue eye shapes
to<00:01:56.479> be<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.689> little<00:01:58.020> iris<00:01:59.060> highlight<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> eyes

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.550 

and<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.149> opposite<00:02:06.750> almost<00:02:07.380> of

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
and so this is the opposite almost of

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.169 
and so this is the opposite almost of
what<00:02:07.740> it'll<00:02:07.890> look<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.099> once<00:02:08.519> it's<00:02:08.729> poured

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
what it'll look like once it's poured

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.790 
what it'll look like once it's poured
and<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:09.660> molten<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.560> hot<00:02:12.349> you<00:02:13.349> can<00:02:13.530> barely

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
and all molten and hot you can barely

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.900 
and all molten and hot you can barely
see<00:02:14.160> little<00:02:14.519> turquoise<00:02:15.030> bits<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.459> trying<00:02:17.459> not

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
see little turquoise bits and trying not

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.420 
see little turquoise bits and trying not
to<00:02:17.970> shake<00:02:18.360> too<00:02:18.629> much<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:19.379> move<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.160> one

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
to shake too much to move that one

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.370 
to shake too much to move that one
little<00:02:20.970> piece<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.209> glass<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.959> not<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.110> lot<00:02:22.349> of

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
little piece of glass and not a lot of

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.449 
little piece of glass and not a lot of
sand<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.989> piece<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:29.010> before

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
sand so this is the piece just before

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.170 
sand so this is the piece just before
the<00:02:29.580> hot<00:02:29.790> glass<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.810> poured
