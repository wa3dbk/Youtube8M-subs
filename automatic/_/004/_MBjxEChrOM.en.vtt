it's important for these moments that
you<00:01:50.179> have<00:01:50.330> something<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.319> can<00:01:51.500> cast<00:01:51.789> so

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
you have something that you can cast so

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.080 
you have something that you can cast so
you<00:01:53.300> can<00:01:53.509> always<00:01:53.989> cast<00:01:54.380> either<00:01:54.920> light<00:01:55.550> tap<00:01:55.910> to

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
you can always cast either light tap to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.969 
you can always cast either light tap to
get<00:01:56.270> some<00:01:56.450> matter<00:01:56.690> back<00:01:56.989> so<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:57.830> don't

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
get some matter back so that you don't

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.290 
get some matter back so that you don't
have<00:01:58.069> to<00:01:58.190> do<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.429> later<00:01:58.580> in<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:58.910> fight<00:01:59.149> and

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
mana later on in the fight you can cast

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.930 
mana later on in the fight you can cast

now<00:02:27.860> there's<00:02:28.220> two<00:02:28.490> specs<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.240> use<00:02:29.480> as

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
now there's two specs you can use as

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.230 
now there's two specs you can use as
affliction<00:02:30.650> one<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.430> them<00:02:31.550> involves<00:02:31.820> using

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
affliction one of them involves using

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.030 
affliction one of them involves using
shadow<00:02:32.660> bolt<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:33.050> your<00:02:33.200> filler<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.920> other

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
shadow bolt is your filler and the other

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.530 
shadow bolt is your filler and the other
one<00:02:34.220> involves<00:02:34.550> using<00:02:34.700> drain<00:02:35.000> life<00:02:35.210> is<00:02:35.390> your

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
one involves using drain life is your

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.690 
one involves using drain life is your
filler<00:02:35.720> now<00:02:36.410> personally<00:02:36.770> I<00:02:37.040> use<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.490> shadow

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
filler now personally I use the shadow

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.910 
filler now personally I use the shadow
bolt<00:02:37.910> spec<00:02:38.300> because<00:02:38.840> an<00:02:39.050> equal<00:02:39.380> gear<00:02:39.590> does<00:02:39.890> a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
bolt spec because an equal gear does a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.610 
bolt spec because an equal gear does a
little<00:02:40.250> bit<00:02:40.430> more<00:02:40.550> damage<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.620> drain

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
little bit more damage and the drain

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.080 
little bit more damage and the drain
like<00:02:42.800> speck<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.340> actually<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.760> little<00:02:43.880> bit

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
like speck is actually a little bit

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.880 
like speck is actually a little bit
latency<00:02:44.570> dependent<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:45.320> if<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.530> don't<00:02:45.770> have

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
latency dependent so if you don't have

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.010 
latency dependent so if you don't have
very<00:02:46.040> good<00:02:46.130> latency<00:02:46.670> or<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:47.810> bad

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
very good latency or if you have bad

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.260 
very good latency or if you have bad
latency<00:02:48.500> rather<00:02:48.800> it's<00:02:49.340> not<00:02:49.640> it's<00:02:50.030> not<00:02:50.150> going

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
latency rather it's not it's not going

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.240 
latency rather it's not it's not going
to<00:02:50.360> work<00:02:50.450> out<00:02:50.630> very<00:02:50.780> well<00:02:50.900> for<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.290> but<00:02:52.040> in<00:02:52.130> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
to work out very well for you but in the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.560 
to work out very well for you but in the
end<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.430> just<00:02:52.460> comes<00:02:52.760> down<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.030> personal<00:02:53.330> taste

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
end it just comes down to personal taste

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.840 
end it just comes down to personal taste
and<00:02:54.110> I've<00:02:54.320> seen<00:02:54.500> warlocks<00:02:55.100> use<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.640> drain

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
and I've seen warlocks use the drain

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.180 
and I've seen warlocks use the drain
like<00:02:56.060> spec<00:02:56.360> successfully<00:02:56.960> so<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:57.710> just<00:02:57.800> use

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
like spec successfully so you just use

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.430 
like spec successfully so you just use
whatever<00:02:58.430> you're<00:02:58.640> most<00:02:58.730> comfortable<00:02:58.910> with

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
whatever you're most comfortable with

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.630 
whatever you're most comfortable with
this<00:03:00.440> is<00:03:00.620> suspect<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.160> currently<00:03:01.430> use

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
this is suspect that I currently use

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.970 
this is suspect that I currently use
however<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.600> do<00:03:02.720> know<00:03:02.900> some<00:03:03.380> other<00:03:03.470> very<00:03:03.800> good

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
however I do know some other very good

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.710 
however I do know some other very good
warlocks<00:03:04.340> they<00:03:04.550> use<00:03:04.700> variations<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.510> spec

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
warlocks they use variations of the spec

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.460 
warlocks they use variations of the spec
such<00:03:06.590> as<00:03:06.770> this<00:03:07.040> one<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.480> this<00:03:08.480> one<00:03:08.540> now

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
such as this one and this one now

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.950 
such as this one and this one now
personally<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.220> chose<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.850> spec<00:03:11.330> into<00:03:11.690> soul

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
personally I chose to spec into soul

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.470 
personally I chose to spec into soul
burn<00:03:12.170> seat<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.500> corruption<00:03:13.120> it's<00:03:14.120> very<00:03:14.330> useful

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
burn seat of corruption it's very useful

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.180 
burn seat of corruption it's very useful
it<00:03:14.930> will<00:03:14.990> help<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.260> out<00:03:15.290> in<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.530> lot<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.710> bosses

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
and the law situations but it's not a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.300 
and the law situations but it's not a
requirement<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.740> know<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:18.920> don't<00:03:19.070> actually

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
requirement you know you don't actually

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.030 
requirement you know you don't actually
need<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.080> on<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.320> other<00:03:21.380> hand<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.680> know<00:03:21.770> this

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
need it on the other hand you know this

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.590 
need it on the other hand you know this
effect<00:03:22.370> as<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:22.640> can<00:03:22.760> see<00:03:22.910> chose<00:03:23.210> to<00:03:23.390> get<00:03:23.570> a

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
effect as you can see chose to get a

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.840 
effect as you can see chose to get a
curse<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.230> exhaustion<00:03:24.680> instead<00:03:25.130> which<00:03:25.730> is

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
curse of exhaustion instead which is

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.660 
curse of exhaustion instead which is
also<00:03:26.030> very<00:03:26.270> useful<00:03:26.390> but<00:03:26.990> not<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.170> requirement

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
also very useful but not a requirement

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:35.950 
also very useful but not a requirement
this<00:03:28.670> other<00:03:28.820> spectators<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:35.570> just<00:03:35.780> need<00:03:35.870> to

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
this other spectators you just need to
