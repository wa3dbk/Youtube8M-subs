00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
constant of the excess so this is how

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.580 
constant of the excess so this is how
much<00:02:36.120> i'll<00:02:36.330> be<00:02:36.510> cutting<00:02:36.720> off<00:02:37.490> from<00:02:38.490> my<00:02:38.670> eyelash

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.600 

this<00:02:43.590> much<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.440> cover<00:02:46.740> your<00:02:46.950> eyelash<00:02:47.370> you

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
this much so to cover your eyelash you

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.490 
this much so to cover your eyelash you
need<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.060> start<00:02:48.450> from<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.470> back<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:51.290> not<00:02:52.290> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
need to start from the back and not the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.680 
need to start from the back and not the
front<00:02:52.800> because<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.430> far<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.970> shortest<00:02:54.420> i

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
front because the far is the shortest i

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.380 
front because the far is the shortest i
would<00:02:54.989> sit<00:02:55.530> around<00:02:55.830> here<00:02:56.190> while<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.090> back

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
would sit around here while the back

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.170 
would sit around here while the back
would<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.810> here<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.280> always<00:02:59.430> best<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.880> cut

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
would be here so it's always best to cut

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.930 
would be here so it's always best to cut
from<00:03:00.480> your<00:03:00.780> back<00:03:01.020> any<00:03:01.440> excess<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.370> always<00:03:02.730> cut

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
from your back any excess you always cut

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:11.010 
from your back any excess you always cut
from<00:03:03.150> your<00:03:03.300> back

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.380

just like easier to move around without
it<00:03:56.080> being<00:03:56.440> crazy<00:03:56.910> so<00:03:57.910> once<00:03:58.150> I've<00:03:58.300> applied<00:03:58.420> my

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
it being crazy so once I've applied my

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.680

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
how the first thing to do is always to

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.270 
how the first thing to do is always to
look<00:04:07.870> down<00:04:08.170> when<00:04:08.680> you're<00:04:08.860> applying<00:04:09.069> your

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
look down when you're applying your

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.270 
look down when you're applying your
eyelashes<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:10.420> way<00:04:10.630> it's<00:04:10.750> easier<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.290> apply

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
eyelashes that way it's easier to apply

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.250 
eyelashes that way it's easier to apply
them<00:04:12.640> so<00:04:13.510> I'm<00:04:13.570> just<00:04:13.780> going<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:14.019> take<00:04:14.200> my

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260

eyelash<00:04:14.830> and<00:04:15.419> what<00:04:16.419> I<00:04:16.450> do<00:04:16.570> is<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:16.870> just<00:04:16.930> firstly

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
eyelash and what I do is I just firstly

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:29.490

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.980 

now<00:04:30.100> once<00:04:30.370> it's<00:04:30.550> on<00:04:30.700> my<00:04:30.880> eyelid<00:04:31.330> I<00:04:31.510> start<00:04:31.900> with

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990

and<00:04:40.030> then<00:04:40.630> I'm<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.200> front

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:07.670 

and<00:04:58.520> then<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:59.060> go<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.630> middle

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.070 

well<00:05:08.400> I'll<00:05:08.550> play<00:05:08.729> my<00:05:08.940> lashes<00:05:09.210> I<00:05:09.449> always<00:05:09.780> tried

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:34.570 

so<00:05:18.720> it's<00:05:19.169> nice<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.470> secure<00:05:19.860> on<00:05:20.340> my<00:05:20.550> lash<00:05:20.759> line

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.820 

so<00:05:35.580> once<00:05:35.790> my<00:05:36.000> eyelashes<00:05:36.540> are<00:05:36.660> nice<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.260> secure

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.000 

I<00:05:51.910> don't<00:05:52.690> suppose<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:53.110> do<00:05:53.230> this<00:05:53.350> once<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.830> glue

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
I don't suppose to do this once the glue

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.640 
I don't suppose to do this once the glue
has<00:05:54.130> dried<00:05:54.780> so<00:05:55.780> you're<00:05:55.930> not<00:05:56.170> moving<00:05:56.530> your
