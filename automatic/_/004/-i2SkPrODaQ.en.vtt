00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
to the wall so you probably won't be

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.200 
to the wall so you probably won't be
able<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.369> yourself<00:01:32.729> most<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> time

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.300 

she<00:03:16.659> went<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.049> middle<00:03:17.319> summon<00:03:17.650> plumes<00:03:17.950> and

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
she went to the middle summon plumes and

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.149 
she went to the middle summon plumes and

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
now I'm doing this far and I actually

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.670

need to do my damage rotation a lot

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.699 
need to do my damage rotation a lot
because<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.159> bard<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.930> bard<00:03:25.930> is<00:03:26.230> going<00:03:26.590> to

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
because the bard that bard is going to

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.479 
because the bard that bard is going to
pull<00:03:26.859> a<00:03:26.890> girl<00:03:27.250> off<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.579> me<00:03:32.099> all<00:03:33.099> right<00:03:33.250> that's

better

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.330 
better
now<00:03:34.780> we<00:03:34.840> are<00:03:35.049> ignoring<00:03:35.319> the<00:03:35.590> plumes<00:03:35.889> because

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
now we are ignoring the plumes because

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.119 
now we are ignoring the plumes because
we<00:03:36.609> took<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:37.150> little<00:03:37.389> damage<00:03:37.989> in<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.590> rest<00:03:38.980> of

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
we took so little damage in the rest of

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.979 
we took so little damage in the rest of
the<00:03:39.189> phase<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:40.359> plumes<00:03:40.629> can't

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
the phase that the plumes can't

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.539 
the phase that the plumes can't
realistically<00:03:41.409> destroy<00:03:42.040> enough<00:03:42.219> so<00:03:42.340> then<00:03:42.459> you

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
realistically destroy enough so then you

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.240 
realistically destroy enough so then you
immediately<00:03:42.879> run<00:03:43.180> behind<00:03:43.599> this<00:03:43.840> plume

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
immediately run behind this plume

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.229 
immediately run behind this plume
running<00:03:45.250> behind<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.579> plumes<00:03:45.790> here<00:03:45.909> doesn't

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
running behind the plumes here doesn't

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.089 
running behind the plumes here doesn't
actually<00:03:46.359> reduce<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.870> damage<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.260> take<00:03:47.500> but

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
actually reduce the damage you take but

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.409 
actually reduce the damage you take but
this<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.519> position<00:03:48.700> you're<00:03:49.090> gonna<00:03:49.180> need

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
this is the position you're gonna need

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.229 
this is the position you're gonna need
to<00:03:49.569> pull<00:03:49.810> Garuda<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.349> after<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.129> face<00:03:51.340> yeah

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
right now like as the phase changes then

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.959 
right now like as the phase changes then
everybody<00:03:55.180> else<00:03:55.239> runs<00:03:55.629> over<00:03:55.870> there<00:03:56.169> I<00:03:56.969> tank

bring her like right to her to my left
is<00:07:01.849> where<00:07:02.000> I'm<00:07:02.089> gonna<00:07:02.180> run<00:07:02.479> Garuda<00:07:02.960> as<00:07:03.110> soon<00:07:03.289> as

00:07:03.429 --> 00:07:03.439 
is where I'm gonna run Garuda as soon as

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.909 
is where I'm gonna run Garuda as soon as
this<00:07:03.560> phase<00:07:03.770> is<00:07:03.949> over<00:07:05.469> so<00:07:06.469> I<00:07:06.500> run<00:07:06.710> through

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
this phase is over so I run through

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:10.219 
this phase is over so I run through
slipstream

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:13.469 

and<00:07:11.229> now<00:07:12.190> is<00:07:12.610> that<00:07:12.759> it<00:07:12.940> okay

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 
and now is that it okay

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.339 
and now is that it okay
now<00:07:13.630> right<00:07:14.229> here<00:07:15.750> it's<00:07:16.750> the<00:07:16.840> easiest<00:07:17.139> way<00:07:17.319> to

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:17.349 
now right here it's the easiest way to

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:18.749 
now right here it's the easiest way to
remember<00:07:17.650> she's<00:07:17.979> dead<00:07:18.220> but<00:07:18.370> then<00:07:18.520> you<00:07:18.610> would

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 
remember she's dead but then you would

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:20.809 
remember she's dead but then you would
rotate<00:07:18.940> around<00:07:19.240> and<00:07:19.539> you<00:07:19.599> should<00:07:19.780> be<00:07:19.900> good<00:07:20.080> and

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 
rotate around and you should be good and

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.760 
rotate around and you should be good and
that's<00:07:21.819> the<00:07:22.449> basis<00:07:22.930> of<00:07:23.080> tanking<00:07:23.500> her<00:07:23.620> the

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
that's the basis of tanking her the

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.439 
that's the basis of tanking her the
toughest<00:07:24.160> part<00:07:24.370> is<00:07:24.490> picking<00:07:24.639> up<00:07:24.910> Sharada<00:07:25.210> and

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:25.449 
toughest part is picking up Sharada and

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.480 
toughest part is picking up Sharada and
not<00:07:25.630> slipstreaming<00:07:26.319> the<00:07:26.560> entire<00:07:26.830> party<00:07:27.280> when

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
not slipstreaming the entire party when

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.249 
not slipstreaming the entire party when
you<00:07:27.610> do<00:07:27.759> it<00:07:27.940> that's<00:07:28.569> the<00:07:28.780> toughest<00:07:29.050> part<00:07:29.229> of

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:29.259 
you do it that's the toughest part of

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.969 
you do it that's the toughest part of
the<00:07:29.349> fight<00:07:29.669> and<00:07:30.990> I<00:07:31.990> messed<00:07:32.199> up<00:07:32.410> a<00:07:32.530> little<00:07:32.770> bit

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:32.979 
the fight and I messed up a little bit

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:35.100 
the fight and I messed up a little bit
there<00:07:33.160> I<00:07:33.190> was<00:07:33.400> a<00:07:33.430> little<00:07:33.520> too<00:07:34.090> quick<00:07:34.509> in<00:07:34.810> my

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.110 
there I was a little too quick in my

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.409 
there I was a little too quick in my
movements<00:07:35.620> messed<00:07:36.370> it<00:07:36.550> up<00:07:38.849> when<00:07:39.849> after<00:07:40.120> the

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:40.419 
movements messed it up when after the

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.080 
movements messed it up when after the
center<00:07:41.020> part<00:07:41.289> it's<00:07:41.530> the<00:07:41.680> southwest<00:07:42.580> corner<00:07:42.909> I

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.090 
center part it's the southwest corner I

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.610 
center part it's the southwest corner I
think<00:07:43.360> it<00:07:43.479> was<00:07:43.599> that<00:07:43.750> you<00:07:44.110> want<00:07:44.259> to<00:07:44.349> take<00:07:44.470> her

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:44.620 
think it was that you want to take her

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:50.250 
think it was that you want to take her
to<00:07:45.780> yeah<00:07:46.810> a<00:07:47.080> little<00:07:48.039> lock
