00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
then this one the water is only going to

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.700 
then this one the water is only going to
be<00:01:37.289> about<00:01:37.470> 16<00:01:38.100> inches<00:01:38.310> deep<00:01:39.110> we<00:01:40.110> could<00:01:40.350> make<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
be about 16 inches deep we could make it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.380 
be about 16 inches deep we could make it
out<00:01:40.830> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.069> first<00:01:41.340> step<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.210> only

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
out of the first step and have it only

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.449 
out of the first step and have it only
about<00:01:42.720> six<00:01:43.049> inches<00:01:43.380> deep<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.860> this

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
about six inches deep but this

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.960 
about six inches deep but this
configuration<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.349> second<00:01:46.770> step<00:01:47.069> seems

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
configuration as the second step seems

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.029 
configuration as the second step seems
to<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.179> a<00:01:48.209> little<00:01:48.420> more<00:01:48.629> popular<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:49.890> can

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
to be a little more popular so you can

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.490 
to be a little more popular so you can
see<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.060> step<00:01:51.390> progresses<00:01:51.989> we<00:01:52.140> come<00:01:52.349> down

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
see as the step progresses we come down

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.999 
see as the step progresses we come down
here<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.239> you'll<00:01:54.239> see<00:01:54.330> that<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:55.349> third<00:01:55.619> step

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
here and you'll see that the third step

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.010 
here and you'll see that the third step
into<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.550> shallow<00:01:56.910> end<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.330> pool<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.780> just

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
into the shallow end of the pool is just

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.919 
into the shallow end of the pool is just
below<00:01:58.349> it<00:01:58.379> gives<00:01:59.190> us<00:01:59.340> our<00:01:59.489> three<00:01:59.819> steps<00:02:00.179> that

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
below it gives us our three steps that

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.809 
below it gives us our three steps that
drops<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.470> three<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.920> half<00:02:02.069> feet<00:02:02.789> of

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
drops into three and a half feet of

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:10.290 
drops into three and a half feet of
water<00:02:03.379> here<00:02:04.379> and<00:02:04.500> your<00:02:04.649> shallow<00:02:04.890> end

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.780 

so<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.260> can<00:02:11.410> see<00:02:11.650> we're<00:02:11.890> down<00:02:12.100> in<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.340> bottom

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
so you can see we're down in the bottom

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.660

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
looking at once the the shell is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.400 
looking at once the the shell is
complete<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.480> first<00:02:28.780> thing<00:02:28.930> I'm<00:02:29.080> sitting

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
complete the first thing I'm sitting

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.790 
complete the first thing I'm sitting
next<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.770> here<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> light<00:02:30.700> niche<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.800> the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
next to here is a light niche and the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.680 
next to here is a light niche and the
lightness<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.400> come<00:02:33.580> with<00:02:33.730> these<00:02:33.940> covers

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
lightness just come with these covers

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.900 
lightness just come with these covers
because<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.740> gun<00:02:35.950> eiders<00:02:36.310> will<00:02:36.550> actually

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
because the gun eiders will actually

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.910 
because the gun eiders will actually
shoot<00:02:37.210> gunite<00:02:37.630> right<00:02:37.870> over<00:02:38.140> top<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.770> I

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
shoot gunite right over top of it I

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.970 
shoot gunite right over top of it I
pulled<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.640> tie<00:02:40.330> wire<00:02:40.630> off<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.410> chip<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
pulled this tie wire off and chip the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.860 
pulled this tie wire off and chip the
gun<00:02:42.160> ID<00:02:42.340> away<00:02:42.580> from<00:02:42.820> it<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.120> could<00:02:43.360> expose<00:02:43.720> it

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
gun ID away from it so I could expose it

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.260 
gun ID away from it so I could expose it
for<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.170> just<00:02:45.040> by<00:02:45.190> removing<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.210> cover

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270

for you just by removing this cover
you'll<00:02:46.840> see<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.170> light<00:02:47.350> niche<00:02:47.530> behind<00:02:48.070> me

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
you'll see the light niche behind me

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.210 
you'll see the light niche behind me
this<00:02:49.090> will<00:02:49.300> house<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.890> pool<00:02:50.890> light

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
this will house the pool light

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.800 
this will house the pool light
eventually<00:02:52.170> once<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.350> pool<00:02:53.890> gets<00:02:54.130> plastered

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
eventually once the pool gets plastered

see a cover over top of it on the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.300 
see a cover over top of it on the
concrete

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
concrete

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.550 
concrete
it<00:03:03.760> takes<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.240> surface<00:03:04.690> water<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.320> leaves

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
it takes the surface water the leaves

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.580 
it takes the surface water the leaves
the<00:03:05.770> bugs<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.280> whatnot<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.470> collects<00:03:08.470> them

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
the bugs and whatnot and collects them

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.920 
the bugs and whatnot and collects them
in<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.770> basket<00:03:09.010> that's<00:03:09.490> on<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.730> other<00:03:09.880> side<00:03:09.970> but

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
and our plaster will come up to about

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.420 
and our plaster will come up to about
here<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.930> water<00:03:20.200> level<00:03:20.650> will<00:03:20.800> sit<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
here and the water level will sit in the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:38.000 
here and the water level will sit in the
middle<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.060> skimmer<00:03:22.900> area
