00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
the DAR should be little bit up it can

the DAR should be little bit up it can
be<00:04:55.750> talked<00:04:55.990> earlier<00:05:00.000> it<00:05:01.000> would<00:05:01.210> be<00:05:01.330> three

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
be talked earlier it would be three

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.339 
be talked earlier it would be three
inches<00:05:02.050> or<00:05:02.379> she<00:05:03.069> is<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.280> little<00:05:03.580> bit<00:05:03.819> old<00:05:04.419> or<00:05:04.659> 40

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
inches or she is a little bit old or 40

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.129 
inches or she is a little bit old or 40
or<00:05:05.560> 45<00:05:06.219> years<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:06.789> are<00:05:07.389> should<00:05:07.659> be<00:05:07.780> to<00:05:07.960> put

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
or 45 years that are should be to put

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.980 
or 45 years that are should be to put
down<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:09.430> can<00:05:09.669> be<00:05:09.819> our<00:05:09.909> two<00:05:10.090> stages<00:05:10.449> I<00:05:10.719> think

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
down it can be our two stages I think

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.149 
down it can be our two stages I think
two<00:05:11.500> inches<00:05:11.939> so<00:05:12.939> just<00:05:13.539> slow<00:05:13.810> this<00:05:14.080> is<00:05:14.409> going<00:05:14.949> to

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 
two inches so just slow this is going to

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:19.499 
two inches so just slow this is going to
be<00:05:15.279> stitch<00:05:15.729> for<00:05:16.120> a<00:05:16.419> lady<00:05:17.319> she<00:05:18.189> is<00:05:18.250> more<00:05:18.939> than<00:05:19.060> 45

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
be stitch for a lady she is more than 45

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.529 
be stitch for a lady she is more than 45
years<00:05:19.539> old<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:21.060> that<00:05:22.060> is<00:05:22.240> too<00:05:22.479> small

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
years old so that is too small

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.209 
years old so that is too small
now<00:05:25.539> we<00:05:25.900> are<00:05:26.139> going<00:05:26.319> to<00:05:26.409> connect<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.860> dart

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
now we are going to connect the dart

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:30.029 
now we are going to connect the dart
line<00:05:27.520> and<00:05:27.819> this<00:05:28.150> lung<00:05:28.389> it<00:05:29.229> should<00:05:29.469> be<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:29.680> curve

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
line and this lung it should be a curve

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.249 
line and this lung it should be a curve
something<00:05:30.340> like<00:05:30.550> this<00:05:30.879> this<00:05:31.539> is<00:05:31.689> going<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.139> be

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
something like this this is going to be

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.260 
something like this this is going to be
different<00:05:32.830> based<00:05:33.009> ability<00:05:33.639> is<00:05:33.699> very<00:05:34.029> very

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
different based ability is very very

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.519 
different based ability is very very
important<00:05:34.870> in<00:05:35.199> the<00:05:35.379> blouse<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:37.169> now<00:05:38.169> we<00:05:38.229> can

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
important in the blouse and now we can

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.949 
important in the blouse and now we can
cut<00:05:38.740> it<00:05:38.830> out
