00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.330
 the other pupil is complicated but not 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.130
 the adoption of some technique by the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.200
 rural record went to the property of the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.240
 its antonio that is near field 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.130
 great and I do not see Japanese cucumber grown 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.110
 almost 20 years ago 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.939
 we will accompany the report of willian 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.760
 Frank and Alex Ax 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.460
 this plant of hair that you live 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.640
 today is the result of a bet made 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.399
 by this rural producer for almost 20 years 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.270
 his antonio sérgio worked with cattle 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.510
 milkman 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.150
 but the yield was too low hence 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.390
 alternative was to get out there on the land 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.030
 your option in São Paulo to leave the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.360
 red through my relatives in the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.930
 state and I saw that it was more advantageous 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.360
 because it was a technique that produced 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.360
 the volume of product in little 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.579
 space and with that add enough value 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.400
 of r 1 joining the useful to the pleasant 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.329
 I liked it and thank god it worked and 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.450
 working well 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:21.049
 the crop covered in cucumber production 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.929
 Japanese seemed to be the best option and he 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.810
 was not wrong but learn to deal 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:30.109
 with the vegetable was not easy to deal with 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.979
 management and cultivation had to be 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.380
 exported 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.869
 the start was very difficult because of this 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.630
 lack of technical assistance in the 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.810
 so I sought out this knowledge 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.840
 including taking courses and taking 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.340
 doubts sometimes by phone even 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.740
 and then it was a very dangerous cast but 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.649
 with a happy ending 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.700
 the investment of his Sergio was a year 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.929
 after year and today there are six greenhouses 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.200
 available only for the cultivation 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.649
 of cucumber and the average yield has been 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.360
 quite interesting from eight to ten 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.349
 pounds per foot 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.450
 are 900 feet of Japanese cucumber 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.020
 distributed in 400 square meters of 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.200
 area 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.290
 cucumber down 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.620
 whole and arises from the flower of the plant 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.709
 and everything is very fast from this stage until 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.430
 the harvest is eight days when the vegetable 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.530
 achieve the ideal size 22 centimeters 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.870
 Japanese cucumber production is 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.690
 distributed to the large field ceasa 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.450
 and other cities within the statute 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.849
 and the response to good income is 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.560
 simple to do what you like is a 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.680
 activity that I really like 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.230
 doing that is one of the reasons 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.120
 worked also we have the 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.840
 persistence and enjoy working with 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.420
 that 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.480
 popularly known as cultivation 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.390
 covered this type of plantation presents 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.130
 many favorable points because it decreases 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.099
 the impacts caused by 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.780
 adversities of time and when it comes to 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.810
 of Japanese cucumber 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.049
 hence it is a great option since the blackness 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.989
 the smallest wind impulse changes the 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.870
 its shape and how much more curved it 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.940
 the greater the rejection at the time of 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.150
 mainly in the case of 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.510
 Japanese cucumber is a while since he 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.019
 need to have this upright feature 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.739
 feature is is quite a way 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:38.430
 and visual is not so when you present 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.450
 a fruit that it has a curvature yet 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.450
 what minimum 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.410
 he may already lose until this half of the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.079
 your price 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.130
 so I grow protected in this case is 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.180
 primordial 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.430
 so much is that the vast majority of 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.329
 all national cultivation of you 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.660
 Japanese made in greenhouse is a cucumber 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.459
 falls pipino common he even accepts better 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.069
 field conditions né 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.030
 all cucumber feet were planted 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.650
 in this type of semi-trough 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.430
 hydroponic irrigation to the extent 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.739
 certain 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.950
 another advantage we find here 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.049
 in this property is the way of planting 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.780
 very different from the cultivation of those 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.450
 producers where the cucumber 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.210
 Japanese will continue to crawl across the floor 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.060
 always keep the plant up in the 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.180
 vertical is without shadow 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.810
 of doubts, we can 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.970
 to observe in this greenhouse that it has these 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.210
 stripes is coming down from the 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:45.410
 first 20 centimeters of the soil already 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:49.910
 to observe him and her every 20-25 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:54.110
 centimeters passing is ribbon one way 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.540
 ae is vertical alias horizontal and beyond 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:02.270
 we have it vertically 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:05.090
 the budget of each case here 25 to 30 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.800
 centimeters too then we have both 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.570
 vertical and horizontal tutoring 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.460
 considered a vegetable that 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.300
 It is usually consumed in the form of 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.030
 salad 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.050
 but did you know that my powerful anti 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.310
 inflammatory 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:25.190
 in addition it is digestive diuretic pm stands 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.139
 the skin helps in combating dandruff and helps 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.389
 kidney problems. 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.620
 dissolution of calculations, among others 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.840
 properties 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.770
 and then the subject is to include a tire 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.770
 our own diet
