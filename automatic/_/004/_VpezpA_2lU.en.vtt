we're here with Germany kinsman who has

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.680 
we're here with Germany kinsman who has
some<00:00:07.529> big<00:00:07.799> heavy<00:00:07.950> tillage<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:09.330> help<00:00:09.510> put

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
some big heavy tillage and a help put

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.950 
some big heavy tillage and a help put
some<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:09.990> big<00:00:10.170> bud<00:00:10.349> tractors<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.889> work

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
some of the big bud tractors to work

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.980 
some of the big bud tractors to work
this<00:00:12.960> first<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.759> is<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:15.710> Brent<00:00:16.850> earthquake<00:00:17.990> 9.0

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
this first one is a Brent earthquake 9.0

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
this first one is a Brent earthquake 9.0
and<00:00:19.410> I'm<00:00:20.130> guessing<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.350> 9.0<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:22.710> for

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and I'm guessing it's the 9.0 was for

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.150 
and I'm guessing it's the 9.0 was for
the<00:00:23.130> nine<00:00:23.699> chanc<00:00:24.150> than<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.510> has<00:00:24.830> it<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.980> an

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the nine chanc than it has it is an

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.779 
the nine chanc than it has it is an
early<00:00:26.400> very<00:00:26.910> early<00:00:27.080> version<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:29.429> gripper

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
early very early version of this gripper

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.160 
early very early version of this gripper
that<00:00:29.970> were<00:00:30.240> made<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> mid<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> late<00:00:32.009> 90s<00:00:33.170> it

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
that were made in the mid to late 90s it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.459 
that were made in the mid to late 90s it
was<00:00:34.469> very<00:00:35.420> wouldn't<00:00:36.420> say<00:00:36.540> crude<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.200> very

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
was very wouldn't say crude but very

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.229 
was very wouldn't say crude but very
very<00:00:37.829> simple<00:00:38.430> very<00:00:38.460> basic

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
very simple very basic

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.200 
very simple very basic
when<00:00:40.719> they<00:00:40.840> built<00:00:41.110> these<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.980> they<00:00:42.100> were<00:00:42.210> when

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
when they built these and they were when

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.639 
when they built these and they were when
they<00:00:43.360> from<00:00:43.780> what<00:00:43.960> I<00:00:43.989> have<00:00:44.200> seen<00:00:44.230> they<00:00:44.620> were

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
they from what I have seen they were

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.850 
they from what I have seen they were
very<00:00:45.010> successful<00:00:45.280> machine<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.410> doing<00:00:47.710> what

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
very successful machine and doing what

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.470 
very successful machine and doing what
they<00:00:47.980> were<00:00:48.040> supposed<00:00:48.129> to<00:00:48.550> do<00:00:49.379> holds<00:00:50.379> up<00:00:51.480> it's

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
they were supposed to do holds up it's

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.389 
they were supposed to do holds up it's
one<00:00:52.600> of<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.840> few<00:00:53.050> implements<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:53.769> I've<00:00:54.070> seen

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
one of the few implements that I've seen

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.049 
one of the few implements that I've seen
that<00:00:54.640> holds<00:00:54.969> flat<00:00:55.680> instead<00:00:56.680> of<00:00:57.000> looking<00:00:58.000> more

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
that holds flat instead of looking more

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.259 
that holds flat instead of looking more
like<00:00:58.390> a<00:00:58.420> tent<00:01:01.050> wheels<00:01:02.550> raise<00:01:03.550> and<00:01:03.790> lower<00:01:03.820> with

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
like a tent wheels raise and lower with

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.190 
like a tent wheels raise and lower with
the<00:01:04.390> hydraulic<00:01:04.899> cylinder<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.690> tandems

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
the hydraulic cylinder and the tandems

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:16.169 
the hydraulic cylinder and the tandems
do<00:01:08.470> walk<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.610> shanks<00:01:13.149> were<00:01:14.310> resin<00:01:15.310> cast<00:01:15.580> it

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
do walk the shanks were resin cast it

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.190 
do walk the shanks were resin cast it
was<00:01:16.300> a<00:01:16.360> design<00:01:16.899> that<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.259> came<00:01:17.560> up<00:01:17.770> with<00:01:19.200> molded

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
was a design that I came up with molded

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.039 
was a design that I came up with molded
in<00:01:20.380> past<00:01:20.649> several<00:01:20.979> years<00:01:21.160> ago

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
in past several years ago

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.139 
in past several years ago
and<00:01:23.439> then<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.799> disk<00:01:24.009> blades<00:01:24.399> will<00:01:24.700> punched

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
and then the disk blades will punched

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.779 
and then the disk blades will punched
out<00:01:27.509> 20,000<00:01:28.509> sheet<00:01:28.780> styrene<00:01:29.429> and<00:01:30.429> then<00:01:30.640> the

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
out 20,000 sheet styrene and then the

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.179 
out 20,000 sheet styrene and then the
individual<00:01:31.390> schools<00:01:31.810> put<00:01:32.229> in<00:01:32.320> between<00:01:32.710> the

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
individual schools put in between the

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.899 
individual schools put in between the
shaft<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:34.679> vent<00:01:35.679> brass

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
shaft with vent brass

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.080 
shaft with vent brass
for<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.270> see<00:01:38.509> hangers

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.170 

if<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:41.840> notice<00:01:42.259> on<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:42.560> back<00:01:42.799> they<00:01:43.520> do<00:01:43.579> taper

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
if you notice on the back they do taper

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.990 
if you notice on the back they do taper
in<00:01:44.780> diameter<00:01:45.110> just<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:46.700> real<00:01:46.850> ones

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.899

for transport very simple bill but very

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.330 
for transport very simple bill but very
it<00:02:17.970> was<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.150> fun<00:02:18.450> build<00:02:18.800> just<00:02:19.800> because<00:02:20.160> it's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
it was a fun build just because it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.560 
it was a fun build just because it's
something<00:02:20.550> different<00:02:20.720> they<00:02:21.830> very<00:02:22.830> few<00:02:23.130> people

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
something different they very few people

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.690 
something different they very few people
I've<00:02:24.570> seen<00:02:24.900> build<00:02:25.350> anything<00:02:25.710> from<00:02:26.100> some<00:02:26.340> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
I've seen build anything from some a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.730 
I've seen build anything from some a
short<00:02:27.000> line<00:02:27.240> manufacturer<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.470> and

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
short line manufacturer like that and

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.740 
short line manufacturer like that and
it's<00:02:28.860> older<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.490> wanted<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.090> do<00:02:30.300> something<00:02:30.690> a

it's older I wanted to do something a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.580 
it's older I wanted to do something a
