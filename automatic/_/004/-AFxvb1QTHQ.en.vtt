00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.250 

the<00:00:10.360> star<00:00:10.660> bolt

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
the star bolt

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.470 
the star bolt
I<00:00:11.290> think<00:00:11.830> it's<00:00:11.980> v-twin<00:00:12.490> really<00:00:12.850> beats<00:00:13.210> the

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
I think it's v-twin really beats the

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.449 
I think it's v-twin really beats the
Sportster<00:00:13.900> in<00:00:14.170> terms<00:00:14.440> of<00:00:14.650> it's<00:00:14.860> got<00:00:15.190> a<00:00:15.250> little

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
Sportster in terms of it's got a little

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.359 
Sportster in terms of it's got a little
bit<00:00:15.639> of<00:00:15.760> a<00:00:15.849> torque<00:00:16.180> you're<00:00:16.710> better<00:00:17.710> power<00:00:18.009> band

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
bit of a torque you're better power band

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.410 
bit of a torque you're better power band
it<00:00:18.880> feels<00:00:19.330> like<00:00:19.599> a<00:00:19.630> stronger<00:00:20.590> bike<00:00:21.369> and<00:00:21.939> it<00:00:22.029> is

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
it feels like a stronger bike and it is

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.519 
it feels like a stronger bike and it is
I<00:00:24.180> love<00:00:25.180> the<00:00:25.300> snappiness<00:00:25.750> of<00:00:26.050> throttle

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
I love the snappiness of throttle

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.650 
I love the snappiness of throttle
response<00:00:26.649> it's<00:00:27.369> just<00:00:27.640> immediately<00:00:27.849> dialed<00:00:28.509> in

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
response it's just immediately dialed in

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.040 
response it's just immediately dialed in
twist<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:29.529> go<00:00:29.759> first<00:00:30.759> couple<00:00:31.090> of<00:00:31.149> gears<00:00:31.390> it's

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
twist and go first couple of gears it's

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.479 
twist and go first couple of gears it's
really<00:00:32.470> me<00:00:32.559> you<00:00:32.619> know<00:00:32.739> launching<00:00:33.190> off<00:00:33.309> the

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
really me you know launching off the

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.130 
really me you know launching off the
line<00:00:33.700> very<00:00:34.660> usable<00:00:35.230> power<00:00:36.750> unlike<00:00:37.750> some<00:00:38.020> of

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
line very usable power unlike some of

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.680 
line very usable power unlike some of
the<00:00:38.200> metrics<00:00:38.410> which<00:00:38.920> have<00:00:39.820> sort<00:00:40.090> of<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.210> detuned

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
the metrics which have sort of a detuned

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.230 
the metrics which have sort of a detuned
or<00:00:40.990> mellow<00:00:41.290> feel<00:00:41.830> to<00:00:42.130> their<00:00:42.280> engine<00:00:42.640> I<00:00:42.790> think

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
or mellow feel to their engine I think

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.260 
or mellow feel to their engine I think
the<00:00:43.630> star<00:00:43.930> really<00:00:44.320> does<00:00:44.560> deliver<00:00:45.310> like<00:00:46.000> some

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
the star really does deliver like some

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.100 
the star really does deliver like some
personality<00:00:46.990> some<00:00:47.800> people<00:00:48.070> will<00:00:48.250> prefer<00:00:48.430> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
personality some people will prefer the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.110 
personality some people will prefer the
character<00:00:50.110> of<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.440> Sportster<00:00:50.860> but<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.400> think

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
character of the Sportster but I think

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.930 
character of the Sportster but I think
that<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.990> bolts<00:00:53.440> v-twin<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.430> easier<00:00:54.880> to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
that the the bolts v-twin is easier to

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.470 
that the the bolts v-twin is easier to
live<00:00:55.180> with<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.980> engine<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:57.820> more<00:00:58.060> broad<00:00:58.450> than

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
live with the engine is more broad than

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.410 
live with the engine is more broad than
the<00:00:59.020> Sportster<00:00:59.440> which<00:01:00.100> means<00:01:00.400> that<00:01:00.640> your<00:01:00.940> legs

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
the Sportster which means that your legs

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.940 
the Sportster which means that your legs
have<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:01.720> spread<00:01:02.110> out<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.290> little<00:01:02.470> bit<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:02.829> be

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
have to spread out a little bit to be

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.369 
have to spread out a little bit to be
comfortable<00:01:03.489> on<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.629> general<00:01:05.049> riding

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
comfortable on it the general riding

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.719 
comfortable on it the general riding
position<00:01:05.710> is<00:01:05.740> very<00:01:06.009> similar<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.490> the

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
position is very similar to the

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.270 
position is very similar to the
Sportster<00:01:07.149> but<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.689> bolt<00:01:08.409> fills<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:09.009> little

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
Sportster but the bolt fills a little

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.550 
Sportster but the bolt fills a little
bit<00:01:09.399> bigger<00:01:09.670> I<00:01:09.970> also<00:01:10.360> feel<00:01:10.750> like<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.049> controls

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
bit bigger I also feel like the controls

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.530 
bit bigger I also feel like the controls
on<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.860> bolt<00:01:12.100> are<00:01:12.340> a<00:01:12.400> little<00:01:12.940> bit<00:01:13.060> larger

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
on the bolt are a little bit larger

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.300 
on the bolt are a little bit larger
makes<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.290> feel<00:01:14.500> like<00:01:14.620> a<00:01:14.680> little<00:01:14.979> bit<00:01:15.100> bigger

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
makes it feel like a little bit bigger

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.310 
makes it feel like a little bit bigger
bike<00:01:15.580> than<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:15.909> really<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.600> when<00:01:17.260> you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
bike than it really is and when you

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.070 
bike than it really is and when you
compare<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:18.340> Sportster<00:01:18.760> to<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.150> bolt<00:01:19.360> the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
compare the Sportster to the bolt the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.140 
compare the Sportster to the bolt the
bolt<00:01:20.260> feels<00:01:20.680> bigger<00:01:20.979> even<00:01:21.550> though<00:01:21.729> it<00:01:21.909> weighs

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
bolt feels bigger even though it weighs

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.560 
bolt feels bigger even though it weighs
less<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.070> turns<00:01:24.340> if<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:25.000> bolt<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.360> very

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
less in the turns if the bolt is very

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.289 
less in the turns if the bolt is very
stable<00:01:26.020> very<00:01:26.650> predictable<00:01:26.970> hug<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.150> road

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
stable very predictable hug the road

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.630 
stable very predictable hug the road
well<00:01:28.659> does<00:01:29.470> feel<00:01:29.680> like<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.890> bigger<00:01:30.159> bike<00:01:30.400> than

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
well does feel like a bigger bike than

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.789 
well does feel like a bigger bike than
the<00:01:30.729> other<00:01:30.850> two<00:01:31.090> but<00:01:31.500> hustling<00:01:32.500> through<00:01:32.710> the

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.690 
the right height to cut into your calf
and<00:02:06.549> it's<00:02:07.090> it's<00:02:07.630> really<00:02:08.019> irritating<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.799> I

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
and it's it's really irritating and I

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.550 
and it's it's really irritating and I
Kamiya<00:02:10.119> really<00:02:10.390> detracts<00:02:10.690> from<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
Kamiya really detracts from the the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.340 
Kamiya really detracts from the the
writing<00:02:11.860> experience<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.930> find<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.110> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
writing experience I find that the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.500 
writing experience I find that the
display<00:02:14.950> with<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.400> sort<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.000> smoked

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
display with the sort of the smoked

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.570 
display with the sort of the smoked
glass<00:02:16.990> over<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.800> really<00:02:18.069> hard<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.400> read

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
glass over it is really hard to read

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.559 
glass over it is really hard to read
especially<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.080> Sun<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:22.180> brakes<00:02:22.390> have

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
especially in the Sun the brakes have

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.360 
especially in the Sun the brakes have
good<00:02:22.810> fill-in<00:02:23.170> power<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.860> rear<00:02:24.100> will

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
good fill-in power but the rear will

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.390 
good fill-in power but the rear will
lock<00:02:24.670> up<00:02:24.700> pretty<00:02:25.180> easily<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.900> also<00:02:26.350> once<00:02:27.250> you

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
lock up pretty easily and also once you

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.490 
lock up pretty easily and also once you
lock<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.940> up<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.480> back<00:02:28.720> tire<00:02:28.959> doesn't<00:02:29.350> have<00:02:29.470> a

whole lot of grip the front end in

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.330 
whole lot of grip the front end in
particular<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.290> really<00:02:32.590> nice<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:33.070> think<00:02:33.220> it's

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
particular is really nice I think it's

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.370 
particular is really nice I think it's
really<00:02:33.490> clean<00:02:33.880> for<00:02:34.450> me<00:02:34.570> personally<00:02:35.110> where<00:02:35.260> the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
really clean for me personally where the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.620 
really clean for me personally where the
styling<00:02:35.830> sort<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.130> falls<00:02:36.310> apart<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.850> the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
styling sort of falls apart is the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.949 
styling sort of falls apart is the
exhaust<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.770> little<00:02:39.040> bulky<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.420> engine

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
exhaust is a little bulky that engine

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.510 
exhaust is a little bulky that engine
guard<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.380> mentioned<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:41.950> I'm<00:02:42.130> not<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.310> big

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
guard that I mentioned is I'm not a big

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.370 
guard that I mentioned is I'm not a big
fan<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.330> then<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.600> get<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.959> back<00:02:44.110> end

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
fan of and then we get to the back end

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.800 
fan of and then we get to the back end
with<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.680> LED<00:02:45.430> tail<00:02:45.700> light<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.150> LED<00:02:46.480> parts

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
with that LED tail light the LED parts

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.449 
with that LED tail light the LED parts
pretty<00:02:46.989> cool<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.890> way<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.100> just<00:02:48.250> kind<00:02:48.430> of

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
pretty cool but the way it just kind of

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.740 
pretty cool but the way it just kind of
sticks<00:02:48.700> up<00:02:48.910> out<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.209> nowhere<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.660> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
sticks up out of nowhere and the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.030 
sticks up out of nowhere and the
defender<00:02:50.500> doesn't<00:02:50.680> really<00:02:51.250> work<00:02:51.459> for<00:02:51.489> me

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
defender doesn't really work for me

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.490 
defender doesn't really work for me
the<00:02:54.040> bolt<00:02:54.280> does<00:02:54.489> a<00:02:54.519> really<00:02:54.730> good<00:02:54.940> job<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.510> being

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
the bolt does a really good job of being

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.770 
the bolt does a really good job of being
like<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.340> Sportster<00:02:57.760> without<00:02:58.300> being<00:02:58.570> the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
like the Sportster without being the

Sportster<00:02:59.200> so<00:02:59.560> it's<00:02:59.709> gonna<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.640> its<00:03:01.209> target<00:03:01.690> is
