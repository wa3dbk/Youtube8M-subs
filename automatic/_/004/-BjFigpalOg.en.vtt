00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 so I'm happy let's hope we can 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.580
 win this confederations cup that something 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.649
 which is that Spain has not yet 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.559
 achieved and we would like to 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.000
 win half of the season 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.120
 we had many points away 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.680
 it seemed that it was practically 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.330
 sentenced and not given much value 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.490
 just as it was given to others 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.590
 Minor titles do not bother us 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.510
 but it is the reality that the league is a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.609
 important title of brand the team more 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.769
 regular of the season and has appeared 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.359
 that he was not given importance to 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.099
 we have been important 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.230
 get him to get it in the way 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 that we have done it by getting 100 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.469
 points scoring many goals and good 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.870
 true that we are very happy to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.640
 have done it yes and if not I think it is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.620
 one of the best players in the world 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.690
 nowadays and as I have always said no 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.760
 all the best players in the world 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 they deserve to be in the boat and it will be a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.480
 pleasure to have it with us let's hope 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.770
 that is as soon as possible that I can 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.290
 exploit all its conditions 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.350
 undoubtedly a very bad news for 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.660
 us because he is a base player 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.150
 who has been a goalkeeper for many years 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.770
 for me the best in the world as 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.990
 partner as a person because he is also 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.500
 a person with a lot of weight inside the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.270
 wardrobe and a very good companion and the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.860
 it's a pity that he's leaving 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.260
 who has made this decision but no 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.110
 to respect it and nothing else 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.180
 face it like we have to face it 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.180
 supporting them for everything they have done for 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.270
 everything that has given and well let's hope and 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.219
 I wish him the best where they go 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.869
 if it's true that he's also doing 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.759
 a job here in the selection also 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.520
 in the liverpool and good sounds too 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.320
 for the team and I think it's a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.270
 goalkeeper of many guarantees and a good 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.930
 turnover in I do not know is always 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.240
 competitive not every year 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.370
 has a great great players 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.800
 team and that's why every year is very difficult 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.420
 beat them now I see it well here is with 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.390
 you win again is with the companions 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.180
 they feel comfortable I think it has happened 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.540
 a bad situation that no player 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.979
 would like to live less to him for all the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.570
 trajectory that takes from small in 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.910
 the real madrid being the captain here 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.100
 also being the captain and good the 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.410
 true that we are all with him this to 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.300
 Sometimes it happens in football and well you have to 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.950
 respect it but as I tell you and you're 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.380
 a great professional 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.580
 he keeps working the same and good 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.950
 we are happy that he is here with 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.130
 We do not at the moment, but as you 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.320
 I say I'm calm and good, I trust 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.510
 this club or in these classmates and good 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.510
 I hope I can be many years
