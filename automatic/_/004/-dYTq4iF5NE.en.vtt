00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.000
 in football we always idolize the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.849
 players but behind all the goals 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.380
 and super pranks there are other idols today in 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.269
 the break previously we bring to those 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 football icons that were made 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.890
 famous despite not being football players is 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.380
 more not even for being human as is 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.420
 the case of the deceased German octopus paul 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.160
 to this octopus in the South Africa World Cup 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.420
 he went around the world thanks to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.400
 I guess the result of the first 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.430
 four matches of the German national team 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.680
 the semifinal and the final its clairvoyance 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.690
 she became very famous despite the opinion 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.030
 of several experts in any way the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.390
 octopus paul died in 2010 taking 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.920
 all its secrets at the bottom of the sea 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.329
 rest in peace but the world past 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.300
 from south africa had two big 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.449
 protagonists who were not soccer players nor 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.760
 Girlfriends of football players or transvestites 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.040
 from salcido 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.500
 the vuvuzelas and the ball first the 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.220
 vuvuzelas a kind of trumpet 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.220
 popularized on the African continent 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.270
 it was the headache of millions of 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.550
 viewers worldwide thanks to 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.440
 his desperate sound that drilled the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.440
 heard worse than the tigress of the east ' 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.880
 good 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.950
 this toy caused the annoyance also 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.300
 of players because the extreme noise that 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.550
 causes does not let the players 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.950
 they will organize on the court to take away the 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.950
 ball to goal 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.750
 and if that were not enough, the official ball of the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.250
 world also starred all 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.900
 this because it was so light that at 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.729
 moment of kicking the players makes a 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.320
 movement so strange that they turned 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.690
 crazy the goalkeepers is why every 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.090
 four years is redesigned not only visual 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.040
 but technologically with the best of what 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.020
 better not only do you want it to be more 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.970
 light but that the players can 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.190
 handle it better what you 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.440
 you thought it was just a poor ball 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.600
 deluded but certainly one of the icons 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.229
 greatest football comes from one 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.470
 from the strangest worlds the legal profession 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.600
 so is 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.789
 jules rimet was lawyer maybe the name 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.399
 do not sound like it because it was a long time ago 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.400
 rime invented football just like 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.070

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.930

 equitable and of course the cup that 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.700

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.210
 let's hope that in Brazil there is some other 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.710
 figure that is immortal isis and even 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.420

 Mexicans the goalkeeper arrives in Brazil 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.940

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.670
 at school or in the office thanks to 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.710
