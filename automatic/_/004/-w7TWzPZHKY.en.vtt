00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.830
 hi I am massimiliano corso with this 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.889
 tutorials we learn to insert in 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:16.520
 photo a copyright watermark 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 then we open the photo that interests us 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.930
 use for work 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.170
 let's start with choosing a color of 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.170
 close-up a medium gray one 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.170
 intensity 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.540
 ok now let's select here from the panel 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:46.020
 rectangle tool we hold e 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.500
 we choose tool personal form here 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.210
 in the options 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:57.149
 we click on form scroll down 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.270
 the predefined forms and select the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.980
 copyright symbol 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.490
 we click and close 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.909
 now, first of all, let's create a 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.950
 new level and now holding 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.210
 the uppercase key to keep the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.470
 proportions of the logo we draw on 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:29.540
 photo of copyright symbol 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:30.770
 here now we add a style of 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.790
 level 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:39.220
 here we press the styles icon 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:44.300
 level and add the option 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:48.009
 bevel and relief effect we see that 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:52.940
 we leave the default settings 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:55.090
 ok now let's create another new level 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.090
 level 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:07.420
 select the text tool and here 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.420
 we can write our name 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:19.959
 rather than just training 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.959
 copyright and the year so to speak 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.910
 here too we apply the same effect 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.630
 which we applied to the symbol of 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.420
 copyright 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.120
 so let's add a level style 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:42.720
 we select musso and effect lowes 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:45.660
 relief ok now let's select together i 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.760
 two levels we have created for 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.709
 center them together and then select 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.850
 together also the background keeping pressed 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.150
 the uppercase key 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.200
 we select more levels and so here 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.410
 We got to do 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.590
 in the perfect picture 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.120
 at this point we select only i 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.540
 two levels we have created for the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:15.560
 copyright is for the text and we combine 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.560
 the levels 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.239
 we now set the light from normal to 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.510
 bright light 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.989
 here it becomes brighter 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.940
 let's set this opacity to ours 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.549
 liking to make it more transparent 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.800
 in order to be less invasive here ad 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:48.530
 example in this case a 50 percent 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:51.830
 and very well here we have created our own 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.930
 our copyright watermark on the photo 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.880
 to avoid doing all this every 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.190
 time we need to insert it into a photo 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.600
 we can in the level we have created 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:08.090
 copyright select it and convert it 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:11.780
 in advanced subject at this point 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:16.390
 we click on the e level again 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.250
 select export content 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.380
 save it as an example file name 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.980
 copyright 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.870
 save ok now let's imagine we have 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.050
 again we delete the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.920
 let's imagine we have ours 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.620
 our initial image without 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:43.120
 no copyright watermark we go 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:46.630
 in the file menu enter select 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.940
 the advanced object we saved 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.700
 enter eco here 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.830
 the only thing we have to do here 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.169
 reapply enter files and the 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.100
 light regulation we had 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:04.820
 inserted as intense and then regular 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.620
 opacity without needing to recreate 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.830
 all levels to rewrite everything 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.790
 how much here this is all to 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.790
