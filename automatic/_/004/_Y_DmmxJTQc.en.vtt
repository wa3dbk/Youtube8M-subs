mashes<00:00:12.509> up<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.320> verified<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.920> had<00:00:14.099> full

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
mashes up and I verified that I had full

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.700 
mashes up and I verified that I had full
conversion<00:00:14.849> by<00:00:15.000> using<00:00:15.210> an<00:00:15.599> iodine<00:00:16.109> test<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:17.539> I

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
conversion by using an iodine test and I

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.679 
conversion by using an iodine test and I
just<00:00:19.710> started<00:00:20.010> recirculating<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.029> heating

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
just started recirculating and heating

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.310 
just started recirculating and heating
the<00:00:22.140> mash<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:23.600> lot<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:24.930> seen<00:00:25.199> me

advocate<00:00:25.769> breaking<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.699> barrage<00:00:26.970> into<00:00:27.300> two

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
advocate breaking this barrage into two

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.380 
advocate breaking this barrage into two
equal<00:00:27.779> portions<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.699> while<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> still<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:30.240> that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
equal portions and while I still do that

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.999

on<00:00:30.539> my<00:00:30.660> smaller<00:00:30.990> beers<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.590> beer<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.920> going

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
on my smaller beers this beer is going

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.740 
on my smaller beers this beer is going
to<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.279> about<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.149> 10<00:00:33.530> 72<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> believe<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.750> I've

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
to be about a 10 72 I believe and I've

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
to be about a 10 72 I believe and I've
only<00:00:37.020> got<00:00:37.140> three<00:00:37.559> gallons<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.160> water<00:00:38.730> to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
only got three gallons of water to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.389 
only got three gallons of water to
sparge<00:00:39.300> within<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.140> considerably<00:00:40.829> large<00:00:41.100> grain

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
sparge within a considerably large grain

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.060 
sparge within a considerably large grain
bill<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.059> mean<00:00:42.989> there's<00:00:43.140> six<00:00:43.379> gallons<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
bill here I mean there's six gallons of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.830 
bill here I mean there's six gallons of
strike<00:00:44.399> water<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.879> three<00:00:45.059> gallons<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.450> sparge

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
strike water and three gallons of sparge

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.920 
strike water and three gallons of sparge
so<00:00:46.530> I'm<00:00:47.430> only<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> single<00:00:48.450> sparge

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
so I'm only going to do a single sparge

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:57.830 
so I'm only going to do a single sparge
for<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.469> patch<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:55.879> feed<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.000> down<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
for this patch I feed that down to the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.130 
for this patch I feed that down to the
bottom<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> kettle<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.809> turn<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> pump

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
bottom of the kettle and turn the pump

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.860 
bottom of the kettle and turn the pump
on

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.430 

now<00:01:09.870> I<00:01:09.900> don't<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.440> do<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.620> dedicated<00:01:12.440> war

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
now I don't have to do a dedicated war

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.590 
now I don't have to do a dedicated war
loaf<00:01:13.680> at<00:01:13.980> this<00:01:14.340> point<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.300> was

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
loaf at this point because as I was

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
loaf at this point because as I was
recirculating<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> heating<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.280> mash<00:01:17.670> out

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
recirculating and heating to mash out

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.520 
recirculating and heating to mash out
temperature<00:01:18.300> I<00:01:18.330> was<00:01:18.570> basically<00:01:18.840> achieving<00:01:19.290> of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
temperature I was basically achieving of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.580 
temperature I was basically achieving of
whirl<00:01:19.680> off<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.190> process<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.000> my<00:01:21.750> mesh<00:01:22.350> run

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
whirl off in that process so my mesh run

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.840 
whirl off in that process so my mesh run
off<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:22.920> now<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.250> crystal<00:01:23.700> clear<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.530> just

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
off right now is crystal clear and just

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.190 
off right now is crystal clear and just
to<00:01:26.850> note<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.570> don't<00:01:27.690> really<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.110> open

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
to note you don't really want to open

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440 
to note you don't really want to open
this<00:01:28.500> valve<00:01:28.710> wide<00:01:29.130> open<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:29.670> pump<00:01:29.940> with<00:01:30.210> full

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
this valve wide open and pump with full

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.730 
this valve wide open and pump with full
force<00:01:30.720> because<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.500> actually

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
force because you're going to actually

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.430 
force because you're going to actually
pull<00:01:32.160> all<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.030> grain<00:01:33.270> down<00:01:33.510> very<00:01:33.930> tight<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
pull all the grain down very tight to

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.060 
pull all the grain down very tight to
the<00:01:34.530> false<00:01:34.770> bottom<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.460> caused<00:01:36.210> us<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:37.440> stuck

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the false bottom and caused us a stuck

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.249 
the false bottom and caused us a stuck
sparge<00:01:38.460> basically<00:01:39.150> or<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.360> block<00:01:39.810> lot<00:01:40.050> of

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
sparge basically or a block lot of

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.340 
sparge basically or a block lot of
blockage<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.160> runoff<00:01:41.960> okay<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.110> now<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
blockage in the runoff okay and now that

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.320 
blockage in the runoff okay and now that
I<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.650> good<00:01:44.040> three<00:01:44.340> gallons<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.910> my<00:01:45.060> kettle

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
I have a good three gallons in my kettle

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.690 
I have a good three gallons in my kettle
I<00:01:45.690> can<00:01:46.440> go<00:01:46.619> ahead<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.830> light<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.160> flame<00:01:47.369> under

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I can go ahead and light the flame under

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:58.230 
I can go ahead and light the flame under
it

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.090 

because<00:01:59.229> there's<00:01:59.409> really<00:01:59.440> no<00:01:59.710> reason<00:01:59.950> to

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
because there's really no reason to

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.039 
because there's really no reason to
waste<00:02:00.310> time<00:02:00.610> letting<00:02:01.330> word<00:02:01.750> sit<00:02:02.080> in<00:02:02.170> there<00:02:04.049> I'm

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
waste time letting word sit in there I'm

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.649 
waste time letting word sit in there I'm
getting<00:02:05.290> ready<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.650> put<00:02:06.430> my<00:02:06.550> first<00:02:06.820> sparge<00:02:07.510> in

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
getting ready to put my first sparge in

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:16.900 
getting ready to put my first sparge in
there

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.630 

so<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.840> my<00:02:18.050> destination<00:02:18.680> hoes<00:02:19.070> now<00:02:19.370> I'm

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
so this is my destination hoes now I'm

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.050 
so this is my destination hoes now I'm
going<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.090> put<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:20.450> back<00:02:20.720> into<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.230> mash<00:02:21.440> tun

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
going to put this back into the mash tun

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.000 
going to put this back into the mash tun
make<00:02:23.060> sure<00:02:23.210> all<00:02:23.390> your<00:02:23.570> valves<00:02:23.930> are<00:02:24.050> closed

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.540 

okay<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.120> destination<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.409> mash<00:02:32.280> tun

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
okay so the destination is the mash tun

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.280 
okay so the destination is the mash tun
now<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.310> put<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.209> hose<00:02:36.510> either<00:02:36.870> on

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
now and I can put this hose either on

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.580 
now and I can put this hose either on
the<00:02:38.069> drain<00:02:38.370> or<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.150> recirculation<00:02:39.900> port<00:02:40.349> or

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
the drain or the recirculation port or

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.559 
the drain or the recirculation port or
just<00:02:40.980> drape<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.400> over<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> top<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.299> wanted

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
just drape it over the top if I wanted

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.710 
just drape it over the top if I wanted
to<00:02:42.629> but<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.920> under<00:02:44.790> let<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.269> grain<00:02:45.510> bed

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
to but I like to under let the grain bed

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.890 
to but I like to under let the grain bed
with<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.290> sparge<00:02:46.799> water<00:02:47.239> so<00:02:48.239> now<00:02:48.390> my<00:02:48.599> source

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
with the sparge water so now my source

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.699 
with the sparge water so now my source
is<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.590> be<00:02:49.680> my<00:02:49.920> hot<00:02:50.129> liquor<00:02:50.430> tank<00:02:50.459> and

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
is going to be my hot liquor tank and

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.619 
is going to be my hot liquor tank and
again<00:02:52.709> just<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.010> make<00:02:53.129> sure<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.700> I'm<00:02:53.849> not

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
again just to make sure that I'm not

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.530 
again just to make sure that I'm not
going<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.260> suck<00:02:55.470> too<00:02:55.709> much<00:02:55.890> air<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:57.299> open

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
going to suck too much air I just open

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.229 
going to suck too much air I just open
this<00:02:57.660> valve<00:02:57.870> carefully<00:02:58.680> get<00:02:59.579> some<00:02:59.760> water<00:03:00.000> and

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
this valve carefully get some water and

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.089 
this valve carefully get some water and
then<00:03:00.360> close<00:03:00.629> it<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.470> I'm<00:03:01.530> going<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.739> open<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
then close it so I'm going to open the

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:10.490 
then close it so I'm going to open the
valve<00:03:02.310> from<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.120> hot<00:03:03.299> liquor<00:03:03.569> tank

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.020 

open<00:03:11.190> up<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.490> mash<00:03:12.420> tun<00:03:12.660> valve<00:03:12.960> and<00:03:14.030> finally

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
open up the mash tun valve and finally

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:26.780 
open up the mash tun valve and finally
open<00:03:15.840> up<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.050> pump<00:03:16.290> valves<00:03:25.520> alright<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.550> have

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
open up the pump valves alright I have

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.370 
open up the pump valves alright I have
confidence<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.840> it's<00:03:28.370> fully<00:03:29.690> mixed<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.930> I

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
confidence that it's fully mixed and I

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.440 
confidence that it's fully mixed and I
guess<00:03:31.710> about<00:03:31.920> five<00:03:31.980> minutes<00:03:32.550> have<00:03:32.730> passed<00:03:33.090> and

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
guess about five minutes have passed and

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.100 
guess about five minutes have passed and
now<00:03:34.260> we<00:03:34.320> want<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.770> recirculate<00:03:35.190> again<00:03:35.670> so

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
now we want to recirculate again so

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.410 
now we want to recirculate again so
here's<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.320> destination<00:03:38.010> hose<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.610> put<00:03:39.300> that

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
here's the destination hose I put that

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.290 
here's the destination hose I put that
on<00:03:39.600> my<00:03:39.630> recirculation<00:03:40.560> port<00:03:40.980> or<00:03:41.760> my<00:03:41.910> return

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
on my recirculation port or my return

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:54.980 
on my recirculation port or my return
port<00:03:47.750> now<00:03:48.750> we're<00:03:48.960> taking<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:51.260> mesh

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.750 

now<00:03:55.990> I'm<00:03:56.110> performing<00:03:56.410> another<00:03:57.130> short<00:03:57.520> war

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
now I'm performing another short war

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.960 
now I'm performing another short war
loss<00:03:57.970> after<00:03:58.210> I've<00:03:59.280> stirred<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.460> my<00:04:00.610> sparked

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
loss after I've stirred in my sparked

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.970 
loss after I've stirred in my sparked
water<00:04:01.210> and<00:04:01.540> this<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:02.050> course<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.440> reset<00:04:02.830> the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
water and this is of course to reset the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.730 
water and this is of course to reset the
grain<00:04:03.190> bed<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:04.180> create<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.900> clear<00:04:05.380> run<00:04:05.590> off

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
grain bed and to create a clear run off

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.560 
grain bed and to create a clear run off
again<00:04:05.950> because<00:04:06.820> once<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.090> stir<00:04:07.360> it<00:04:07.540> you

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
again because once you stir it you

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.060 
again because once you stir it you
reintroduce<00:04:08.080> some<00:04:08.560> grain<00:04:08.800> particles

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
reintroduce some grain particles

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.280 
reintroduce some grain particles
underneath<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.790> false<00:04:10.000> bottom<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:11.110> don't

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
underneath the false bottom you don't

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.750 
underneath the false bottom you don't
have<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:11.500> run<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.770> very<00:04:11.950> long<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.370> would<00:04:12.550> say

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
have to run it very long I would say

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.540 
have to run it very long I would say
that<00:04:12.970> one<00:04:13.870> or<00:04:13.960> two<00:04:14.020> minutes<00:04:14.410> is<00:04:14.500> fine<00:04:14.770> when

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
that one or two minutes is fine when

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.300 
that one or two minutes is fine when
that's<00:04:15.989> completed<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.230> should<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:17.650> shut

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
that's completed you should just shut

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.650 
that's completed you should just shut
the<00:04:18.430> valve<00:04:18.610> to<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:18.940> pump<00:04:19.210> you<00:04:19.330> don't<00:04:19.480> have<00:04:19.570> to

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
the valve to the pump you don't have to

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.560 
the valve to the pump you don't have to
shut<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.900> pump<00:04:20.050> off<00:04:21.990> now<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.080> take<00:04:23.260> your

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
shut the pump off now you take your

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:33.110 
shut the pump off now you take your
return<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:26.040> now<00:04:27.040> run<00:04:27.760> that<00:04:29.160> into<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.400> kettle

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.210 

okay<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.360> can<00:04:34.510> reopen<00:04:34.660> that<00:04:34.960> valve<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.620> now

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
okay so I can reopen that valve and now

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.800 
okay so I can reopen that valve and now
I'm<00:04:36.400> pumping<00:04:36.820> into<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.120> kettle<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.690> and
