everything you need to know about it

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.400 
everything you need to know about it
from<00:00:26.099> proper<00:00:26.519> hand<00:00:26.699> positionings<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:28.050> all<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
from proper hand positionings to all the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.800 
from proper hand positionings to all the
notes<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.769> make<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.460> normal<00:00:30.269> saxophone

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
notes that make up the normal saxophone

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.049 
notes that make up the normal saxophone
range<00:00:31.080> which<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.349> from<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> low<00:00:31.890> B<00:00:32.099> flat<00:00:32.130> to

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
hand on the very lowest note that's low

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.610 
hand on the very lowest note that's low
C<00:05:01.680> now<00:05:02.680> remember<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.790> middle<00:05:04.720> C<00:05:04.930> was<00:05:05.229> just

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
C now remember the the middle C was just

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.219 
C now remember the the middle C was just
your<00:05:06.010> middle<00:05:06.220> finger<00:05:06.700> everything<00:05:07.450> else<00:05:07.660> is<00:05:07.900> up

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
your middle finger everything else is up

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.310 
your middle finger everything else is up
so<00:05:09.130> just<00:05:09.340> your<00:05:09.520> middle<00:05:09.669> finger<00:05:10.120> let's<00:05:10.990> start

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
so just your middle finger let's start

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.020 
so just your middle finger let's start
there<00:05:11.530> so<00:05:11.770> middle<00:05:12.100> finger<00:05:12.870> index<00:05:13.870> finger<00:05:14.850> to<00:05:15.850> B

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
there so middle finger index finger to B

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:26.580 
there so middle finger index finger to B
so<00:05:16.450> c<00:05:16.870> b<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:18.840> g<00:05:20.789> f<00:05:21.789> e<00:05:22.270> d<00:05:23.080> c<00:05:24.780> that's<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:26.080> C<00:05:26.260> scale

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
so c b a g f e d c that's the C scale

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.560 
so c b a g f e d c that's the C scale
going<00:05:27.039> down<00:05:28.560> C<00:05:29.789> call<00:05:30.789> it<00:05:30.940> backwards<00:05:31.330> if<00:05:31.479> you

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
going down C call it backwards if you

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.460 
going down C call it backwards if you
like<00:05:31.750> bits<00:05:31.990> a<00:05:33.120> up<00:05:34.120> would<00:05:34.690> be<00:05:34.720> starting<00:05:35.380> from

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
like bits a up would be starting from

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.080 
like bits a up would be starting from
the<00:05:35.620> low<00:05:35.770> C<00:05:36.070> going<00:05:36.370> up<00:05:36.550> c<00:05:37.030> d<00:05:37.300> e<00:05:37.330> f<00:05:37.539> g<00:05:37.780> a<00:05:38.050> DC<00:05:38.770> and

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
the low C going up c d e f g a DC and

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:47.400 
the low C going up c d e f g a DC and
going<00:05:40.090> down<00:05:40.240> as<00:05:40.510> c<00:05:41.130> b<00:05:42.130> a<00:05:42.520> g<00:05:43.270> f<00:05:44.139> e<00:05:44.740> d<00:05:45.430> c<00:05:46.410> learning

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
going down as c b a g f e d c learning

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.290 
going down as c b a g f e d c learning
the<00:05:47.530> C<00:05:47.710> scale<00:05:48.010> on<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.430> saxophone<00:05:48.760> is<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.000> great

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
the C scale on the saxophone is a great

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.330 
the C scale on the saxophone is a great
way<00:05:49.599> to<00:05:49.630> start<00:05:50.020> because<00:05:50.260> it<00:05:50.530> incorporates

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
way to start because it incorporates

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.560 
way to start because it incorporates
most<00:05:51.940> of<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.210> notes<00:05:52.389> on<00:05:53.289> both<00:05:53.889> hands<00:05:54.190> and

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
most of the notes on both hands and

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.210 
most of the notes on both hands and
you're<00:05:55.570> also<00:05:55.780> learning<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:56.620> eighth<00:05:56.770> notes<00:05:57.010> of

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
you're also learning the eighth notes of

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.040 
you're also learning the eighth notes of
the<00:05:57.340> C<00:05:57.490> major<00:05:57.520> scale<00:05:57.880> so<00:05:58.360> that's<00:05:58.510> really<00:05:58.750> two

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
the C major scale so that's really two

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.350 
the C major scale so that's really two
lessons<00:05:59.289> combined<00:05:59.919> a<00:06:00.220> sax<00:06:00.610> lesson<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.270> a

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
lessons combined a sax lesson and a

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.680 
lessons combined a sax lesson and a
musical<00:06:01.810> theory<00:06:02.110> lesson<00:06:02.849> so<00:06:03.849> remember<00:06:04.599> to

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
musical theory lesson so remember to

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.320 
musical theory lesson so remember to
look<00:06:04.840> at<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.160> scale<00:06:06.160> written<00:06:06.430> out<00:06:06.669> below<00:06:07.030> and

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
look at the scale written out below and

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.089 
look at the scale written out below and
read<00:06:07.840> what<00:06:08.110> I've<00:06:08.200> got<00:06:08.410> to<00:06:08.530> say<00:06:08.680> about<00:06:08.710> it

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
read what I've got to say about it
