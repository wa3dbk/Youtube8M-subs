little<00:00:07.020> different<00:00:07.470> than<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> normal<00:00:07.740> video<00:00:08.610> for

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
little different than a normal video for

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.049 
little different than a normal video for
me<00:00:09.210> basically<00:00:09.990> I've<00:00:10.590> had<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:11.340> lot<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.820> these

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
me basically I've had a lot of these

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.759 
me basically I've had a lot of these
clips<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:12.599> my<00:00:12.630> harddrive<00:00:12.960> for<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> really<00:00:13.620> long

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
clips on my harddrive for a really long

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.049 
clips on my harddrive for a really long
time<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.040> I've<00:00:14.429> always<00:00:14.670> thought<00:00:14.790> they<00:00:15.030> were

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
time and I've always thought they were

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.750 
time and I've always thought they were
funny<00:00:15.450> but<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:16.470> could<00:00:16.890> never<00:00:17.070> really<00:00:17.400> figure

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
funny but I could never really figure

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.730
