gladiatori so one of my major bugbears
is<00:00:06.450> with<00:00:06.839> armor<00:00:07.529> in<00:00:07.859> computer<00:00:08.519> games<00:00:08.760> and

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
is with armor in computer games and

is with armor in computer games and
films<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:09.960> TV<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.880> my<00:00:11.880> main<00:00:12.120> bugbear<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:12.990> main

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
films and TV and my main bugbear my main

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.039 
films and TV and my main bugbear my main
issue<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.920> with<00:00:14.280> armor<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.870> is

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
issue with with armor is that it is

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.790 
issue with with armor is that it is
treated<00:00:16.470> as<00:00:16.590> cost<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.250> not<00:00:17.910> as<00:00:18.150> armor<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.650> if

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
treated as cost you not as armor so if

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.220 
treated as cost you not as armor so if
we<00:00:19.949> look<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.490> film<00:00:20.789> like<00:00:21.080> Excalibur<00:00:22.080> for
