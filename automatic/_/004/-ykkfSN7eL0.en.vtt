acids now I'm going to review very
quickly<00:00:28.670> what<00:00:28.940> Omega<00:00:29.210> threes<00:00:29.539> do<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:29.900> you'll

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
quickly what Omega threes do and you'll

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.450 
quickly what Omega threes do and you'll
know<00:00:30.230> why<00:00:30.440> they're<00:00:30.619> so<00:00:30.800> important<00:00:31.220> I<00:00:31.280> call

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
know why they're so important I call

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.520 
know why they're so important I call
them<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:31.700> wellness<00:00:32.149> molecules<00:00:32.750> they're<00:00:33.350> good

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
them the wellness molecules they're good

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.200 
them the wellness molecules they're good
for<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:33.739> brain<00:00:33.920> they're<00:00:34.610> good<00:00:34.760> for<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:35.000> heart

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
for the brain they're good for the heart

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.450 
for the brain they're good for the heart
they<00:00:35.720> help<00:00:35.930> lower<00:00:36.140> blood<00:00:36.350> pressure<00:00:36.470> they<00:00:37.160> keep

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
they help lower blood pressure they keep

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.340 
they help lower blood pressure they keep
your<00:00:37.670> cell<00:00:37.940> membranes<00:00:38.450> healthy<00:00:38.930> why<00:00:39.110> do<00:00:39.170> you

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
your cell membranes healthy why do you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.630 
your cell membranes healthy why do you
care<00:00:39.620> because<00:00:39.739> you<00:00:40.010> want<00:00:40.220> those<00:00:40.400> cell

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
care because you want those cell

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.760 
care because you want those cell
membranes<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:41.180> allow<00:00:41.810> information<00:00:42.079> to<00:00:42.500> come

membranes to allow information to come

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.139 
membranes to allow information to come
in<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.280> out<00:00:43.430> you<00:00:43.640> want<00:00:43.790> them<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:44.000> be<00:00:44.120> good

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
in and out you want them to be good

cell membranes which Omega threes help

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.620 
cell membranes which Omega threes help
with<00:00:49.070> is<00:00:49.250> like<00:00:49.670> having<00:00:49.910> a<00:00:50.149> computer<00:00:50.600> that

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
with is like having a computer that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.240 
with is like having a computer that
doesn't<00:00:50.930> get<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:51.140> virus<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.680> know<00:00:51.800> everything

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
doesn't get a virus you know everything

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.130 
doesn't get a virus you know everything
just<00:00:52.280> goes<00:00:52.579> fast<00:00:52.970> it<00:00:53.210> doesn't<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:53.840> know<00:00:53.870> if

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
just goes fast it doesn't you know if

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.330 
just goes fast it doesn't you know if
you're<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.320> Mac<00:00:54.559> user<00:00:54.590> you<00:00:55.010> don't<00:00:55.160> see<00:00:55.309> that

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
you're a Mac user you don't see that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.069 
you're a Mac user you don't see that
little<00:00:55.579> rainbow<00:00:56.030> of<00:00:56.059> doom<00:00:56.450> that<00:00:56.750> goes<00:00:56.930> on

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
little rainbow of doom that goes on

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.440 
little rainbow of doom that goes on
forever<00:00:57.380> and<00:00:57.620> ever<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.190> that's<00:00:58.940> what<00:00:59.149> you<00:00:59.270> want

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
forever and ever so that's what you want

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.880 
forever and ever so that's what you want
your<00:00:59.660> cell<00:00:59.840> membranes<00:01:00.200> you<00:01:00.320> want<00:01:00.500> that<00:01:00.680> kind

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
your cell membranes you want that kind

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.490 
your cell membranes you want that kind
of<00:01:01.040> fast<00:01:01.340> communication<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.360> when<00:01:02.840> Omega<00:01:03.200> 3s

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
of fast communication and when Omega 3s

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.380 
of fast communication and when Omega 3s
get<00:01:03.680> incorporated<00:01:03.980> into<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.790> cell<00:01:04.969> membranes

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
get incorporated into the cell membranes

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.969 
get incorporated into the cell membranes
that<00:01:05.810> means<00:01:05.990> everything<00:01:06.350> just<00:01:06.469> works<00:01:06.740> better

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
that means everything just works better

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.609 
that means everything just works better

of<00:01:09.649> good<00:01:09.799> stuff<00:01:09.829> so<00:01:10.670> in<00:01:11.229> addition<00:01:12.229> quills<00:01:12.950> are

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
of good stuff so in addition quills are

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.270

very highly concentrated in an amazing

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.459 
very highly concentrated in an amazing
antioxidant<00:01:16.639> called<00:01:17.240> as<00:01:17.450> tax<00:01:17.869> event<00:01:18.289> and

that's the stuff that gives salmon its

that's the stuff that gives salmon its
normal<00:01:21.229> red<00:01:21.439> color<00:01:21.740> because<00:01:22.100> salmon<00:01:22.459> actually

is<00:01:24.799> also<00:01:25.219> very<00:01:25.369> good<00:01:25.579> for<00:01:25.639> PMS<00:01:26.149> I<00:01:26.389> talked<00:01:27.139> a

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
is also very good for PMS I talked a

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.510 
is also very good for PMS I talked a
little<00:01:27.409> bit<00:01:27.560> about<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:27.950> one<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:28.159> talked<00:01:28.429> about

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
little bit about this one I talked about

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.300 
little bit about this one I talked about
my<00:01:28.670> PMS<00:01:29.240> cocktail<00:01:29.719> in<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.049> earlier<00:01:30.439> video<00:01:30.740> but

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
my PMS cocktail in the earlier video but

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.249 
my PMS cocktail in the earlier video but
three<00:01:31.639> grams<00:01:31.939> of<00:01:32.149> krill<00:01:32.389> oil<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.719> day<00:01:32.749> seems<00:01:33.200> to

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
three grams of krill oil a day seems to

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.410 
three grams of krill oil a day seems to
work<00:01:33.469> even<00:01:33.770> better<00:01:33.950> than<00:01:34.340> regular<00:01:34.579> omega-3

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
work even better than regular omega-3

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.510 
work even better than regular omega-3
there<00:01:35.869> may<00:01:36.020> be<00:01:36.049> something<00:01:36.439> about<00:01:36.679> the<00:01:36.920> omega-3

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
there may be something about the omega-3

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.160 
there may be something about the omega-3
and<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.849> synergistic<00:01:38.329> nutrients<00:01:39.020> that<00:01:39.109> are

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
and the synergistic nutrients that are

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.690 
and the synergistic nutrients that are
also<00:01:39.409> found<00:01:39.709> in<00:01:39.889> krill<00:01:40.159> that<00:01:40.340> work<00:01:40.490> together

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
also found in krill that work together

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.550 
also found in krill that work together
to<00:01:40.999> kind<00:01:41.149> of<00:01:41.240> potentiate<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:41.929> effect<00:01:42.380> and

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
to kind of potentiate the effect and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.830 
to kind of potentiate the effect and
make<00:01:42.679> it<00:01:42.799> better<00:01:42.950> all<00:01:43.249> around<00:01:43.450> in<00:01:44.450> another
