00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.519
 Hello everyone, today we talk about weapons 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:09.150
 long that means frey and lances 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.490
 boomerang 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.549
 we are not exactly to see the lances for 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.619
 first in the normal game the spears yes 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.650
 can only be found in the various 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 screen we have the normal orange of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.060
 trident and then the dark spear in the hard 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.089
 mod 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.119
 as usual we have a peak balto 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:32.360
 this case only imagined morning but 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.039
 they put it as they say anyway of cobalt 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:40.559
 michael's halberd and paris to lovers 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:45.829
 melting all together as in the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.829
 we usually have a super lance of 7 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.350
 utility and use of lances then 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.200
 do not let yourself be stung by the graphic effect 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.090
 who do why like all weapons do not 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.240
 I can walk through the walls unless 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.240
 there are two spaces 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:09.120
 as all created them to pass 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.640
 utilities you launched own 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.710
 reach the farthest enemies 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.310
 so compared to a sword it can be 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.710
 useful for a 7 warrior to attack 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:28.220
 place the anti all spears pierce i 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.840
 Enemies then boss case usually 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.200
 composed of multiple sections we can strike 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.899
 multiple parts at the same time and others 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 techniques is useful with the lance and if 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.170
 play in multiplayer 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.440
 you can have a warrior in front is a 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.740
 another pass behind with the lance that 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.110
 helps the courier found has now 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.509
 let's look at the flame 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:58.830
 in the game normal phrase can be 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:02.130
 cars found we have the pole or art with 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:07.110
 the blue moon lobster at the level of 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.959
 power the second we find then 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.950
 move on to knowing they have possibilities 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.950
 to set fire to the enemies 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.850
 now let's go to a flame 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.430
 so towards or the harpoon the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.580
 behavior is similar even if it has a 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.560
 larger radius and a little speed 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.500
 greater because unlike normal 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.530
 play that once they hit 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.480
 goal when always need a 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.989
 moment to shoot again 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.430
 and if we pressed the button if it 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:47.209
 we carry around with us 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:50.430
 you can see the fired harpoon continuously 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:57.269
 so we are close to enemies we succeed 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.599
 just bursting to finish in the art 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.170
 mod 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:05.030
 we have the little dow which is a play that yes 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.290
 can only manufacture you can see 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:13.109
 later higher and if you have 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.560
 noticed for a second that point of 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.200
 question 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.329
 it means that I used the dÃ©bat of the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.609
 confusion that the enemy means 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.200
 they simply don't run away 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.599
 attack more changes in direction for 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.460
 a few seconds 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.140
 finally we move on to the boomerangs 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.590
 in the normal game we begin to find a 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.040
 boomerang 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.040
 simple 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:44.350
 Short little harm the boom was 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:49.270
 enchanted this is found can 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:52.330
 then apply the turn 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.710
 chakra crispi species for this 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.210
 we can be it even if to the form 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.580
 different from the boom now that the brothers 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.610
 of the same difference that bounces you 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.720
 can bounce on the walls in the large 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:12.370
 decidedly greater to then move on to 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:17.799
 fleming a boomerang modification 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:20.680
 all enchanted fast this effect 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.160
 structure makes itself focus like 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.740
 any concept done with les 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.380
 top herbiers and to finish when we have 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.600
 the hard bop we can build the discuss 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:36.940
 light that really an absurd weapon because 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.210
 the comparison has an incredible range 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.220
 of the other boomerangs 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.840
 you have to see I can't do it soon 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.229
 not even to experience the maximum rocket here 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.720
 inside 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:53.990
 has rebounds several times and we can 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:58.080
 throw 5 at the same time you know 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.599
 a powerful weapon with regard to 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.940
 long weapons or those that have one 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.240
 certain thrown we said for this is 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.110
 all 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.110
 see you next time
