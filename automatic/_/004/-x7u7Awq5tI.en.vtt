00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 this is done to youtube sincerely 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.540
 Welcome to a new skin show 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.849
 gives a new skin the sdr or it 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.750
 Give it up for the turn if that is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.230
 the gladiators greven 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:20.250
 was so does the whole of the guy 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 from behind from the front of the page and he 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.900
 was so cool here again the chin 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.640
 the sayings have not changed 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.500
 but the attacks look like and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.640
 The recall of the callback is the hottest 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.640
 at all, look at this 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.690
 and the screaming timelines and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.050
 Now we'll take a look at the whole time 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.730
 in the game, do not be surprised 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.500
 that up there when de deo is when the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.280
 that is a good colleague of mine and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.570
 we share a pc server and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.600
 That's why we just want to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.000
 Now look at how the whole thing looks like 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:10.830
 sees the content of which is field 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.869
 still the same that w there 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.190
 will for example red but try 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.700
 we kinda like a kid 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.460
 to get 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.990
 that little bit problematic because 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.690
 it's still a bit here, too 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.690
 reggae is on the servers 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.040
 but I think we'll get there already 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.649
 we simply times purely that we 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.649
 always getting a bit low life 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:51.060
 that its multi user just the multi 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:55.310
 did you ever see them like that ? 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.310
 is just as always that hurt that knee 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 looks really nice too 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.380
 yes that was it, so to speak 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.700
 Once upon a time you have that 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.660
 times the attacks seen against the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.770
 gladiators meet 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.090
 but as it gets now that 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.220
 tattoo changes if he stops 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.060
 the sound of the blades starts to light up 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.349
 if the clou has activated and that is 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.390
 stop 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.910
 Once again that makes it necessary 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.239
 if he has activated bio and who 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.959
 That's what it looks like 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.800
 and again his callback and that's it 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.720
 for me then already 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.360
 then you have the new gladiators 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.540
 ravens king seen thank you bye to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.540
 then
