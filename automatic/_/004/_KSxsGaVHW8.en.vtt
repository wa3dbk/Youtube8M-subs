display or a VGA display using a special
adapter<00:00:44.770> let's<00:00:45.770> see<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.070> setup<00:00:46.430> using<00:00:46.790> the

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
adapter let's see the setup using the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.850 
adapter let's see the setup using the
onboard<00:00:47.170> HDMI<00:00:48.170> port<00:00:49.210> first<00:00:50.210> connect<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.170> HDMI

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
onboard HDMI port first connect the HDMI

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.610 
onboard HDMI port first connect the HDMI
output<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.610> your<00:00:52.820> screen<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.870> HDMI<00:00:54.590> port

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
output of your screen to the HDMI port

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.270 
output of your screen to the HDMI port
as<00:00:55.040> shown<00:00:55.400> here<00:00:55.730> now<00:00:56.440> power<00:00:57.440> up<00:00:57.590> your<00:00:57.860> system

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
as shown here now power up your system

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.970 
as shown here now power up your system
it<00:00:58.600> is<00:00:59.600> important<00:01:00.080> to<00:01:00.200> notice<00:01:00.410> that<00:01:00.590> when

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
it is important to notice that when

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.460 
it is important to notice that when
using<00:01:01.460> this<00:01:01.580> port<00:01:01.970> you<00:01:02.510> will<00:01:02.660> not<00:01:02.870> get<00:01:03.200> any

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
using this port you will not get any

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.910 
using this port you will not get any
video<00:01:03.770> until<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.759> get<00:01:04.940> into<00:01:05.210> Windows<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:06.710> is

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
video until you get into Windows this is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.850 
video until you get into Windows this is
the<00:01:07.070> normal<00:01:07.430> behavior<00:01:07.520> of<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:07.970> machine<00:01:08.800> for<00:01:09.800> a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
the normal behavior of the machine for a

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.650 
the normal behavior of the machine for a
new<00:01:10.009> system<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:10.640> might<00:01:10.880> take<00:01:11.119> up<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.330> 30

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
new system it might take up to 30

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:19.210 
new system it might take up to 30
seconds<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.530> boot<00:01:12.710> into<00:01:12.920> windows<00:01:17.950> now<00:01:18.950> let's

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
seconds to boot into windows now let's

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.859 
seconds to boot into windows now let's
see<00:01:19.340> what<00:01:19.490> happens<00:01:19.790> when<00:01:20.030> we<00:01:20.150> use<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.479> Nvidia

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
see what happens when we use the Nvidia

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.710 
see what happens when we use the Nvidia
video<00:01:21.050> card<00:01:21.500> connectors<00:01:22.150> simply<00:01:23.150> plug<00:01:23.509> a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
video card connectors simply plug a

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.020 
video card connectors simply plug a
display<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.290> any<00:01:24.680> other<00:01:24.920> ports<00:01:25.220> on<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.490> Nvidia

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
display to any other ports on the Nvidia

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.920 
display to any other ports on the Nvidia
card<00:01:27.640> for<00:01:28.640> example<00:01:28.729> here<00:01:29.330> we're<00:01:29.479> using<00:01:29.509> the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
card for example here we're using the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.859 
card for example here we're using the
DVI<00:01:30.320> connector<00:01:34.210> remember<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.540> use<00:01:35.720> the

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
DVI connector remember that to use the

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.200 
DVI connector remember that to use the
mini<00:01:36.080> HDMI<00:01:36.770> port<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.190> may<00:01:37.370> need<00:01:37.580> a<00:01:37.640> special

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
mini HDMI port you may need a special

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.930 
mini HDMI port you may need a special
adapter<00:01:38.500> using<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:39.800> connection<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.490> will

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
adapter using this connection you will

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.660 
adapter using this connection you will
see<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.270> video<00:01:41.540> on<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:42.110> screen<00:01:42.470> almost<00:01:42.740> as<00:01:43.460> soon

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
see a video on the screen almost as soon

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:58.039 
see a video on the screen almost as soon
as<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.970> turn<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.240> computer<00:01:44.810> on

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.899 

now<00:01:58.740> let's<00:01:59.219> plug<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.670> two<00:01:59.909> screens<00:02:01.789> for<00:02:02.789> this

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
now let's plug in two screens for this

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.569 
now let's plug in two screens for this
example<00:02:03.299> we're<00:02:03.570> going<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.719> use<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.079> onboard

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
example we're going to use the onboard

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.449 
example we're going to use the onboard
HDMI<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:06.570> DVI<00:02:06.960> port<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.799> Nvidia<00:02:08.069> card

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
HDMI and the DVI port on the Nvidia card

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:17.660 
HDMI and the DVI port on the Nvidia card
at<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> same<00:02:08.759> time

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.880 

when<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.330> start<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.690> computer<00:02:19.140> up<00:02:19.290> you're

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
when you start the computer up you're

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
when you start the computer up you're
going<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.040> get<00:02:20.190> video<00:02:20.490> at<00:02:20.670> all<00:02:20.819> times<00:02:21.150> on<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
going to get video at all times on the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.720 
going to get video at all times on the
monitor<00:02:22.230> plugged<00:02:22.709> into<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.160> Nvidia<00:02:23.520> video

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
