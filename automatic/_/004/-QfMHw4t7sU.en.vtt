hi<00:00:00.510> I<00:00:00.539> am<00:00:00.840> Carlos<00:00:01.380> Madera<00:00:02.060> heavy<00:00:03.060> equipment

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hi I am Carlos Madera heavy equipment

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.320 
hi I am Carlos Madera heavy equipment
operator<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.350> training<00:00:04.770> here<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.700> Deep<00:00:06.120> Creek

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
operator and training here in Deep Creek

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.030 
operator and training here in Deep Creek
construction<00:00:06.960> school<00:00:07.200> here<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.649> show<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:07.919> how

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
construction school here to show you how

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.870 
construction school here to show you how
to<00:00:08.670> determine<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.750> safe<00:00:09.990> working<00:00:10.460> load<00:00:11.460> for

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
to determine the safe working load for

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.490 
to determine the safe working load for
this<00:00:12.030> three-quarter<00:00:12.809> inch<00:00:12.960> rope<00:00:14.120> so

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
this three-quarter inch rope so

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.310 
this three-quarter inch rope so
determine<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.940> safe<00:00:18.289> working<00:00:19.289> load<00:00:20.689> for<00:00:21.689> this

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
determine the safe working load for this

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.609 
determine the safe working load for this
very<00:00:22.650> quarter<00:00:22.980> inch<00:00:24.650> rope<00:00:27.140> there<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.349> four

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
very quarter inch rope there are four

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.410 
very quarter inch rope there are four
steps<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.130> must<00:00:29.519> fall<00:00:29.730> first<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.650> put<00:00:32.420> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
steps you must fall first is to put the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:43.619 
steps you must fall first is to put the
rope<00:00:35.480> diameter<00:00:36.480> into<00:00:37.700> 1/8

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.920 

so<00:00:44.500> in<00:00:44.649> this<00:00:44.800> case<00:00:45.039> the<00:00:45.190> three-quarter-inch

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
so in this case the three-quarter-inch

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.450 
so in this case the three-quarter-inch
would<00:00:46.930> be<00:00:47.760> six<00:00:48.760> over<00:00:49.030> 80<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.730> step<00:00:52.059> two<00:00:53.460> would

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
would be six over 80 then step two would

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.930 
would be six over 80 then step two would
be<00:00:54.640> to<00:00:55.230> multiply<00:00:57.839> split<00:00:58.839> that<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.409> top<00:00:59.649> number

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.969 

by<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.000> top<00:01:04.479> number

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.660 

which<00:01:09.969> would<00:01:10.180> be<00:01:10.439> six<00:01:11.439> times<00:01:11.619> it<00:01:11.950> would<00:01:12.520> equal

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
which would be six times it would equal

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.719 
which would be six times it would equal
just<00:01:13.270> 30<00:01:13.630> 30<00:01:15.210> step<00:01:16.210> number<00:01:16.390> three<00:01:17.310> would<00:01:18.310> be<00:01:18.340> to

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
just 30 30 step number three would be to

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:29.580 
just 30 30 step number three would be to
multiply<00:01:23.429> that<00:01:24.429> by<00:01:24.490> Tsar<00:01:24.970> Constance<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
multiply that by Tsar Constance and

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.609 
multiply that by Tsar Constance and
there<00:01:30.310> are<00:01:30.429> four<00:01:30.640> constants<00:01:31.240> for<00:01:32.200> each<00:01:32.289> test

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
there are four constants for each test

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.719 
there are four constants for each test
route

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.999 

first<00:01:36.729> we<00:01:36.909> have<00:01:37.060> Manila<00:01:39.869> which<00:01:40.869> is<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.380> constant

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
first we have Manila which is a constant

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:50.130 
first we have Manila which is a constant
at<00:01:42.159> 20<00:01:42.810> poly<00:01:44.069> ethylene<00:01:48.329> which<00:01:49.329> has<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.569> constant

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
at 20 poly ethylene which has a constant

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.109 
at 20 poly ethylene which has a constant
of<00:01:50.289> 30<00:01:50.500> stop<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:52.090> we<00:01:52.209> have<00:01:52.390> polypropylene

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.050 

teza<00:01:58.119> constant<00:01:58.780> has<00:01:58.989> 40<00:01:59.470> and<00:02:00.569> we<00:02:01.569> have<00:02:01.720> nylon

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
teza constant has 40 and we have nylon

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.690 
teza constant has 40 and we have nylon
which<00:02:04.060> has<00:02:04.270> its<00:02:04.539> constant<00:02:05.079> at<00:02:05.259> 60<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.549> once<00:02:09.549> you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
which has its constant at 60 so once you

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.099 
which has its constant at 60 so once you
do<00:02:09.849> that<00:02:11.010> we<00:02:12.010> have<00:02:12.190> 36<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.120> then<00:02:13.810> we<00:02:13.989> have

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
do that we have 36 and then we have

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:18.000 
do that we have 36 and then we have
nylons<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.670> multiply<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.510> by<00:02:16.569> 60<00:02:17.230> which

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
nylons so we multiply that by 60 which

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.390 
nylons so we multiply that by 60 which
would<00:02:18.190> give<00:02:18.400> us<00:02:19.590> 2160<00:02:21.120> step<00:02:22.120> number<00:02:22.269> four<00:02:23.400> this

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
would give us 2160 step number four this

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.000 
would give us 2160 step number four this
would<00:02:24.609> be<00:02:24.790> answer<00:02:25.359> is<00:02:25.510> in<00:02:25.690> pounds

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.390 

so<00:02:32.010> our<00:02:32.129> answer<00:02:32.489> would<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:33.379> 2,000<00:02:34.790> 160<00:02:35.790> pounds

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
so our answer would be 2,000 160 pounds

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.759 
so our answer would be 2,000 160 pounds
so<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.790> our<00:02:39.090> safe<00:02:39.360> working<00:02:39.689> load<00:02:40.019> for<00:02:40.409> the

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
so that is our safe working load for the

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.720 
so that is our safe working load for the
3/4<00:02:41.519> inch<00:02:41.549> thank<00:02:42.540> you
