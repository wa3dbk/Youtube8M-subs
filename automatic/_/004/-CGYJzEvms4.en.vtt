00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.830
 hello very good to all youtube people 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:10.360
 and kevin col I come to bring you a 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:13.090
 Minecraft tutorial which is a tutorial 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.720
 a tutorial on how to change the letters 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.370
 of the enchantment table since this 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.870
 track 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:26.280
 of which you have not understand is nothing 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:28.830
 that is, I do not know what language is 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.570
 and look at this it seems I do not understand you 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.220
 nothing is like making it change to lyrics 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 to Spanish good not exactly in 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.520
 Spanish in English but with lyrics 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.430
 that in English was the bonus read well or if 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.480
 it does not translate it 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.220
 a way that character is with two 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.770
 demands 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.710
 flat h and a little book 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.110
 here we already have a table enchantment and 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.860
 well let's go 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.860
 to that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:13.140
 and we close that because here we close and what 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.580
 what we are going to do is press the key 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.649
 that what we do get out of this is not what 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.390
 we leave pressed that we get out of that 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:26.790
 and more cr and it comes out this one runs a 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.710
 running appears in English is also 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.170
 good but the other way expose to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.170
 who in search we look for 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.070
 here it appears but obviously more 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.040
 fast this way of processing and err 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.080
 that would be run and the r rubén then then 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.869
 we write here in this part that 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.690
 we believe percent percent 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:58.680
 ap p2p app data data dating and by 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.360
 hundred again we will accept and here 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.250
 it can already be a bit where program 0 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.720
 it's always pretty first milestone if 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 they have minecraft obviously always going to 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.429
 be of first point minecraft that is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.549
 they give you a double click 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.420
 and one that looks like a lot of things 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.950
 let's read, do not get tangled up and we give you a happing 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.019
 two 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.140
 and we give him here in this we look for the 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:26.129
 minecraft dot heart this must be this 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.540
 we give you click right click we give here 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:33.989
 in April as and in winrar follow in wii 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.710
 rare to another good program me that if you 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.210
 we click right and left 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.190
 our relationship 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.060
 I have seen this 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.300
 here we have this here all the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.030
 folders where you can put mons 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.520
 and all that is all that 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.730
 on map 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:01.659
 ok then we go something 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.659
 is up below him and barber 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.049
 the evans arrival forum then 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.000
 we give the latter this does not lend 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.040
 attention to the last, the last, the last 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.409
 that says default and alternatiba general 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.099
 Here you can see some letters that can not be seen 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.569
 since this is blank, not like this 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.480
 is blank and this is transparent 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.659
 well you do not see practically three for 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.389
 that half see what happened here and there 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:35.430
 will realize that there are letters and there I will 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:38.280
 approach the alternative because here to 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.169
 who can see it, put your head towards 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.560
 the right and there they see the electric in 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:47.760
 true then these are the letters in 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.250
 Spanish are these and these are the letters a 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.790
 all ugly but what we have to do 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.240
 is 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.580
 put here 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:05.330
 and change the name and we are going to copy 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:07.940
 The control is copied and we eliminate it 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.260
 remove 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:17.540
 and this we put here change the name 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.389
 paste or control and paste there is 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.320
 we passed it here no one sinks 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:31.699
 thing that option is precisely to 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:33.860
 accept and it will be in Spanish now and 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.490
 as you can see one can not see but 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:41.259
 well I have an idea 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.259
 well that after 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.280
 Well, we already have this table in 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.240
 treatment in Spanish and we're going to 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.240
 check now let's go to minecraft point 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.240
 Minecraft 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.139
 and came 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.870
 and well this is only works 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.250
 with the texture of minecraft the normal no 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.960
 it works and if you want to put the 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:13.229
 texture of a graph that does not or the only thing 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.840
 what would it be then would you have the 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:22.069
 matba jr and update it update the 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.069
 textures and there if you put some letters 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.750
 do not 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.230
 and well here I had not put a 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.230
 enchantment 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:46.669
 now let's right click on sing 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.599
 anything, wait and I put on a 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.599
 sword or something 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:59.320
 we will do this 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:02.230
 lath sword and Here and tachán 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.530
 here this is in English but that's what 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:09.850
 can that the electrics are like a 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:13.630
 little bit of riddle here lighting 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:17.400
 of the coso is then it would mean hit 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:20.170
 more or less then there is a summary 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.300
