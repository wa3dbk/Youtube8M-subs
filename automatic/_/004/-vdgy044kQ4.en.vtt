00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.840
 pass the kernel anything 11 to the folder 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.940
 where you downloaded the x10 flash in the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.280
 firmware folder is then open the x10 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.250
 flash tool 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.350
 once the x10 flash is opened they go on 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.070
 the button that says flash and select the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.430
 kernel swims 11 and they give ok we wait for

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.640
 they have to connect their xperia x8 in mode 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.659

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.659

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.000
