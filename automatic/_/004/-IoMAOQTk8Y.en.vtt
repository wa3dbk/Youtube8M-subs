00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.880 
going to have to be loosing the pocket
moving<00:00:58.379> around<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.960> bill<00:01:00.960> softens<00:01:01.440> has<00:01:01.620> zero

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
moving around so bill softens has zero

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.130 
moving around so bill softens has zero
turnovers<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.699> throughout<00:01:02.940> four<00:01:03.239> games<00:01:03.510> so

stay<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.570> game<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:10.439> my<00:01:11.130> prediction<00:01:11.400> I

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
stay in this game now my prediction I

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.929 
stay in this game now my prediction I
believe<00:01:13.189> Chicago<00:01:14.189> will<00:01:14.400> probably<00:01:14.729> end<00:01:14.820> up

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
believe Chicago will probably end up

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.520 
believe Chicago will probably end up
with<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> wind<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.200> great

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
with the wind I think it's a great

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.350 
with the wind I think it's a great
opportunity<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> bills<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.670> step<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
opportunity for the bills and step up in

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.359 
opportunity for the bills and step up in
the<00:01:18.479> league<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.979> show<00:01:19.979> everybody<00:01:20.189> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the league and show everybody that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
the league and show everybody that
they're<00:01:20.729> contenders<00:01:21.240> which<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.869> still<00:01:22.080> believe

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
they're contenders which I still believe

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.440 
they're contenders which I still believe
they<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.950> Chicago's<00:01:23.520> probably<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> little

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
they are for Chicago's probably a little

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.740 
they are for Chicago's probably a little

league and our third and fourth down
conversion<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:53.200> terrible<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.010> we<00:02:54.520> need<00:02:54.640> to

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
conversion is terrible so we need to

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.390 
conversion is terrible so we need to
step<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.120> up<00:02:55.210> and<00:02:55.650> take<00:02:56.650> some<00:02:56.830> chances<00:02:56.860> were

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
step it up and take some chances were

being<00:02:57.610> kind<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:57.910> conservative<00:02:58.210> here<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:59.040> now

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
being kind of conservative here so now

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.280 
being kind of conservative here so now
the<00:03:00.580> defense<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.180> full<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.600> speed<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.080> youth

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the defense is full of speed and youth

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.040 
the defense is full of speed and youth
we<00:03:02.890> have<00:03:03.070> three<00:03:03.610> or<00:03:03.670> four<00:03:03.850> rookies<00:03:04.050> starting

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
we have three or four rookies starting

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.320 
we have three or four rookies starting
and<00:03:05.260> another<00:03:05.560> one<00:03:05.740> rotating<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.610> what<00:03:07.210> we

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
and another one rotating in so what we

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330 
and another one rotating in so what we
need<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.570> do<00:03:07.660> is<00:03:07.780> step<00:03:07.990> it<00:03:08.140> up<00:03:08.230> play<00:03:08.740> tough<00:03:09.040> and

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
need to do is step it up play tough and

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.820 
need to do is step it up play tough and
give<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:09.820> one<00:03:10.090> hundred<00:03:10.210> percent<00:03:10.360> gives<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.410> the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
give it one hundred percent gives a the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.410 
give it one hundred percent gives a the
biggest<00:03:12.160> problem<00:03:12.280> here<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:12.940> two<00:03:13.150> bears

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
biggest problem here is two bears

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.180 
biggest problem here is two bears
defense<00:03:13.930> if<00:03:14.170> we<00:03:14.350> can<00:03:14.530> compete<00:03:14.830> with<00:03:15.010> their

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
defense if we can compete with their

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.310 
defense if we can compete with their
defense<00:03:15.580> were<00:03:15.790> all<00:03:15.970> right<00:03:16.150> right<00:03:16.959> now<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.170> think

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
defense were all right right now I think

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.650 
defense were all right right now I think
the<00:03:17.590> key<00:03:17.890> matchup<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.490> built<00:03:18.820> offensive<00:03:19.450> line

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
the key matchup is built offensive line

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.380 
the key matchup is built offensive line
which<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.230> playing<00:03:20.590> good<00:03:20.860> but<00:03:21.640> it's<00:03:21.970> against

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
which is playing good but it's against

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
which is playing good but it's against
an<00:03:22.570> incredible<00:03:23.170> Bears<00:03:23.550> defensive<00:03:24.550> line<00:03:24.760> in

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
an incredible Bears defensive line in

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.810 
an incredible Bears defensive line in
Brian<00:03:26.410> Urlacher<00:03:26.770> and<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.160> linebacking<00:03:27.520> true

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
Brian Urlacher and the linebacking true

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.480 
Brian Urlacher and the linebacking true
scares<00:03:28.420> me<00:03:28.630> he<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.350> very<00:03:29.920> good<00:03:30.010> news<00:03:30.160> all<00:03:30.459> over

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
scares me he is very good news all over

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.070 
scares me he is very good news all over
the<00:03:30.730> field<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.240> he<00:03:31.420> could<00:03:31.570> cause<00:03:31.840> some<00:03:32.050> damage

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
the field and he could cause some damage

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.710 
the field and he could cause some damage
so<00:03:32.590> we<00:03:33.280> really<00:03:33.640> really<00:03:33.940> really<00:03:34.120> need<00:03:34.270> to<00:03:34.540> step

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
so we really really really need to step
