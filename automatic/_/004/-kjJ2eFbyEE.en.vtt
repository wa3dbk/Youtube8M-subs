down like stone and for this middle

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.170 
down like stone and for this middle
portion<00:04:57.560> on<00:04:57.710> here<00:05:00.430> instead<00:05:01.430> of<00:05:01.490> placing<00:05:01.790> in

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180

portion on here instead of placing in
out<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.540> route<00:05:03.280> i'm<00:05:04.280> going<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.580> put<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:04.850> more
