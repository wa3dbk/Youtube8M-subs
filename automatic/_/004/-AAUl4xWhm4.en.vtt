00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.500 

so<00:00:35.490> that's<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> lead<00:00:35.970> guitar<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.810 
so that's the lead guitar in the
beginning<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:37.050> later<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.250> Jim<00:00:38.430> comes<00:00:38.670> in

with<00:00:38.970> this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.240 

then<00:00:56.870> comes<00:00:57.110> one<00:00:57.350> when<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:57.980> screen<00:00:58.219> comes

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
then comes one when the screen comes

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:10.600 
then comes one when the screen comes
into<00:00:58.790> being<00:00:58.850> because<00:00:59.300> it

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:24.090 

I<00:01:10.960> saw<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:11.990> long<00:01:12.470> time

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.950 

and<00:01:25.100> then<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.430> course<00:01:25.460> stop<00:01:25.909> singing<00:01:26.299> it<00:01:26.720> goes

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
and then of course stop singing it goes

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.990 
and then of course stop singing it goes
like<00:01:27.170> this

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:50.330 

third<00:01:32.000> fret

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:04.240 

the<00:01:51.340> next<00:01:51.640> thing<00:01:51.760> goes<00:01:51.880> like<00:01:52.060> this

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.070 

I<00:02:05.230> use<00:02:06.230> this<00:02:06.470> fresh<00:02:07.130> air

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
I use this fresh air

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:19.309 
I use this fresh air
but<00:02:09.890> then<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:10.280> also<00:02:10.850> in<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.510> middle

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.130 

and<00:02:20.189> icons<00:02:20.549> another<00:02:20.819> if<00:02:21.540> you're<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> beginner<00:02:22.049> I

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
and icons another if you're a beginner I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.289 
and icons another if you're a beginner I
would<00:02:22.349> try<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> play<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.579> sixth<00:02:23.879> fret<00:02:24.030> here

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
would try to play the sixth fret here

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.020 
would try to play the sixth fret here
not<00:02:25.200> because<00:02:25.739> they<00:02:25.950> use<00:02:26.069> bounce<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.760> if<00:02:26.909> you

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
not because they use bounce but if you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.460 
not because they use bounce but if you
are<00:02:27.090> not<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.390> familiar<00:02:27.540> with<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.290> would

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
are not so familiar with it I would

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:43.640 
are not so familiar with it I would
truly<00:02:28.860> use<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.129> sixth<00:02:29.430> fret

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:03:07.750 

great<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.519> goes<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:44.910> this

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.480 

okay<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.210> then<00:03:09.960> comes<00:03:10.200> another<00:03:10.440> if<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:11.340> goes

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
okay so then comes another if that goes

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:22.400 
okay so then comes another if that goes
like<00:03:11.610> this

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.780 

so<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.520> 0<00:03:23.820> for<00:03:24.420> 1<00:03:24.990> -<00:03:25.620> it's<00:03:26.160> all<00:03:26.310> really<00:03:26.460> sorry

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
so it's 0 for 1 - it's all really sorry

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.460 
so it's 0 for 1 - it's all really sorry
and<00:03:27.120> then<00:03:27.390> when<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.600> double<00:03:27.900> kick<00:03:28.050> kicks<00:03:28.290> in

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
and then when the double kick kicks in

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:39.520 
and then when the double kick kicks in
girls<00:03:29.040> like<00:03:29.190> this

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:04:05.920 

that<00:03:40.530> comes<00:03:40.800> this<00:03:40.950> roof

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.600 

and<00:04:06.319> then<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:06.650> just<00:04:06.830> goes<00:04:07.040> down<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.550> the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
and then it just goes down to the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:26.670 
and then it just goes down to the
off-speed<00:04:07.760> like

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.620 

and<00:04:27.680> that's<00:04:27.949> the<00:04:28.100> whole<00:04:28.220> song<00:04:28.460> so<00:04:28.729> good<00:04:29.449> luck
