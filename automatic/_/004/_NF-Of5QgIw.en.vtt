of shaking up and given a new twist and

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.190

aim is to surprise the light and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.810 
aim is to surprise the light and
entertain<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.859> if<00:02:06.950> we<00:02:07.100> can<00:02:07.250> do<00:02:07.399> all<00:02:07.549> three<00:02:07.729> of

entertain and if we can do all three of

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.490 
entertain and if we can do all three of
those<00:02:08.030> then<00:02:08.360> we're<00:02:08.869> on<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.140> winner

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
those then we're on to winner

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.070 
those then we're on to winner
I<00:02:10.590> think<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.910> major<00:02:12.240> change<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.990> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
I think that the major change in the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.950 
I think that the major change in the
show<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:13.830> because<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.490> gone<00:02:14.670> from<00:02:14.910> 20<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.660> 10

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
show is because it's gone from 20 to 10

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.640 
show is because it's gone from 20 to 10
and<00:02:16.260> i<00:02:16.470> think<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:18.750> also<00:02:19.020> means<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
and i think that it also means that the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.360 
and i think that it also means that the
talent<00:02:20.070> has<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.550> be<00:02:20.700> superb<00:02:21.420> because<00:02:22.220> when<00:02:23.220> we

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
talent has to be superb because when we

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.040 
talent has to be superb because when we
used<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.760> do<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.030> top<00:02:24.210> 20<00:02:24.570> we<00:02:24.660> put<00:02:24.900> together

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
used to do the top 20 we put together

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.810 
used to do the top 20 we put together
people<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:26.160> well<00:02:26.310> maybe<00:02:26.370> they

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
people and you think well maybe they

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.670 
people and you think well maybe they
might<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.180> out<00:02:27.300> week<00:02:27.540> one<00:02:27.810> or<00:02:28.080> they<00:02:28.260> might<00:02:28.470> make

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
might be out week one or they might make

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.840 
might be out week one or they might make
it<00:02:28.830> through<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.160> there's<00:02:29.280> always<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.490> dark

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
it through and there's always a dark

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.250 
it through and there's always a dark
horse<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.420> goes<00:02:30.570> right<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> way<00:02:30.990> through<00:02:31.020> to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
horse that goes right the way through to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.860 
horse that goes right the way through to
the<00:02:31.440> end<00:02:31.530> there<00:02:31.740> always<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.600> but<00:02:33.600> at<00:02:33.720> this

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
the end there always is and but at this

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.170 
the end there always is and but at this
point<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.350> going<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.920> nuttin<00:02:35.880> we're

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
point it's going to be a nuttin we're

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.460 
point it's going to be a nuttin we're
not<00:02:36.360> going<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.600> want<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.840> lose<00:02:36.959> anybody

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
not going to want to lose anybody

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.210 
not going to want to lose anybody
actually<00:02:38.400> it's<00:02:38.640> kind<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:38.940> nobody<00:02:40.220> expendable

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
actually it's kind of nobody expendable

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.580 
actually it's kind of nobody expendable
and<00:02:41.610> yet<00:02:42.090> we're<00:02:42.300> gonna<00:02:42.570> have<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.840> do<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.410> it's

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
and yet we're gonna have to do so it's

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.920 
and yet we're gonna have to do so it's
going<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.830> be<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> very<00:02:44.459> interesting<00:02:45.450> show<00:02:45.870> to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
going to be a very interesting show to

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.270 
going to be a very interesting show to
watch<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.380> dancers<00:02:46.770> are<00:02:46.830> definitely

going<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.489> feel<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.730> pressure<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.090> think

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
going to feel the pressure I think

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.780 
going to feel the pressure I think
the<00:02:50.319> dancers<00:02:50.739> from<00:02:50.859> the<00:02:50.920> /<00:02:51.159> seasons<00:02:51.579> are<00:02:51.670> going

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
the dancers from the / seasons are going

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.429 
the dancers from the / seasons are going
to<00:02:51.849> be<00:02:51.909> in<00:02:52.030> every<00:02:52.269> week<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.599> can<00:02:52.749> get<00:02:53.200> all<00:02:53.409> the

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
to be in every week so I can get all the

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.929 
to be in every week so I can get all the
gossip<00:02:53.739> straight<00:02:54.189> away<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.430> don't<00:02:54.700> have<00:02:54.819> to

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
gossip straight away I don't have to

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.539 
gossip straight away I don't have to
wait<00:02:55.060> until<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.420> see<00:02:55.599> them<00:02:55.749> again<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.400> it's

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
wait until I see them again and it's

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.849 
wait until I see them again and it's
also<00:02:57.760> really<00:02:58.209> encouraging<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.139> think<00:02:59.409> to<00:02:59.650> see

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
also really encouraging I think to see

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.069 
also really encouraging I think to see
what<00:03:00.459> they've<00:03:00.849> done<00:03:01.150> with<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.420> opportunity

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
what they've done with the opportunity

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.720 
what they've done with the opportunity
that's<00:03:02.319> been<00:03:02.439> given<00:03:02.799> for<00:03:02.950> them<00:03:03.099> too<00:03:03.280> because<00:03:03.519> I

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
that's been given for them too because I

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.910 
that's been given for them too because I
think<00:03:03.909> that's<00:03:04.480> essentially<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.290> great<00:03:05.650> thing

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
think that's essentially the great thing

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.500 
think that's essentially the great thing
about<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.250> show<00:03:06.459> is<00:03:06.609> it<00:03:06.730> gives<00:03:06.969> them<00:03:07.239> a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
about the show is it gives them a

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.809 
about the show is it gives them a
platform<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.379> be<00:03:08.650> able<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.980> go<00:03:09.340> away<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.519> and

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
platform to be able to go away and and

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.390 
platform to be able to go away and and
do<00:03:10.150> whatever<00:03:10.359> they<00:03:10.629> want<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.019> mean<00:03:11.349> it's<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.370> very

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
do whatever they want I mean it's a very
