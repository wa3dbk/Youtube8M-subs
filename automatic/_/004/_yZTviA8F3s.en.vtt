00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
gain more control with this exercise you

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.640 
gain more control with this exercise you
can<00:01:40.910> progress<00:01:41.090> by<00:01:41.600> lowering<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.170> object<00:01:42.560> that

can progress by lowering the object that
you're<00:01:42.800> squatting<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.400> if<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:45.380> find<00:01:45.619> that<00:01:45.740> you

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
you're squatting to if you find that you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.620 
you're squatting to if you find that you
can<00:01:45.979> only<00:01:46.130> perform<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.729> few<00:01:46.970> reps<00:01:47.240> on<00:01:47.450> each<00:01:47.479> leg

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
can only perform a few reps on each leg

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.030 
can only perform a few reps on each leg
you<00:01:48.470> can<00:01:48.619> also<00:01:48.770> try<00:01:49.130> an<00:01:49.250> alternating<00:01:49.820> version

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
you can also try an alternating version

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.650 
you can also try an alternating version
this<00:01:52.040> requires<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.640> little<00:01:52.850> more<00:01:53.000> coordination

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
this requires a little more coordination

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.600 
this requires a little more coordination
so<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.229> can<00:01:54.350> be<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.470> new<00:01:54.649> challenge<00:01:54.920> all<00:01:55.280> on<00:01:55.460> its

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
so it can be a new challenge all on its

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.250 

as<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:04.210> gain<00:02:04.390> more<00:02:04.600> control<00:02:04.750> with<00:02:05.140> this

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
as you gain more control with this
