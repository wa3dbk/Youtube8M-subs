00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.400
 in all greets friends like this 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.049
 double welcome back to me 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.570
 channel and now I bring you what is a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.789
 review of a bumper courtesy of martín 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.310
 let's see it we see that the presentation 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.500
 it looks very good let's take them out of the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.420
 box so they can see it better what 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 yes I want to thank you before 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.260
 nothing to martín for having sent me what 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.420
 is this product to do the review in 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.180
 my channel we see that it brings us what is the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.370
 case and a little box that looks like a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.809
 iphone 5 the truth looks pretty good 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.940
 I imagine that there is what comes in 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.879
 the protective screen the protector of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.500
 screen let's see it let's go as they 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.450
 I say it looks pretty good there brings us 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.350
 some indications a concept of what 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.989
 is the company really is very good 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.489
 add us what is the protector 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.800
 of screen we see that brings the washcloth 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.329
 of fiber to be able to clean it before 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.620
 put what is our protector of 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.329
 screen 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.890
 and as I said is a good thing that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.850
 include since not all companies 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.250
 include 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.530
 and for me I think it gives us a 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.900
 protection since they do not include 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.640
 what is the protector plastic 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.990
 screen to put it is very simple what 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 only thing we have to do is separate 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.330
 the pieces and put what would be the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.340
 part of the opposite the truth that you look 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.960
 pretty well the color I like the neon 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 with black it's pretty good for me 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.399
 the white iphone or the black iphone the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.500
 price is 29 90 and you can find it in 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.880
 martín puntocom in the description him 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.070
 you can leave the direct link so that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.710
 go check it out as we can see by 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.750
 the sides look quite well 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.399
 tickets are perfect they are pretty good 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.039
 the people we have access to 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.619
 easy to power button and button 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.330
 of the bold volume as we can see 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.369
 do it I'm teaching to be seen 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.350
 much better and also does not make us thick 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.060
 the phone since there are many 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.340
 that they do not like to be looked at with that the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.530
 phone and then here as I was 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.259
 saying they can check the page to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.270
 different models there for iphone there 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.550
 for galaxies then the truth that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.619
 it is quite complete what is the 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.070
 their website in a little bit and 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.930
 good 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.210
 I'm double birds but they liked this 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.210
