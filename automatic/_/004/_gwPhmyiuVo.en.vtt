we won't get into that just yet and then

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.320 
we won't get into that just yet and then
when<00:02:23.130> we're<00:02:23.280> ready<00:02:23.310> we<00:02:23.730> hit<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.060> create

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.850 

this<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.360> first<00:02:29.599> screen<00:02:30.079> that<00:02:30.200> you'll<00:02:30.530> see

this is the first screen that you'll see

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.280 
this is the first screen that you'll see
when<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.400> start<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.849> new<00:02:31.879> program

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
when you start a new program

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.500 
when you start a new program
there's<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.129> lot<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.400> things<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.909> look<00:02:36.060> at<00:02:36.299> and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
there's a lot of things to look at and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.569 
there's a lot of things to look at and
most<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:37.470> doesn't<00:02:37.709> really<00:02:37.980> matter<00:02:38.280> right

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
most of it doesn't really matter right

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.780 
most of it doesn't really matter right
off<00:02:38.909> the<00:02:39.120> bat<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:40.620> close<00:02:40.950> out<00:02:41.189> some<00:02:41.549> of<00:02:41.670> this

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
off the bat to close out some of this

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
and if you have a small screen these can

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.740 
and if you have a small screen these can
help<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:47.040> gain<00:02:47.670> back<00:02:47.970> some<00:02:48.000> screen<00:02:48.540> real

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
help you gain back some screen real

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.790 
help you gain back some screen real
estate<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.439> can<00:02:49.590> see<00:02:49.799> more<00:02:49.980> information

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
estate so you can see more information

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.690 
estate so you can see more information
next<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.850> want<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.090> click<00:02:53.330> on<00:02:53.620> main.c<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.890> now

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
next you want to click on main.c and now

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.040 
next you want to click on main.c and now
we<00:02:55.760> can<00:02:56.000> actually<00:02:56.150> look<00:02:56.450> at<00:02:56.630> some<00:02:56.660> real<00:02:56.990> code

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
we can actually look at some real code

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.490 
we can actually look at some real code
here's<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.950> simple<00:03:00.400> application<00:03:01.140> at<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.290> top

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
here's a simple application at the top

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.880 
here's a simple application at the top
there's<00:03:02.770> comments<00:03:03.070> which<00:03:03.730> are<00:03:04.890> visible

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
there's comments which are visible

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.210 
there's comments which are visible
because<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.820> forward<00:03:07.240> slashes<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:08.220> then

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
because of the forward slashes and then

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.730 
because of the forward slashes and then
where<00:03:09.790> all<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.330> magic<00:03:10.660> happens<00:03:11.080> is<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.440> int

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
where all the magic happens is that int

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.760 
where all the magic happens is that int
main<00:03:12.160> line<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:14.080> starting<00:03:14.470> place<00:03:14.740> for

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
main line that is the starting place for

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.350 
main line that is the starting place for
any<00:03:15.190> computer<00:03:15.610> program<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:15.970> we're<00:03:16.180> going<00:03:16.270> to

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
any computer program that we're going to

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.590 
any computer program that we're going to
be<00:03:16.480> writing<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:18.550> last<00:03:18.760> thing<00:03:18.970> you'll<00:03:19.120> see<00:03:19.360> is

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
be writing the last thing you'll see is

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.500 
be writing the last thing you'll see is
a<00:03:19.660> printf<00:03:20.260> command<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:21.970> something

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
a printf command this is something

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.600 
a printf command this is something
that's<00:03:22.690> printing<00:03:23.650> something<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.340> screen

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
that's printing something to the screen

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.510 
that's printing something to the screen
it<00:03:24.760> stands<00:03:25.030> for<00:03:25.120> print<00:03:25.510> formatted

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.340 

and<00:03:31.030> when<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.180> say<00:03:31.390> printing<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.990> don't<00:03:32.140> mean

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
and when I say printing I don't mean

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.780 
and when I say printing I don't mean
printing<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.950> piece<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.280> paper

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
printing a piece of paper

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.520 
printing a piece of paper
I<00:03:33.820> mean<00:03:34.420> displaying<00:03:35.250> text<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.910> screen

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
I mean displaying text on the screen

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.280 
I mean displaying text on the screen
so<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.820> run<00:03:40.000> your<00:03:40.210> application<00:03:40.750> right<00:03:40.960> off<00:03:41.110> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
so to run your application right off the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.200 
so to run your application right off the
bat<00:03:41.440> just<00:03:41.830> hit<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.010> big<00:03:42.340> play<00:03:42.640> button<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:43.120> the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
bat just hit that big play button in the

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.510 
bat just hit that big play button in the
top<00:03:43.420> left<00:03:43.450> corner<00:03:43.810> like<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.650> see<00:03:45.010> on<00:03:45.100> iTunes

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
top left corner like you see on iTunes

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.300 
top left corner like you see on iTunes
and<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:47.050> that's<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.650> for<00:03:47.890> getting<00:03:48.040> started

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
and so that's it for getting started

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.760 
and so that's it for getting started
with<00:03:48.490> Xcode<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.840> next<00:03:50.110> video<00:03:50.380> we'll<00:03:50.650> go

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
with Xcode in the next video we'll go

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.530 
with Xcode in the next video we'll go
over<00:03:50.800> what<00:03:51.040> printf<00:03:51.730> does<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.780> how<00:03:52.960> to<00:03:53.020> use<00:03:53.320> it
