00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
work always had a kind of a function or

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.010 
work always had a kind of a function or
relation<00:00:16.730> to<00:00:17.730> function<00:00:18.210> or<00:00:18.270> what<00:00:18.390> was<00:00:18.750> about

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
relation to function or what was about

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.160 
relation to function or what was about
to<00:00:19.140> function<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.740> for<00:00:20.039> me<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.910> make<00:00:21.119> art<00:00:21.449> with

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
to function so for me to make art with

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.240 
to function so for me to make art with
the<00:00:22.619> kind<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.510> usefulness<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:25.140> very<00:00:25.710> normal

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the kind of usefulness is very normal

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.019 
the kind of usefulness is very normal
and<00:00:26.580> part<00:00:26.880> as<00:00:27.769> from<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.859> practice<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.880> not

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and part as from a practice it's not

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.420 
and part as from a practice it's not
that<00:00:30.150> I'm<00:00:30.300> design<00:00:30.990> I'm<00:00:31.170> making<00:00:31.500> art<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.130> am

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that I'm design I'm making art that I am

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.569 
that I'm design I'm making art that I am
an<00:00:32.640> artist<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.600> makes<00:00:34.010> not<00:00:35.010> design<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
an artist that makes not design that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.240 
an artist that makes not design that
something<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.360> could<00:00:36.660> be<00:00:36.809> used<00:00:37.100> back<00:00:38.100> at

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
something that could be used back at

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
something that could be used back at
that<00:00:38.399> time<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.390> work<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.750> much<00:00:39.960> more<00:00:40.140> about

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
that time the work was much more about

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.930 
that time the work was much more about
the<00:00:40.530> position<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:41.070> heart<00:00:41.280> by<00:00:41.489> making

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the position of heart by making

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.119 
the position of heart by making
functional<00:00:42.629> objects<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.739> create<00:00:43.890> in

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
functional objects or to create in

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.840 
functional objects or to create in
mini-worlds<00:00:44.930> nowadays<00:00:46.129> my<00:00:47.129> position<00:00:47.489> towards

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
mini-worlds nowadays my position towards

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.540 
mini-worlds nowadays my position towards
the<00:00:48.000> body<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.260> abstract<00:00:49.680> part<00:00:50.219> of

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the body and the more abstract part of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.889 
the body and the more abstract part of
sculpture<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.899> more<00:00:52.649> interesting<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.899> but

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
sculpture is more interesting to me but

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.689 
sculpture is more interesting to me but
still<00:00:55.110> some<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> pieces<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.460> piece

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
still some of the pieces like this piece

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.569 
still some of the pieces like this piece
is<00:00:56.879> very<00:00:56.910> functional<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.260> body<00:00:58.469> self<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
is very functional or the body self is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.930 
is very functional or the body self is
still<00:00:59.850> functional<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> has<00:01:01.410> much<00:01:01.649> more

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
still functional but it has much more

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
still functional but it has much more
sculptural<00:01:02.940> values<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.260> actually<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> do

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
sculptural values and actually what I do

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.030 
sculptural values and actually what I do
I<00:01:05.430> make<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.240> object<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.780> make<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> sculpture<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
I make an object I make a sculpture and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700 
I make an object I make a sculpture and
it's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.520> very<00:01:08.850> simple<00:01:09.270> action<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.320> changed<00:01:10.619> it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it's a very simple action I changed it

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.820 
it's a very simple action I changed it
to<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:11.220> functional<00:01:12.030> object<00:01:12.119> by<00:01:12.770> putting<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to a functional object by putting a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.149 
to a functional object by putting a
pillow<00:01:14.040> inside<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:15.439> put<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.619> installing<00:01:16.979> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
pillow inside or put it installing a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.730 
pillow inside or put it installing a
lampshade<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:18.570> that's<00:01:19.170> that's<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
lampshade so that's that's the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.510 
lampshade so that's that's the
difference<00:01:20.330> work<00:01:21.330> much<00:01:21.930> more<00:01:22.229> intuitively<00:01:22.979> at

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
difference work much more intuitively at

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.770 
difference work much more intuitively at
this<00:01:23.970> moment<00:01:24.180> than<00:01:24.600> before<00:01:25.049> yes<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
this moment than before yes we have a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.960 
this moment than before yes we have a
lot<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.259> everything<00:01:28.500> lot<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> exhibitions<00:01:29.670> a

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
something I've I really believe it

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.089 
something I've I really believe it
should<00:02:13.750> be<00:02:14.430> good<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:16.170> special<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.709> material

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
should be good and special the material

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.059 
should be good and special the material
I<00:02:18.160> used<00:02:18.370> most<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.970> fiberglass<00:02:19.810> which<00:02:20.319> is<00:02:20.500> this

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
I used most is fiberglass which is this

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.759 
I used most is fiberglass which is this
material<00:02:21.330> which<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.480> very<00:02:22.590> strong<00:02:23.590> and

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
material which is very strong and

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.100 
material which is very strong and

such<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:24.940> way<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.479> designed<00:04:25.900> something<00:04:26.289> you

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
such a way that I designed something you

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.760 
such a way that I designed something you
know<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.530> function<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.340> just<00:04:27.460> make<00:04:28.080> a<00:04:29.080> shape

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
know to function and just make a shape

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.860 
know to function and just make a shape
sculpture<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.759> very<00:04:30.940> expressive<00:04:31.509> way
