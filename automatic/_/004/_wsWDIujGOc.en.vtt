00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 buy it we go to a 4 antenna and 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.009
 poles this serves for any 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.259
 television but it also works for us 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.760
 for high definition televisions 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.469
 in the description I will leave you a 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.049
 link where you 'll put details 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.830
 antenna and here we are going to give the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.750
 materials 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.310
 to start we need a meter of 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.380
 pvc three-quarter inch 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.470
 diameter and approximately 15 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.460
 centimeters of PVC of half an inch 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.859
 diameter 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.240
 we will also occupy 5 screws of 2 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.579
 inches long by a quarter 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.470
 and 10 one-inch screws for a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.750
 fourth these are from the exonerate head the 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.309
 I prefer because they have more grip and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.420
 for the small screws we're going to 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.420
 accompany with 10 rounds 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.370
 we will also be a vhf converter and 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.050
 hf this basically what he does is 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.120
 separate the coaxial cable that we connect 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.470
 here on both legs so we can 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.800
 connect in each of the towns of 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.629
 our antenna 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.360
 finally we need some wire 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.250
 conductor for this I occupy wire of 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.989
 copper because it 's easy to get but 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.369
 could replace it with some of the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 metal hooks that sometimes have in 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.900
 house to start we cut the tube 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.509
 half an inch in fractions of 2 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.610
 Inch this can be done with a 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.350
 hacksaw this first they would have to mark 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.229
 the area where they are going to cut with a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.479
 masking or something and they already proceed to 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.640
 I personally do not like to cut 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.250
 this technique because first I was 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.720
 it's a bit difficult to cut it suppose that 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.210
 the most experienced people to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.979
 cut can do it faster but the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.830
 The most negative part of this is that 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.140
 it goes completely straight always and 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.610
 apart from some burrs that then 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.729
 then you have to eliminate these you have to 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.080
 remove them with sandpaper or some one 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.670
 Emery so they do not generate us 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.470
 problems after 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.119
 pdc cutting personally 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.540
 I recommend occupying a tube cutter 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.250
 of copper if they have it at home 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.149
 this is a much, much cleaner cut is 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.549
 A precise cut is easy to make 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.470
 And also they do not leave us the impurities that 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.300
 the other one leaves us 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.670
 good to cut it with a hacksaw here 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.350
 The cut is fairly even if 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.640
 he has some edges that he does not 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.530
 they affect in nothing the measures are more 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.340
 precise and we do not have to be linking 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.340
 after having cut 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.320
 what follows is to mark the fractions of 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.660
 2 inches that we just cut as 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.070
 appears in the image the way that I 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.200
 I recommend doing it so that all 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.750
 remain the same is to mark it on a sheet 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.210
 of paper mark the good the points in 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.430
 where are they going to do the drilling 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.710
 and after this we cut it with a 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.940
 circular paper puncher and in case 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.070
 if we do not have it, we can do the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.510
 triangles with one with a scissors like 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.510
 it looks right now 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.510
 Once this is done we unfold the paper 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.110
 and we place the pvc tube in such a way 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.300
 that the outgoing coincides well is about 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.280
 this is to mark what the points are 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.070
 where we are going to drilling and we are 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.750
 all will be equal this step can 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.670
 be before or after marking the points 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.800
 but on a surface a little 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.710
 lifted we make a straight line that 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.960
 through the PVC this can be either 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.800
 a notebook or even a frame of a 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.800
 door works for me 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.360
 we proceed to drill 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.550
 this can be done with a drill bit 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.410
 eighth so that it is both less than 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.200
 screw entry so that this 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.090
 I do fit well with drill 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.129
 bank but they can do it is a problem 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.560
 with a regular set you just have to 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.610
 have a base on which to slide 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.680
 so that we always have the 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.680
 perforations as straight as possible 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.130
 once this is done we will use the 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.200
 longer tube and we're going to mark a 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.270
 central line and on this line we are going to 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.510
 mark in inches the measurements that 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.459
 see in the image we proceed to what is 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.110
 punching the centerline what 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.680
 allows us is that all the 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.090
 holes are on the same plane 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.400
 then you do not have to after 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.520
 have problems that come out in chueca 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.200
 only the poles are isolated 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.880
 to begin with the first part of 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.670
 armed we are going to place the screws 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.030
 small at the ends of the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.120
 extreme holes of the fractions of 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.530
 half inch pvc tube the screw 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.720
 long we will place it in the part 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.310
 central making it come out 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.200
 approximately 1 centimeter for 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.640
 mount it on the 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.640
 over the longest post 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.720
 this I will not leave it to the bottom 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.950
 because it is the base point mark 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.360
 where the screws will be and 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.620
 leave them the form for later 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.620
 dismantle it and be able to paint 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.900
 in the painting phase I recommend 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.060
 first use a plastic primer this 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.020
 I got this liquid then what 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.699
 I am applying with a regular sprayer 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.259
 you have to spray well and according to 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.550
 to manufacturer's specifications 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.979
 I buy it you have to let it dry 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.449
 for 15 minutes and once 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.069
 After this time we can 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.860
 proceed to paint I am doing it 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.990
 with a black spray 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.750
 and then the same according to the specifications 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.210
 of the manufacturer must be applied to 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.630
 approximately 20 centimeters from the 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.210
 object 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.529
 and trying to cover in several layers all 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.039
 area 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.839
 I did this a bit quickly but the 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.609
 results were good the time of 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:25.099
 drying this is more or less was 

00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:28.839
 equal 10 minutes 15 minutes because that 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.839
 nothing is a quick drying paint 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.410
 while this dries we will take advantage 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.780
 to cut 8 fractions of 14 inches 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.250
 of the copper wire and we're going to 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.850
 double as the image that appears on the 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.950
 screen 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.620
 this is deadlines talk for half 2 to 7 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.930
 inches and with an opening between 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.850
 the tips of 5 inches and a half 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.940
 additional this we are going to cut two 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.470
 fractions 33 inches long and the 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.860
 let's talk as seen below 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.150
 the fold that is good is 9 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.520
 inches and a half and then we make a 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.960
 small fold is very light here I put 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.860
 an angle is the angle that marked me 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.660
 172 software this degrees then the 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.620
 doubles is very light and therefore this is 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.620
 can adjust at the end 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.740
 well that's why we would have all the 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.230
 prepared pieces and we can proceed 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.640
 what is the assembly this happens 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.730
 first let's assemble the tubes 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.770
 small on the longest pole and then 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.570
 we will place one of the wires crossed 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.910
 as seen in the image after 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.010
 let's put in the times we achieve 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.580
 do we are going to put them that way 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.960
 and we're going to screw later on this 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.680
 we proceed to place what is the 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.300
 second wire 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.490
 these wires at the time of crossing not 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.680
 they should touch then it is important 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.170
 that when placing it, let's leave a 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.970
 space after this we're going to put what 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.970
 what are the others that were missing 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.879
 and more or less the assembly must be 

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:53.879
 as seen here in the picture 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.190
 here I would recommend if they have the 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.050
 possibility to apply small points 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.150
 welding joints on these 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.320
 stops to keep it fixed and if in a 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.600
 future there will be corruption of 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.320
 our materials does not affect or mete 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.320
 noise at our signal 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.849
 the last step to have the 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:13.620
 antenna is to place where the 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.840
 red box that is the only post that does not 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.780
 had of the times we are going to place the 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.819
 vhf and hf converter this good 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.770
 trying to get in touch with what 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:27.289
 It's the copper wire 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.289
 and then they would have a finished antenna
