 parsley in all the chops ok after 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 having put the parsley 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:18.570
 put the freshly ground pepper and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:21.200
 tasty on all four of them 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.200
 wounds

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.380
 pecorino romano 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:31.370

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.760
 chili because someone likes it 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:40.900
 peppers still hanging but only for one 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.900
 and now proceed 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.840
 here is the closure 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:04.010
 so for all 4 and now we proceed up 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:16.890
 wrapping them with a thread not with lo 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:19.490
 toothpick with wire 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.490
 there he is 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.140
 this operation must be done for all e 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:48.810
 four clearly to find the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:55.650
 end of the thread wraps around one 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:59.459
 toothpick and slips inside 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.150
 of the chop so that you just pull 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.760
 off the toothpick comes out the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.579
 the whole end of the thread to unroll it is 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.310
 so this operation must be done for 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:16.560
 also the others to recognize that 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.729
 with the chilli we put two 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.910

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.680
 how you can read it so you recognize 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.180
 while the others 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.200

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.530
 the bone 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.530
