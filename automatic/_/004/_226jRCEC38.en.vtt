00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.719 
so for starters it's very very pigmented
as<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.740> down<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.310> um<00:01:52.430> but<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.579> not

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
as you can see down here um but it's not

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.719 
as you can see down here um but it's not
so<00:01:53.970> pigmented<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.600> doesn't<00:01:54.990> look<00:01:55.409> natural<00:01:56.399> so

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
so pigmented it doesn't look natural so

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.480 
so pigmented it doesn't look natural so
I<00:01:57.570> got<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.229> dark<00:01:58.469> purely<00:01:59.009> because<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
I got this in dark purely because the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.910 
I got this in dark purely because the
powder<00:01:59.729> color<00:02:00.090> appeared<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.140> pale

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
powder color appeared so pale

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.319 
powder color appeared so pale
and<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.430> one<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.700> things<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.939> would<00:02:03.000> say

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and that one of the things I would say

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.359 
and that one of the things I would say
if<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.630> are<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.079> invest<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.979> kit

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
if you are going to invest in this kit

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.160 
if you are going to invest in this kit
is<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.509> get<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.960> shade<00:02:07.200> darker<00:02:07.229> than<00:02:07.770> you

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
is to get it in a shade darker than you

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.479 
is to get it in a shade darker than you
you<00:02:08.289> think<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.649> are<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:10.569> draw<00:02:11.020> down<00:02:11.349> in<00:02:11.830> a

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
you think you are I just draw down in a

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.630 
you think you are I just draw down in a
line

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.110 

because<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:19.740> powder<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.190> very<00:02:20.370> light<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.880> wax

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
because the powder is very light the wax

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.990 
because the powder is very light the wax
I<00:02:21.480> think<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.780> perfect<00:02:22.230> match<00:02:22.459> right<00:02:23.459> Sansa<00:02:23.850> put

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
I think is perfect match right Sansa put

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.440 
I think is perfect match right Sansa put
the<00:02:24.090> wax<00:02:24.240> on<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:25.200> give<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> little<00:02:25.770> brush

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
the wax on just give a little brush

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
the wax on just give a little brush
again<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.810> make<00:02:27.959> sure<00:02:27.990> we're<00:02:28.410> all

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
again just to make sure we're all

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.720 
again just to make sure we're all
blended<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:30.530> that's<00:02:31.530> looking<00:02:31.980> natural<00:02:32.550> and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
blended and that's looking natural and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.880 
blended and that's looking natural and
then<00:02:32.819> if<00:02:32.910> you've<00:02:33.060> got<00:02:33.270> any<00:02:33.440> bits<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.590> need

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
then if you've got any bits that need

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.220 
then if you've got any bits that need
tidying<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.580> can<00:02:35.760> do<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:35.940> now<00:02:36.270> right

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
tidying up you can do that now right

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.810 
tidying up you can do that now right
then<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:38.100> move<00:02:38.820> on<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.870> powder<00:02:40.490> which<00:02:41.490> is

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
then I move on to the powder which is

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.030 
then I move on to the powder which is
this<00:02:42.180> side<00:02:42.510> here<00:02:42.959> I'll<00:02:43.230> just<00:02:43.440> swatch<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.010> for

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
this side here I'll just swatch it for

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.920 
this side here I'll just swatch it for
you<00:02:44.570> as<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.840> see<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.140> very<00:02:46.200> light<00:02:46.739> and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
you as you can see it's very light and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.430 
you as you can see it's very light and
but<00:02:48.930> well<00:02:49.319> pigmented<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.190> think<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:51.930> take

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
but well pigmented I think so I do take

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.900 
but well pigmented I think so I do take
the<00:02:52.590> little<00:02:52.830> brush<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.310> comes<00:02:53.459> with<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.760> kit

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
the little brush that comes with the kit

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.199 
the little brush that comes with the kit
and<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.930> tiny<00:02:55.410> bit<00:02:56.070> literally<00:02:56.640> one<00:02:56.850> swipe

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
and a tiny bit literally one swipe

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.710 
and a tiny bit literally one swipe
because<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.700> very<00:02:59.910> chalky<00:03:00.480> and

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
because it is so so it's very chalky and

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.890 
because it is so so it's very chalky and
it<00:03:00.840> does<00:03:01.050> transfer<00:03:01.620> onto<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.980> brows<00:03:02.900> quite

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
it does transfer onto the brows quite

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.600 
it does transfer onto the brows quite
strongly<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.830> put<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
strongly and I just put that on the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.759 
strongly and I just put that on the
first<00:03:05.880> bit<00:03:06.680> like<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:09.140> okay<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.320> then<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.650> to

first bit like so okay and then just to

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.979 
first bit like so okay and then just to
seal<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.130> all<00:03:11.310> on<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.209> do<00:03:12.269> recommend<00:03:12.690> this
