yeah you get you arriving into certain
one<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.189> six<00:00:26.460> gear<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.060> everything's<00:00:27.660> right

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
one in six gear and everything's right

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230 
one in six gear and everything's right
you<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.769> pretty<00:00:28.980> much<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.340> flat<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.939> sex

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
you can pretty much do it flat in sex

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.030 
you can pretty much do it flat in sex
but<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.630> can't<00:00:30.810> always<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.349> yeah<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.890> mean

but you can't always do it yeah I mean

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.799 
but you can't always do it yeah I mean
it's<00:00:32.189> there's<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.520> pretty<00:00:32.730> pretty<00:00:33.030> fast<00:00:33.300> corner

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it's there's a pretty pretty fast corner

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.750 
it's there's a pretty pretty fast corner
it<00:00:34.320> wasn't<00:00:34.710> too<00:00:34.860> long<00:00:35.010> ago<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.430> were<00:00:35.550> down<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
it wasn't too long ago we were down a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.150 
it wasn't too long ago we were down a
couple<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.149> gears<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.110> try<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.829> get<00:00:37.950> round

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
couple of gears and try and get round

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.590 
couple of gears and try and get round
there<00:00:38.280> now<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.790> obviously<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> cars<00:00:39.390> have

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
there now the obviously the cars have

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.389 
there now the obviously the cars have
advanced<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.200> much<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.590> aerodynamics<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
advanced so much in aerodynamics and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.950 
advanced so much in aerodynamics and
Tiger<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.090> Michelin<00:00:42.480> tires<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
Tiger if you know Michelin tires and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.740 
Tiger if you know Michelin tires and
everything<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.500> really<00:00:44.489> quickly<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.629> then

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
everything just really quickly and then

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.660 
everything just really quickly and then
you<00:00:45.780> come<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.980> go<00:00:47.129> down<00:00:47.309> into

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
you come out and then you go down into

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.510 
you come out and then you go down into
turn<00:00:47.820> well<00:00:48.180> they<00:00:48.270> call<00:00:48.450> turn<00:00:48.690> three<00:00:49.250> down<00:00:50.250> into

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
turn well they call turn three down into

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150 
turn well they call turn three down into
third<00:00:50.760> gear<00:00:51.090> left<00:00:51.870> hand<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.620> right<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
third gear left hand a little right and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.709 
third gear left hand a little right and
then<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.579> around<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.969> sort<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> long<00:00:54.449> left

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
then we go around the sort of long left

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.310 
then we go around the sort of long left
turn<00:00:54.989> five<00:00:56.030> accelerate<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> there<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
turn five accelerate out of there up to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.889 
turn five accelerate out of there up to
top<00:00:58.500> again<00:00:58.829> down<00:00:59.609> hard<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> brakes<00:01:00.570> into

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
top again down hard on the brakes into

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.529 
top again down hard on the brakes into
the<00:01:01.020> hairpin<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.949> second<00:01:02.489> gear<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.329> come

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the hairpin at second gear and we come

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.060 
the hairpin at second gear and we come
off<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.049> shoot<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.559> down<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> little

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
off there we shoot up down a little

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.580 
off there we shoot up down a little
chute<00:01:05.400> which<00:01:06.060> has<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.780> sort<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.320> left

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
chute which has a sort of right left

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.130 
chute which has a sort of right left
right<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:08.159> bend<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> left<00:01:09.270> Bend<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
right right bend and a left Bend and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.929 
right right bend and a left Bend and
then<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.500> hard<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> brakes<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.700> what

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
then it's hard on the brakes for to what

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.080 
then it's hard on the brakes for to what
we<00:01:12.030> call<00:01:12.210> turn<00:01:12.420> ten<00:01:13.159> that's<00:01:14.159> that's<00:01:14.820> third

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
we call turn ten that's that's third

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.149 
we call turn ten that's that's third
gear<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.689> quite<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.350> looks<00:01:16.590> kind<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.950> tight

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
gear it's quite a it looks kind of tight

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.499 
gear it's quite a it looks kind of tight
but<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.640> third<00:01:17.880> gear<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.299> get

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
but you know third gear you can get

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.210 
but you know third gear you can get
through<00:01:18.720> there<00:01:18.869> pretty<00:01:19.140> well

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
through there pretty well

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.640 
through there pretty well
and<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.729> accelerate<00:01:21.270> fourth<00:01:21.600> fifth<00:01:22.020> down

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and then we accelerate fourth fifth down

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.880 
and then we accelerate fourth fifth down
into<00:01:22.950> third<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.460> 13<00:01:24.229> that's<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.320> tricky<00:01:25.619> corner

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
into third for 13 that's a tricky corner

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.760 
into third for 13 that's a tricky corner
because<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.400> kind<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.030> dips<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.320> then

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
because it's kind of dips down and then

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.960 
because it's kind of dips down and then
it's<00:01:28.920> kind<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> got<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.850> bit<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
it's kind of got like a little bit of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.810 
it's kind of got like a little bit of
camber<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> tarmac<00:01:31.590> changes<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
camber and then the tarmac changes so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.819 
camber and then the tarmac changes so
tricky<00:01:33.479> little<00:01:33.659> corner<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.590> fun

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
tricky little corner that one but fun

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.870 
tricky little corner that one but fun
fun<00:01:35.280> corner<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:35.970> through<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.680> go

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
fun corner to go through and then we go

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.870 
fun corner to go through and then we go
down<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> sort<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.659> back<00:01:39.840> straight<00:01:40.229> here<00:01:40.880> into

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
down the sort of back straight here into

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.850 
down the sort of back straight here into

Top Gear 40 it
and<00:01:46.490> 16<00:01:47.230> and<00:01:48.230> certainly<00:01:49.160> today<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:50.240> track<00:01:50.480> was

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
and 16 and certainly today the track was

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.990 
and 16 and certainly today the track was
very<00:01:50.690> good<00:01:51.020> there<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.560> it's<00:01:52.490> just<00:01:52.640> super

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
very good there and it's just super

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.050 
very good there and it's just super
quick<00:01:53.390> fifth<00:01:53.690> gear<00:01:53.870> on<00:01:54.080> entry<00:01:54.640> which<00:01:55.640> we<00:01:55.850> you

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
quick fifth gear on entry which we you

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.180 
quick fifth gear on entry which we you
know<00:01:56.150> sometimes<00:01:56.600> we<00:01:56.780> had<00:01:56.870> to<00:01:56.900> go<00:01:57.110> forth<00:01:57.440> but

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
know sometimes we had to go forth but

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.470 
know sometimes we had to go forth but
it's<00:01:58.370> you<00:01:58.640> know<00:01:58.670> it's<00:01:58.760> been<00:01:58.970> quite<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.270> lot<00:01:59.390> of

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
it's you know it's been quite a lot of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.050 
it's you know it's been quite a lot of
group<00:01:59.630> so<00:01:59.840> fifth<00:02:00.200> gear<00:02:00.410> you<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:01.340> do<00:02:01.760> fourth

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
group so fifth gear you can do fourth

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.000 
group so fifth gear you can do fourth
but<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.630> know<00:02:02.750> fifth<00:02:03.020> gear<00:02:03.170> seems<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.680> run<00:02:03.890> in

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
but you know fifth gear seems to run in

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.760 
but you know fifth gear seems to run in
there<00:02:04.190> pretty<00:02:04.400> smoothly<00:02:05.020> fifth<00:02:06.020> fifth<00:02:06.470> and

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
there pretty smoothly fifth fifth and

there pretty smoothly fifth fifth and
then<00:02:06.920> fourth<00:02:07.520> for<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.850> turn<00:02:08.750> sixteen<00:02:09.260> onto

the<00:02:09.740> long<00:02:10.250> back<00:02:10.460> straight<00:02:10.820> which<00:02:11.060> obviously

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
the long back straight which obviously

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.210 
the long back straight which obviously
is<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.570> really<00:02:11.840> important<00:02:12.260> corner<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.800> get

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
is a really important corner to get

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.770 
is a really important corner to get
through<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.580> corner<00:02:14.000> quickly<00:02:14.240> with<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.600> lot

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
through that corner quickly with a lot

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.590 
through that corner quickly with a lot
of<00:02:14.870> speed<00:02:15.140> bentham<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:15.800> get<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.040> power<00:02:16.310> on

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
of speed bentham and get the power on

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.640 
of speed bentham and get the power on
because<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:17.660> gain<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> lot<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.140> time<00:02:18.320> down<00:02:18.500> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
because you gain a lot of time down the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.830 
because you gain a lot of time down the
street<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.910> then<00:02:20.060> it's<00:02:20.180> down<00:02:20.330> into<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.660> last
