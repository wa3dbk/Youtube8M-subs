vectoring<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.029> might<00:00:18.210> add<00:00:18.390> know<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> thought<00:00:19.560> I

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
vectoring I might add know I thought I

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.679 
vectoring I might add know I thought I
knew<00:00:19.949> what<00:00:20.130> thrust<00:00:20.580> vectoring<00:00:20.970> was<00:00:21.150> until<00:00:21.510> now

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
knew what thrust vectoring was until now

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.140 
knew what thrust vectoring was until now
oh<00:00:21.930> well<00:00:22.500> that's<00:00:22.650> where<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.160> motor<00:00:23.400> changes

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
oh well that's where the motor changes

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849 
oh well that's where the motor changes
direction<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.050> case<00:00:25.289> only<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
direction and in this case only on the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.830 
direction and in this case only on the
yaw<00:00:26.010> axis<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:27.060> make<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> plane<00:00:27.599> more

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
yaw axis to make the plane more

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.660 
yaw axis to make the plane more
maneuverable<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.769> actually<00:00:29.250> pretty<00:00:29.460> simple

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
maneuverable it's actually pretty simple

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.560 
maneuverable it's actually pretty simple
to<00:00:29.849> put<00:00:30.090> together

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
to put together

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.030 
to put together
either<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> binding<00:00:31.320> fly<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
either the binding fly or the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.889 
either the binding fly or the
plug-and-play<00:00:32.250> version<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.510> easy<00:00:33.750> that

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
plug-and-play version it's so easy that

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.360 
plug-and-play version it's so easy that
I<00:00:34.079> actually<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> could<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.070> I

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
I actually think you could do it I

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.760 
I actually think you could do it I
probably<00:00:36.270> could<00:00:36.750> although<00:00:37.170> I'm<00:00:37.380> gonna<00:00:37.620> use

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
probably could although I'm gonna use

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.229 
probably could although I'm gonna use
something<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.340> lot<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.700> guys<00:00:38.850> never

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
something that a lot of you guys never

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.420 
something that a lot of you guys never
even<00:00:39.450> look<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> instruction

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
even look at and that's the instruction

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.310 
even look at and that's the instruction
manual<00:00:41.940> looks<00:00:42.239> pretty<00:00:42.420> thick<00:00:42.750> though<00:00:42.930> don't

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
manual looks pretty thick though don't

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.779 
manual looks pretty thick though don't
let<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> size<00:00:43.710> intimidate<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.399> Michael<00:00:44.670> it's

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
let the size intimidate you Michael it's

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.760 
let the size intimidate you Michael it's
written<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.090> five<00:00:45.300> different<00:00:45.510> languages<00:00:46.200> can

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
written in five different languages can

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.479 
written in five different languages can
you<00:00:46.800> grab<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> fuselage<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:48.480> say<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.489> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
you grab the fuselage you say that it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.860 
you grab the fuselage you say that it
looks<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:51.059> we're<00:00:51.239> gonna<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.510> starting<00:00:51.809> with

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
looks like we're gonna be starting with

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.389 
looks like we're gonna be starting with
the<00:00:51.989> landing<00:00:52.260> gear<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> fixed

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the landing gear now this is the fixed

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.650 
the landing gear now this is the fixed
landing<00:00:53.520> gear<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> plane<00:00:54.180> actually

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
landing gear that the plane actually

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
landing gear that the plane actually
comes<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:54.960> easy<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.710> install<00:00:55.920> they<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.340> pop

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
comes with easy to install they just pop

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.410 
comes with easy to install they just pop
right<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:59.059> optionally<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.239> can

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
right in like that and optionally we can

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.290 
right in like that and optionally we can
we<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.739> e<00:01:01.980> flight<00:01:02.370> electric

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
we can use the e flight electric

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.170 
we can use the e flight electric
retracts<00:01:03.809> right<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.339> simplicity<00:01:05.489> we're

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
retracts right but for simplicity we're

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.840 
retracts right but for simplicity we're
gonna<00:01:06.270> use<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> fixed<00:01:06.930> gear<00:01:07.170> even<00:01:07.979> though<00:01:08.369> for

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
gonna use the fixed gear even though for

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.700 
gonna use the fixed gear even though for
high<00:01:09.180> speed<00:01:09.450> flying<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.170> high<00:01:10.470> speed

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
high speed flying and high speed

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.130 
high speed flying and high speed
performance<00:01:10.860> you're<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:11.970> gonna<00:01:12.090> want<00:01:12.390> your

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
performance you're not gonna want your

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
performance you're not gonna want your
junk<00:01:13.380> hanging<00:01:13.590> down<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> was

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
junk hanging down that's what I was

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.660 
junk hanging down that's what I was
going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.090> say<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> let's<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.040> pop<00:01:17.250> these<00:01:17.460> in

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
going to say so let's just pop these in

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.840 
going to say so let's just pop these in
here<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> these<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.420> secured<00:01:18.930> by<00:01:19.850> plastic

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
here and these are secured by plastic

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
here and these are secured by plastic
covers<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.840> labeled<00:01:22.229> left<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
covers and these are labeled left and

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.850 
covers and these are labeled left and
right<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.299> pop<00:01:25.110> these<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
right and you just pop these in and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.149 
right and you just pop these in and
they're<00:01:26.130> shaped<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:28.740> go<00:01:28.920> right

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
they're shaped so you so they go right

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.539 
they're shaped so you so they go right
in<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.790> get<00:01:29.970> them<00:01:30.090> right<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:31.549> when

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
in if you get them right and when

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.210 
in if you get them right and when
they're<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.509> fit<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.900> nicely<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:35.040> so

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
they're right they fit in nicely and so

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.830 
they're right they fit in nicely and so
I<00:01:35.250> need<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> 12<00:01:35.850> millimeter<00:01:37.310> hex<00:01:38.310> bolt<00:01:38.900> and

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
I need a 12 millimeter hex bolt and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.620 
I need a 12 millimeter hex bolt and
that's<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.430> again<00:01:44.509> we've<00:01:45.509> already

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that's not it again we've already

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.560 
that's not it again we've already
preassembled<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.560> piece<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.460> control<00:01:48.299> horn

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
preassembled this piece the control horn

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.389 
preassembled this piece the control horn
goes<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.140> side<00:01:49.350> we'll<00:01:49.890> tighten<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
goes on this side we'll tighten that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.399 
goes on this side we'll tighten that
down<00:01:50.460> once<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.479> aligned<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.259> there

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
down once we have it aligned but there

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.429 
down once we have it aligned but there
is<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> notch<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.850> there<00:01:54.210> already<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
is a notch in there already in this in

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.039 
is a notch in there already in this in
this<00:01:55.649> wire<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.060> we'll<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.840> ahead<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this wire and so we'll go ahead and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.569 
this wire and so we'll go ahead and
tighten<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.619> down<00:01:58.680> where<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.280> supposed<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
tighten that down where it's supposed to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.090 
tighten that down where it's supposed to
be<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.200> flight<00:02:01.469> has<00:02:01.740> done<00:02:01.950> is

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
be and so what a flight has done is

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.370 
be and so what a flight has done is
taken<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> guesswork<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:04.110> that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
taken the guesswork out of it so that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.800 
taken the guesswork out of it so that
when<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.189> not<00:02:06.000> put<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.540> where<00:02:06.689> it's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
when you not put that where it's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.990 
when you not put that where it's
supposed<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.520> be<00:02:08.670> aligned

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
supposed to be it's going to be aligned

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.660 
supposed to be it's going to be aligned
properly<00:02:09.860> ok<00:02:10.860> Michael<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.340> wasn't<00:02:11.489> too

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
properly ok Michael that wasn't too

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.700 
properly ok Michael that wasn't too
difficult<00:02:11.700> let's<00:02:12.209> flip<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.569> over<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.170> take

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
difficult let's flip this over and take

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.470 
difficult let's flip this over and take
look<00:02:13.860> at<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> top<00:02:14.250> side<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.150> canopy

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
look at the top side this is the canopy

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.130 
look at the top side this is the canopy
alright<00:02:16.580> looks<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:18.180> strong<00:02:18.450> magnet<00:02:18.900> just

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
alright looks like a strong magnet just

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.320 
alright looks like a strong magnet just
yeah<00:02:19.320> pulls<00:02:19.710> right<00:02:19.860> out<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.400> nice<00:02:20.880> battery

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
yeah pulls right out and nice battery

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.420 
yeah pulls right out and nice battery
compartment<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.080> one<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.980> cool<00:02:23.190> things

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
compartment and one of the cool things

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.070 
compartment and one of the cool things
about<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.820> scimitar<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.690> could<00:02:24.840> hand

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
about the scimitar and if you could hand

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.240 
about the scimitar and if you could hand
me<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.380> purple<00:02:26.420> that's<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.600> purple<00:02:28.290> there<00:02:29.100> you

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the receiver in and plug all your so we

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.090 
the receiver in and plug all your so we
just<00:03:06.150> pop<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.420> battery<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.840> here<00:03:07.050> now<00:03:07.770> the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
just pop the battery in here now the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.440 
just pop the battery in here now the
other<00:03:08.370> thing<00:03:08.610> we're<00:03:08.730> going<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:08.970> do<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.330> we're

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
other thing we're going to do is we're

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.750 
other thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.660> take<00:03:09.810> off<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.260> motor<00:03:10.920> hatch<00:03:11.190> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
going to take off the motor hatch and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.220 
going to take off the motor hatch and
disable<00:03:12.480> thrust-vectoring

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
disable thrust-vectoring

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.160 
disable thrust-vectoring
because<00:03:13.890> as<00:03:14.280> good<00:03:14.490> as<00:03:14.610> Larry<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.120> right<00:03:15.690> we

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
because as good as Larry is right we

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.570 
because as good as Larry is right we
don't<00:03:16.290> want<00:03:16.410> them<00:03:16.620> thrust-vectoring<00:03:17.010> on<00:03:17.490> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
don't want them thrust-vectoring on the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.370 
don't want them thrust-vectoring on the
first<00:03:17.820> time<00:03:18.060> out<00:03:18.240> something<00:03:18.900> bad<00:03:19.140> could

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
first time out something bad could

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.880 
first time out something bad could
happen<00:03:19.940> I'm<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:21.180> eyeballing<00:03:21.390> these<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.680> we

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
happen I'm just eyeballing these so we

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.990 
happen I'm just eyeballing these so we
could<00:03:23.070> be<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:23.370> all<00:03:23.400> day

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
could be here all day

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.990 
could be here all day
oh<00:03:24.720> wait<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.200> minute<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.830> kit<00:03:26.070> comes<00:03:26.460> with<00:03:26.640> one

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
oh wait a minute the kit comes with one

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.660 
oh wait a minute the kit comes with one
there's<00:03:27.900> actually<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.350> hex<00:03:28.590> wrench<00:03:28.710> inside<00:03:29.460> the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
there's actually a hex wrench inside the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.750 
there's actually a hex wrench inside the
kit<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.810> while<00:03:34.020> we<00:03:34.140> were<00:03:34.230> off<00:03:34.410> camera<00:03:34.440> we<00:03:35.100> took

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
kit so while we were off camera we took

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.280 
kit so while we were off camera we took
off<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> motor<00:03:36.210> hatch<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.720> disabled<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
off the motor hatch and disabled the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.690 
off the motor hatch and disabled the
thrust<00:03:37.620> vectoring<00:03:37.980> which<00:03:38.250> was<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.430> pretty

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
thrust vectoring which was a pretty

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.370 
thrust vectoring which was a pretty
simple<00:03:39.180> process<00:03:39.330> pretty<00:03:39.840> simple<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.320> it

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
simple process pretty simple and it

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.870 
simple process pretty simple and it
makes<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.680> easy<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.130> fly<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.520> you're<00:03:41.670> just

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
makes it easy to fly if you're just

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.720 
makes it easy to fly if you're just
starting<00:03:42.060> out<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.370> don't<00:03:44.490> want

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
starting out and and and you don't want

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.430 
starting out and and and you don't want
to<00:03:44.760> have<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.060> wild<00:03:45.510> capabilities<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.350> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
to have the wild capabilities of the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.710 
to have the wild capabilities of the
Scimitar<00:03:46.830> then<00:03:47.280> we<00:03:47.400> restored<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> receiver

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
Scimitar then we restored the receiver

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.750 
Scimitar then we restored the receiver
hatch<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.320> one<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.070> cool<00:03:50.250> things<00:03:50.520> that<00:03:50.610> ii

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
hatch and one of the cool things that ii

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.790 
hatch and one of the cool things that ii
Flake<00:03:51.090> did<00:03:51.270> is<00:03:51.390> they<00:03:51.510> put<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.780> bind<00:03:52.050> plug<00:03:52.350> they

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
Flake did is they put the bind plug they

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.770 
Flake did is they put the bind plug they
extended<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.430> out<00:03:53.640> from<00:03:53.970> underneath<00:03:54.570> the

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
extended it out from underneath the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.110 
extended it out from underneath the
receiver<00:03:55.110> hatch<00:03:55.320> here<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.830> if<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.550> have<00:03:56.790> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
receiver hatch here so if you have the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.880 
receiver hatch here so if you have the
find<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.780> fly<00:03:57.960> you<00:03:58.020> can<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.410> put<00:03:58.560> your<00:03:58.590> bind

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
find and fly you can just put your bind

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.770 
find and fly you can just put your bind
plug<00:03:59.190> in<00:03:59.400> go<00:03:59.940> ahead<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.150> bind<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:00.570> to<00:04:00.660> your

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
plug in go ahead and bind it to your

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.860 
plug in go ahead and bind it to your
transmitter<00:04:01.320> drop<00:04:02.010> your<00:04:02.190> battery<00:04:02.520> in<00:04:02.780> put<00:04:03.780> the

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
the wings in the vertical fins okay

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.610 
the wings in the vertical fins okay
start<00:04:09.510> with<00:04:09.600> this<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.960> carbon<00:04:10.320> well<00:04:10.590> I

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
start with this the carbon well I

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.250 
start with this the carbon well I
thought<00:04:10.770> you<00:04:10.890> were<00:04:10.980> gonna<00:04:11.070> smack<00:04:11.460> me<00:04:11.490> with<00:04:11.760> it

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
thought you were gonna smack me with it

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.900 
thought you were gonna smack me with it
and<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.440> one<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.920> long<00:04:14.340> one<00:04:14.520> goes<00:04:14.670> in<00:04:14.820> the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
and this one the long one goes in the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.280 
and this one the long one goes in the
rear<00:04:15.090> okay

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
rear okay

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.100 
rear okay
you'll<00:04:16.470> put<00:04:16.710> the<00:04:16.830> short<00:04:17.100> one<00:04:17.250> in<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.430> front

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.590 

pretty<00:04:22.110> simple<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.950> is<00:04:23.130> pretty<00:04:23.400> soon<00:04:23.610> okay<00:04:23.910> so

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
pretty simple it is pretty soon okay so

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.320 
pretty simple it is pretty soon okay so
these<00:04:24.720> going<00:04:24.990> back<00:04:25.170> and<00:04:25.440> then<00:04:26.090> we<00:04:27.090> want<00:04:27.300> to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
these going back and then we want to

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.870 
these going back and then we want to
make<00:04:27.510> sure<00:04:27.540> that<00:04:27.870> these<00:04:28.050> are<00:04:28.260> even<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.770> course

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
make sure that these are even of course

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.220 
make sure that these are even of course
it's<00:04:29.880> just<00:04:29.940> always<00:04:30.180> good<00:04:30.420> practice<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:30.990> then

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
it's just always good practice and then

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.340 
it's just always good practice and then
when<00:04:31.770> we<00:04:31.920> slide<00:04:32.220> on<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.700> vertical<00:04:33.120> fins<00:04:34.050> we

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
when we slide on the vertical fins we

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.560 
when we slide on the vertical fins we
want<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.650> make<00:04:34.770> sure<00:04:34.980> that<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.460> servo<00:04:36.300> leads

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
want to make sure that the servo leads

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.960 
want to make sure that the servo leads
connect<00:04:37.140> in<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.890> appropriate<00:04:38.340> place<00:04:38.610> pop

terrific<00:05:03.720> so<00:05:05.270> we're<00:05:06.270> gonna<00:05:06.360> slide<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.870> wing

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
terrific so we're gonna slide the wing

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.660 
terrific so we're gonna slide the wing
on<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:07.560> we'll<00:05:07.650> do<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.860> same<00:05:08.130> thing<00:05:08.370> with<00:05:08.550> our

on and we'll do the same thing with our

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.580 
on and we'll do the same thing with our
lead<00:05:08.940> here<00:05:09.720> now

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
hold hold the plane up and you'll see

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.380 
hold hold the plane up and you'll see
there<00:05:13.650> are<00:05:13.740> holes<00:05:13.980> down<00:05:14.220> here<00:05:14.700> and<00:05:14.880> these<00:05:15.210> are

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
there are holes down here and these are

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.070 
there are holes down here and these are
going<00:05:15.540> to<00:05:15.630> keep<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.050> wings<00:05:16.260> in<00:05:16.560> place<00:05:18.080> and

products are very well made and if you

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.550 
products are very well made and if you
have<00:05:26.670> any<00:05:27.180> for<00:05:27.630> sitting<00:05:27.960> or<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:28.230> can<00:05:28.380> feel

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
have any for sitting or you can feel

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.170 
have any for sitting or you can feel
like<00:05:28.710> it's<00:05:28.770> not<00:05:29.070> threading<00:05:29.580> you're<00:05:29.880> doing

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
like it's not threading you're doing

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.420 
like it's not threading you're doing
something<00:05:30.420> wrong<00:05:30.720> in<00:05:30.960> most<00:05:31.380> cases<00:05:31.650> so<00:05:32.310> we'll

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
something wrong in most cases so we'll

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.580 
something wrong in most cases so we'll
just<00:05:32.610> make<00:05:33.090> that<00:05:33.270> snug<00:05:33.600> but<00:05:33.870> again<00:05:34.080> not<00:05:34.290> over

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
just make that snug but again not over

just make that snug but again not over
tight<00:05:34.830> look<00:05:35.670> at<00:05:35.820> that<00:05:35.970> we<00:05:36.660> have<00:05:36.930> us<00:05:37.590> a<00:05:38.390> carbon<00:05:39.390> z

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
tight look at that we have us a carbon z

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.620 
tight look at that we have us a carbon z
scimitar<00:05:40.170> and<00:05:40.620> when<00:05:41.610> we<00:05:41.730> pop<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.120> battery<00:05:42.450> in

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
scimitar and when we pop the battery in

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.960 
scimitar and when we pop the battery in
the<00:05:42.690> nose<00:05:42.960> and<00:05:43.320> notice<00:05:43.920> that<00:05:44.070> notice<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.580> CG

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
the nose and notice that notice the CG

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.570 
the nose and notice that notice the CG
here<00:05:45.180> notice<00:05:45.480> this<00:05:45.600> thing<00:05:45.780> is<00:05:45.960> rock<00:05:46.200> back

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
here notice this thing is rock back

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.800 
here notice this thing is rock back
Terry<00:05:47.580> go<00:05:47.730> ahead<00:05:47.850> and<00:05:47.940> remove<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.300> canopy<00:05:48.630> and

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
Terry go ahead and remove the canopy and

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.780 
Terry go ahead and remove the canopy and
let's<00:05:48.960> drop<00:05:49.140> the<00:05:49.320> battery<00:05:49.680> on<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.100> I'm<00:05:50.670> going

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
let's drop the battery on and I'm going

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.270 
let's drop the battery on and I'm going
to<00:05:50.850> show<00:05:51.060> everybody<00:05:51.300> how<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:52.470> thing<00:05:52.770> balances

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
to show everybody how the thing balances

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.340 
to show everybody how the thing balances
out<00:05:53.600> with<00:05:54.600> the<00:05:54.720> battery<00:05:55.080> in<00:05:55.170> the<00:05:55.200> compartment

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
out with the battery in the compartment

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.990 
out with the battery in the compartment
we<00:05:55.800> don't<00:05:55.980> need<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.190> secure<00:05:56.520> it<00:05:56.640> we'll<00:05:56.790> just

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
we don't need to secure it we'll just

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.300 
we don't need to secure it we'll just
drop<00:05:57.150> it<00:05:57.360> in<00:05:57.920> this<00:05:58.920> looks<00:05:59.910> good<00:06:00.060> to<00:06:00.120> me<00:06:01.100> so<00:06:02.100> for

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
drop it in this looks good to me so for

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.160 
drop it in this looks good to me so for
a<00:06:02.340> flying<00:06:02.700> wing<00:06:03.030> type<00:06:03.360> aircraft<00:06:03.900> like<00:06:04.050> the

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
a flying wing type aircraft like the

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.050 
a flying wing type aircraft like the
scimitar<00:06:04.650> it's<00:06:04.860> very<00:06:05.280> important<00:06:05.820> to<00:06:05.880> balance

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
scimitar it's very important to balance

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.210 
scimitar it's very important to balance
it<00:06:06.420> right<00:06:06.630> and<00:06:07.140> so<00:06:07.230> what<00:06:07.410> we<00:06:07.530> did<00:06:07.680> is<00:06:07.860> we<00:06:07.890> drop

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
it right and so what we did is we drop

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.070 
it right and so what we did is we drop
the<00:06:08.400> battery<00:06:08.730> in<00:06:08.940> all<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.360> way<00:06:09.450> forward<00:06:09.780> in

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
the battery in all the way forward in

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.440 
the battery in all the way forward in
the<00:06:10.170> battery<00:06:10.440> compartment<00:06:10.530> to<00:06:11.520> begin<00:06:11.880> with<00:06:12.090> to

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
the battery compartment to begin with to

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.150 
the battery compartment to begin with to
see<00:06:12.720> where<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.110> Scimitar<00:06:13.500> would<00:06:13.680> balance<00:06:13.830> and

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
see where the Scimitar would balance and

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.250 
see where the Scimitar would balance and
you<00:06:14.580> measure<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:15.090> balance<00:06:15.390> point<00:06:15.660> from<00:06:16.020> the

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
you measure the balance point from the

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.720 
you measure the balance point from the
tip<00:06:16.530> of<00:06:16.740> the<00:06:17.070> nose<00:06:17.250> back<00:06:18.500> 563<00:06:19.500> to<00:06:19.770> 565

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
tip of the nose back 563 to 565

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.870 
tip of the nose back 563 to 565
millimeters<00:06:21.390> to<00:06:22.200> get<00:06:22.410> your<00:06:22.530> balance<00:06:22.860> point<00:06:23.160> so

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
millimeters to get your balance point so

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.450 
millimeters to get your balance point so
that's<00:06:24.390> it<00:06:24.630> we<00:06:25.200> installed<00:06:25.620> our<00:06:25.770> second<00:06:26.250> set<00:06:26.430> of

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
that's it we installed our second set of

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.850 
that's it we installed our second set of
winged<00:06:26.790> bolts

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
winged bolts

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.430 
winged bolts
my<00:06:28.130> stuff<00:06:28.790> now<00:06:29.120> I<00:06:29.150> think<00:06:29.450> it's<00:06:29.660> ready<00:06:29.840> to<00:06:29.960> fly<00:06:30.140> I

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
my stuff now I think it's ready to fly I

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.930 
my stuff now I think it's ready to fly I
think<00:06:30.740> we<00:06:30.830> did<00:06:30.980> a<00:06:31.010> great<00:06:31.160> job<00:06:31.250> do<00:06:31.790> you<00:06:31.880> think

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
think we did a great job do you think

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.000 
think we did a great job do you think
you<00:06:32.210> could<00:06:32.360> fly<00:06:32.540> I<00:06:32.900> think<00:06:33.380> I<00:06:33.500> could<00:06:33.740> but<00:06:33.980> I

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
you could fly I think I could but I

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.650 
you could fly I think I could but I
think<00:06:34.310> maybe<00:06:34.490> we're<00:06:34.730> gonna<00:06:34.790> let<00:06:35.090> Larry<00:06:35.300> fly<00:06:35.600> it

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
think maybe we're gonna let Larry fly it

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.930 
think maybe we're gonna let Larry fly it
I<00:06:35.990> think<00:06:36.440> it's<00:06:36.530> a<00:06:36.620> good<00:06:36.740> idea<00:06:36.920> if<00:06:37.550> you<00:06:37.670> want<00:06:37.790> to
