this<00:06:47.169> one<00:06:47.470> is<00:06:47.620> going<00:06:47.770> to<00:06:47.860> be<00:06:47.919> picked<00:06:48.310> off<00:06:48.580> and

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
this one is going to be picked off and

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.870 
this one is going to be picked off and
that<00:06:49.780> is<00:06:49.960> pretty<00:06:50.320> much<00:06:50.470> one<00:06:51.070> too<00:06:51.190> silly<00:06:51.520> and

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
that is pretty much one too silly and

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.390 
that is pretty much one too silly and
that<00:06:52.510> was<00:06:52.780> a<00:06:52.990> terrible<00:06:53.320> innocence<00:06:53.919> for<00:06:54.070> Mario

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
that was a terrible innocence for Mario

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.189 
that was a terrible innocence for Mario
to<00:06:54.460> his<00:06:54.610> third<00:06:54.880> of<00:06:55.000> the<00:06:55.120> game<00:06:55.150> we<00:06:55.780> will<00:06:55.990> hold

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 
to his third of the game we will hold

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:58.110 
to his third of the game we will hold
using<00:06:56.740> the<00:06:56.830> three<00:06:57.070> points<00:06:57.460> but<00:06:57.610> look<00:06:57.760> at<00:06:57.910> this

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
using the three points but look at this

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.379 
using the three points but look at this
when<00:06:58.990> things<00:06:59.350> go<00:06:59.860> bad<00:06:59.889> everything<00:07:00.820> gets<00:07:01.060> worse

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
when things go bad everything gets worse

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:03.600 
when things go bad everything gets worse
we<00:07:01.990> are<00:07:02.110> going<00:07:02.290> to<00:07:02.350> have<00:07:02.530> a<00:07:02.770> roughing<00:07:03.580> the

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
as well we barely touched the kicker but

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.120
