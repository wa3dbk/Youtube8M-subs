00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.390 
consistent don't use your index finger
just<00:02:49.350> because<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.650> easier<00:02:50.100> because<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.340> know

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
just because it's easier because I know

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.860

for<00:02:50.670> some<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.000> beginning<00:02:51.360> guitar<00:02:51.450> players

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
for some of you beginning guitar players

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.690 
for some of you beginning guitar players
it's<00:02:52.320> totally<00:02:52.770> easier<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.220> use<00:02:53.340> your<00:02:53.460> index

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
it's totally easier to use your index

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.880 
it's totally easier to use your index
finger<00:02:54.030> but<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:55.080> need<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> practice<00:02:55.710> using

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
finger but you need a practice using

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.650 
finger but you need a practice using
more<00:02:56.160> than<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.460> your<00:02:56.490> index<00:02:56.820> finger<00:02:57.060> okay<00:02:57.240> so

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
more than just your index finger okay so

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.270 
more than just your index finger okay so
try<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.960> make<00:02:58.140> use<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.320> more<00:02:58.620> than<00:02:58.650> more

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
try to make use of more than more

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.800 
try to make use of more than more
fingers<00:02:59.580> especially<00:03:00.240> your<00:03:00.330> pinkie<00:03:00.570> when<00:03:00.720> we

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
fingers especially your pinkie when we

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.330 
fingers especially your pinkie when we
get<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.050> point<00:03:01.170> we're<00:03:02.040> going<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.250> go

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
get to that point we're going to go

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.740 
get to that point we're going to go
through<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.520> scale<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:03.000> little<00:03:03.240> bit<00:03:03.330> slowly<00:03:03.570> so

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
through the scale a little bit slowly so

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.420 
through the scale a little bit slowly so
you<00:03:03.810> get<00:03:03.990> a<00:03:04.020> feel<00:03:04.320> for<00:03:04.530> warming<00:03:04.770> up<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.040> this

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
you get a feel for warming up to it this

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.660 
you get a feel for warming up to it this
is<00:03:05.490> what<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.820> sounds<00:03:06.000> like

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.470 

you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.610 

you

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.020 

we're<00:03:23.620> gonna<00:03:23.709> do<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.129> reverse<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.700> when<00:03:24.939> we

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
we're gonna do it in reverse and when we

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.190 
we're gonna do it in reverse and when we
do<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.239> in<00:03:25.329> reverse<00:03:25.450> we're<00:03:25.840> still<00:03:26.019> going<00:03:26.109> to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
do it in reverse we're still going to

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:43.690 
do it in reverse we're still going to
start<00:03:26.349> with<00:03:26.439> a<00:03:26.530> Down<00:03:26.829> strum

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.420 

and<00:03:44.080> now<00:03:45.080> we're<00:03:45.650> going<00:03:45.770> to<00:03:45.830> go<00:03:46.040> through<00:03:46.340> that

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
and now we're going to go through that

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.970 
and now we're going to go through that
scale<00:03:47.110> forwards<00:03:48.110> from<00:03:48.260> lowest<00:03:48.650> note<00:03:48.800> to<00:03:48.890> the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
scale forwards from lowest note to the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
highest note and backwards highest note

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.050 
highest note and backwards highest note
to<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.050> lowest<00:03:51.170> note<00:03:51.379> a<00:03:51.500> couple<00:03:51.530> times<00:03:52.069> slowly

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
to the lowest note a couple times slowly

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.790 
to the lowest note a couple times slowly
so<00:03:53.300> you're<00:03:53.390> going<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.569> practice<00:03:53.750> alone<00:03:54.140> so
