00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.690 
mouth you're gonna do the exact same
stitch<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.890> make<00:01:32.100> sure<00:01:32.220> you're<00:01:32.369> using<00:01:32.550> your

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
stitch and make sure you're using your

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.010 
stitch and make sure you're using your
light<00:01:33.270> tan<00:01:33.720> embroidery<00:01:34.619> floss<00:01:34.800> or<00:01:35.400> thread<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
light tan embroidery floss or thread and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.469 
light tan embroidery floss or thread and
when<00:01:38.009> you're<00:01:38.130> using<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.550> embroidery<00:01:38.970> floss<00:01:39.119> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
when you're using the embroidery floss I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.859 
when you're using the embroidery floss I
use<00:01:39.930> two<00:01:40.380> strands<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.300> stitches<00:01:42.509> are

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
use two strands just so the stitches are

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.070 
use two strands just so the stitches are
more<00:01:43.229> secure<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.979> are<00:01:44.850> stronger<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.780> they

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
more secure and are stronger so they

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.170 
more secure and are stronger so they
don't<00:01:46.259> break<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:49.700> make<00:01:50.700> sure<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.909> go<00:01:51.060> around

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
don't break and make sure you go around

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.020 
don't break and make sure you go around
the<00:01:51.420> entire<00:01:51.470> mouthpiece<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.340> next<00:01:56.820> we're

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the entire mouthpiece so next we're

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.669 
the entire mouthpiece so next we're
going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.240> put<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.539> stitches<00:01:57.810> connecting<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.469 
going to put the stitches connecting the
ears<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.310> mouth<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.789> it's<00:01:59.910> just<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.240> little

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479

through<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.010> don't<00:02:17.070> know<00:02:17.250> how<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.459> explain

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
through and I don't know how to explain

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.500 
through and I don't know how to explain
this<00:02:17.850> but<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.600> showed<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.239> next<00:02:21.239> we're

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
this but I showed you so and next we're

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.020 
this but I showed you so and next we're
going<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.690> put<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.500> eyes<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.160> I'm<00:02:23.610> drawing

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
going to put on the eyes and I'm drawing

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.210 
going to put on the eyes and I'm drawing
mine<00:02:24.300> on<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.989> sharpie<00:02:25.410> first<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.069> also

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
mine on with a sharpie first and I also

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.729 
mine on with a sharpie first and I also
drew<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.790> mouth<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.050> know<00:02:28.170> where

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
drew on the mouth just so I know where

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.170 
drew on the mouth just so I know where
to<00:02:28.769> position<00:02:29.760> my<00:02:30.450> eyes<00:02:30.870> or<00:02:31.350> start<00:02:32.070> sewing<00:02:32.489> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
to position my eyes or start sewing and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.539 
to position my eyes or start sewing and
this<00:02:33.959> is<00:02:34.140> probably<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> trickiest<00:02:34.890> part<00:02:35.400> of

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
this is probably the trickiest part of

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.000 
this is probably the trickiest part of
the<00:02:35.670> entire<00:02:36.060> plush<00:02:36.540> keychain<00:02:37.079> you're<00:02:37.799> gonna

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
the entire plush keychain you're gonna

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.340 
the entire plush keychain you're gonna
want<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.280> make<00:02:38.370> sort<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.180> cross<00:02:39.570> shape<00:02:40.079> and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
want to make sort of a cross shape and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.789 
want to make sort of a cross shape and
then<00:02:40.739> fill<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.730> gaps<00:02:42.209> almost<00:02:42.959> like<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.320> star

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
then fill in the gaps almost like a star

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.920 
then fill in the gaps almost like a star
but<00:02:44.340> more<00:02:45.150> linked<00:02:45.780> like<00:02:46.079> lengthwise<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:47.190> guess

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
but more linked like lengthwise I guess

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.340 
but more linked like lengthwise I guess
so

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
so

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.770 
so
and<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:49.950> fill<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.459> all<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.880> gaps<00:02:51.060> in

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
and just fill in all the gaps in

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.720 
and just fill in all the gaps in
diagonals<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.920> sometimes<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.489> do

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
diagonals and sometimes you do

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.960 
diagonals and sometimes you do
horizontals<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.860> it's<00:02:55.860> something<00:02:56.220> it's<00:02:56.700> not

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
horizontals and it's something it's not

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.080 
horizontals and it's something it's not
hard<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.989> do<00:02:58.290> after<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.100> do<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.489> few<00:02:59.910> times

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
hard to do after you do it a few times

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.840 
hard to do after you do it a few times
but<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.870> can<00:03:01.200> be<00:03:01.320> tricky<00:03:01.530> at<00:03:01.769> first<00:03:01.820> so<00:03:02.820> I

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
but it can be tricky at first so I

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.210 
but it can be tricky at first so I
definitely<00:03:03.120> recommend<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.989> draw<00:03:04.290> on<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
definitely recommend you draw on the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.970 
definitely recommend you draw on the
eyes<00:03:05.400> first<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.329> can<00:03:06.739> sort<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.829> have<00:03:07.920> a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
eyes first so you can sort of have a

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.120 
eyes first so you can sort of have a
stencil<00:03:08.400> for<00:03:08.880> what<00:03:09.329> you're<00:03:09.540> sewing

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.030 

so<00:03:14.910> next<00:03:15.270> we're<00:03:15.570> moving<00:03:15.600> on<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.440> nose<00:03:16.680> and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
so next we're moving on to the nose and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.460 
so next we're moving on to the nose and
I'm<00:03:17.280> going<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.760> put<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.210> stitch<00:03:18.630> across<00:03:18.870> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
I'm going to put a stitch across the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.650 
I'm going to put a stitch across the
nose<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.980> then<00:03:20.310> I'm<00:03:20.550> gonna<00:03:20.730> make<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.030> triangle

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
nose and then I'm gonna make a triangle

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.100 
nose and then I'm gonna make a triangle
pattern<00:03:21.840> out<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.430> string<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.000> then<00:03:24.300> sew

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
pattern out of the string and then sew

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.430 
pattern out of the string and then sew
in<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.250> fill<00:03:26.640> in<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.090> gap<00:03:27.270> or<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.930> can't

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
in and fill in the gap or so you can't

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.970 
in and fill in the gap or so you can't
see<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.800> white<00:03:28.950> part

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.960 

and<00:03:38.489> then<00:03:39.030> you're<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.330> gonna<00:03:39.510> sew<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.230> line

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
and then you're just gonna sew a line

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.140 
and then you're just gonna sew a line
afterwards

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
afterwards

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.630 
afterwards
connecting<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.170> nose<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:43.920> end<00:03:44.099> of<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
connecting the nose to the end of the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.420 
connecting the nose to the end of the
mouthpiece<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:46.200> I'm<00:03:47.190> also<00:03:47.489> going<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.590> add<00:03:49.590> a

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
mouthpiece and I'm also going to add a

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.920 
mouthpiece and I'm also going to add a
pink<00:03:51.030> little<00:03:51.209> mouth<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.780> my<00:03:52.050> guy<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.720> like

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
pink little mouth on my guy so it's like

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.740 
pink little mouth on my guy so it's like
one<00:03:55.110> of<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.380> plushies<00:03:55.970> cuz<00:03:56.970> one<00:03:57.239> has<00:03:57.480> their

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
one of the plushies cuz one has their

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.080 
one of the plushies cuz one has their
mouth<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.380> closed<00:03:58.769> both<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.610> them<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.000> the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
mouth like closed both of them and the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.570 
mouth like closed both of them and the
other<00:04:00.239> ones<00:04:00.540> with<00:04:00.780> their<00:04:00.930> mouth<00:04:01.110> open<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:02.099> I

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
other ones with their mouth open and I

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.710 
other ones with their mouth open and I
just<00:04:02.610> like<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.030> one<00:04:03.180> with<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.300> mouth<00:04:03.510> open

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
just like the one with the mouth open

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.130 
just like the one with the mouth open
cuz<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.290> gives<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.590> plush<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.830> bit<00:04:05.099> more<00:04:05.250> color

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
cuz it gives a plush a bit more color

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.289 
cuz it gives a plush a bit more color
and<00:04:07.140> here's<00:04:07.650> where<00:04:07.860> I'm<00:04:08.010> drawing<00:04:08.310> art<00:04:08.610> sewing

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
and here's where I'm drawing art sewing

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.860 
and here's where I'm drawing art sewing
in<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.660> line<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.430> mouth<00:04:14.330> not<00:04:15.330> difficult

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
in the line to the mouth not difficult

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.479 
in the line to the mouth not difficult
just<00:04:16.079> make<00:04:16.290> sure<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.560> come<00:04:16.859> up<00:04:17.070> where<00:04:17.370> you

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
just make sure you come up where you

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.009 
just make sure you come up where you
went<00:04:17.760> down<00:04:18.120> when<00:04:18.540> you're<00:04:18.690> doing<00:04:18.989> your

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
went down when you're doing your

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.610 
went down when you're doing your
stitches<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:24.750> know<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:24.900> did<00:04:25.080> three<00:04:25.350> stitches

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
stitches you know I did three stitches

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.560 
stitches you know I did three stitches
for<00:04:26.010> this<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.430> should<00:04:26.490> probably<00:04:27.180> be<00:04:27.389> able<00:04:27.450> to

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
for this you should probably be able to

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.350 
for this you should probably be able to
do<00:04:27.720> three<00:04:28.110> or<00:04:28.139> two<00:04:28.940> but<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:30.060> should<00:04:30.240> do

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
do three or two but you should do

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.510 
do three or two but you should do
smaller<00:04:30.630> stitches<00:04:31.080> so<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.350> won't<00:04:32.100> seeing<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
smaller stitches so you won't seeing the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.000 
smaller stitches so you won't seeing the
white<00:04:32.700> between<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.210> lines<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:34.800> last

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
white between the lines and the last

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
kind of do it I don't know so when you

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.200 
kind of do it I don't know so when you
do<00:04:53.130> these<00:04:53.250> stitches<00:04:53.639> you<00:04:53.760> want<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:53.970> make<00:04:54.060> sure

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
do these stitches you want to make sure

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.070 
do these stitches you want to make sure
you<00:04:54.330> go<00:04:54.600> through<00:04:54.630> your<00:04:55.139> loop<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:55.710> it's<00:04:56.400> not<00:04:56.639> a

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
you go through your loop so it's not a

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.290 
you go through your loop so it's not a
blanket<00:04:58.080> stitch<00:04:58.470> really<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.280> guess<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.060> kind<00:05:00.270> of

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
blanket stitch really I guess it kind of

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.090 
blanket stitch really I guess it kind of
is<00:05:00.419> but<00:05:00.630> it's<00:05:00.750> not<00:05:00.810> as<00:05:01.020> strong<00:05:01.410> because<00:05:01.740> it's

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
is but it's not as strong because it's

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.240 
is but it's not as strong because it's
only<00:05:02.250> looped<00:05:02.520> around<00:05:02.639> like<00:05:02.940> once<00:05:03.860> if<00:05:04.860> you

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
only looped around like once if you

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.320 
only looped around like once if you
might<00:05:05.580> not<00:05:05.729> know<00:05:05.820> what<00:05:05.850> I'm<00:05:05.970> talking<00:05:06.270> about
