done<00:03:49.829> is<00:03:50.280> turn<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.880> temperature<00:03:51.299> up<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.810> little

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
done is turn the temperature up a little

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.250 
done is turn the temperature up a little
bit<00:03:52.319> so<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.160> have<00:03:53.340> more<00:03:53.639> space<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:54.569> growing

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
bit so we have more space for growing
