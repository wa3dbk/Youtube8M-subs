it's it's tipping pretty steep towards

the lake so what that means is any

spills or any any problems that we could
have<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> farm<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.649> wouldn't<00:01:58.890> take<00:01:59.009> long

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
have on the farm it wouldn't take long

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.300 
have on the farm it wouldn't take long
to<00:02:00.119> get<00:02:00.299> into<00:02:00.689> into<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> lake<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.540> made<00:02:03.540> a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
to get into into the lake so I made a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
to get into into the lake so I made a
concentrated<00:02:05.310> effort<00:02:05.670> even<00:02:06.149> before<00:02:06.750> we

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
concentrated effort even before we

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.869 
concentrated effort even before we
started<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> meat<00:02:07.619> verification<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.610> ensure

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
started the meat verification to ensure

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.070 
started the meat verification to ensure
that<00:02:09.709> that<00:02:10.709> no

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
that that no

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.950 
that that no
polluted<00:02:12.470> water<00:02:12.830> got<00:02:13.190> off<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.580> site<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.150> this

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
polluted water got off the site so this

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.400 
polluted water got off the site so this
this<00:02:15.650> meat<00:02:15.890> program<00:02:16.420> really<00:02:17.420> brought<00:02:18.200> things

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
this meat program really brought things
