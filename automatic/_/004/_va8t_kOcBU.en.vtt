needed<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> should<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.490> easy<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.810> reason

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
needed it should be easy but the reason

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.600

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
as you can see back in a previous build

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.140

but<00:04:03.420> I'm<00:04:03.720> not<00:04:03.930> sure<00:04:04.170> how<00:04:04.700> safe<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.910> would<00:04:06.000> be

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
but I'm not sure how safe that would be

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.780 
but I'm not sure how safe that would be
or<00:04:06.390> if<00:04:06.480> it's<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.780> whole<00:04:06.959> thing<00:04:07.290> or<00:04:07.790> exactly

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
or if it's the whole thing or exactly

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.050 
or if it's the whole thing or exactly
where<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.090> goes<00:04:09.270> so<00:04:09.600> I'm<00:04:09.989> just<00:04:10.380> going<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:11.060> keep

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
where it goes so I'm just going to keep

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.060 
where it goes so I'm just going to keep
my<00:04:12.239> old<00:04:12.420> backup<00:04:12.660> as<00:04:12.989> well<00:04:13.200> as<00:04:13.470> I<00:04:13.650> ever<00:04:13.770> want<00:04:13.920> to

revert back to the old one another thing

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.979 
revert back to the old one another thing
though<00:04:17.790> that<00:04:17.820> I<00:04:18.239> did<00:04:18.390> notice<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:18.720> they

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
though that I did notice is they

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.080 
though that I did notice is they
actually<00:04:19.380> removed<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.950> crafting<00:04:20.430> table<00:04:20.580> 3

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
actually removed the crafting table 3

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.300 
actually removed the crafting table 3
from<00:04:21.390> this<00:04:21.720> new<00:04:22.380> build<00:04:22.620> they<00:04:22.860> added<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.190> whole

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
from this new build they added a whole

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.850 
from this new build they added a whole
bunch<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.640> stuff<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.720> made<00:04:24.930> some<00:04:25.140> more

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
bunch of stuff and made some more

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.119 
bunch of stuff and made some more
updates<00:04:26.610> on<00:04:26.849> a<00:04:26.879> ton<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.330> other<00:04:27.659> mods<00:04:28.560> but<00:04:28.949> they

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
updates on a ton of other mods but they

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.219 
updates on a ton of other mods but they
completely<00:04:29.550> took<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.360> crafting<00:04:30.720> table<00:04:30.840> three

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
completely took the crafting table three

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.409 
completely took the crafting table three
out<00:04:31.379> and<00:04:31.710> my<00:04:32.220> guess<00:04:32.490> as<00:04:32.699> to<00:04:32.909> why<00:04:33.030> they<00:04:33.210> did<00:04:33.389> that

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
out and my guess as to why they did that

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.140 
out and my guess as to why they did that
is<00:04:33.930> I<00:04:34.409> know<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:35.069> whenever<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.460> tried<00:04:35.789> to

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
is I know that whenever you tried to

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.330 
is I know that whenever you tried to
open<00:04:36.750> up<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:36.930> recipe<00:04:37.199> like<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:37.979> know<00:04:38.129> how<00:04:38.250> you

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
open up a recipe like you know how you

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.510 
open up a recipe like you know how you
could<00:04:38.490> press<00:04:38.699> R<00:04:38.940> while<00:04:39.840> in<00:04:40.590> your<00:04:40.860> inventory<00:04:41.129> to

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
could press R while in your inventory to

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.879 
could press R while in your inventory to
check<00:04:42.000> out<00:04:42.150> how<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.330> make<00:04:42.569> stuff<00:04:42.690> if<00:04:43.500> trying<00:04:43.800> to

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
check out how to make stuff if trying to

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.409 
check out how to make stuff if trying to
doing<00:04:44.099> that<00:04:44.220> while<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.550> crafting<00:04:44.940> table<00:04:45.090> 3

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
doing that while the crafting table 3

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.839 
doing that while the crafting table 3
was<00:04:45.569> open<00:04:45.870> however<00:04:46.020> would<00:04:46.470> probably<00:04:47.220> cause<00:04:47.430> or

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
was open however would probably cause or

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.730 
was open however would probably cause or
pretty<00:04:48.060> much<00:04:48.180> cause<00:04:48.419> a<00:04:48.449> crash<00:04:48.900> in<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.530> game

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
pretty much cause a crash in the game

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.649 
pretty much cause a crash in the game
and<00:04:50.159> if<00:04:50.370> not<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.610> crash<00:04:50.909> it<00:04:51.150> would<00:04:51.240> be<00:04:51.389> like<00:04:51.629> a

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
and if not a crash it would be like a

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.770 
and if not a crash it would be like a
really<00:04:52.080> long<00:04:52.379> hang<00:04:52.770> for<00:04:53.490> 20<00:04:53.879> to<00:04:53.970> 30<00:04:54.030> seconds

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
really long hang for 20 to 30 seconds

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.960 
really long hang for 20 to 30 seconds
until<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.229> would<00:04:55.379> resume<00:04:55.680> back<00:04:55.949> to<00:04:56.729> just

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
until it would resume back to just

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.110 
until it would resume back to just
taking<00:04:57.389> your<00:04:57.860> inventory<00:04:58.860> Oh<00:04:58.949> like<00:04:59.520> out<00:04:59.759> and

what<00:05:51.960> your<00:05:52.110> EMC<00:05:52.590> is<00:05:52.740> for<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.219> item<00:05:53.490> which<00:05:53.699> is

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
what your EMC is for the item which is

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.670 
what your EMC is for the item which is
really<00:05:54.029> really<00:05:54.180> nice<00:05:54.419> for<00:05:54.690> stuff<00:05:54.990> like<00:05:55.319> for

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
really really nice for stuff like for

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.010 
really really nice for stuff like for
example<00:05:55.770> if<00:05:56.370> you<00:05:56.490> have<00:05:56.580> a<00:05:56.639> half<00:05:57.210> broken<00:05:57.599> sword

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
example if you have a half broken sword

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.920 
example if you have a half broken sword
you<00:05:58.710> could<00:05:58.889> see<00:05:59.490> how<00:05:59.639> much<00:05:59.699> EMC<00:06:00.300> it<00:06:00.419> is<00:06:00.569> as<00:06:00.810> the

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
you could see how much EMC it is as the

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.360 
you could see how much EMC it is as the
durability<00:06:01.110> goes<00:06:01.500> down<00:06:01.889> so<00:06:02.129> you<00:06:02.219> could

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
durability goes down so you could

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.730 
durability goes down so you could
probably<00:06:02.490> make<00:06:02.729> you<00:06:02.940> know<00:06:03.060> better<00:06:03.740> decisions
