00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
hand cannon on xbox and it is up to par

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.189 
hand cannon on xbox and it is up to par
with<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.759> Hawkmoon<00:00:15.210> though<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.599> like<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
with the Hawkmoon though I do like the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.890 
with the Hawkmoon though I do like the
Hawkmoon<00:00:16.680> just<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.210> bit<00:00:18.330> more<00:00:18.600> this

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900

hand<00:00:19.109> cannon<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.529> excellent<00:00:20.100> because<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.369> is

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
hand cannon is excellent because it is

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.400 
hand cannon is excellent because it is
full<00:00:21.029> auto<00:00:21.420> meaning<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.900> hold<00:00:22.080> down<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
full auto meaning you hold down the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.990 
full auto meaning you hold down the
trigger<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.400> goes<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.640> has<00:00:23.970> a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
trigger and it just goes and has a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.060 
trigger and it just goes and has a
really<00:00:24.449> high<00:00:24.660> fire<00:00:24.990> rate<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.590> has<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> lot<00:00:26.039> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
really high fire rate it has a lot of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.029 
really high fire rate it has a lot of
perks<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.359> increase<00:00:27.869> hipfire<00:00:28.470> damage

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
will make enemies stagger more often

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630

single<00:00:52.320> point<00:00:52.530> sling<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.309> makes<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
single point sling which makes you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.279 
single point sling which makes you
switch<00:00:53.879> your<00:00:54.030> weapons<00:00:54.539> faster<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> move

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
switch your weapons faster and move

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.290 
switch your weapons faster and move
quicker<00:00:55.590> while<00:00:55.770> aiming<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.879> got<00:00:57.059> aggressive

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
quicker while aiming it's got aggressive

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.569 
quicker while aiming it's got aggressive
ballistics<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:58.410> has<00:00:58.620> confusing<00:00:59.250> language

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
ballistics which has confusing language

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.310 
ballistics which has confusing language
with<00:00:59.760> more<00:00:59.940> predictable<00:01:00.449> recoil<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.170> then

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
with more predictable recoil and then

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.840 
with more predictable recoil and then
more<00:01:01.500> recoil<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.399> gives<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> little

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
more recoil but it gives you a little

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.200 
more recoil but it gives you a little
bit<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.120> impact<00:01:03.690> smart<00:01:04.680> drift<00:01:04.920> control

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
bit more impact smart drift control

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
bit more impact smart drift control
predictable<00:01:06.210> recoil<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.100> penalty<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> range

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
predictable recoil and penalty to range

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.940 
predictable recoil and penalty to range
and<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.210> use<00:01:09.450> soft<00:01:09.720> ballistics<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.770> are

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and I use soft ballistics but these are

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.140 
and I use soft ballistics but these are
really<00:01:11.100> something<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.700> could<00:01:11.970> go

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
really something that you could go

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.890 
really something that you could go
through<00:01:13.100> situationally<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.640> kind<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.689> I

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
through situationally I kind of like I

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.990 
through situationally I kind of like I
kind<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.520> PvP

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
kind of like this one a lot for PvP

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.460 
kind of like this one a lot for PvP
it'll<00:01:18.270> help<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.540> land<00:01:18.750> those<00:01:18.960> crits<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.350> bit

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
it'll help you land those crits a bit

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
it'll help you land those crits a bit
better<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.670> pistol<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.180> I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
better and this is a pistol that I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.539 
better and this is a pistol that I
really<00:01:21.509> use<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.840> close<00:01:22.110> range<00:01:22.470> anyways<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
really use at close range anyways so

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.850 
really use at close range anyways so
this<00:01:24.390> might<00:01:24.689> be<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.869> perk<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.470> would<00:01:25.619> use

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
this might be a perk that you would use

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.060 
this might be a perk that you would use
in<00:01:26.189> PvP<00:01:26.700> more<00:01:26.970> often<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.860> want<00:01:29.009> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
in PvP more often if you if you want to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
in PvP more often if you if you want to
use<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> high-caliber<00:01:29.880> rounds<00:01:30.060> that'll<00:01:30.479> help

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
use the high-caliber rounds that'll help

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.880 
use the high-caliber rounds that'll help
stagger<00:01:30.900> enemies<00:01:31.320> though<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.619> won't<00:01:31.829> really

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
stagger enemies though this won't really

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.679 
stagger enemies though this won't really
help<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.549> PvP<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.090> much<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.479> would

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
help you in PvP that much I would

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
help you in PvP that much I would
recommend<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.680> perfect<00:01:35.100> balance<00:01:35.490> in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
recommend going with perfect balance in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.569 
recommend going with perfect balance in
PvP<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:37.079> single<00:01:37.500> point<00:01:37.710> sling<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.400> good

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
PvP and then single point sling is good

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.429 
PvP and then single point sling is good
for<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.329> getting<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> weapon<00:01:39.960> out<00:01:40.049> quickly
