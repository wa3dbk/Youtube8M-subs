00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello all beach figures heartily 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:09.900
 Welcome to 13 practice us fat and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.790
 get sick and have done and in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.759
 this video is divided into two parts 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.869
 it will go straight on with it 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.680
 lie number one is bad 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.350
 avoid 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.410
 yes, the myth of bad cholesterol 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.990
 he keeps himself stubborn at night 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.090
 90% of cholesterol from the body itself 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.360
 is produced because its necessary 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.160
 fabric is still forgotten and 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.040
 the factor hdl clgl lipoprotein that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.379
 namely the good HDL lipoproteins of 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.110
 raising eggs is also forgotten 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.879
 or that there are a lot of vitamins 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.510
 Minerals good proteins and good fats 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.180
 contains 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.010
 my recommendation you do not only need 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.320
 Two eggs sample when rick scott 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.649
 to eat at 10 to 20 euros per week 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 completely left to you lie number 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.750
 two a calorie is equal to one 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.250
 calorie no matter where it comes from and we 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 Just need less calories 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.170
 Now eat 100 calories from pure 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.229
 Proteins are not equal to 100 calories 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.060
 from glucose because protein helps firstly 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.100
 in muscle building and has through the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.070
 thermo genesis a higher consumption 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.439
 effects on the body and glucose 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.290
 produced by insulin ascended one 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.360
 greater hunger as a problem 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.590
 100 calorie fructose pure fructose 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.380
 also create a bigger one 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.299
 hunger as glucose be it the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.220
 interaction on hunger on the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.970
 hormones and health is included 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.600
 calories different lie number 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.899
 three is generally bad 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.100
 that is not true because the effect 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.340
 on cholesterol and on hdl dlv lwl's 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.680
 but again differentiated but what 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.479
 even more important is it if I have to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.590
 Take in lots of calories if I have to 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.149
 eat a lot of sugar 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.679
 I am not enough or not at all 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.210
 Movement only from TV seats 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.969
 the whole criteria of modern 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.649
 society is then law 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.869
 and saturated fats indeed 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.730
 bad but what beach figure am 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.459
 then it is not a problem for me 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.360
 There will be less sugar and less 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.879
 Companies in power 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.440
 But let's get to the next point 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.140
 animal fat and animal protein 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.340
 apology is harmful then take it 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.799
 i like a study where i am 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.530
 Simply give a mouse a poison with it 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.579
 she developed cancer and then in the second 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.700
 I give them an extract 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.440
 isolated protein such as casein and the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.220
 Cancer does not go away and then I say 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.989
 Now this protein is responsible 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.730
 for the cancer I have a clear 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.200
 message will not work anymore 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.060
 differentiated between the individual 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.290
 animal proteins so no 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.640
 Science I big with something 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.640
 love number five is very good 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.170
 Whole wholemeal no matter who you are 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.360
 whether you are a little bit 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.819
 allergic or upgrades bad 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.069
 British Reviers does not care and does not care 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.769
 how much alpha amylase strengthens 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.049
 splitting enzymes hate you in your mouth 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.540
 does not matter that this bandwidth of 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.569
 1 to 15 will fluctuate in humans 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.370
 disregarded and thus that some 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.989
 People are much better at strength 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.829
 react as other people 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.170
 and that's why it 's a lie, too 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.079
 the sixth love for today in this 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.720
 First video one of the worst 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:34.500
 I say low carb is the best diet of the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.389
 world same unit cup resp 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.269
 According to Sap, the best diet is only 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:42.239
 if she is vegan that has the next one 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.060
 a few leos the only true diet because 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.730
 or already analyzed on primitive peoples 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.200
 and proved no nonsense anabolic diet 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.230
 for muscle building is much better 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.549
 no nonsense dge diet full and such 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.470
 further is much better 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.569
 All this nonsense I would only 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.889
 That's why he confused testers 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.500
 get out on which things you better 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.100
 responds 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.770
 That's your perfect diet lactose 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.020
 fructose gluten starch cleaving enzymes 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.090
 these are just individual factors 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.970
 decide which diet on 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.590
 best for you is if you are more of 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.150
