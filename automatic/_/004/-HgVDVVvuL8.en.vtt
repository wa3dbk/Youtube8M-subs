00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.130 
this game is called sky gnomes
essentially<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.580> premises<00:00:03.060> that<00:00:03.120> you<00:00:03.510> are<00:00:03.780> a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.980 
collecting coins you can collect
power-ups

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
power-ups

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.980 
power-ups
get<00:00:44.620> huge<00:00:44.950> boost<00:00:45.250> like<00:00:45.880> these<00:00:46.090> checkpoints<00:00:46.480> up

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
get huge boost like these checkpoints up

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.140 
get huge boost like these checkpoints up
here

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
here

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.880 
here
and<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:48.780> another<00:00:48.930> cool<00:00:49.320> element<00:00:49.740> in<00:00:49.800> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and then another cool element in this

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.830 
and then another cool element in this
game<00:00:50.130> is<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> competitive<00:00:51.360> element<00:00:51.540> we're

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
game is the competitive element we're

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.920 
game is the competitive element we're
trying<00:00:52.080> to<00:00:52.170> add<00:00:52.700> so<00:00:53.700> essentially<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.630> you're

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
trying to add so essentially as you're

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
trying to add so essentially as you're
racing<00:00:55.500> down<00:00:56.480> your<00:00:57.480> run<00:00:57.720> is<00:00:57.930> recorded<00:00:58.650> so

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
racing down your run is recorded so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.910 
racing down your run is recorded so
depending<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.210> your<00:01:00.390> skill<00:01:00.690> level<00:01:00.920> seamlessly

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
depending on your skill level seamlessly

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.980 
depending on your skill level seamlessly
load<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.940> other<00:01:03.120> whoops<00:01:03.360> just<00:01:03.570> hit<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.810> nice

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
load in and other whoops just hit a nice

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.259 
load in and other whoops just hit a nice
char

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
char

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.749 
char
so<00:01:05.899> will<00:01:06.109> seamlessly<00:01:06.409> load<00:01:06.950> in<00:01:07.100> an<00:01:07.340> actual

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
so will seamlessly load in an actual

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.959 
so will seamlessly load in an actual
players<00:01:08.149> run<00:01:09.070> into<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.189> other<00:01:10.429> computer

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
players run into the other computer

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.490 
players run into the other computer
players<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:11.689> you'll<00:01:11.840> always<00:01:11.929> be<00:01:12.229> playing
