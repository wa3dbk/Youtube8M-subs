around the neck they're not as hard to
play<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.620> they<00:00:34.829> look<00:00:35.130> because<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.700> an<00:00:35.820> electric

guitar<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:37.260> strings<00:00:37.620> are<00:00:37.770> very<00:00:37.980> light<00:00:38.250> and

guitar the strings are very light and
they're<00:00:38.760> not<00:00:38.879> very<00:00:39.120> hard<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> push<00:00:39.750> down<00:00:40.250> but

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
they're not very hard to push down but

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.639 
they're not very hard to push down but
I'll<00:00:41.460> show<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> barre<00:00:42.270> chord<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
I'll show you what a barre chord is if I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.300 
I'll show you what a barre chord is if I
play<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.100> ecord

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.000 

and<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.910> want<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.240> take<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.630> same<00:00:50.010> position

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
and I want to take the same position

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.680 
and I want to take the same position
which<00:00:51.220> means<00:00:51.520> my<00:00:51.790> fingers<00:00:52.150> are<00:00:52.300> going<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.480> look

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
which means my fingers are going to look

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.530 
which means my fingers are going to look
like<00:00:52.750> an<00:00:53.200> E<00:00:53.380> chord<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.430> I<00:00:54.490> want<00:00:54.790> to<00:00:54.970> move<00:00:55.180> it<00:00:55.390> up

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
like an E chord but I want to move it up

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.460 
like an E chord but I want to move it up
the<00:00:55.780> neck<00:00:55.990> until<00:00:56.230> it's<00:00:56.920> an<00:00:57.160> a<00:00:57.370> chord<00:00:57.730> okay<00:00:58.600> what

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
the neck until it's an a chord okay what

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.160 
the neck until it's an a chord okay what
I'm<00:00:59.620> going<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.830> do<00:01:00.070> first<00:01:00.900> actually<00:01:01.900> I'm<00:01:01.990> just

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
I'm going to do first actually I'm just

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.840 
I'm going to do first actually I'm just
going<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.380> move<00:01:02.470> it<00:01:02.620> up<00:01:02.680> one<00:01:02.980> fret<00:01:03.250> so<00:01:03.580> you<00:01:03.640> get

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
going to move it up one fret so you get

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.490 
going to move it up one fret so you get
the<00:01:03.970> idea<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.330> how<00:01:04.480> this<00:01:04.690> works<00:01:04.990> so<00:01:05.230> it'll<00:01:05.470> be

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
the idea of how this works so it'll be

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.250 
the idea of how this works so it'll be
an<00:01:05.680> F<00:01:06.010> chord<00:01:06.040> I'm<00:01:06.970> going<00:01:07.210> to<00:01:07.270> put<00:01:07.990> my<00:01:08.020> finger

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.040 
an F chord I'm going to put my finger
right<00:01:08.890> here<00:01:09.070> my<00:01:09.700> first<00:01:10.000> finger<00:01:10.300> across<00:01:10.690> all

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
the strings and just very lightly I'm

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.930 
the strings and just very lightly I'm
not<00:01:14.170> trying<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.590> push<00:01:14.770> my<00:01:14.980> finger<00:01:15.280> down<00:01:15.310> now<00:01:15.700> at

all but then I need my other three
fingers<00:01:19.480> to<00:01:19.690> form<00:01:19.990> what<00:01:20.380> looks<00:01:20.710> like<00:01:20.830> an<00:01:21.160> E

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.000 
fingers to form what looks like an E
chord<00:01:21.430> if<00:01:22.000> I<00:01:22.750> was<00:01:22.930> going<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.110> play<00:01:23.290> my<00:01:23.530> ecord

up<00:01:31.720> one<00:01:31.960> fret<00:01:32.230> and<00:01:32.530> put<00:01:32.770> my<00:01:32.920> first<00:01:33.160> finger<00:01:33.460> down

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
up one fret and put my first finger down

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.050 
up one fret and put my first finger down
now<00:01:34.210> I'd<00:01:34.510> push<00:01:34.840> down<00:01:35.140> on<00:01:35.170> all<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.740> strings

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.569 

and<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.960> an<00:01:40.110> F<00:01:40.320> chord<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.159> let<00:01:41.310> me<00:01:41.399> get<00:01:41.549> this

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and it's an F chord so let me get this

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.219 
and it's an F chord so let me get this
straight<00:01:41.729> Marcie<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.479> almost<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.049> you're

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
straight Marcie it's almost like you're

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.190 
straight Marcie it's almost like you're
taking<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.950> nut<00:01:44.280> uh-huh<00:01:45.149> where<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> strings

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
taking the nut uh-huh where the strings

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.120 
taking the nut uh-huh where the strings
end<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.210> moving<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:48.899> fret<00:01:49.170> exact

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
end and moving it up one fret exact

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.840 
end and moving it up one fret exact
using<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.670> index<00:01:50.880> finger<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.649> nut

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
using your index finger as the nut

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.820 
using your index finger as the nut
exactly<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.600> play<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.960> chords

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
exactly then you can play the chords

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.560 
exactly then you can play the chords
that<00:01:56.009> you'd<00:01:56.220> be<00:01:56.429> playing<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:57.060> by<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.299> nut

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
that you'd be playing down by the nut

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.600 
that you'd be playing down by the nut
only<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.500> come<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.070> different<00:01:59.429> key

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
only they come out in a different key

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.330 
only they come out in a different key
it's<00:02:00.149> great<00:02:00.509> isn't<00:02:00.720> it<00:02:00.929> what<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> great<00:02:01.740> concept

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
it's great isn't it what a great concept

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.429 
it's great isn't it what a great concept
now<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> lot<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.030> people<00:02:03.270> think<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.750> nut<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
now a lot of people think the nut is the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.800 
now a lot of people think the nut is the
