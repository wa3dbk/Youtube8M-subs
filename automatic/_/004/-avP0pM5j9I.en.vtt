can<00:01:31.350> rush<00:01:31.710> straight<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.150> is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
can rush straight to a so what you do is

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
can rush straight to a so what you do is
you<00:01:33.600> cut<00:01:33.840> straight<00:01:34.200> through<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.650> underground

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you cut straight through the underground

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.450 
you cut straight through the underground
area<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.880> come<00:01:36.390> right<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.869> under<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.890> then

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
area and come right up under a and then

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.160 
area and come right up under a and then
you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.790> toss<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.090> cone<00:01:39.329> grenade<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> back

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you can toss a cone grenade on the back

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.710 
you can toss a cone grenade on the back
wall<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> it'll<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.430> similar<00:01:41.970> effects<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.509> as

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
wall and it'll do similar effects to as

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.050 
wall and it'll do similar effects to as
if<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> were<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.259> see<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.430> run<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:44.909> with

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
if it were on see if you run there with

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.340 
if it were on see if you run there with
another<00:01:45.240> person<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.930> your<00:01:46.020> team<00:01:46.079> you're<00:01:46.320> going

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
to clear out that area nine times out of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.810 
to clear out that area nine times out of
ten<00:01:48.659> works<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.350> well<00:01:49.470> by<00:01:50.100> yourself<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.729> can

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
ten works really well by yourself it can

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.399 
ten works really well by yourself it can
be<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> little<00:01:51.119> bit<00:01:51.299> iffy<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.689> difficult<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.259> do

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
be a little bit iffy and difficult to do

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.010 
be a little bit iffy and difficult to do
but<00:01:53.040> if<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.369> are<00:01:53.880> feeling<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.689> there's<00:01:54.899> too

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
but if you are feeling like there's too

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.300 
but if you are feeling like there's too
many<00:01:55.140> people<00:01:55.470> there<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.950> throw<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
many people there you can throw a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.800 
many people there you can throw a
grenade<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.790> there<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.210> cut<00:01:57.420> around<00:01:57.540> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
grenade in there and then cut around to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.090 
grenade in there and then cut around to
the<00:01:57.930> right<00:01:58.079> side<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.500> kind<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.740> shoot<00:01:58.979> in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the right side and kind of shoot in

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980 
the right side and kind of shoot in
through<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.460> door<00:01:59.700> I'd<00:02:00.090> say<00:02:00.329> about<00:02:00.360> half<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
through that door I'd say about half the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.719 
through that door I'd say about half the
time<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.439> works<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:02.040> well<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.579> your

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
time this works really well and your

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.490 
time this works really well and your
hero<00:02:03.030> for<00:02:03.299> all<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.509> your<00:02:03.600> team<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> other

hero for all of your team and the other

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.230 
hero for all of your team and the other
half<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> time<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.430> either<00:02:05.579> stall<00:02:06.000> them

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
half of the time you either stall them

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.150 
half of the time you either stall them
or<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.600> flat-out<00:02:06.899> die<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.680> team

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
or you just flat-out die and your team

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.279 
or you just flat-out die and your team
spits<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.640> your<00:02:08.729> corpse<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.200> either

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
spits on your corpse so you can either

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.380 
spits on your corpse so you can either
pick<00:02:10.619> off<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.979> rushers<00:02:11.280> or<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.790> can<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
pick off the rushers or you can be the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.809 
pick off the rushers or you can be the
rusher

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
rusher

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.910 
rusher
learning<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.299> spawns<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.109> absolute<00:02:14.620> best

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
learning the spawns is the absolute best

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.069 
learning the spawns is the absolute best
thing<00:02:15.099> you<00:02:15.249> can<00:02:15.400> do<00:02:15.579> to<00:02:15.760> get<00:02:16.150> better<00:02:16.299> at<00:02:16.569> PvP

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
thing you can do to get better at PvP

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.080 
thing you can do to get better at PvP
knowing<00:02:17.950> where<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.189> enemies<00:02:18.430> are<00:02:18.459> even<00:02:18.969> when

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
knowing where the enemies are even when

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.640 
knowing where the enemies are even when
they're<00:02:19.209> not<00:02:19.239> on<00:02:19.420> your<00:02:19.749> radar<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.230> what's

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
they're not on your radar is what's

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.289 
they're not on your radar is what's
going<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.829> really<00:02:21.040> improve<00:02:21.459> your<00:02:21.670> game<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.150> for

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
going to really improve your game so for

going to really improve your game so for
the<00:02:22.389> a-side<00:02:22.719> spawns<00:02:23.109> we've<00:02:23.349> got<00:02:23.469> two<00:02:23.650> in

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
the a-side spawns we've got two in

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.110 
the a-side spawns we've got two in
particular<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.400> are<00:02:24.519> very<00:02:24.700> heavily

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
particular that are very heavily

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.789 
particular that are very heavily
weighted<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.900> those<00:02:26.019> are<00:02:26.139> going<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.290> be<00:02:26.349> here

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
weighted and those are going to be here

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.190 
weighted and those are going to be here
and<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:28.150> now<00:02:28.540> these<00:02:28.689> are<00:02:28.870> going<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.019> be<00:02:29.079> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
and here now these are going to be the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.509 
and here now these are going to be the
hardest<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.680> flip<00:02:29.920> where<00:02:30.129> people<00:02:30.370> are<00:02:30.430> going

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
hardest to flip where people are going

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.979 
hardest to flip where people are going
to<00:02:30.609> be<00:02:30.670> spawning<00:02:30.909> most<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.389> the<00:02:31.450> time<00:02:31.689> on<00:02:31.959> a

to be spawning most of the time on a

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.110 
to be spawning most of the time on a
side<00:02:32.439> then<00:02:33.099> we've<00:02:33.219> got<00:02:33.370> three<00:02:33.609> spawns<00:02:33.909> that

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
side then we've got three spawns that

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.849 
side then we've got three spawns that
are<00:02:34.239> more<00:02:34.359> situational<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.260> less<00:02:35.469> consistent

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
are more situational and less consistent

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.619 
are more situational and less consistent
for<00:02:36.280> when<00:02:36.430> your<00:02:36.579> team<00:02:36.819> is<00:02:36.849> pressuring<00:02:37.480> the

enemy team and pushing them back in to
see<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.419> spawns<00:02:40.750> haven't<00:02:41.169> flipped<00:02:41.409> yet

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
see but the spawns haven't flipped yet

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.709 
see but the spawns haven't flipped yet
or<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.519> spawns<00:02:42.790> are<00:02:42.939> in<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> process<00:02:43.329> of

or the spawns are in the process of

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.619 
or the spawns are in the process of
flipping<00:02:43.989> now<00:02:44.560> those<00:02:44.769> are<00:02:44.799> going<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.069> be<00:02:45.159> here

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
flipping now those are going to be here

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.530 
flipping now those are going to be here
here<00:02:46.629> and<00:02:46.840> here<00:02:47.969> so<00:02:48.969> this<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.269> where<00:02:49.450> the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
here and here so this is where the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.849 
here and here so this is where the
enemies<00:02:49.840> will<00:02:49.989> be<00:02:50.019> spawning<00:02:50.409> while<00:02:50.739> you're

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
enemies will be spawning while you're

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.459 
enemies will be spawning while you're

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:53.469 
controlling C or C and B so take note of

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.259 
controlling C or C and B so take note of
particularly<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.219> heavily-weighted<00:02:54.699> spawns

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.250 
particularly the heavily-weighted spawns
because<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.689> other<00:02:55.810> ones<00:02:55.989> are<00:02:56.109> more

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
because the other ones are more

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.539 
because the other ones are more
transitional<00:02:56.919> and<00:02:57.040> you're<00:02:57.129> not<00:02:57.189> really<00:02:57.370> going

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
transitional and you're not really going

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.979 
transitional and you're not really going
to<00:02:57.609> be<00:02:57.760> right<00:02:58.030> up<00:02:58.060> on<00:02:58.299> those<00:02:58.510> people<00:02:58.900> as

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
to be right up on those people as

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.509 
to be right up on those people as
they're<00:02:59.109> spawning<00:02:59.379> but<00:03:00.010> with<00:03:00.129> a<00:03:00.159> heavily

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
they're spawning but with a heavily

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.009 
they're spawning but with a heavily
weighted<00:03:00.699> spawns<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.659> can<00:03:01.810> pretty

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
weighted spawns you can pretty

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.809 
weighted spawns you can pretty
consistently<00:03:02.680> hold<00:03:03.010> down<00:03:03.189> the<00:03:03.370> water<00:03:03.579> tower

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
consistently hold down the water tower

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.459 
consistently hold down the water tower
area<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.389> people<00:03:04.480> just<00:03:04.810> keep<00:03:04.989> coming<00:03:05.049> around

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
area and people just keep coming around

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:06.720 
area and people just keep coming around
that<00:03:05.680> corner<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.159> you<00:03:06.189> can<00:03:06.340> pick<00:03:06.459> them<00:03:06.609> off

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
that corner and you can pick them off

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.360 
that corner and you can pick them off
with<00:03:06.969> a<00:03:07.180> scout<00:03:07.810> rifle<00:03:08.019> or<00:03:08.469> sniper<00:03:08.859> or<00:03:09.099> whatever

you're using and you know but feel free
to<00:03:11.260> correct<00:03:11.379> me<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.829> calling<00:03:12.159> that<00:03:12.280> thing<00:03:12.459> a

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
to correct me and calling that thing a

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.909 
to correct me and calling that thing a
water<00:03:12.790> tower<00:03:13.060> water<00:03:13.599> container<00:03:14.049> whatever<00:03:14.799> the

water tower water container whatever the

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.319 
water tower water container whatever the
heck<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.280> that's<00:03:15.699> what<00:03:15.849> I'm<00:03:15.939> calling<00:03:16.090> it

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
heck it is that's what I'm calling it

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.640 
heck it is that's what I'm calling it
that's<00:03:16.510> what<00:03:16.629> it<00:03:16.659> looks<00:03:16.870> like<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.199> think<00:03:17.439> so

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
that's what it looks like I think so

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.929 
that's what it looks like I think so
just<00:03:17.919> yeah<00:03:18.069> it's<00:03:18.370> just<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.609> get<00:03:18.729> the<00:03:18.790> point

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
just yeah it's just to get the point

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.759 
just yeah it's just to get the point
across<00:03:19.060> hope<00:03:19.449> you<00:03:19.540> guys<00:03:19.659> understand<00:03:20.139> you<00:03:20.650> know

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
across hope you guys understand you know

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.589 
across hope you guys understand you know
what<00:03:20.889> I<00:03:20.919> mean<00:03:21.180> don't<00:03:22.180> look<00:03:22.239> at<00:03:22.359> me<00:03:22.449> like<00:03:22.479> that

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
what I mean don't look at me like that

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.780 
what I mean don't look at me like that
and<00:03:22.959> while<00:03:23.919> we're<00:03:24.009> on<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.250> topic<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.669> that

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
and while we're on the topic of that

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.280 
and while we're on the topic of that
water<00:03:25.030> container<00:03:25.449> area<00:03:25.810> let's<00:03:26.019> talk<00:03:26.139> about

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
water container area let's talk about

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.530 
water container area let's talk about
one<00:03:26.530> more<00:03:26.709> spawn<00:03:27.009> point<00:03:27.250> located<00:03:27.639> here<00:03:28.239> and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
one more spawn point located here and

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.199 
one more spawn point located here and
this<00:03:29.199> one's<00:03:29.439> between<00:03:29.919> a<00:03:29.949> and<00:03:30.220> C<00:03:30.400> I'd<00:03:30.699> say<00:03:30.970> and

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
this one's between a and C I'd say and

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.789 
this one's between a and C I'd say and
it's<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.479> most<00:03:31.659> transitional<00:03:32.290> spawn<00:03:32.530> point

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
it's the most transitional spawn point

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.429 
it's the most transitional spawn point
for<00:03:33.250> if<00:03:33.459> teams<00:03:33.790> are<00:03:34.000> pressuring<00:03:34.389> be<00:03:34.720> so<00:03:35.169> if<00:03:35.290> one

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
for if teams are pressuring be so if one

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.080 
for if teams are pressuring be so if one
team<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.769> pressuring<00:03:36.069> be<00:03:36.250> really<00:03:36.699> hard<00:03:36.909> and

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
team is pressuring be really hard and

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.429 
team is pressuring be really hard and
they're<00:03:37.209> not<00:03:37.419> as<00:03:37.569> much<00:03:37.720> at<00:03:37.870> their<00:03:37.989> home<00:03:38.139> flag

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
they're not as much at their home flag

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.949 
they're not as much at their home flag
it's<00:03:38.859> going<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.099> flip<00:03:39.459> people<00:03:39.669> here<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.389> so

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
it's going to flip people here and so

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.629 
it's going to flip people here and so
they<00:03:41.109> can<00:03:41.259> go<00:03:41.439> and<00:03:41.769> take<00:03:41.979> the<00:03:42.129> enemy's<00:03:42.459> home

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
they can go and take the enemy's home

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.460 
they can go and take the enemy's home
flag<00:03:42.879> and<00:03:43.120> while<00:03:43.750> we're<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.049> topic<00:03:44.079> of

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
flag and while we're on the topic of

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.379 
flag and while we're on the topic of
transitioning<00:03:45.250> let's<00:03:45.790> talk<00:03:45.970> about<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
transitioning let's talk about the

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.809 
transitioning let's talk about the
seaside<00:03:46.810> spawns<00:03:47.199> so<00:03:47.949> again<00:03:48.280> we<00:03:48.459> have<00:03:48.609> two

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
seaside spawns so again we have two

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.399 
seaside spawns so again we have two
heavily<00:03:49.209> weighted<00:03:49.479> spawns<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:50.049> start<00:03:50.259> off

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
heavily weighted spawns to start off

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.009 
heavily weighted spawns to start off
with<00:03:50.620> which<00:03:50.979> are<00:03:51.069> going<00:03:51.159> to<00:03:51.250> be<00:03:51.340> here<00:03:51.639> and<00:03:52.019> here

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
with which are going to be here and here

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.020 
with which are going to be here and here
and<00:03:53.159> these<00:03:54.159> pawns<00:03:54.370> are<00:03:54.519> going<00:03:54.639> to<00:03:54.699> be<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.879> most

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
and these pawns are going to be the most

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.610 
and these pawns are going to be the most
consistent<00:03:55.389> the<00:03:55.750> hardest<00:03:56.079> to<00:03:56.199> flip<00:03:56.439> people

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
consistent the hardest to flip people

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.140 
consistent the hardest to flip people
are<00:03:56.799> going<00:03:56.889> to<00:03:56.979> be<00:03:57.069> spawn<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.489> there<00:03:57.639> usually

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
are going to be spawn in there usually

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.509 
are going to be spawn in there usually
even<00:03:58.780> if<00:03:58.930> you're<00:03:59.079> going<00:03:59.229> for<00:03:59.439> see<00:03:59.650> i<00:03:59.859> would<00:04:00.400> say

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
even if you're going for see i would say

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.339 
even if you're going for see i would say
that<00:04:00.549> second<00:04:01.030> spawn<00:04:01.239> is<00:04:01.419> even<00:04:01.719> more<00:04:01.989> heavily

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
that second spawn is even more heavily

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.469 
that second spawn is even more heavily
weighted<00:04:02.439> they<00:04:03.069> will<00:04:03.459> spawn<00:04:03.849> people<00:04:04.269> there

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:04.479 
weighted they will spawn people there

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.439 
weighted they will spawn people there
all<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:05.439> time<00:04:05.489> even<00:04:06.489> if<00:04:06.639> your<00:04:06.849> cap<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.150> see

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
all the time even if your cap and see

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:08.939 
all the time even if your cap and see
flag<00:04:07.659> people<00:04:08.049> are<00:04:08.139> going<00:04:08.229> to<00:04:08.319> be<00:04:08.500> there<00:04:08.709> so

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
flag people are going to be there so

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.649 
flag people are going to be there so
don't<00:04:09.489> take<00:04:09.729> your<00:04:09.849> eyes<00:04:10.030> off<00:04:10.060> that<00:04:10.299> side

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
don't take your eyes off that side

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.029 
don't take your eyes off that side
people<00:04:10.989> are<00:04:11.079> gonna<00:04:11.199> keep<00:04:11.500> coming<00:04:11.859> from<00:04:11.949> that

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:12.039 
people are gonna keep coming from that

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.830 
people are gonna keep coming from that
way<00:04:12.159> unless<00:04:12.879> they<00:04:13.180> decide<00:04:13.299> to<00:04:13.479> run<00:04:13.659> through

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
way unless they decide to run through

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.479 
way unless they decide to run through
the<00:04:13.959> tunnel<00:04:14.229> and<00:04:14.259> come<00:04:14.469> from<00:04:14.680> be<00:04:14.829> direction<00:04:15.310> so

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
the tunnel and come from be direction so

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.189 
the tunnel and come from be direction so
you<00:04:15.549> know<00:04:15.819> that<00:04:15.969> can<00:04:16.150> happen<00:04:16.419> but<00:04:16.959> I'm<00:04:17.079> just

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
you know that can happen but I'm just

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.300 
you know that can happen but I'm just
here<00:04:17.349> to<00:04:17.409> tell<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:17.650> about<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.889> spawns<00:04:18.130> not

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
here to tell you about the spawns not

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.740 
here to tell you about the spawns not
perfectly<00:04:18.789> predict<00:04:19.180> every<00:04:19.449> enemy's

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
perfectly predict every enemy's

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.409 
perfectly predict every enemy's
movements<00:04:20.229> then<00:04:20.680> again<00:04:21.130> we<00:04:21.579> have<00:04:21.789> three<00:04:22.210> more

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
movements then again we have three more

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.330 
movements then again we have three more
less<00:04:23.080> heavily<00:04:23.320> weighted<00:04:23.680> spawns<00:04:24.039> but<00:04:24.250> they're

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
less heavily weighted spawns but they're

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.920 
less heavily weighted spawns but they're
actually<00:04:24.460> still<00:04:24.849> pretty<00:04:25.180> heavily<00:04:25.479> weighted

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
actually still pretty heavily weighted

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.640 
actually still pretty heavily weighted
but

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
but

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.100 
but

this<00:04:29.320> little<00:04:29.680> back<00:04:29.919> corner<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:30.790> they<00:04:31.000> can<00:04:31.449> take

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
this little back corner so they can take

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.420 
this little back corner so they can take
the<00:04:31.930> liberty<00:04:32.259> of<00:04:32.290> spawning<00:04:32.680> people<00:04:33.070> they're<00:04:33.250> a

the liberty of spawning people they're a

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.490 
the liberty of spawning people they're a

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
pretty large amount of time and those

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.270 
pretty large amount of time and those

hold<00:05:09.820> down<00:05:10.030> I'd<00:05:10.419> say<00:05:10.870> C<00:05:10.930> and<00:05:11.380> B<00:05:11.440> because<00:05:12.370> those

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
two heavily weighted a spawns make it so

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.040 
two heavily weighted a spawns make it so
the<00:05:14.919> people<00:05:15.160> I<00:05:15.220> either<00:05:15.639> have<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:16.030> come<00:05:16.270> up<00:05:16.449> the

stairs to come out of a which you can

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
see from the middle half of the map or

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.580 
see from the middle half of the map or
they<00:05:21.370> have<00:05:21.580> to<00:05:21.760> go<00:05:21.910> at<00:05:22.150> come<00:05:22.900> out<00:05:23.110> at<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.349> water

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
they have to go at come out at the water

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.439 
they have to go at come out at the water
container<00:05:24.070> which<00:05:24.669> you<00:05:24.789> can<00:05:24.940> also<00:05:25.090> see<00:05:25.419> that

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
container which you can also see that

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.180 
container which you can also see that
area<00:05:26.080> if<00:05:26.289> you're<00:05:26.440> standing<00:05:26.680> up<00:05:26.919> on<00:05:27.039> that

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
area if you're standing up on that

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.370 
area if you're standing up on that
little<00:05:27.340> metal<00:05:27.610> walkway<00:05:28.150> near<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.840> side<00:05:29.050> of<00:05:29.080> C

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
little metal walkway near the side of C

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.890 
little metal walkway near the side of C
so<00:05:30.070> since<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.430> side<00:05:30.669> is<00:05:30.849> just<00:05:31.060> so<00:05:31.389> open<00:05:31.599> you<00:05:31.870> got

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
so since a side is just so open you got

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.420 
so since a side is just so open you got
plenty<00:05:32.229> of<00:05:32.320> lines<00:05:32.560> of<00:05:32.740> sight<00:05:32.860> to<00:05:33.039> see<00:05:33.220> into

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
plenty of lines of sight to see into

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.740 
plenty of lines of sight to see into
their<00:05:33.669> from<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:33.970> middle<00:05:34.180> half<00:05:34.360> of<00:05:34.479> the<00:05:34.539> map

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
their from the middle half of the map

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.110 
their from the middle half of the map
and<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.710> just<00:05:35.889> makes<00:05:36.010> it<00:05:36.160> easy<00:05:36.310> to<00:05:36.430> control<00:05:36.729> so

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
and it just makes it easy to control so

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.520 
and it just makes it easy to control so
if<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.330> learn<00:05:37.510> these<00:05:37.690> spawns<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.260> really

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
if you learn these spawns and really

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.200 
if you learn these spawns and really
master<00:05:38.949> them<00:05:39.099> you<00:05:39.460> should<00:05:39.669> be<00:05:39.789> able<00:05:39.880> to<00:05:40.090> know

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
master them you should be able to know

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.700 
master them you should be able to know
where<00:05:40.419> people<00:05:40.690> are<00:05:40.780> coming<00:05:40.810> from<00:05:41.110> at<00:05:41.440> most

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
where people are coming from at most

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.980 
where people are coming from at most
times<00:05:41.979> and<00:05:42.340> you<00:05:42.789> should<00:05:43.000> get<00:05:43.150> pretty<00:05:43.510> good<00:05:43.570> at
