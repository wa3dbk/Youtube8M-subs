find you have little pockets of air and

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.890 
find you have little pockets of air and
they'll<00:05:03.650> translate<00:05:04.040> into<00:05:04.370> holes<00:05:04.690> so<00:05:05.690> this

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
they'll translate into holes so this

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.580

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
indentations all I would do is just

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.800 
indentations all I would do is just
gently<00:05:51.950> were<00:05:52.310> up<00:05:52.430> in<00:05:52.610> a<00:05:52.700> circular<00:05:52.970> motion<00:05:53.389> and

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
gently were up in a circular motion and

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.450 
gently were up in a circular motion and
you'll<00:05:54.380> find<00:05:54.650> they'll<00:05:54.830> disappear

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460
