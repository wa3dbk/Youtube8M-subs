00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.820
 they tell us how the banquet was filled with us and 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.190
 then it actually seemed like it wasn't 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.680
 questionnaire contract they already filled out with us 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.210
 contract for the purchase and installation of filters 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 for the water which she was not going to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.380
 buy on consultant showed people 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.510
 seemingly shocking experiment 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.740
 she put down another water device and 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.099
 plug it in 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.250
 while in her water turned out weak 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.170
 we have yellow colors with black 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.030
 flakes so brown 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.500
 the girl was very persistent they 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.629
 she said the very last thing herself 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.579
 the installation itself was worth somewhere 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.469
 about six million and filters 3 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.539
 millions of muddy water seemed people 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.980
 or by profession chemist technologist after 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.379
 publishing stories on one of the news 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.420
 portals it turned out such cases completely and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.789
 next joke is there hundreds of comments from 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.230
 in words and came to us I was led on 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.809
 this divorce is now half a year now 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.969
 this filter costs 600 minus 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.030
 expensive analogues have 200 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.740
 They came to us this winter I'm not a chemist but 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.990
 immediately realized that it was some kind of simple 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.640
 focus is focus but older people 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.770
 can believe and give money 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.689
 dear water filter you are divorced in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.700
 Minsk lasts for a long time very sorry that 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.830
 This topic is really very late raised 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.049
 sorry for the people who believed the scammers 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.970
 Dmitriy sells water purifiers 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.860
 systems that is called without tricks to give 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.420
 interview on camera he refused but 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.030
 told that aggressive advertising in 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.750
 three firms are involved in the city and 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.430
 demonstrated that very experiment 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.860
 with a device called 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.290
 electrolyzer tap water has 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.759
 sufficiently high salt content and 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.259
 accordingly conducts electric 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.780
 current is very good, respectively, water 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.399
 from under reverse osmosis owns under 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.710
 reverse osmosis salt content 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.950
 reduced by 10-15 times, respectively 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.990
 conducts a very weak electrical current 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.979
 it is natural that we are seeing 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.060
 water from the tap goes clearly and falling out 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:05.450
 precipitation that is the usual usual process 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.799
 corrosion of aluminum pseudo electrode 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.200
 consultants call and all this 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.120
 pesticides with petroleum nitrates and 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.519
 to sell reverse osmosis 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.849
 filters are 3-4 times more expensive than their current 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.220
 prices 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.200
 need good reasons let's do the same experience 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.319
 with bottled water it would seem 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.060
 too cleaner to darken, too, some water from under 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.930
 filter actually distillate put 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.540
 pinch of salt 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.769
 it's not better than tap water 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.750
 Andreev is not a chemist from the Academy of Sciences 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.000
 explains this kind of tests show 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.400
 only one conducts or yes so water is 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.769
 very difficult system to evaluate it 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.709
 quality you need to perform a whole cycle 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.840
 often required tests 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.120
 and not a day or two so are there any to you 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.860
 came home literally within 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.230
 a few minutes said that you have 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.190
 dirty cold snaps corresponds to how 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.870
 then the parameters then most likely we will say this 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.519
 so not entirely in good faith and came to 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.319
 I may be some people and not 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.120
 prevent you from putting a water filter 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.070
 but being deceived to buy in 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.500
 literally at an exorbitant price hardly anyone 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.140
 will want so don't fall for clean 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.549
 water divorce maria with u alexander haiduk
