00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.119
 welcome back new episode of hi 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.890
 doctor the weekly program that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.660
 we realize in collaboration with the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.730
 esculapio di lucca medical center 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.760
 dedicated to our health today 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.650
 we want to talk about children and 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.650
 endocrinology come with me 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.070
 We said pediatric endocrinology 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.320
 we are in the company of doctor mara 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.300
 ferrari a specialist in the field who 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.190
 works here at the esculapio medical center of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.170
 lucca not only thanks first of all 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.550
 doctor for this interview I would like 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.760
 leave because maybe those who are there 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.090
 looking does not know well than that of 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.579
 which is what is a matter 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.060
 pediatric endocrinologist takes care of the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.150
 endocrinological sphere of the child who 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.890
 regards various pathologies and the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.880
 most frequent pathology is obesity 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.530
 infant 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.430
 currently but all other area that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 we can investigate is concerning the hormone 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.400
 of growth then low stature 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.470
 pathological disorders of the thyroid disorders 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.640
 of adrenals and even diabetes 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.070
 infant 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.820
 so all that concerns the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.530
 Endocrine gland pathology is 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.060
 very important that from the most tender 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.420
 age these districts are observed 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.049
 because then they are related to well-being 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.330
 life of the child in and of itself therefore is 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.600
 important that where there is a 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.820
 alarm bell for parents 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.380
 concerning or low height that you do not 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.680
 like to the pediatrician for whom already the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.479
 Pediatrician will direct us on what it is 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:09.500
 the situation or on what it can 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.840
 be an overweight situation to 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.250
 point to become obesity and to 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.400
 Obesity is not a bad word in 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.930
 parents usually struggle to 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.170
 define the child obese because it seems 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.069
 almost offensive actually obesity is already 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.730
 an overweight exceeding 10 kg e 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.760
 often children of even small ages 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.890
 have this condition is a condition 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.220
 risky because it is risky in this regard 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.400
 to the issue in cardiovascular ie 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.790
 children who at an early age have the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.250
 possibility of developing what is 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.829
 the metabolic syndrome 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.079
 it is now precociously and later in age 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.959
 adolescent can be a sign of himself or 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:59.420
 even even before with severe 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.760
 imminent health risk but 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.910
 especially then in adulthood 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.760
 so now how to say there is a lot 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.480
 attention towards this pathology that is 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.859
 unfortunately rising in the apparently countries 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.739
 westernized by the way 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.470
 of childhood obesity since it is the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.329
 most common pathology as a 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.000
 parent here to understand that there is some 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.190
 problem maybe related to the 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.780
 glands maybe it's not because he eats 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.090
 bad 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.030
 exactly then for example if 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.069
 along with an overweight even 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.720
 even a marked overweight is there 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.849
 low stature 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.940
 such that in one year this child 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.709
 tends not to grow or grow under the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.330
 two letters standard deviations for that 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.040
 which concerns its own percentile of 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:53.879
 growth 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:57.959
 if instead an overweight can be observed 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:00.690
 compared to the average of children on 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.459
 parent is duty bound to take it from 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.959
 own family pediatrician who 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.489
 surely he will address it 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.950
 by the pediatric endocrinologist and not by ad 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.200
 example other figures such as the dietician e 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.510
 nutritionist this is important because 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.900
 the child has the right to have one 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.060
 battery of tests concerning the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.889
 thyroid disorder than most 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.039
 part is not present but must be 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.889
 assessed cholesterol levels of 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:32.880
 triglyceride blood sugar levels 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.190
 insulin and not last an assessment 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.889
 cardiological that allows us to 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.280
 already exclude a hypertensive state 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.770
 so I also remember pediatricians 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.310
 that they do it quietly but it is 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.349
 let's underline the evaluation 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.889
 of pressure to children always goes 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:55.590
 made to the controls therefore pediatrician the 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.240
 reference point that prescribes the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.110
 exams and then the specialist's address 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.520
 however there is a community age for which a 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.260
 starting from which parents must 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.500
 worry 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.360
 then regarding the pathology 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.910
 obesity in and of itself does not exist 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.020
 unit 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.110
 limit in the sense that if the child 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.450
 begins to grow too much by weight 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.310
 from the first months of life it must be contained 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.620
 in the diet I do not speak in the period 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.960
 milk supply ranging from 0 to 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.570
 6 months but from weaning onwards 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.250
 this is certainly never good for the 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.960
 child is overweight and above all 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.370
 in the first year of life because there 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.030
 they form adipocytes, that is, cells 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.030
 which are then to be filled as far as 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.040
 it concerns the fat and therefore more if any 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.510
 they form more then if you tend to fill them 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.050
 so for life this is 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.030
 very important but pediatricians know it 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.470
 if the parent has any doubts it comes 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.510
 quietly also directly 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.250
 because in any case I am also a pediatrician 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.530
 also a hospital pediatrician for whom 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.200
 I am a pediatric endocrinologist but I am 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.750
 also a pediatrician and as for 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.440
 the question of growth or the question 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.590
 let's say bone in if for if it is necessary 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.600
 always remember that the tables exist 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.640
 the percentiles that are these 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.570
 child is measured are measured 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:19.410
 parents and does not even exist there 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.840
 an age limit must always be evaluated 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.960
 growth curve of the child from the first 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.510
 months of life until then of course 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.510
 does not reach the age of maturation 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.130
 here to not frighten the parents who 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.590
 they are looking at us as they care with 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.160
 these pathologies is simple in mind 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.330
 then if they are thyroid diseases 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.100
 there are transient thyroiditis 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.530
 of the teenager that sometimes and often 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.950
 sometimes they regress on their own sometimes 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:50.340
 need medical support e 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.860
 therefore therapeutic with regard to i 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.920
 deficiency or hormone deficiencies 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.220
 growth tests are done 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.140
 that guarantee us the 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.560
 lack of this hormone that comes 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:06.770
 administered more synthetic same thing 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:10.070
 if it concerns the question of what to say 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.480
 lack of oxidation or alteration 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.610
 of skiing, perhaps due to lack of it 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.470
 of vitamin D there is the possibility of 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.870
 give a simple vitamin it should 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.340
 be implemented until adolescence 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.950
 and beyond 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.190
 and if they concern other aspects instead 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.960
 as adrenal glands or even the 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.300
 childhood diabetes 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.220
 there is also the possibility of intervening 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.070
 with therapies 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.900
 so any pathology is 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.450
 quietly treatable 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:42.410
 just have the right therapy and 

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:44.510
 know the type of disease 

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.790
 that we are going to face then do 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.310
 diagnosis we have exhausted ours 

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:52.190
 time I thank Dr. Mara 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.930
 ferrari endocrinologist pediatrician 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.360
 thank you for explaining so many things 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.220
 useful that surely have affected 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.650
 to our viewers except doctor 

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.950
 come back in seven days good 

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.950
 continuation
