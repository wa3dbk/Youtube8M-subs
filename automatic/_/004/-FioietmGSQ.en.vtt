00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
wouldn't expect it much but if you look

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.870 
wouldn't expect it much but if you look
at<00:01:51.110> his<00:01:51.229> physical<00:01:51.649> traits<00:01:52.160> they're<00:01:52.520> in<00:01:52.759> the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
at his physical traits they're in the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.300 
at his physical traits they're in the
upper<00:01:53.179> 70s<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:53.810> then<00:01:54.349> technical<00:01:54.890> traits<00:01:55.160> a

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
upper 70s and then technical traits a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.339 
upper 70s and then technical traits a
lot<00:01:55.490> of<00:01:55.610> them<00:01:55.700> are<00:01:55.910> in<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.149> upper<00:01:56.420> 70s<00:01:56.599> so<00:01:57.020> I

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
lot of them are in the upper 70s so I

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.620 
lot of them are in the upper 70s so I
feel<00:01:57.619> like<00:01:57.649> he<00:01:58.039> exceeds<00:01:58.490> his<00:01:58.640> 70<00:01:59.060> rating<00:01:59.450> and

feel like he exceeds his 70 rating and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.690 
feel like he exceeds his 70 rating and
he<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.319> definitely<00:02:00.530> worth<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.009> cash<00:02:01.340> from<00:02:01.550> the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
he is definitely worth the cash from the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.120 
he is definitely worth the cash from the
start<00:02:02.030> well<00:02:02.390> take<00:02:02.539> a<00:02:02.569> look<00:02:02.780> now<00:02:02.840> at<00:02:03.080> what<00:02:04.039> he

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
should be playing them at centre-back

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.370 
should be playing them at centre-back
or<00:02:40.190> center<00:02:40.489> defense<00:02:40.760> amid<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.510> in<00:02:41.660> my<00:02:41.870> opinion

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
or center defense amid so in my opinion

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
if you look at those stats I feel like

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.630 
if you look at those stats I feel like
he<00:02:45.020> fits<00:02:45.349> so<00:02:45.709> well<00:02:45.950> into<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> center

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
he fits so well into the center

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.309 
he fits so well into the center
defensive<00:02:47.120> mid<00:02:47.269> role<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.810> would<00:02:47.959> be<00:02:48.200> an

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
defensive mid role and it would be an

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.140 
defensive mid role and it would be an
injustice<00:02:48.590> really<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.700> play<00:02:49.849> him<00:02:50.000> at<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
injustice really to play him at the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.790 
injustice really to play him at the
center<00:02:50.420> back<00:02:50.540> role<00:02:50.810> especially<00:02:51.230> with<00:02:51.709> the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
center back role especially with the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.559 
center back role especially with the
four<00:02:52.010> star<00:02:52.220> weak<00:02:52.370> foot<00:02:52.489> four<00:02:52.730> star<00:02:53.000> skills<00:02:53.360> and

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
four star weak foot four star skills and

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.229 
four star weak foot four star skills and
his<00:02:53.900> physical<00:02:54.410> attributes<00:02:54.830> he<00:02:55.310> fit<00:02:55.550> so<00:02:55.940> well

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
his physical attributes he fit so well

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.970 
his physical attributes he fit so well
into<00:02:56.750> center<00:02:56.989> defensive<00:02:57.410> mid<00:02:57.530> he<00:02:57.650> can<00:02:57.800> go

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
into center defensive mid he can go

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.270 
into center defensive mid he can go
forward<00:02:58.519> he<00:02:58.910> even<00:02:59.060> has<00:02:59.480> decent<00:02:59.870> shooting<00:03:00.470> 67

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
forward he even has decent shooting 67

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280 
forward he even has decent shooting 67
finishing<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.760> definitely<00:03:02.209> not<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.420> best<00:03:02.600> but

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
finishing is definitely not the best but

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
finishing is definitely not the best but
if<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.470> take<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.680> look<00:03:03.860> at<00:03:03.950> all<00:03:04.040> his<00:03:04.130> other

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
if you take a look at all his other
