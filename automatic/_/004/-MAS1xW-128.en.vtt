00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.680
Welcome Brothers and Sisters!

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.220
I just wanted to put together a super quick
Update Video because it's been far too long

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.610
since I've been in front of a camera and put
anything out online, for you guys!

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.630
And producing videos is really the easiest
way to do that - so I apologize for sound

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.010
- it's a little windy here up on this roof
- but I did want to put something together

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.810
for you, because I have 4 very important pieces
of information.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.460
Things that are going to be evolving over
this next month.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.719
And the first I'm going to share is some really
good news: and that is I am finally going

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.000
to launch a new show on my channel called,
"Stars In Our Eyes."

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's a breakdown of Steven Universe!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.140
People were really great and really reacted
positively to the really slapdash ukulele

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.219
tutorial video I put together.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.300
What is Stars In Our Eyes going to be about?

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.040
Well, it's going to be breakdowns and analyzations
of Steven Universe - much like I do for Gravity

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.700
Falls - it'll be ukulele tutorials, it's going
to be... probably very few trains.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.490
But, it's also going to focus on some more
adult material - not necessarily bad for kids

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.990
- but I may put up occasional warnings because
I may talk about more mature subject matter

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.860
on that show.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.729
It's an amazing program, I do suggest you
watch it, if you haven't seen it already.

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.560
The second big piece of information is that
this month is crazy for me.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.140
I don't know if you've seen how sporadic my
updates have been, and that is because not

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.400
only have I been juggling a massive video
project for work - which is now done.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.270
I now have this small little bubble of time
until just past this weekend when I will be

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.439
traveling to go visit my younger brother who
is graduating from medical school!

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.061
Which is a huge thing - he's now fully a doctor!

00:01:55.061 --> 00:02:00.360
It's taken him many many years to get this
far so I want to be there for that celebration.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.399
But that means I'm going to be away from home.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.630
And that means being away from my editing
equipment.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.100
And probably most of my regular production
equipment.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.890
So I don't know just yet how I'm going to
have new content created for those five or

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.520
six days.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.690
But what I do want to do in preparation for
going away - makes the third thing - Live

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.900
Meetings!

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.959
I'm going to produce two Live Meetings this
month.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.739
That means this coming Saturday - the uh...

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.440
I don't have my calendar with me - but this
coming Saturday - and I'll flash the date

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.430
up on the screen.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.739
I am going to be putting together a Patreon
ONLY top secret meeting of the Royal Order

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.390
of the Holy Mackerel.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.360
Are you a Patreon Supporter?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.650
Thank you so much.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.650
I've been trying to figure out a way to really
repay the kindness to those folks who are

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.220
supporting me there, and although giving first
dibs on Live Meetings is kind of - well, it

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.950
does the job in some cases - it's kind of
unfair to my Regular Members.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.830
So what I'm going to do is put together a
top secret meeting for just my Patreon Supporters.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.830
The link will only be shared with those who
have unlocked the ability to see it by supporting

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.300
me there.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.120
So if you would like to become a Patreon Supporter
and be a part of this coming Saturday's Live

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.530
Meeting, there is still plenty of time to
do so.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.100
I believe the smallest amount is a dollar,
but there's no cap - you can support me as

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.100
much as you want.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.430
And it's on a Monthly basis - not per project.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.230
I upload a lot, regularly.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.870
If you are a brand new member of the Royal
Order of the Holy Mackerel, thank you!

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.670
Welcome to my channel!

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.780
The biggest news I saved for last - and that
is, I have been accepted into YouTube Space.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.780
Which is their special studio space that they
have in New York City!

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.040
I have to go through orientation, but it's
thanks to you - thanks to your following me,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.480
and supporting the show, I've been able to
now get into the Space and I'll be able to

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.150
book and gain access to that.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.190
And hopefully what this means is that I can
lock in a particular shoot date, and shoot

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.690
time, and not have to destroy my house to
throw up a shoot.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.471
Or climb out onto the roof and shoot.

00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:23.880
And have to deal with trains and wind.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.620
But thank you all so much.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.910
This means BIG THINGS.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.190
Probably more collaborations with big time
YouTubers - it means probably I'll have the

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.389
space - and this is something that I've really
wanted to do for a while - is hold interviews.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.210
Actual one on one interviews - not over Skype,
but with those who can come to the New York

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.220
area - and now I'll have a professional place
to not only shoot, but also invite these important

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.690
people.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.180
And so much more!

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.410
Lavish sets!

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.410
Pro lighting!

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.639
Things I can just - I can just go there, throw
up my stuff in a snap, most likely have other

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.139
attendants to help me!

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.090
I'll have classes to teach me how to YouTube
better - and that all means better things

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.270
for you - the viewer, and my fans, in the
long run.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.800
So thank you so much!

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.990
I will have more information as things develop.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.030
I will be holding a standard Live Meeting
of the Royal Order of the Holy Mackerel on

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.520
the last Saturday of the month.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.280
I don't know if it's the 30th or the 31st
- but through the magic of YouTube I'm putting

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.810
that up on the screen right now.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.930
I will make an event page and share that.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.630
And again, if you're not following me on social
media - please do so!

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.100
You'll find all this information - and more.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.780
Links are in the About section below this
video.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.789
Thank you again for watching, and until next
time - share, subscribe, and keep cracking

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.320
those codes!

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.111
Come on - hang in there sun!

00:05:51.111 --> 00:05:53.180
The sun is dropping like a stone.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.860
There must be a hundred vampires near here.
