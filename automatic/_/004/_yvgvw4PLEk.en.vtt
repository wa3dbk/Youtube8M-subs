00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hey, youtube group. 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.589
 I'm here again andrézão show 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.809
 here for you 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.809
 some modifications I did on xj 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.340
 this time I put the pointer léo 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.619
 more 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.830
 I just told you I feel something original 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.029
 is making a more serious noise 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.029
 mainly in low rotation 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.690
 but it was more beautiful noise but the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.690
 It hit me so much better. 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.000
 I, the one who works the motorcycle 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.469
 did not want to put 141 right away if 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.940
 find it necessary to go forward 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.370
 I'll put it down but for now I'll leave it there. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.489
 i bought from ebay 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.750
 I had it delivered to a friend's house in 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 Portugal 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.420
 He brought me Brazil, there's the play. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.000
 beautiful ball show finish and made 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.299
 of titanium a pectin finish in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.970
 top carbon fiber got a fuss 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.350
 very tasty 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.820
 of course there was not the noise of a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.860
 picture and one thing that was not going to really stay 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.729
 huh 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.490
 I will wait now to put the tire 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.520
 original is with 3 and fewer than 3 thousand 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.610
 and a few km 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.390
 I will still wait to put the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.549
 filter cahino and the old iridium to see 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.149
 if something changes with that know 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.780
 with this border 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:52.079
 even because I have a friend who has a 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.290
 jota has a deafening noise 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:02:00.509
 it's beautiful it's more to wear on a daily basis 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.799
 How I use it will be very difficult. 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.799
 I'll give you a call here. 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.100
 nothing more sung 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.640

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.610
 pretty 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.650
 That's it, boys. 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:13.400

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:18.290

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.240
