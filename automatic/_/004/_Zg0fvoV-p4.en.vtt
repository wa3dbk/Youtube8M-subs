hi I'd like to demonstrate for you the
state-owned<00:00:11.969> device<00:00:12.619> that<00:00:13.879> is<00:00:15.049> specifically

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
state-owned device that is specifically

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.950 
state-owned device that is specifically
designed<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.100> Bigsby<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
designed for the Bigsby this is the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.780 
designed for the Bigsby this is the
string<00:00:19.320> clamp<00:00:19.970> and<00:00:21.800> this<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.040> the<00:00:23.220> Bigsby<00:00:23.640> on

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
string clamp and this is the Bigsby on

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.720 
string clamp and this is the Bigsby on
the<00:00:23.910> back<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.530> see<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.860> fine<00:00:26.160> tuner

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the back so you can see the fine tuner

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.000 
the back so you can see the fine tuner
is<00:00:26.940> back<00:00:27.600> here<00:00:27.900> with<00:00:28.110> the<00:00:28.260> biggest<00:00:28.560> peak<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
is back here with the biggest peak and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.619 
is back here with the biggest peak and
it's<00:00:30.350> absolutely<00:00:31.350> necessary<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.270> that

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
it's absolutely necessary to have that

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.220 
it's absolutely necessary to have that
on<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.039> put<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.550> string<00:00:35.879> clamp<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.600> your

fine tuner electronic fine tuner and I
have<00:00:53.639> this<00:00:53.969> device<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:55.109> not<00:00:55.679> tightened<00:00:56.670> on

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
have this device that's not tightened on

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.539 
have this device that's not tightened on
the<00:00:56.999> strings<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.409> I<00:00:59.190> would<00:00:59.370> like

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
the strings right now and I would like

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.160 
the strings right now and I would like
to<00:00:59.579> demonstrate<00:01:00.319> that<00:01:01.319> when<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.769> dive<00:01:02.129> bomb

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
to demonstrate that when you dive bomb

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.670 
to demonstrate that when you dive bomb
the<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:05.159> strings<00:01:05.610> don't<00:01:06.540> return<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.260> tonal

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the the strings don't return to tonal

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.240 
the the strings don't return to tonal
zero<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.329> the<00:01:09.750> g<00:01:10.200> string<00:01:10.619> which<00:01:11.009> is

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
zero so here is the g string which is

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.039 
zero so here is the g string which is
notorious<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.969> going<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:12.539> of<00:01:12.570> tune<00:01:12.840> while

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
notorious for going out of tune while

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.399 
notorious for going out of tune while
you're<00:01:13.229> playing<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:15.079> that<00:01:16.079> it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you're playing and it's because that it

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.700 
you're playing and it's because that it
doesn't<00:01:16.890> come<00:01:17.100> back<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.090> nut<00:01:18.329> so<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.469> is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
doesn't come back at the nut so this is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.520 
doesn't come back at the nut so this is
loose<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.659> what<00:01:21.899> we've<00:01:22.049> got<00:01:22.079> what<00:01:22.439> I'm

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
now you can see the fine tuner the

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.270 
now you can see the fine tuner the
electronic<00:01:33.770> tuner<00:01:34.189> is<00:01:34.850> sharp<00:01:35.500> now<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:36.890> just

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
electronic tuner is sharp now I just

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.490 
electronic tuner is sharp now I just
died<00:01:39.610> okay<00:01:40.610> now<00:01:41.299> I'm<00:01:41.630> gonna<00:01:41.810> go<00:01:42.020> ahead<00:01:42.259> and

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.800 

stretch<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:49.970> now<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:50.929> notice<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:51.679> flat

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.429 

and<00:01:56.409> if<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:57.100> die<00:01:57.159> bomb

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.910 

it<00:02:00.920> goes<00:02:01.159> sharp<00:02:02.079> so<00:02:03.079> what<00:02:03.229> like<00:02:03.409> what<00:02:03.679> I'd<00:02:03.799> like

and there's no no alteration to your
guitar<00:02:21.190> when<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.340> do<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.480> it's<00:02:23.870> just

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
guitar when you do this so it's just

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.740 
guitar when you do this so it's just
it's<00:02:24.590> just<00:02:24.709> clamping<00:02:25.400> all<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.420> strings

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
it's just clamping all of the strings

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.470 
it's just clamping all of the strings
together<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:29.750> let<00:02:30.080> me<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:31.090> put<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.269> on

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
together and so let me just put this on

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.250 
together and so let me just put this on
and<00:02:34.090> then<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:36.110> just<00:02:36.440> snug<00:02:37.099> up<00:02:37.480> as<00:02:38.480> snug

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
and then and so you just snug up as snug

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.330 
and then and so you just snug up as snug
as<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.560> possibly<00:02:39.980> can<00:02:40.450> are<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:42.530> four<00:02:42.980> little

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
as you possibly can are the four little

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.640 
as you possibly can are the four little
screws<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.000> all<00:02:44.329> that<00:02:44.629> does<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:44.900> tighten<00:02:45.530> up

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
screws and all that does is tighten up

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.550 
screws and all that does is tighten up
the<00:02:46.370> string<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.879> tightens<00:02:47.720> all<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.260> strings

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
the string it tightens all the strings

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.979 
the string it tightens all the strings
together<00:02:51.459> now<00:02:52.459> what<00:02:52.790> I'm<00:02:52.940> going<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.239> do<00:02:53.540> is

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
together now what I'm going to do is

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.220 
together now what I'm going to do is
with<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.739> fine<00:02:54.980> tuner<00:02:55.400> on<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.670> back<00:02:56.019> now<00:02:57.019> that

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.500 

and<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.870> see<00:04:10.140> here<00:04:10.550> when<00:04:11.550> you<00:04:11.670> dive-bomb<00:04:12.270> it
