and there's a couple of different

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180 
and there's a couple of different
reasons<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.210> part<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.170> cause<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.620> an

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
reasons for part of it is cause of an

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.650 
reasons for part of it is cause of an
aging<00:00:50.579> group<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.149> know<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.570> have

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
aging group but you know what we have

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.600 
aging group but you know what we have
the<00:00:51.750> Millennials<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> scene<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the Millennials on the scene and that is

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.430 
the Millennials on the scene and that is
a<00:00:53.730> big<00:00:53.760> swell<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.690> anybody<00:00:54.930> who<00:00:55.110> says<00:00:55.289> it's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
a big swell so anybody who says it's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.740 
a big swell so anybody who says it's
just<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.610> guess<00:00:57.239> they<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.390> don't<00:00:57.690> know

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
just that I guess they just don't know

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750 
just that I guess they just don't know
about<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.079> millennial<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.190> reality<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
about the millennial so the reality is

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.490 
about the millennial so the reality is
is<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.359> not<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.539> great<00:01:00.750> labor<00:01:01.050> market

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
is that it's not a great labor market

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.380 
is that it's not a great labor market
but<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.579> thing<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:02.879> say<00:01:03.090> okay<00:01:03.329> so

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
but that's one thing they say okay so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.210 
but that's one thing they say okay so
one<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> labor<00:01:04.080> market<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.710> economy<00:01:05.100> in

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and gold to go down like that there and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.649

they've<00:01:46.439> had<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> phenomenal<00:01:46.890> year<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:48.630> know

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
they've had a phenomenal year you know

they've had a phenomenal year you know
this<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.409> supposed<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.829> pull<00:01:50.070> back<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.490> was

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
this it's supposed to pull back it was

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.190 
this it's supposed to pull back it was
just<00:01:50.880> wait<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> lot<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> speculation

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
just wait and get a lot of speculation

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.120 
just wait and get a lot of speculation
of<00:01:52.290> course<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> pull<00:01:52.950> back<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
of course it's going to pull back the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.429 
of course it's going to pull back the
third<00:01:54.119> reason<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> US<00:01:55.079> dollar<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
third reason is the US dollar the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.200 
third reason is the US dollar the
strength<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.920> US<00:01:56.130> dollar<00:01:56.369> compared<00:01:57.149> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that everybody knows and it's always

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
strong for years other than I think was

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.029 
strong for years other than I think was
2013<00:02:09.330> right<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.569> had<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.840> dip<00:02:10.020> off<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> pretty

2013 right I had to dip off a pretty

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.070 
2013 right I had to dip off a pretty
significant<00:02:11.610> but

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
significant but

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.270 
significant but
since<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.710> done<00:02:12.830> well<00:02:13.040> now<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
since that it's done well now the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.770 
since that it's done well now the
reasons<00:02:13.670> why<00:02:13.790> is<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:13.970> while<00:02:14.300> that's<00:02:14.510> for<00:02:14.750> a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
reasons why is that while that's for a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.810 
reasons why is that while that's for a
different<00:02:14.870> video<00:02:15.170> but<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> point<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.280> get

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
different video but the point is I get

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.820 
different video but the point is I get
three<00:02:17.060> points<00:02:17.270> on<00:02:17.510> this<00:02:17.600> on<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:17.990> email<00:02:18.590> where

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
they tell me these are the three reasons

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.920 
they tell me these are the three reasons
why<00:02:21.050> silver<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.770> going<00:02:22.070> down<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.760> then<00:02:23.720> it's<00:02:23.840> a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
why silver is going down and then it's a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.070 
why silver is going down and then it's a
