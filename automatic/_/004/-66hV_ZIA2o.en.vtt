00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
dead to the YouTube universe as it was

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.509 
dead to the YouTube universe as it was
it<00:00:44.809> only<00:00:44.960> makes<00:00:45.320> sense<00:00:45.500> that<00:00:45.860> I<00:00:46.040> give<00:00:46.250> you<00:00:46.370> guys

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
it only makes sense that I give you guys

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.210

the<00:00:47.120> story<00:00:47.540> of<00:00:47.720> the<00:00:47.839> day<00:00:48.049> I<00:00:48.080> was<00:00:48.350> almost<00:00:48.559> shot

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
the story of the day I was almost shot

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.130 
the story of the day I was almost shot
to<00:00:49.460> death<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:49.909> real<00:00:50.150> life<00:00:50.479> and<00:00:50.750> I<00:00:50.870> thought<00:00:51.080> it

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
to death in real life and I thought it

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.450 
to death in real life and I thought it
would<00:00:51.229> be<00:00:51.320> pretty<00:00:51.530> interesting<00:00:51.979> to<00:00:52.100> go<00:00:52.220> ahead

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
would be pretty interesting to go ahead

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.149 
would be pretty interesting to go ahead
and<00:00:52.670> get<00:00:53.210> right<00:00:53.479> into<00:00:53.659> that<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.890> story

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
and get right into that so the story

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:56.890 
and get right into that so the story
starts<00:00:55.250> once<00:00:55.790> again<00:00:56.120> back<00:00:56.449> in<00:00:56.600> my<00:00:56.720> high<00:00:56.870> school

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.120 
him dick that wasn't his real name but
he<00:01:41.480> was<00:01:41.660> kind<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.350> dick<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.800> guess<00:01:43.010> it

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
he was kind of a dick so I guess it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.590 
he was kind of a dick so I guess it
makes<00:01:43.280> sense<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.820> hide<00:01:44.030> his<00:01:44.150> identity

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
makes sense that I hide his identity

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.260 
makes sense that I hide his identity
like<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:45.080> anyway<00:01:46.070> dick<00:01:46.520> always<00:01:46.880> brought<00:01:47.090> to

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270
