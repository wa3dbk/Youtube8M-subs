00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 everybody good day, fat their hands and in this 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.940
 issue I would like to do a review on 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.370
 some server i went into it 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.290
 decided to play well at the same time to make a review 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.859
 so if you are attracted by something 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:22.250
 could not play on the server with us 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.410
 20 people 20 lots 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.039
 I do not have every vegetables my Rome then 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.630
 there is so powerful on our right 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.880
 ugly to build such a first thing I 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.910
 probably went to the store because 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.640
 something is no longer very beautiful 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.980
 such a shop on this basis in general 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:54.390
 the standard store is no surprise 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:57.180
 children found in the store I ran straight 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.100
 because clicks scored wonderful wings I 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.100
 wanted you to count it but it looks like it 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.720
 aside from but I did not have and I did not 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.380
 go up and go get yourself a meal 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.950
 because I had a goal food here already 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 Of course we have great because you know 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:24.240
 what did you do agon here if you 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.790
 you will adjust currency because block 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.750
 worth of interesting places interesting 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:40.259
 interesting video 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:42.329
 fuck further I of course you went to the museum 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.220
 which they are to us and built only for 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.229
 entertaining purpose and 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.390
 it was why it was visible strongly here such arose 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.060
 silent build it out steve zombies and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.119
 creeper and skeleton but in general mommy 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.290
 simple on 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.570
 further I was very attracted to this 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.070
 construction I decided to see what its his 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.070
 turned out to be a roller coaster 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.270
 even look 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.070
 yes it ran these mountains not very much 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.820
 the statute did not give my entrance here 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.860
 click on what you think we go in to 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.620
 hemorrhagus and we are given bulk goat 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.740
 free but what is purely entertaining 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:33.230
 goals and trolley sit in the menu click 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:38.420
 on the button and hit the road of course 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.420
 building roller coaster interest 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:03:01.090
 and so here we go we go we go in general 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.860
 overall very interesting gray not 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:11.470
 like obviously not play was developed 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:15.340
 important server name is very interesting 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.400
 or want boracay to wear his baby i 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.310
 I'll throw off the oh-group and and all sense to 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:27.810
 Garrison I have learned so far that there is no 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.810
 very clearly let's see 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:39.400
 nothing original because if 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.340
 passes they don't decide it's not easy 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.890
 like this ram volodya jump jump 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.400
 this is not involved in general this is not 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.650
 stops my secret here is 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:59.769

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.410
 Cafe 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.129
 find inside everything is fine i do 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:17.430

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:25.180

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.419
 entertainment merge nothing 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:37.479
 here we have a cafe and the inscription 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:39.520

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.680

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.830
