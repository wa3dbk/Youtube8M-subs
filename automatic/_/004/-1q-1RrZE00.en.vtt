00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.160
 then let's read it we were looking for the 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.860
 things that we need if it gets worse 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.430
 a conveyor belt reason 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.160
 of 30 cubic feet per minute then 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.820
 there is the first thing that we have to 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.940
 notice that they are giving us this reason 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.390
 30 cubic feet per minute that already 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.020
 says that that's a differential but a 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.730
 volume change tell me that the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:49.070
 volume changes 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.070
 with respect to you at a rate of 30 and it's 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.300
 cubic x 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.690
 then change volume the way that 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.269
 has the mound that is going to be formed 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.890
 when they are not bouncing gravel that is the 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.140
 cone shape is what we have here 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.720
 now they say the dimensions of their 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.050
 fragments allow to form a stack of 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.759
 cone shaped whose diameter and height 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:20.680
 they are the same since the distance is 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.680
 is here is equal to the distance of 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.810
 the diameter of these two distances are 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.810
 same 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.100
 how fast the height increases 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.280
 of the pile when it is measured 10 feet 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.380
 high since they tell us 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.619
 if this is the height for itself 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.920
 you want to know how the height changes with 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.880
 regarding the time of the question and what 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.880
 they want to know when 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.330
 when h 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:01.850
 10 feet tall and what we need is 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.480
 the volume of a call is the volume of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.480
 a cone is 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.930
 one third 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.690
 standing 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.690
 for the square real x 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.690
 then we already have that they do not relate 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.910
 we variables like this 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.180
 and what are the changes that ask me 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.060
 something that we have to notice is that we 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.370
 are saying that the diameter has to 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.370
 be equal to the high so they tell us 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.650
 the diameter 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.280
 it's the same oh that means that two 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.360
 times 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.150
 r is equal to 2 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.500
 then from there we clear r we are left 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:57.550
 that you are equal to ah means 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.320
 to replace it in the formulite of this 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.320
 of volume then we would have to 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:09.170
 the volume is equal to one third of pi 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.950
 for r squared but you're h means 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.950
 then we write h squared over 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.670
 4 hours 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.350
 that would be 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.510
 12 and or 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:29.620
 from vic by h the cube is fine and now 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.620
 if we can come 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.470
 find the exchange rate that would be 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.720
 we derive with respect to and we are left 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.310
 the volume change with respect to 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.440
 time equals 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:49.010
 3 out of 12 that's a quarter 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.580
 for now h squared by the derivative 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.450
 of h with respect d 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.330
 tic 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.970
 and now we have to 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:04.120
 to replace what we know that 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.240
 we know we know that this is 30 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.700
 yes 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.900
 equal to a quarter 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.889
 for you for h squared how much is worth hh 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:22.730
 1010 squared 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:27.860
 I feel for dh dt 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:31.340
 then 100/4 are 25 which had 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:38.090
 30 match 25 7 h 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:40.690
 dt equals 30 match 25 and what 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.690
 we can simplify 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.390
 6 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:51.389
 about 5 pib which is approximately 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.389
 how much 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.469
 0 points 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.060
 0.38 and the dimensions 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.300
 good about 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.300
 minutes are less 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.560
 10 minutes 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.750
 it is clear 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.750
 6 of the exercise
