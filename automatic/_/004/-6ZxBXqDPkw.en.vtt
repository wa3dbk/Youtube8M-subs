00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.680
 scan the code so let's get the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.420
 cell phone to do this is important 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.550
 remember that web access is not a 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.469
 another axa pib account is just one 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.610
 extension of the account you already have a 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.800

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.270
 you will use the same account in the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.680
 two platforms 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.860
 first we need to open 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.030
 whatsapp and click settings 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 then we go to the act sapweb and there 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.200
 all we have to do is position 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.659
 qr code reader towards the screen 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.780
 computer to read only 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.939
 wait a little bit and you're done 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.060
 Can access whatsapp from web 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.670
 usually those who are all their 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.689

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.850

 here on the web platform you can activate 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.020
 job 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.939
 so every time someone sends a 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.439
 message to you you receive the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.610
 notification directly on your 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.799
