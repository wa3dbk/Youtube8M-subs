current<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:59.740> advice<00:03:00.070> is<00:03:00.370> not<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.820> try<00:03:01.240> and

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
current the advice is not to try and

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.170 
current the advice is not to try and
swim<00:03:01.630> directly<00:03:01.959> back<00:03:02.290> towards<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.800> shore

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
swim directly back towards the shore

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.130 
swim directly back towards the shore
because<00:03:04.180> you're<00:03:04.300> basically<00:03:04.600> fighting<00:03:04.900> to

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
because you're basically fighting to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.390 
because you're basically fighting to
fast-moving<00:03:05.530> water<00:03:05.800> that's<00:03:06.130> going<00:03:06.280> in<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
fast-moving water that's going in the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.740 
fast-moving water that's going in the
opposite<00:03:06.670> direction<00:03:06.820> what<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.420> have<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.660> do

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
opposite direction what you have to do

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.710 
opposite direction what you have to do
instead<00:03:08.020> is<00:03:08.500> swim<00:03:09.250> parallel<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.600> shore

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
instead is swim parallel to the shore

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.840 
instead is swim parallel to the shore
until<00:03:11.170> you're<00:03:11.590> out<00:03:11.800> of<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.100> rip<00:03:12.250> current<00:03:12.610> and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
until you're out of the rip current and

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.490 
until you're out of the rip current and
then<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.660> get<00:03:13.810> yourself<00:03:13.900> back<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.470> the
