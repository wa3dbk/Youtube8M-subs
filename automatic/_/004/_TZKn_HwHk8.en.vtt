which<00:02:31.469> is<00:02:31.590> pretty<00:02:31.739> cool<00:02:31.980> because<00:02:32.159> it'll<00:02:32.400> be

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
which is pretty cool because it'll be

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.559 
which is pretty cool because it'll be
like<00:02:32.790> maybe<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:33.659> be<00:02:33.750> Optimus<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.439> optimus
