so<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.750> will<00:01:42.869> attract<00:01:43.170> some<00:01:43.350> fingerprints

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
so that will attract some fingerprints

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.929 
so that will attract some fingerprints
but<00:01:43.950> that's<00:01:44.100> better<00:01:44.280> than<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.579> whole<00:01:44.700> device

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
but that's better than your whole device

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.450 
but that's better than your whole device
being<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.360> fingerprint<00:01:45.840> magnet<00:01:46.220> let's<00:01:47.220> see

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
being a fingerprint magnet let's see

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.520 
being a fingerprint magnet let's see
here<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> bottom<00:01:48.200> looks<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.350> we've<00:01:49.500> got

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
here on the bottom looks like we've got

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.050 
here on the bottom looks like we've got
a<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:49.860> sub<00:01:50.130> woofer<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.579> did<00:01:50.729> listen<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
a little sub woofer and I did listen to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060 
a little sub woofer and I did listen to
this<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:52.049> believe<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> subwoofer

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
this and I believe that is a subwoofer

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.469 
this and I believe that is a subwoofer
there<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> bottom<00:01:53.700> because<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.299> some

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
there in the bottom because I have some

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.300 
there in the bottom because I have some
really<00:01:54.750> nice<00:01:54.960> bass<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.590> did<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.189> expect

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
really nice bass that I did not expect

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.730 
really nice bass that I did not expect
out<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.540> also<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> sides<00:01:58.380> here

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
out of this and also on the sides here

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.039 
out of this and also on the sides here
we've<00:01:58.979> got<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> stereo<00:01:59.670> speakers<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.420> those

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
we've got the stereo speakers and those

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.569 
we've got the stereo speakers and those
sounds<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.619> good<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:02.159> actually<00:02:02.460> get

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
sounds really good and they actually get

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.399 
sounds really good and they actually get
pretty<00:02:02.880> loud<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.360> was<00:02:03.600> very<00:02:03.630> impressed<00:02:04.110> with

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
pretty loud so I was very impressed with

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.010 
pretty loud so I was very impressed with
this<00:02:04.649> sip<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:06.899> we

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
this sip this right here and then we

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.850 
this sip this right here and then we
just<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.619> actual<00:02:07.829> USB<00:02:08.729> dongle<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:10.140> cap

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
just have the actual USB dongle this cap

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.190 
just have the actual USB dongle this cap
comes<00:02:11.069> off<00:02:11.190> here<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:12.930> plug<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
comes off here and you just plug that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.820 
comes off here and you just plug that
right

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
right

your computer PC or Mac this operates on
2.4<00:02:17.340> gigahertz<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.030> gives<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.330> range<00:02:18.600> of

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
2.4 gigahertz and it gives it a range of

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.590 
2.4 gigahertz and it gives it a range of
about<00:02:19.080> 60<00:02:19.890> feet<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.280> says<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:21.360> can<00:02:21.480> also

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
about 60 feet it says you can also

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.000 
about 60 feet it says you can also
select<00:02:21.900> channels<00:02:22.410> if<00:02:22.530> you're<00:02:22.680> getting<00:02:22.860> any

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
sort of like interference you can push

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.480 
sort of like interference you can push
this<00:02:25.320> channel<00:02:25.680> button<00:02:25.860> here<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.370> will

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
on the fly and get rid of any

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.460 
on the fly and get rid of any
interference<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.870> may<00:02:30.990> be<00:02:31.050> having<00:02:31.260> I

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
interference that you may be having I

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.750 
interference that you may be having I
didn't<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.830> problem<00:02:32.100> with<00:02:32.190> interference

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
didn't have a problem with interference

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.240 
didn't have a problem with interference
but<00:02:33.090> if<00:02:33.630> you're<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.990> an<00:02:34.140> area<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.710> has<00:02:34.950> really

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
but if you're in an area that has really

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.640 
but if you're in an area that has really
high<00:02:35.460> traffic<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.360> 2.4<00:02:36.870> gigahertz<00:02:36.930> rained

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
high traffic in the 2.4 gigahertz rained

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.530 
high traffic in the 2.4 gigahertz rained
like<00:02:37.860> wireless<00:02:38.310> networks<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.390> even

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
like wireless networks and I think even

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.950 
like wireless networks and I think even
microwaves<00:02:40.200> disrupt<00:02:40.850> 2.4<00:02:41.850> gigahertz<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.810> can

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
microwaves disrupt 2.4 gigahertz you can

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.410 
microwaves disrupt 2.4 gigahertz you can
use<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> change<00:02:43.950> your<00:02:44.160> frequency<00:02:44.420> so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
use that to change your frequency so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.030 
use that to change your frequency so
there<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.080> bump<00:02:46.290> wireless<00:02:46.650> speaker

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
there it is the bump wireless speaker

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500 
there it is the bump wireless speaker

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
there's no jumps or anything it should

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.990 
there's no jumps or anything it should
just<00:04:03.159> start<00:04:03.430> playing<00:04:03.519> out<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.849> bump

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000

just start playing out of the bump
wireless<00:04:04.389> speaker<00:04:05.220> there<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.310> goes<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:10.750> goes

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
wireless speaker there it goes that goes

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.220 
wireless speaker there it goes that goes
really<00:04:11.139> loud<00:04:11.439> not<00:04:11.950> distorting<00:04:12.519> too<00:04:12.730> so

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
really loud not distorting too so

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:21.809 
really loud not distorting too so
earnest

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:21.819 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.860 

member

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.140 

and

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.040 

so<00:04:30.150> obviously<00:04:30.509> you<00:04:30.629> could<00:04:30.749> tell<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:30.930> that

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
so obviously you could tell that that

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.839 
so obviously you could tell that that
thing<00:04:31.289> is<00:04:31.319> a<00:04:31.409> lot<00:04:31.620> louder<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.729> could

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
thing is a lot louder and you could

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.100 
thing is a lot louder and you could
probably<00:04:33.060> hear<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.509> there<00:04:33.659> is<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.810> lot<00:04:34.080> more

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
probably hear that there is a lot more

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.200 
probably hear that there is a lot more
bass<00:04:34.530> output<00:04:34.800> on<00:04:35.099> that<00:04:35.249> too<00:04:35.580> then<00:04:35.849> just<00:04:36.090> like

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
bass output on that too then just like
