00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.340
 when we press directly they will 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.779
 bring to a menu that you can 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.029
 choose by choosing what they want 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.949
 learn if the intro of the song or the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.779
 verse or the chorus depends depends 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.550

 google + so good we go note by 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.860
 note 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.150
 good starting with interpreting it by 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.150
 the first the intro 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.329
 we started 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.439
 we make a slide on the fourth string 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.430
 fourth rope contrast number nine 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.920
 then we do the same without the slide 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.840
 we played in seven in the third of the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.880
 third string we have a little bit of 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.119
 vibrato 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.119
 yes 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.750
 but we played in nine of the third 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.890
 and now what we do is we touch the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.870
 second string 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.150
 the first ten and three first nine of 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.830
 the third at the same time we play but 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.830
 we make a 20 on the third string 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.939
 yes 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.890
 a fly 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.890
 i 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.470
 if we know we give a 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.470
 a little bit of vibrato up there 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.760
 we are in the most higher part 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.920
 when we are still doing the vent 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.120
 we play with little one or with whom 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.940
 they prefer depends on how they are 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.320
 turn on we play on the tenth fret 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.320
 the second and the first block 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.010
 yes 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.630
 after we played in the first 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.390
 rope on the tenth fret 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.760
 we do again 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.130
 a vent is still in the tenth to the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.480
 second and on the fret does not move from the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.519
 third 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.980
 when we do good when we lower it 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.980
 we make a pool or 7 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.709
 the case that I made was touching this note 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.480
 they can also only after 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.760
 after 7 depends on 7 can go 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.030
 directly back to the tenth and the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.319
 ninth of those two bens 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.700
 it's the same movement that we did before 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.939
 nothing else we do it twice 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.939
 followed 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.019
 wants to show you how it looks 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.150
 in the second sells 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.939
 we give a little bit of 20 like the same 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.470
 what we did with the first one with this 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:55.790
 first procession after 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.650
 we touch the bottom 9 of the third 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:03.150
 we play the tenth of the second and 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:06.659
 we make a pu lof to the fret to the fret 7 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.209
 what we do is we drag after 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.530
 enrolled we drag on the yes 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.120
 mainly the second agreement 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.810
 then dragged the two 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.060
 I believe that drag drag a single 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:23.660
 but you are watching our two 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.660
 we drag from frets 6 to 7 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.310
 yes 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.250
 and can drag we play the 7 of the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:41.270
 third string we play the 9 of the fourth 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.360
 9 of the third 9 of the fourth of 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.190
 new and then we play the 7 and we give it 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.650
 a little bit of a little vibrato to 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.100
 show him how everything is a bit 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.100
 slower 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.370
 yes 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.280
 after 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:24.160
 we play the ninth of the fourth string 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.320
 we make a pu lof to 7 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.870
 after the pool of the 7 in the fourth 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:35.730
 in the fifth we play in the ninth 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.800
 we make a slide to the seventh fret part 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.300
 of the fifth and when we finished hardly 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.640
 it's very fast at the moment but we finish 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:47.270
 to do the live we make a pulse to 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:49.930
 fret 5 we play the 7 of the sixth string 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.900
 we play again on 5 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.620
 and after 7 we make a slide to 9 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.820
 of the game 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.150
 let me show you how is your 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.150
 full 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.310
 com 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.830
 yes 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.110
 and 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.130
 after doing that we play third 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.630
 rope and the fourth rope at the same 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.660
 weather 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:28.190
 you eat once we drag to 9 and 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.190
 we turn some to 7 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.279
 after he finished dragging 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.740
 we play the 9 of the fourth we return to 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:39.039
 touch him 7 17 of the share of the third and 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.259
 the fourth and we do a pulo we play the 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.169
 two at the same time and then we play 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:46.629
 we make a hammer on forgiveness to it 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:50.219
 position but in 93 remember the 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:50.219
 number 9 and the 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.020
 the fourth string in 39 does everything to 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.819
 Same time 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.699
 four minimums we give a little bit of 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:02.099
 vibrato and before we finish we drag 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.460
 as again everything slower is not 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.460
 worry
