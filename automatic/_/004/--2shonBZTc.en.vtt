the<00:00:54.480> weekend<00:00:54.920> they<00:00:55.920> were<00:00:56.039> pretty<00:00:56.250> gross

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the weekend they were pretty gross

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.229 
the weekend they were pretty gross
missing<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.059> while<00:00:57.210> idle<00:00:57.660> worth<00:00:57.809> crap<00:00:58.050> so

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
missing one while idle worth crap so

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.689 
missing one while idle worth crap so
this<00:01:00.239> does<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.570> electric<00:01:00.960> start<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
this does have electric start and

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.310 
this does have electric start and
reverse<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.000> think<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> solenoid<00:01:03.989> stuck

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
reverse I think the solenoid stuck

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.310 
reverse I think the solenoid stuck
because<00:01:04.619> yeah<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> turn<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.760> over<00:01:05.970> and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
because yeah I can I turn it over and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.450 
because yeah I can I turn it over and
nothing<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.409> don't<00:01:07.470> even<00:01:07.619> hear<00:01:07.740> anything<00:01:07.979> no

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
nothing you don't even hear anything no

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.090 
nothing you don't even hear anything no
clicks<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.939> anything<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.650> solenoids<00:01:10.650> probably

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
clicks or anything so solenoids probably

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.700 
clicks or anything so solenoids probably
shot<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:13.310> it's<00:01:14.310> sat<00:01:14.670> outside<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.119> think

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
shot and it's sat outside I think

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.539 
shot and it's sat outside I think
there's<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> wasp<00:01:16.950> nests<00:01:17.460> under<00:01:17.729> there

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.950 

it's<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.670> actually<00:01:24.240> pretty<00:01:24.420> excellent<00:01:24.869> meal

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
it's a actually pretty excellent meal

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.300 
it's a actually pretty excellent meal
it's<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:25.680> fast<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.040> my<00:01:26.159> Indy<00:01:26.400> 500<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
it's not as fast as my Indy 500 but I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.050 
it's not as fast as my Indy 500 but I
thought<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.610> rides<00:01:29.850> nice<00:01:30.150> though<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:32.060> gets

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
thought it rides nice though and gets

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.179 
thought it rides nice though and gets
this<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.540> only<00:01:33.689> has<00:01:33.840> 512<00:01:34.650> miles

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
this it only has 512 miles

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.760 
this it only has 512 miles
I<00:01:35.369> had<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.900> 476<00:01:36.900> when<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.110> got<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:37.650> I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
I had a 476 when we got it but then I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.280 
I had a 476 when we got it but then I
fixed<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> also<00:01:39.689> had<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.990> fix<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
fixed it and what I also had to fix the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.660 
fixed it and what I also had to fix the
clutch<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.740> think<00:01:40.950> something<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.250> hanging<00:01:41.549> up

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
clutch I think something was hanging up

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
there on a piece of rust on the shaft so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.639 
there on a piece of rust on the shaft so
anyway<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.689> can't<00:01:45.869> took<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.200> apart<00:01:46.439> and

even<00:02:22.599> lower<00:02:22.959> at<00:02:23.200> all<00:02:23.880> didn't<00:02:24.880> work<00:02:25.030> out<00:02:25.270> but<00:02:27.450> it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
even lower at all didn't work out but it

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.820 
even lower at all didn't work out but it
sounds<00:02:28.810> kind<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.080> neat<00:02:29.260> sounds<00:02:30.100> different

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
sounds kind of neat sounds different

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.199 
sounds kind of neat sounds different
sounds<00:02:32.830> too<00:02:32.980> old<00:02:33.220> or<00:02:33.370> don't<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.670> think<00:02:33.850> me<00:02:34.180> a

actually have a parking brake which I

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.420 
actually have a parking brake which I
find<00:03:28.630> really<00:03:28.870> unique<00:03:29.319> I've<00:03:29.950> never<00:03:30.250> seen

another slide look one although that I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.720 
another slide look one although that I
haven't<00:03:32.860> looked<00:03:33.010> at<00:03:33.190> on<00:03:33.280> my<00:03:33.400> just<00:03:33.550> ledger

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
haven't looked at on my just ledger

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.860 
haven't looked at on my just ledger
where<00:03:33.910> they<00:03:33.970> have<00:03:34.060> parking<00:03:34.420> brakes<00:03:34.600> or<00:03:34.750> not

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
where they have parking brakes or not

where they have parking brakes or not
this<00:03:35.590> thing<00:03:35.800> you<00:03:35.920> squeeze<00:03:36.850> down<00:03:36.970> your<00:03:37.150> brake

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
this thing you squeeze down your brake

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.790 
this thing you squeeze down your brake
and<00:03:37.480> push<00:03:37.660> down<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.110> locks<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.560> in<00:03:38.650> place<00:03:38.709> and

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
and push down and locks it in place and

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.190 
and push down and locks it in place and
squeeze<00:03:41.800> it<00:03:41.920> up<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.250> there<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.459> goes<00:03:42.989> which<00:03:43.989> I

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
squeeze it up and there it goes which I

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.949 
squeeze it up and there it goes which I
I<00:03:44.380> think<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.739> good<00:03:44.920> idea<00:03:45.040> but<00:03:45.780> things<00:03:46.780> you

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
I think it's a good idea but things you

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.449 
I think it's a good idea but things you
gotta<00:03:47.110> look<00:03:47.319> at<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.860> how<00:03:48.040> often<00:03:48.220> do<00:03:48.400> you

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
gotta look at it and how often do you

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.520 
gotta look at it and how often do you
use<00:03:48.520> it<00:03:48.790> but<00:03:49.060> when<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.540> need<00:03:50.140> it<00:03:50.290> that's<00:03:50.350> a

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
use it but when you need it that's a

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.190 
use it but when you need it that's a
great<00:03:50.770> idea

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
great idea

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.750 
great idea
excellent<00:03:53.200> idea<00:03:53.709> overall<00:03:54.630> it's<00:03:55.630> fairly<00:03:56.230> clean

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.979 

even<00:04:00.760> though<00:04:00.820> it's<00:04:00.940> outside<00:04:01.360> we<00:04:01.600> cleaned<00:04:01.870> it

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
even though it's outside we cleaned it

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.890 
even though it's outside we cleaned it
up

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
up

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.120 
up

some of the worst crap I've seen it's a
brown<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.570> pull<00:04:49.570> out<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.870> magnetic<00:04:50.169> dipstick

brown and pull out the magnetic dipstick
and<00:04:50.830> it's<00:04:51.070> pretty<00:04:51.250> fuzzy<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:53.050> doesn't

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
and it's pretty fuzzy so it doesn't

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.020 
and it's pretty fuzzy so it doesn't
necessarily<00:04:54.130> mean<00:04:54.250> it's<00:04:54.370> bad<00:04:54.550> I've<00:04:54.850> just

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
necessarily mean it's bad I've just

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.790 
necessarily mean it's bad I've just
never<00:04:55.210> pulled<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.600> dipstick<00:04:55.960> for<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.289> long<00:04:56.500> long
