00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
you the controls not going to worry

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.670 
you the controls not going to worry
about<00:03:27.000> all<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.300> defenders<00:03:28.110> getting<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.560> way

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
about all the defenders getting the way

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:37.600 
about all the defenders getting the way
because<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.040> generally<00:03:29.370> use<00:03:30.530> one<00:03:31.530> hand<00:03:36.320> alright

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
because I generally use one hand alright

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.480 
because I generally use one hand alright
so<00:03:38.610> basically<00:03:39.380> over<00:03:40.380> here<00:03:40.620> it's<00:03:41.130> how<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.280> move

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
so basically over here it's how you move

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.180 
so basically over here it's how you move
it<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:42.240> not<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> 360-degree<00:03:43.380> analog<00:03:43.830> stick<00:03:44.040> it

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
it is not a 360-degree analog stick it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.180 
it is not a 360-degree analog stick it
is<00:03:44.280> an<00:03:44.400> eight<00:03:45.020> side<00:03:46.020> still<00:03:46.410> want<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.040> you've

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
is an eight side still want so you've

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.600 
is an eight side still want so you've
got<00:03:47.220> all<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.910> corners<00:03:48.270> and<00:03:48.680> up<00:03:49.680> down<00:03:50.220> left

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
got all the corners and up down left

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.270 
got all the corners and up down left
right<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.770> not<00:03:52.770> a<00:03:52.800> full<00:03:53.220> circle<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:55.470> basically

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
right I not a full circle so basically

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.670 
right I not a full circle so basically
if<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.570> red<00:03:57.750> arrow<00:03:57.960> punch<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.500> guy<00:03:58.530> who

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
if the the red arrow punch the guy who

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.940 
if the the red arrow punch the guy who
is<00:03:58.890> moving<00:03:59.040> who<00:03:59.970> has<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.270> ball<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.680> use

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
is moving who has the ball so you use

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.070 
is moving who has the ball so you use
that<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.310> move<00:04:02.460> uh<00:04:04.940> if<00:04:05.940> you're<00:04:06.300> on<00:04:06.420> defense<00:04:06.600> you

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
that to move uh if you're on defense you

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.120 
that to move uh if you're on defense you
can<00:04:07.260> hold<00:04:07.680> down<00:04:07.920> be<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:09.720> call<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.740> an<00:04:10.860> extra

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
can hold down be to call in an extra

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.030 
can hold down be to call in an extra
defender<00:04:11.840> um<00:04:14.270> so<00:04:15.270> obviously<00:04:15.930> if<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.770> probably

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
defender um so obviously if you probably

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.150 
defender um so obviously if you probably
haven't<00:04:17.190> figure<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.489> out<00:04:17.580> B<00:04:18.510> is<00:04:18.810> passed<00:04:19.940> and<00:04:22.160> so

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
haven't figure it out B is passed and so

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.430 
haven't figure it out B is passed and so
he<00:04:23.400> goes<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.610> get<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:23.970> ball<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:25.140> then<00:04:25.320> you

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
he goes and get the ball and then you

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.840 
he goes and get the ball and then you
can<00:04:25.590> tap<00:04:25.890> me<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.400> pass<00:04:27.380> which<00:04:28.380> so<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:28.950> can<00:04:29.100> tap

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
can tap me to pass which so you can tap

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.590 
can tap me to pass which so you can tap
be<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.450> pass<00:04:30.660> or<00:04:31.260> you<00:04:32.250> can<00:04:32.400> hold<00:04:32.820> me<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.420> do<00:04:33.570> a
