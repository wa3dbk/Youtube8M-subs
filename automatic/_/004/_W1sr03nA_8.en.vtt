00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
start to like watching Novak Djokovic

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.359 
start to like watching Novak Djokovic
because<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> transformation<00:01:49.680> for

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
because I think the transformation for

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:50.749 
because I think the transformation for
him

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
him

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.120 
him
is<00:01:51.299> most<00:01:51.659> probably<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.320> significant<00:01:53.040> than

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
is most probably more significant than

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.859 
is most probably more significant than
any<00:01:53.310> other<00:01:53.520> transformation<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.659> much

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
any other transformation it's much

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.350 
any other transformation it's much
probably<00:01:55.110> easier<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.979> learn<00:01:56.670> how<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:56.969> volley

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
probably easier to learn how to volley

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.030 
probably easier to learn how to volley
if<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.780> can't<00:01:58.020> volley<00:01:58.320> than<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.829> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
if you can't volley than it is to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.880 
if you can't volley than it is to
suddenly<00:01:59.399> learn<00:01:59.729> how<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.000> how<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.630> go<00:02:01.380> through

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
suddenly learn how to how to go through

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.999 
suddenly learn how to how to go through
bad<00:02:02.280> patches<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.270> tennis<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.350> maybe<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.770> life

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
bad patches in tennis and maybe in life

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.639 
bad patches in tennis and maybe in life
and<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> way<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.479> he's<00:02:06.659> turned<00:02:06.960> his<00:02:07.200> his

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and the way that he's turned his his

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.529 
and the way that he's turned his his
life<00:02:07.890> especially<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.610> tennis<00:02:08.849> life<00:02:09.060> around<00:02:09.300> I

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
life especially is tennis life around I

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.770 
life especially is tennis life around I
think<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.899> remarkable

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
think is remarkable

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.830 
think is remarkable

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.780 
and finally per dingo would like to know
who<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.590> best<00:02:14.770> opponent<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.490> have<00:02:15.520> ever

I'm so thankful to for Andres a nice guy

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.640 
I'm so thankful to for Andres a nice guy
and<00:02:40.180> he<00:02:40.270> threw<00:02:40.510> me<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.720> couple<00:02:40.990> of<00:02:41.080> bones<00:02:41.260> and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
and he threw me a couple of bones and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.890 
and he threw me a couple of bones and
gave<00:02:41.860> me<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> few<00:02:42.190> games<00:02:42.310> but<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:43.030> realized<00:02:43.660> then

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
gave me a few games but I realized then

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.790 
gave me a few games but I realized then
that<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.550> have<00:02:45.550> no<00:02:45.790> business<00:02:46.020> trying<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.350> get<00:02:47.680> to

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
that I have no business trying to get to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.620 
that I have no business trying to get to
the<00:02:47.890> top<00:02:48.070> of<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.280> game<00:02:48.430> they're<00:02:48.700> just<00:02:48.970> too

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
the top of the game they're just too

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.810 
the top of the game they're just too
good<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.260> think<00:02:50.500> Andre<00:02:50.739> Agassi<00:02:51.190> at<00:02:51.340> his<00:02:51.520> best

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
good so I think Andre Agassi at his best

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.479 
good so I think Andre Agassi at his best
was<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.450> best<00:02:52.720> opponent<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.170> ever<00:02:53.320> faced<00:02:53.590> even

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
was the best opponent I ever faced even

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.740 
was the best opponent I ever faced even

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
sometimes John McEnroe obviously beat me

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.229 
sometimes John McEnroe obviously beat me
really<00:02:59.080> badly<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.590> few<00:02:59.890> times<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.400> then<00:03:00.970> the
