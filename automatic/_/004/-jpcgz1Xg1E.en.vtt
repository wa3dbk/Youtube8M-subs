00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.380 
he started hunching up but he stood
there<00:02:29.410> for<00:02:29.590> several<00:02:29.830> minutes<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.370> guess<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.880> I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
there for several minutes I guess and I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.820 
there for several minutes I guess and I
didn't<00:02:31.630> have<00:02:31.720> another<00:02:31.959> shot<00:02:32.230> he<00:02:32.470> was<00:02:32.590> probably

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
didn't have another shot he was probably

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.400 
didn't have another shot he was probably
out<00:02:33.040> about<00:02:33.220> 50<00:02:33.640> yards<00:02:34.019> couldn't<00:02:35.019> get<00:02:35.140> another

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
out about 50 yards couldn't get another

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.490 
out about 50 yards couldn't get another
shot<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:36.600> he<00:02:37.600> stood<00:02:37.780> there<00:02:37.989> for<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.170> few<00:02:38.320> more

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
shot and he stood there for a few more

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.229 
shot and he stood there for a few more
minutes<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:39.040> slowly<00:02:39.430> walked<00:02:39.760> off<00:02:40.000> I

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
minutes and then slowly walked off I

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.750 
minutes and then slowly walked off I
couldn't<00:02:40.480> believe<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.810> Deardon<00:02:41.019> go<00:02:41.320> down<00:02:41.760> at

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
couldn't believe the Deardon go down at

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.610 
couldn't believe the Deardon go down at
that<00:02:43.090> point<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.570> kind<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.870> got<00:02:44.019> worried<00:02:44.380> am<00:02:44.500> I

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
that point I kind of got worried am I

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.990 
that point I kind of got worried am I
going<00:02:44.830> on<00:02:45.010> what<00:02:45.459> did<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.640> do

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.720 

I<00:02:53.440> was<00:02:54.440> questioning<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.130> shot<00:02:55.370> whether

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
I was questioning the shot whether

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.430 
I was questioning the shot whether
whether<00:02:56.270> it<00:02:56.420> was<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.570> good<00:02:56.780> hit<00:02:56.960> or<00:02:57.110> not<00:02:57.140> because

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
whether it was a good hit or not because

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.110 
whether it was a good hit or not because
the<00:02:57.860> way<00:02:57.980> he<00:02:58.010> walked<00:02:58.400> off<00:02:58.610> we<00:02:58.850> couldn't

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
the way he walked off we couldn't

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.770 
the way he walked off we couldn't
believe<00:02:59.180> he<00:02:59.450> he<00:02:59.750> didn't<00:02:59.960> go<00:03:00.050> down<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:01.600> we<00:03:02.600> got

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
believe he he didn't go down so we got

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.420 
believe he he didn't go down so we got
down<00:03:02.990> out<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.380> stand<00:03:03.650> we<00:03:03.860> reviewed<00:03:04.310> the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
down out of the stand we reviewed the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.400 
down out of the stand we reviewed the
footage<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.910> little<00:03:05.150> bit<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.900> we<00:03:06.080> decided

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
footage a little bit and and we decided

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.920 
footage a little bit and and we decided
it<00:03:06.830> was<00:03:06.920> probably<00:03:07.150> best<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.270> we<00:03:08.480> let<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.780> go

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
it was probably best that we let it go

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.200 
it was probably best that we let it go
overnight
