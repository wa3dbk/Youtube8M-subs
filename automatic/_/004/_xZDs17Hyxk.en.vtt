00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.510
 yo everybody people it's greg 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.080
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.580
 new video on gta 5 and today 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.139
 I will show you that I am going to show you 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.570
 to show something I did not find 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.460
 a long time because I believe I found 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.790
 this morning because before I had not 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.300
 thought 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.020
 and actually it's all about jumping from one 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.330
 building and finally car me it's 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.960
 I will jump from the top of buildings 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:36.059
 I found in the map 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:38.430
 this is the one who is low and the I 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.809
 will jump in car and gcg you go 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.450
 see it will be quite funny because 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.820
 in fact I think it worked already see 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.450
 gta iv but you make it yourself 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.640
 to flatten without breaking your car 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.379
 done while if you jump from the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 car in the air I tried in 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.050
 parachute and ben can be sure she 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.059
 explodes then if you stay in 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.629
 it does not explode so here I am going to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:26.189

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:28.020

 the players are trying this time 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.590

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.280

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.689
 I'm just looking or wrong whether it's 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.909

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:59.180

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.180
