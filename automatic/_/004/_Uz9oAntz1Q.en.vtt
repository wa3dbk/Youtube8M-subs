exciting all those trills and those
notes<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.519> couldn't<00:00:29.849> understand<00:00:30.480> how<00:00:31.170> he

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
notes and I couldn't understand how he

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.760 
notes and I couldn't understand how he
was<00:00:31.769> doing<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.880> made<00:00:33.210> me<00:00:33.710> say<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
was doing that that made me say to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.620 
was doing that that made me say to
myself<00:00:34.980> that's<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.239> want<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.510> play

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
myself that's it I want to play

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.510 
myself that's it I want to play
classical<00:00:36.989> guitar<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.290> wanted<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.890> so

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
classical guitar I wanted to this so

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.490 
classical guitar I wanted to this so
there<00:00:38.670> isn't<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.149> mentioning<00:00:39.930> him<00:00:40.140> Russell

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
there isn't one mentioning him Russell

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.830 
there isn't one mentioning him Russell
is<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.190> he's<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> master<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.690> this

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
is because he's a master in this

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.619 
is because he's a master in this
technique<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.530> way<00:00:43.800> he<00:00:44.309> does<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.940> so

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
technique the way he does it is so

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.709 
technique the way he does it is so
precise<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.620> clear<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.190> even

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
precise and so clear and so even

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.100 
precise and so clear and so even
powerful<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.289> at<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> same<00:00:49.770> time<00:00:50.070> elegant

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
powerful but at the same time elegant

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.930 
powerful but at the same time elegant
he's<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> real<00:00:52.559> master<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.879> think

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
he's a real master in that and I think

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.939 
he's a real master in that and I think
we<00:00:54.239> should<00:00:54.300> take<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.840> example<00:00:55.260> first<00:00:55.710> time

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
we should take this example first time

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.689 
we should take this example first time
I'm<00:00:56.129> learning<00:00:56.699> by<00:00:56.969> myself<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.510> technique<00:00:58.699> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
I'm learning by myself this technique I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.910 
I'm learning by myself this technique I
checked<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.570> Dave<00:01:01.109> Russell's<00:01:01.500> website

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
checked it out on Dave Russell's website

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.210 
checked it out on Dave Russell's website
how<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.870> instead<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.710> thing<00:01:04.979> there

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
how to do it and instead of thing there

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160 
how to do it and instead of thing there
you<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.760> check<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.450> yourself<00:01:06.810> with

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you can check it out for yourself with

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750 
you can check it out for yourself with
the<00:01:07.200> link<00:01:07.500> below<00:01:07.650> I'd<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> point<00:01:08.549> out

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the link below I'd like to point out

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.570 
the link below I'd like to point out
that<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.510> really<00:01:09.990> useful<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.650> master<00:01:11.460> this

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that it is really useful to master this

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.039 
that it is really useful to master this
technique<00:01:11.729> because<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.570> trills

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
technique because I have trills

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.440 
technique because I have trills
everywhere<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.100> Baroque<00:01:14.610> music<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.240> have

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
everywhere in Baroque music you have

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.730 
everywhere in Baroque music you have
true<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.619> every<00:01:17.009> cadence<00:01:17.430> basically<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.560> have

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
true in every cadence basically you have

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.890 
true in every cadence basically you have
throughs<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.520> add<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.659> piece

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
throughs that you can add on the piece

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.530 
throughs that you can add on the piece
and<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.860> reason<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.310> telling<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.270> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and the reason I'm telling you that is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810 
and the reason I'm telling you that is
because<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.049> find<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> lot<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.920> resistance<00:01:26.520> from

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
because I find a lot of resistance from

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.410 
because I find a lot of resistance from
some<00:01:27.030> students<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.170> learn<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:29.220> specific<00:01:30.150> way

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
some students to learn this specific way

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
some students to learn this specific way
of<00:01:30.659> doing<00:01:30.960> truths<00:01:31.229> because<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.920> seems<00:01:32.189> hard<00:01:32.520> in

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
of doing truths because it seems hard in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.880 
of doing truths because it seems hard in
the<00:01:32.729> beginning<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.750> do<00:01:34.110> truths<00:01:34.680> with

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the beginning and you can do truths with

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.740 
the beginning and you can do truths with
slurs<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.869> that's<00:01:36.869> fine<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:38.270> why<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.720> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
slurs and that's fine but why not do it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.460 
slurs and that's fine but why not do it
why<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:40.650> try<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.610> different<00:01:42.180> way<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.899> sounds

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
why not try a different way it sounds

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.230 
why not try a different way it sounds
different<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.130> gives<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.700> different<00:01:44.970> results

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
different it gives you different results

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.190 
different it gives you different results
it<00:01:46.250> gives<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.369> much<00:01:47.579> more<00:01:47.880> flexibility<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.930> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it gives you much more flexibility so I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.889 
it gives you much more flexibility so I
think<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.860> should<00:01:49.890> try<00:01:50.450> harder<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.720> this

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
think we should try harder on this

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.600 
think we should try harder on this
technique<00:01:52.320> all<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:52.770> enough<00:01:53.040> talking<00:01:53.310> let's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
technique all right enough talking let's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.300 
technique all right enough talking let's
do<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
do it

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.550 
do it
all<00:01:55.850> right<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:56.270> that's<00:01:56.450> how<00:01:56.720> we<00:01:56.780> do<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.170> we<00:01:57.530> are

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
all right so that's how we do it we are

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.210 
all right so that's how we do it we are
going<00:01:57.799> to<00:01:57.890> play<00:01:58.040> on<00:01:58.310> our<00:01:58.640> right<00:01:59.240> hand<00:01:59.890> in<00:02:00.890> that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
going to play on our right hand in that

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.969 
going to play on our right hand in that
sequence<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:02.090> fingers<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:03.409> M<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.930> P<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.590> we

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
sequence the fingers a I M and P and we

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.070 
sequence the fingers a I M and P and we
are<00:02:07.070> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.310> use<00:02:07.490> two<00:02:08.060> strings<00:02:08.630> let's<00:02:08.899> say

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
are going to use two strings let's say

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
are going to use two strings let's say
first<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.649> second<00:02:10.310> string<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.000> logic<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.480> up<00:02:11.660> a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
first and second string so logic is up a

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.530 
first and second string so logic is up a
on<00:02:13.100> first<00:02:13.370> string<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:16.370> second<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:19.540> first

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
on first string I one second and first

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.100 
on first string I one second and first
and<00:02:21.850> P<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.150> side

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.740 

okay<00:02:27.110> let's<00:02:27.830> go<00:02:28.040> closer<00:02:28.250> look<00:02:28.550> eight<00:02:29.090> on<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
okay let's go closer look eight on the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.820 
okay let's go closer look eight on the
first<00:02:29.990> string<00:02:30.260> eye<00:02:30.820> on<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.970> siphon<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.830> on

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
first string eye on the siphon and on

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.900 
first string eye on the siphon and on
the<00:02:34.040> first<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.670> P<00:02:35.210> on<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.690> second<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.910> just

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
the first and P on the second and just

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:53.720 
the first and P on the second and just
keep<00:02:38.150> repeating<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.660> very<00:02:39.230> last

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.129 

okay<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:54.790> let's<00:02:55.030> do<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.269> following<00:02:55.629> exercise

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
okay so let's do the following exercise

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.349 
okay so let's do the following exercise
we<00:02:56.709> are<00:02:56.769> going<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:57.010> use<00:02:57.129> only<00:02:57.400> our<00:02:57.790> right<00:02:58.030> hand

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
we are going to use only our right hand

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.170 
we are going to use only our right hand
open<00:02:59.019> strings<00:02:59.349> and<00:02:59.760> we<00:03:00.760> are<00:03:00.790> going<00:03:00.909> to<00:03:00.999> play

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
open strings and we are going to play

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.589 
open strings and we are going to play
three<00:03:02.079> times<00:03:02.109> normal<00:03:02.560> speed<00:03:02.859> and<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:04.329> fourth

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
three times normal speed and the fourth

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.929 
three times normal speed and the fourth
time<00:03:04.900> we<00:03:05.290> play<00:03:05.530> double<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.159> speed<00:03:06.370> all<00:03:06.670> right

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
time we play double the speed all right

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:17.089 
time we play double the speed all right
as<00:03:07.180> follows

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:26.850

just<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:27.950> cup<00:03:28.130> of<00:03:28.250> reminders<00:03:28.849> when<00:03:29.720> we<00:03:29.930> are

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
just a cup of reminders when we are

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.740 
just a cup of reminders when we are
practicing<00:03:30.410> this<00:03:30.739> technique<00:03:30.920> first<00:03:31.670> one<00:03:31.940> keep

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
to the second string go to the third

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.309 
to the second string go to the third
string<00:03:43.910> depending<00:03:44.480> on<00:03:44.599> where<00:03:44.930> you're<00:03:45.110> in<00:03:45.290> the

true but cause your other fingers so
your<00:03:48.769> thumb<00:03:49.640> doesn't<00:03:49.910> have<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.330> travel<00:03:50.599> from

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
your thumb doesn't have to travel from

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.559 
your thumb doesn't have to travel from
here<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.910> here<00:03:53.440> right<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:55.430> last<00:03:55.580> thing<00:03:56.300> I

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
here to here right and the last thing I

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.130 
here to here right and the last thing I
would<00:03:56.690> like<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.319> remember<00:03:57.890> it's<00:03:59.080> try<00:04:00.080> to

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
would like you to remember it's try to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.809 
would like you to remember it's try to
eat<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.560> last<00:04:00.769> note<00:04:01.130> softly<00:04:01.910> don't<00:04:02.690> really

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
eat the last note softly don't really

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.199 
eat the last note softly don't really
smash<00:04:04.819> it<00:04:05.090> as<00:04:05.890> sometimes<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:07.280> happens<00:04:08.030> because

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
smash it as sometimes it happens because

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.229 
smash it as sometimes it happens because
I<00:04:08.769> think<00:04:09.769> because<00:04:10.220> it's<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.549> thumb<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.090> it's

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
I think because it's the thumb and it's

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.360 
I think because it's the thumb and it's
so<00:04:11.450> easy<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:12.080> play<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.319> strong<00:04:12.799> note<00:04:13.010> with<00:04:13.250> the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
so easy to play a strong note with the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.500 
so easy to play a strong note with the
thumb<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:14.230> recent<00:04:15.230> times<00:04:15.440> forget<00:04:15.769> that<00:04:16.510> we

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
thumb and recent times forget that we

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.090 
thumb and recent times forget that we
don't<00:04:17.540> want<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.260> then<00:04:18.410> reason<00:04:18.769> we<00:04:18.919> don't

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
don't want that and then reason we don't

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.159 
don't want that and then reason we don't
want<00:04:19.280> that<00:04:19.489> is<00:04:19.790> because<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.780> nature<00:04:20.989> of

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
want that is because of the nature of

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.120 
want that is because of the nature of
the<00:04:21.440> drill<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:22.010> drill<00:04:22.700> is<00:04:23.090> intended<00:04:23.660> to

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
the drill the drill is intended to

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.490 
the drill the drill is intended to
prolong<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.790> note<00:04:26.000> so<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:28.340> would<00:04:28.580> want<00:04:28.610> some

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
prolong the note so you would want some

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.219 
prolong the note so you would want some
some<00:04:30.500> kind<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:30.830> fade<00:04:31.490> out<00:04:31.520> at<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.330> end<00:04:32.479> you

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
some kind of fade out at the end you

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.320 
some kind of fade out at the end you
don't<00:04:33.380> want<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:34.039> hear<00:04:34.340> like<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:34.940> getting

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
don't want to hear like it getting

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.740 
don't want to hear like it getting
longer

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
longer

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.380 
longer
that's<00:04:36.380> not<00:04:36.620> intention<00:04:37.220> behind<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.640> true<00:04:37.850> with

that's not intention behind it true with

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.480 
that's not intention behind it true with
those<00:04:38.600> things<00:04:38.870> in<00:04:39.050> mind<00:04:39.110> let's<00:04:39.740> practice<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.310> a

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
those things in mind let's practice it a

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.700 
those things in mind let's practice it a
little<00:04:40.729> bit<00:04:40.940> but<00:04:41.780> now<00:04:42.020> we're<00:04:42.260> going<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.500> add

idea<00:05:11.300> here<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.660> do<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.830> same<00:05:13.039> thing<00:05:13.250> we<00:05:13.400> did

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
idea here is do the same thing we did

idea here is do the same thing we did
before<00:05:13.930> but<00:05:14.930> with<00:05:15.919> something<00:05:16.220> that<00:05:16.520> sounds

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
before but with something that sounds

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.379 
before but with something that sounds
more<00:05:17.120> like<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:18.610> trill<00:05:19.610> that<00:05:19.820> you<00:05:19.940> would<00:05:20.180> listen

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
more like a trill that you would listen

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.629

going<00:05:27.289> to<00:05:27.410> do<00:05:27.500> up<00:05:27.680> for<00:05:28.010> the<00:05:28.100> sake<00:05:28.310> of<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.580> time
