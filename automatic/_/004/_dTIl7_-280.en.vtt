00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:03.600
Welcome to Plum Landing.

00:00:08.067 --> 00:00:09.833
Are you earthlings all set?

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:11.767
Are you ready to visit
a far-off world

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:13.433
full of strange
and wondrous things?

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:15.133
(kids cheering)

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.400
Fantastic.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.333
This is so exciting!

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.967
I have this new game tool
I want to test.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:22.133
It's called...

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.567
Drum roll, please.

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:24.567
The Plink.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.600
The what?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.933
Plink.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.433
Short for Plum link.

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:32.167
Because it's a link to me

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:34.933
and because it has
incredible, amazing powers.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:39.500
It can see under, over
and around things.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.467
It has maps and cameras.

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:44.000
It can even fast-forward
through time.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.600
Seriously?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600
You mean if I push
this button, we'll...

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.967
Not now, not now.

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:50.333
Save it for your mission.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.500
A mission?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.667
We get a mission?

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:53.833
Yes.

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:55.300
There are two missions,
actually,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.733
so you'll go in two groups.

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.233
Group number one is...

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:00.367
Brad, Clem and Cooper.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:02.967
(Brad and Clem cheering)

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:04.567
Group 2: Oliver and Gabi.

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:06.033
Sweet.

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.367
So, I'll be sending you
by bubble.

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:11.000
By what?

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:15.267
(kids talking excitedly)

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:16.400
Bye. See you later.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.500
Ta-ta for now.

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:22.933
ALL:
Bye!

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:26.500
(cheering)

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.333
This is awesome.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.333
(screaming)

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.100
I'm not feeling so good.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.200
That was mega super
totally awesome.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.600
Where are we?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.267
A desert?

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:44.900
It looks kind of desert-y.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.967
An Australian desert, maybe?

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:48.333
(beeping)

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:50.233
Hi.

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:51.167
Hi, Plum.

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:52.167
Are we in the desert?

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:54.300
Yep, the Australian desert.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.567
And you'll find your top-secret
mission in that tree.

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.000
(grunting)

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.133
Found it.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:12.567
"Your mission is to..."

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:14.167
Find a lake?

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:17.500
How could we possibly
find a lake in a desert?

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.900
The whole point of deserts is
that they don't have any water.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.700
Well, I can find one no problem.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.633
In <i>Space Beavers vs.
The Thirsty Camel volume 5,</i>

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:31.933
the camel could smell water
from like a mile away.

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:33.400
(sniffing)

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.867
That way.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.167
(panting)

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:49.867
Almost there.

00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:51.300
Almost... there!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.367
Uh, aren't lakes
supposed to have water?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.933
Hang on.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.633
Doesn't that look like
a shoreline?

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:09.633
And see how the ground
is curved?

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:12.933
So maybe this was a lake,
or it will be.

00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:14.567
In the future.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:15.567
(gasps)

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:17.700
Let's try the time-speeder.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.200
Okay, here goes.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.367
CLEM: It's day...

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:23.700
It's night.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.667
It's day.

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:25.800
It's night.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.900
It's working.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.900
It's really speeding up time.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.233
Whoa... this is awesome.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.200
(rumbling overhead)

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200
That better not be thunder.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.533
(rumbling)

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:40.833
(thunder clap)

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:41.967
(screaming)

00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:48.700
You know, I am liking
this Plink.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.133
Look. I was right.

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:52.800
There's our lake.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.367
COOPER: You know, I think
I read somewhere

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:57.300
that it almost never rains
in the desert,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.433
but when it does,
it can flood.

00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:01.567
(screaming)

00:04:01.567 --> 00:04:03.000
Whoa!

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:10.100
The desert is a completely
different place after it rains.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.000
Amazing.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.233
Hey, are those birds?

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:20.867
Can I see the Plink?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.600
It's a pelican.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.000
And he's eating... fish?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.200
And shrimp?

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.467
How did they get into the lake?

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:32.767
It was just sand awhile ago.

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:35.267
Guys, I think the lake
is evaporating.

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:36.767
BRAD: It's what-ing?

00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:38.067
COOPER: Evaporating.

00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:39.800
It's when energy from the sun

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.367
makes water molecules
bounce into the air.

00:04:42.367 --> 00:04:44.233
When enough molecules
get bounced away,

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:45.533
there's no more water.

00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:47.133
We had it on a science test.

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:48.533
Hmm... hey, look.

00:04:48.533 --> 00:04:49.900
Day 90.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.800
We lived through 90 days
in just two minutes.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.033
So in a couple of months,
an entire lake can come and go.

00:04:56.033 --> 00:04:57.700
That's just...

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.233
Wow!

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.633
Let's take a picture
so we can prove we found it.

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:06.700
Yahoo!

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.233
Calling Plum, calling Plum,
come in, Plum.

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:12.400
Mission accomplished.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.433
We found the lake,
though mostly it was me.

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:18.900
You guys are <i>fantastico.</i>

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.000
That was a hard mission
and you did it.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.500
So the time-speeder worked,
you solved the challenge...

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.567
Are you ready to come
back to the ship?

00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:28.100
Uh... no?

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.833
Well, then, stay for a while.

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:30.967
Take more pictures.

00:05:30.967 --> 00:05:32.733
I need some for another game.

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:36.500
Let's see, I need a bilby,
a Thorny Devil, a camel...

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.733
Kangaroo.

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:39.500
Yes. How did you guess?

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:42.133
Stop!

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:43.200
We need your picture!

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.233
Come back!

00:05:44.233 --> 00:05:45.267
Stop!

00:05:45.267 --> 00:05:46.267
Come on!
