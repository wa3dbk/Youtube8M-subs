00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
getting it for 2398 so that's like a

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.520 
getting it for 2398 so that's like a
bomb<00:03:10.250> price<00:03:10.519> so<00:03:10.730> basically<00:03:11.269> this<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.840> this

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
bomb price so basically this and this

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.179 
bomb price so basically this and this
together<00:03:12.769> was<00:03:13.310> 21<00:03:13.909> and<00:03:14.290> 24<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.769> I'm<00:03:16.040> not

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
together was 21 and 24 and I'm not

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.680 
together was 21 and 24 and I'm not
really<00:03:16.310> good<00:03:16.489> at<00:03:16.579> math<00:03:16.819> so<00:03:16.849> that's<00:03:17.299> like<00:03:18.760> 43<00:03:19.760> 44
