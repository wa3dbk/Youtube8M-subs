00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.790
 Evenings today we are going to make 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:08.459
 work began with fd 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.459
 presentation my name is orlando polo 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:14.309
 che and my name is the good ortiz in this 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:18.289
 occasion we are going to solve an exercise in 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.289
 df explaining 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.330
 two numbers if they are ascending or 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.130
 descending good first of all 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.679
 let's add an output object 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.540
 if in which we are going to write always 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.730
 you have to go with quotes at the beginning and 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.769
 with quotation marks at the end it will be written 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.769
 first welcome 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.040
 to the program 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.040
 and we close it with the next meal 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.200
 then another output that is going to 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.180
 indicate that is to start writing 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.100
 the variable plates 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.269
 enter 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.269
 the first value 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.810
 here after I add an offer of 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.119
 reading 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.170
 in which we are going to write the variable 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.170
 in this case it will be 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.560
 and we repeat the case depends the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.750
 variables that we need in this case 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.360
 we need two variables then 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.140
 we do again we add an output and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.520
 we write enter the first value 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.520
 the second value that p 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.400
 we close with quotes 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.960
 then afterwards the same thing an object of 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.320
 reading that will give us the second 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.320
 variable 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.950
 and ready and my partner is going yes 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:56.740
 they will then explain what follows 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.960
 this we insert a decision button 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.390
 where are we going to explain what will be 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.520
 the condition of the variable in this case 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.610
 how do we need it to be ascending or 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.640
 descending then we will place if 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.640
 to 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.100
 younger than you see 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.420
 this is going to be our condition here 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.310
 let's specify to the right if it is 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.900
 truth which is that she is the left 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.900
 that is negative that is false 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.300
 if it is true it will go to the right 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:37.460
 then we insert an exit button 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.460
 and we are going to write 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.000
 with quotation marks 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.380
 two 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.120
 values ​​are ascending 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.720
 with her 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.810
 and if it is negative it is to say that it is greater 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:11.239
 what then? 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.900
 insert an exit button to the part 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.340
 left 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.340
 and we are going to specify 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.730
 the value 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 falling 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.480
 live 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:43.440
 let's check we give play 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.909
 welcome to the program as very well 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.909
 says welcome to the program 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.560
 visit the first value enter the 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.319
 first value 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.319
 so let's do it with 10 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.090
 and ask us to enter the second value 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.980
 let's do it with 11 in this case should 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.800
 appear to be ascending 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.260
 the values are ascending 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.880
 let's try it with a descending value 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.880
 let's run the program 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.430
 let's put 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.430
 9 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.080
 we have the second value, let's put an 8 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:43.440
 the value tells us that it is descending 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.440
 well this was the program thank you very much
