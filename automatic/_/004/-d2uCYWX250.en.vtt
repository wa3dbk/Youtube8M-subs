00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
opinion I think the two basics are the

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.050 
opinion I think the two basics are the
better-looking<00:05:35.190> facial<00:05:36.000> hair<00:05:36.950> structures

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
what I mean by that is I think that the

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.720 
what I mean by that is I think that the
clean-shaven<00:05:41.550> look<00:05:42.410> is<00:05:43.410> just<00:05:43.890> refreshing
