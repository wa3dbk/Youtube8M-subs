finish so it has a more ergonomic feel
in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> hand<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:31.859> hugs<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.340> hand<00:00:32.610> in

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
in the hand so it just hugs your hand in

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.630 
in the hand so it just hugs your hand in
a<00:00:33.390> pretty<00:00:33.630> natural<00:00:34.200> manner<00:00:34.649> whereas<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.489> me

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
a pretty natural manner whereas with me

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.840 
a pretty natural manner whereas with me
as<00:00:35.850> III<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.600> has<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> more<00:00:37.320> flatter<00:00:37.770> design<00:00:38.070> so

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
as III it has a more flatter design so

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.240 
as III it has a more flatter design so
it's<00:00:39.059> not<00:00:39.300> curving<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.020> doesn't<00:00:40.379> quite<00:00:40.649> feel

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it's not curving it doesn't quite feel

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.360 
it's not curving it doesn't quite feel
as<00:00:41.550> organ<00:00:42.270> Amon<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> m9<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.190> still

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
as organ Amon as the m9 but it's still

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.029 
as organ Amon as the m9 but it's still
nice<00:00:44.550> design<00:00:44.879> because<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.320> water<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.920> has

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
nice design because it is a water it has

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.770 
nice design because it is a water it has
a<00:00:47.070> water<00:00:47.340> resistant<00:00:47.850> construction<00:00:48.030> meaning

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
a water resistant construction meaning

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540 
a water resistant construction meaning
that<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.289> could<00:00:49.469> submerge<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.340> it's

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that you could submerge it and it's

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.130 
that you could submerge it and it's
going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.850> safeguarded<00:00:51.449> where's<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> m9
