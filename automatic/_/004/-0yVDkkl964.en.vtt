the<00:01:29.729> diagonal<00:01:30.299> from<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.869> point<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.439> other

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the diagonal from one point to the other

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.679 
the diagonal from one point to the other
you<00:01:32.310> want<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> use<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> pencil<00:01:33.060> or<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.420> chalk

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
you want to use a pencil or a chalk

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
you want to use a pencil or a chalk
marker<00:01:34.049> I'm<00:01:34.140> using<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> pen<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.159> shows

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
marker I'm using a pen just so it shows

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.310 
marker I'm using a pen just so it shows
up<00:01:35.520> better<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.759> camera<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.869> after<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> have

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
up better on camera but after you have

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.350 
up better on camera but after you have
that<00:01:37.530> line<00:01:37.770> put<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> pin<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> other<00:01:38.939> corner

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that line put a pin on the other corner

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.030 
that line put a pin on the other corner
and<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:40.110> you're<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> repeat<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and then you're going to repeat that to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910 
and then you're going to repeat that to
all<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.250> different<00:01:41.640> block<00:01:42.030> units<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.920> then

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
all your different block units and then

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
all your different block units and then
you<00:01:44.100> want<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.610> remember<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.299> quarter<00:01:45.720> inch

to be stopping and cutting your threads
you<00:02:07.500> end<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> long<00:02:08.190> little<00:02:08.580> chain<00:02:08.759> of

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
you end up with a long little chain of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.790 
you end up with a long little chain of
blocks<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.140> simply<00:02:10.440> turn<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
blocks like that then I simply turn it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.130 
blocks like that then I simply turn it
over<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.819> quarter<00:02:12.270> inch<00:02:12.420> line<00:02:12.720> on<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
over and do the quarter inch line on the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.570 
over and do the quarter inch line on the
other

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
out of my line go all the way down you

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.760 
out of my line go all the way down you
want<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.120> stop<00:02:17.360> then<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.900> know<00:02:18.080> reorient<00:02:18.680> the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
want to stop then you know reorient the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.890 
want to stop then you know reorient the
block<00:02:18.980> fix<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.460> up<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.790> guide<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.690> there

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
block fix it up and guide it in there

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.720 
block fix it up and guide it in there
now<00:02:21.800> when<00:02:21.920> you're<00:02:22.040> done<00:02:22.190> with<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.580> can

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
now when you're done with that you can

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.010 
now when you're done with that you can
just<00:02:22.760> snip<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.150> little<00:02:23.480> threads<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.900> are<00:02:23.960> in

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
just snip the little threads that are in

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.990 
just snip the little threads that are in
between<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.680> separate<00:02:25.160> all<00:02:25.190> your<00:02:25.490> units<00:02:25.820> and

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
between and separate all your units and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.450 
between and separate all your units and
it<00:02:26.060> saves<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.390> lot<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.660> time<00:02:27.010> then<00:02:28.010> simply

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
it saves you a lot of time then simply

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.190 
it saves you a lot of time then simply
remove<00:02:28.760> all<00:02:28.940> your<00:02:29.090> pins<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:29.750> we<00:02:29.870> can<00:02:30.020> prepare

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
remove all your pins so we can prepare

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.920 
remove all your pins so we can prepare
these<00:02:30.590> units<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.100> be<00:02:31.130> sliced<00:02:31.520> in<00:02:31.730> half

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
these units to be sliced in half

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.060 
these units to be sliced in half
remember<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.020> place<00:02:33.200> your<00:02:33.410> ruler<00:02:33.530> right<00:02:33.860> on

remember to place your ruler right on
the<00:02:34.190> line<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.520> you<00:02:34.610> traced<00:02:34.880> out<00:02:35.060> earlier<00:02:35.450> and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
the line that you traced out earlier and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.660 
the line that you traced out earlier and
you're<00:02:35.870> going<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.050> slice<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.500> right<00:02:37.220> down<00:02:37.460> that

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
you're going to slice it right down that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.760 
you're going to slice it right down that
diagonal<00:02:38.270> when<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.810> open<00:02:39.110> them<00:02:39.230> up<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.500> see

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
diagonal when you open them up you see

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.410 
diagonal when you open them up you see
you<00:02:39.890> end<00:02:40.040> up<00:02:40.160> with<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.370> half<00:02:40.610> square<00:02:40.880> triangle

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
you end up with a half square triangle

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.910 
you end up with a half square triangle
unit<00:02:41.720> you're<00:02:42.050> going<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> repeat<00:02:42.470> this<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.800> all

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
unit you're going to repeat this to all

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.440 
unit you're going to repeat this to all
your<00:02:43.070> pieces<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.700> remember<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.150> give<00:02:44.270> them<00:02:44.390> a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
your pieces and remember to give them a

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.840 
your pieces and remember to give them a
good<00:02:44.630> press<00:02:44.950> then<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.220> slice<00:02:46.550> off<00:02:46.820> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
good press then you can slice off the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.760 
good press then you can slice off the
little<00:02:47.210> dog<00:02:47.420> ears<00:02:47.750> we<00:02:48.140> want<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.470> work<00:02:48.590> with

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
little dog ears we want to work with

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.310 
little dog ears we want to work with
nice<00:02:49.040> even<00:02:49.370> blocks<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:50.960> can<00:02:51.110> start

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
nice even blocks and then you can start

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.810
