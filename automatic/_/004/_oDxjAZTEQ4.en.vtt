 hi friends how are you today I am going to 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.140
 teach how to make this beautiful candy 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.140
 princesses in the tower 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.140
 let's see what the materials are 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.970
 that we need to remember that I'm going to 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.490
 leave all the figures so you can 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.490
 download below in the description 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.670
 the first thing we're going to do with a little 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.600
 of violet or pink paint the color that 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:53.100
 more we like to paint the cardboard of 10 x 6 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.100
 and the cardboard tube 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.759
 now with a paper circle of 10 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.939
 centimeters let's do the following 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.090
 that we have to make a cut until the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.990
 half 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.740
 we are going to bend it this way 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.740
 to be able to form 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.200
 and we're going to try it on the tube 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.380
 cardboard once the measure is left 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.380
 chosen let's cut the remaining paper 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.530
 now we paste it with a bit of 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.530
 glue for paper 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.079
 now we decorate it with a little shine 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.140
 As you can see, I printed some images 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.140
 a princess a prince and a window 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.609
 what we are going to do is the following 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.579
 we cut the window all over the 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.939
 outline is passing the window of the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.939
 tower 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.009
 once we have the window we are going to 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.009
 paste it in the middle of the cardboard tube 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.590
 now let's cut out the princess by 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:24.360
 the edge but we 're going to make it 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.360
 outline like this 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.070
 it is through this contour that we are going to 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.070
 cut 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.550
 once we have the princess cut 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.550
 We are going to stick it on a piece of cardboard 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.000
 once we have the princess set 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.000
 in the cardboard we will cut it again 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.790
 very well we already have all the parts of 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.329
 the tower with the princess 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.469
 with a cord cited baby quote what more 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:13.560
 you like, let's hit the cone on the 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.480
 cardboard tube first we will stick a 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.319
 end of the tape in the cardboard tube 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.319
 and the other end under the cord 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.090
 now of the cardboard that we had painted 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.090
 let's hit the princess 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.040
 with a little shine we will cover the 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.040
 silicone 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.860
 and right here we will stick the tube 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.860
 paperboard 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.040
 and with a little bit of brightness we'll cover them 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.040
 all the edge of the tower 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.150
 to go finishing we are going to add 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.150
 a few goodies 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.780
 and so is our princess in her tower 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.300
 this is a beautiful candy bar for 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.550
