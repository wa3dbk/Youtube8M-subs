metallic gray accents seen throughout

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.390 
metallic gray accents seen throughout
the<00:00:37.390> front<00:00:37.660> mesh<00:00:37.900> pieces<00:00:38.380> and<00:00:38.620> these<00:00:38.890> teeth

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
the front mesh pieces and these teeth

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.060 
the front mesh pieces and these teeth
like<00:00:39.730> plastics<00:00:40.450> on<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.840> sides<00:00:41.110> in<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.650> way<00:00:41.830> it

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
like plastics on the sides in a way it

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.190 
like plastics on the sides in a way it
does<00:00:42.310> resemble<00:00:42.730> a<00:00:43.000> vampire<00:00:43.510> so<00:00:43.780> I<00:00:43.810> guess<00:00:44.050> the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
does resemble a vampire so I guess the

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.500 
does resemble a vampire so I guess the
name<00:00:44.410> is<00:00:44.740> fitting<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.640> large<00:00:45.850> window<00:00:46.240> on<00:00:46.270> the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
name is fitting the large window on the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.990 
name is fitting the large window on the
side<00:00:46.750> is<00:00:46.990> tinted<00:00:47.410> it<00:00:47.950> looks<00:00:48.160> great<00:00:48.520> regardless

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
side is tinted it looks great regardless

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.360 
side is tinted it looks great regardless
of<00:00:49.210> how<00:00:49.330> much<00:00:49.540> at<00:00:49.810> exposes<00:00:50.530> of<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.890> internals

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
of how much at exposes of the internals

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.180 
of how much at exposes of the internals
but<00:00:51.520> rate<00:00:52.120> max<00:00:52.390> decided<00:00:52.930> to<00:00:53.020> place<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.530> 120

luckily<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:35.349> had<00:03:35.499> one<00:03:35.650> lying<00:03:35.889> around<00:03:36.010> and

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
luckily I had one lying around and

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.849 
luckily I had one lying around and
lastly<00:03:37.209> one<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.689> drive<00:03:37.930> gauge<00:03:38.169> walls<00:03:38.499> was

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
lastly one of the drive gauge walls was

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.429 
lastly one of the drive gauge walls was
bent<00:03:39.219> so<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:40.059> nearest<00:03:40.359> Caddy's<00:03:40.809> fell<00:03:41.109> through

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
bent so the nearest Caddy's fell through

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:42.959 
bent so the nearest Caddy's fell through
and<00:03:41.680> this<00:03:42.069> must<00:03:42.340> have<00:03:42.489> happened<00:03:42.519> during

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:42.969 
and this must have happened during

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.390 
and this must have happened during
production<00:03:43.389> as<00:03:43.930> there's<00:03:44.409> no<00:03:44.680> way<00:03:44.919> this<00:03:45.189> could

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400

have<00:03:45.519> happened<00:03:45.629> during<00:03:46.629> shipment<00:03:47.079> so<00:03:47.739> getting
