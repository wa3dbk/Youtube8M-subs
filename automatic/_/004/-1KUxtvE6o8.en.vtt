00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.069 
getting fish feeding well on the top is
to<00:00:40.710> use<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> food<00:00:41.460> items<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.989> know

to use for the food items and you know
we<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.950> would<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.190> grown<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.670> sort<00:00:45.120> of

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
we we would have grown up on sort of

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.760 
we we would have grown up on sort of
floats<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.539> fishing<00:00:45.809> his<00:00:45.930> Chum<00:00:46.230> mixtures<00:00:46.649> and

you<00:01:42.810> go<00:01:42.960> all<00:01:43.229> small<00:01:43.590> pellets<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.850> then<00:01:45.030> they

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you go all small pellets and then they

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.580 
you go all small pellets and then they
come<00:01:45.270> across<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:45.869> big<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.439> like

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
come across the one big one there like

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.380 
come across the one big one there like
that<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.100> not<00:01:47.670> gonna<00:01:47.850> read<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.210> well

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that so in your not gonna read that well

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.819 
that so in your not gonna read that well
know<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.540> always<00:01:48.780> wanna<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.380> always<00:01:49.619> want<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
know you always wanna you always want a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.410 
know you always wanna you always want a
few<00:01:50.040> big<00:01:50.189> ones<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> guess<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.329> hook

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
few big ones so I guess in for hook

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.050 
few big ones so I guess in for hook
because<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.930> say<00:01:52.110> small<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.740> use<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> big<00:01:53.220> yeah

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
because I say small you use a big yeah

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.050 
because I say small you use a big yeah
so<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.509> would<00:01:55.049> say<00:01:55.350> maybe<00:01:55.880> two<00:01:56.880> or<00:01:57.030> three

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
so I would say maybe two or three

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.330 
so I would say maybe two or three
spoonfuls<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.899> small<00:01:58.409> pellets<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.920> then

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
spoonfuls of small pellets and then

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.190 
spoonfuls of small pellets and then
maybe<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.420> they're<00:02:00.570> within<00:02:00.719> Canterville

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
maybe if they're within Canterville

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.870 
maybe if they're within Canterville
range<00:02:01.380> caterpillar<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.130> few<00:02:02.399> big<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
range caterpillar a few big and so the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.429 
range caterpillar a few big and so the
fish<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.180> coming<00:02:03.210> across<00:02:03.509> rafts<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.170> little

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
fish are coming across rafts or little

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:04.860 
fish are coming across rafts or little
pellets

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
pellets

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.170 
pellets
a<00:02:04.930> little<00:02:05.200> group<00:02:05.620> drifting<00:02:06.010> about<00:02:06.220> then<00:02:07.030> the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
a little group drifting about then the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.300 
a little group drifting about then the
old<00:02:07.330> big<00:02:07.690> pellet<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.350> that<00:02:08.530> they<00:02:08.650> then<00:02:08.979> they're

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
old big pellet so that they then they're

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.370 
old big pellet so that they then they're
not<00:02:09.520> conditioned<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.180> just<00:02:10.750> little<00:02:11.050> pellets

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
not conditioned to just little pellets

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.990 
not conditioned to just little pellets
so<00:02:11.530> mix<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.950> up<00:02:12.070> yeah<00:02:12.400> it's<00:02:12.550> gonna<00:02:12.640> stay<00:02:12.850> in<00:02:12.940> the

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
so mix it up yeah it's gonna stay in the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.880 
so mix it up yeah it's gonna stay in the
same<00:02:13.150> small<00:02:13.390> I'm<00:02:13.720> guessing<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.470> have<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.740> use

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
same small I'm guessing you have to use

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.010 
same small I'm guessing you have to use
a<00:02:14.920> spot<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.310> some<00:02:15.490> sort<00:02:15.730> yeah<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.090> will<00:02:16.780> spot

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
a spot of some sort yeah I will spot

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.020 
a spot of some sort yeah I will spot
them<00:02:17.140> out<00:02:17.320> yeah<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.280> can't<00:02:18.490> cut<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> bottom

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
them out yeah you can't cut the bottom

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.640 
them out yeah you can't cut the bottom
if<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.150> get<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.390> written<00:02:19.630> Tabriz<00:02:20.230> right<00:02:20.470> but

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
if you get the written Tabriz right but

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.140 
if you get the written Tabriz right but
you're<00:02:20.770> often<00:02:20.980> enough<00:02:21.400> capital<00:02:21.700> league<00:02:22.000> and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
you're often enough capital league and

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.580 
you're often enough capital league and
they'll<00:02:22.240> come<00:02:22.570> back<00:02:22.660> in<00:02:22.960> your<00:02:23.080> face<00:02:23.320> so<00:02:23.530> you

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
they'll come back in your face so you

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.520 
they'll come back in your face so you
finally<00:02:24.070> they<00:02:24.640> when<00:02:25.240> they<00:02:25.360> get<00:02:25.510> on<00:02:25.660> then<00:02:25.930> you

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
finally they when they get on then you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.900 
finally they when they get on then you
can<00:02:26.560> get<00:02:26.860> fish<00:02:27.040> beaten<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.400> numbers<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.820> they

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
can get fish beaten in numbers and they

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.710 
can get fish beaten in numbers and they
just<00:02:28.060> keep<00:02:28.270> dropping

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
just keep dropping

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.930 
just keep dropping
oh<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.960> family<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.620> little<00:02:29.860> pellets<00:02:30.040> they<00:02:30.550> they

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
oh I family the little pellets they they

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.420 
oh I family the little pellets they they
get<00:02:31.150> almost<00:02:31.900> wound<00:02:32.140> up<00:02:32.350> by<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.560> these<00:02:32.980> lots<00:02:33.310> of

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
get almost wound up by the these lots of

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.070 
get almost wound up by the these lots of
little<00:02:33.610> food<00:02:33.850> items<00:02:34.270> it's<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.570> tiny<00:02:34.810> fly

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
little food items it's like a tiny fly

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.540 
little food items it's like a tiny fly
hatch<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.770> they<00:02:35.860> spend<00:02:36.070> hours

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
hatch and that and they spend hours

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.310 
hatch and that and they spend hours
looking<00:02:36.760> for<00:02:36.940> them<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.330> some<00:02:37.870> are<00:02:37.990> my<00:02:38.110> best

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
looking for them and some are my best

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.080 
looking for them and some are my best
results<00:02:38.860> as<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.130> said<00:02:39.310> I'm<00:02:39.430> pretty<00:02:39.640> rubbish<00:02:39.880> at

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
results as I said I'm pretty rubbish at

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.400 
results as I said I'm pretty rubbish at
flying<00:02:40.300> fish<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.570> know<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.690> get<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.870> end<00:02:41.140> up<00:02:41.260> all

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
flying fish you know I get I end up all

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.810 
flying fish you know I get I end up all
fingers<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.770> thumbs<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.430> throw<00:02:42.640> in<00:02:42.760> a

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
fingers and thumbs and can throw in a

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.140 
fingers and thumbs and can throw in a
size<00:02:43.030> 10<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.660> but<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.860> find<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.490> that<00:02:45.940> gives

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
size 10 and but I find that that gives

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.050 
size 10 and but I find that that gives
me<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.360> best<00:02:46.540> opportunity<00:02:47.370> din<00:02:48.400> you're

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
me the best opportunity din you're

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.730 
me the best opportunity din you're
saying<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.690> go<00:02:49.900> down<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.290> small<00:02:50.530> pile

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
saying that go down to a small pile

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.410 
saying that go down to a small pile
that's<00:02:50.890> all<00:02:51.010> use<00:02:51.460> a<00:02:51.490> mixture<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:51.970> pellets<00:02:52.270> with

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
that's all use a mixture of pellets with

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.150 
that's all use a mixture of pellets with
a<00:02:52.450> lot<00:02:52.630> small<00:02:52.870> pellets<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.530> ya<00:02:53.740> can<00:02:54.010> give

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
a lot small pellets in that ya can give

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.100 
a lot small pellets in that ya can give
you<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.310> real<00:02:54.520> good<00:02:54.550> edge<00:02:54.910> -<00:02:55.180> yeah<00:02:55.330> absolutely

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
you a real good edge - yeah absolutely

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.510 
you a real good edge - yeah absolutely
and<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.530> other<00:02:56.650> thing<00:02:56.740> about<00:02:56.920> small<00:02:57.160> pellets

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
and the other thing about small pellets

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.280 
and the other thing about small pellets
which<00:02:57.670> may<00:02:58.090> be<00:02:58.150> worth<00:02:58.420> throwing<00:02:58.720> in<00:02:58.930> here<00:02:59.080> is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
which may be worth throwing in here is

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.170 
which may be worth throwing in here is
that<00:02:59.320> they're<00:02:59.920> not<00:03:00.190> quite<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:00.520> easy<00:03:00.850> for<00:03:01.090> the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
that they're not quite so easy for the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.760 
that they're not quite so easy for the
birds<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.600> pickle<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.020> was<00:03:02.170> going<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.440> mention

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
birds to pickle I was going to mention

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.200 
birds to pickle I was going to mention
the<00:03:02.860> bits<00:03:03.160> how<00:03:03.310> do<00:03:03.370> they<00:03:03.580> find<00:03:03.820> them

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
the bits how do they find them
