00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello dear friends bite and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.349
 end and simply unbearable heat 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.870
 because we will certainly make lemonade 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.429
 not even lemonade but practically 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.920
 non-alcoholic mojito is free only 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.920
 therefore it will be very helpful and 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.269
 so for our lemonade we need 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.349
 just one lime 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.800
 but you can take the usual yellow lemon 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.200
 a handful of mint some honey water and 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.860
 a bottle is good if you have 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.770
 glass like me here I have 750 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.190
 milliliters fit in principle 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.360
 concentration you can do what 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:57.180
 want we need to chop everything up so 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:01:00.359
 small enough for our practice to give 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.390
 we have more of our juice and vitaminch of 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.860
 I washed it because I 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.200
 I'm cutting along I will say but if suddenly you 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.470
 afraid that there is something terrible and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.960
 terrible if you think it handles 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.610
 this fruit thats just peel it and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.070
 you will be calm 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.530
 meat, too, try to chop up like 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.060
 can be smaller so she gave it to him 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.070
 more essential oils 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.070
 everyone is now putting it on my bottle 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.740
 you can take an ordinary can of three 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.500
 liter for example now we fill it 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.400
 all by water but first i'm not up to myself 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.899
 top and pour so you can be comfortable 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.060
 to beat and add honey to taste 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:54.890
 you can and sugar well, of course you understand 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.890
 what is honey and how useful is it 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.760
 i add this two teaspoons and you 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:12.970
 whatever you want now close now 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:14.950
 a little stir honey maybe not immediately 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.810
 dissolve but we still will 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.260
 keep pushing for a few 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:29.380
 hours or at night do not worry all 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:34.750
 fits well now topping up the water 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:38.590
 up to the top can be left in the fridge 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.650
 insist in general our lemonade will 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.510
 soon ready i wish you a nice 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.709
 enjoy your appetite in the summer and calm 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.459
 survive and fat 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.459
 bye myself 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.310
 I forgot to say that I use drinking 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.110
 good water not from the tap of course and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.689
 she's cold nothing to heat there 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.530
 you can not boil anything just I'm raw 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:09.200
 spring water will be perfect 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.480
 my lemonade will be ready in a couple 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.640
 hours it will be possible to get to escape from 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.010
 heat and improve their health 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.500
 because such a sweet and sour water 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.260
 cleans blood vessels rejuvenates and generally 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.069
 helps to cleanse the body very well 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.639
 that stay healthy and happy and 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.090
 enjoy the summer 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.090
 until
