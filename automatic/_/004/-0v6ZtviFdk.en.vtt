00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.480 
other concealer I've used because every
concealer<00:07:07.930> goes<00:07:08.380> under<00:07:08.980> my<00:07:09.100> lines<00:07:09.310> and

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
concealer goes under my lines and

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.010 
concealer goes under my lines and
wrinkles<00:07:09.790> and<00:07:09.970> during<00:07:10.270> the<00:07:10.360> day<00:07:10.510> I<00:07:10.540> kind<00:07:10.870> of

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
wrinkles and during the day I kind of

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.690 
wrinkles and during the day I kind of
have<00:07:11.170> to<00:07:11.320> go<00:07:11.440> like<00:07:11.650> this<00:07:11.680> because<00:07:12.460> they'll

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700 
have to go like this because they'll

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.850 
have to go like this because they'll
start<00:07:12.970> forming<00:07:13.240> these<00:07:13.390> little<00:07:13.720> lines<00:07:13.930> and<00:07:14.380> I

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:14.860 
start forming these little lines and I

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.590 
start forming these little lines and I
have<00:07:15.070> to<00:07:15.220> kind<00:07:15.430> of<00:07:15.490> roll<00:07:15.670> like<00:07:15.880> this<00:07:16.060> to<00:07:16.450> get

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
have to kind of roll like this to get

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.210 
have to kind of roll like this to get
rid<00:07:16.780> of<00:07:16.810> them<00:07:17.050> so<00:07:17.410> I'm<00:07:17.590> not<00:07:17.740> going<00:07:17.920> to<00:07:18.010> give<00:07:18.130> it

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.220 
rid of them so I'm not going to give it

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.450 
rid of them so I'm not going to give it
a<00:07:18.280> name<00:07:18.660> yeah<00:07:19.660> I'm<00:07:20.650> not<00:07:20.890> gonna<00:07:21.040> give<00:07:21.250> it<00:07:21.280> a

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
a name yeah I'm not gonna give it a

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.130 
a name yeah I'm not gonna give it a
negative<00:07:21.940> review<00:07:22.150> for<00:07:22.450> that<00:07:22.600> so<00:07:22.840> I<00:07:23.020> would

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
negative review for that so I would

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
negative review for that so I would
probably<00:07:23.320> give<00:07:23.620> this<00:07:23.770> pen

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 
probably give this pen

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.760 
probably give this pen
maybe<00:07:24.370> a<00:07:24.490> four-star<00:07:25.150> just<00:07:25.990> for<00:07:26.260> the<00:07:26.350> fact<00:07:26.590> that

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:26.770 
maybe a four-star just for the fact that

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.250 
maybe a four-star just for the fact that
it's<00:07:26.980> very<00:07:27.340> nice<00:07:27.880> and<00:07:28.120> creamy<00:07:28.480> matte<00:07:28.720> finish

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:29.260 
it's very nice and creamy matte finish

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.950 
it's very nice and creamy matte finish
so<00:07:29.740> convenience<00:07:30.570> probably<00:07:31.570> going<00:07:31.780> to<00:07:31.840> be<00:07:31.930> a

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 
so convenience probably going to be a

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.900 
so convenience probably going to be a
three<00:07:32.380> to<00:07:32.500> four<00:07:32.680> star<00:07:33.040> because<00:07:33.430> it<00:07:33.580> gets

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:33.910 
three to four star because it gets

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.060 
three to four star because it gets
knocked<00:07:34.270> down<00:07:34.780> to<00:07:35.200> the<00:07:35.320> three<00:07:35.650> a<00:07:35.680> little<00:07:35.950> bit

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
knocked down to the three a little bit

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.650 
knocked down to the three a little bit
because<00:07:36.220> of<00:07:36.370> the<00:07:36.520> sharpening<00:07:37.150> issue<00:07:37.330> I<00:07:37.510> just

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:37.660 
because of the sharpening issue I just

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.480 
because of the sharpening issue I just
don't<00:07:38.110> think<00:07:38.410> I<00:07:38.590> think<00:07:39.010> this<00:07:39.100> could<00:07:39.250> have<00:07:39.370> been

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.490 
don't think I think this could have been

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.610 
don't think I think this could have been
formulated<00:07:39.790> a<00:07:40.210> little<00:07:40.540> bit<00:07:40.660> better<00:07:40.840> so<00:07:41.470> that

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.620 
formulated a little bit better so that

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.650 
formulated a little bit better so that
when<00:07:41.740> I<00:07:41.770> stick<00:07:42.130> it<00:07:42.250> into<00:07:42.400> that<00:07:42.550> sharpener<00:07:43.150> it's

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:43.660 
when I stick it into that sharpener it's

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.280 
when I stick it into that sharpener it's
nice<00:07:44.050> smooth<00:07:44.620> easy<00:07:45.070> kind<00:07:45.880> of<00:07:46.000> sharpen<00:07:46.570> and<00:07:46.900> I

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.290 
nice smooth easy kind of sharpen and I

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.350 
nice smooth easy kind of sharpen and I
don't<00:07:47.350> stress<00:07:47.980> about<00:07:48.040> breaking<00:07:48.910> the<00:07:49.000> tip<00:07:49.210> off

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 
don't stress about breaking the tip off

don't stress about breaking the tip off
