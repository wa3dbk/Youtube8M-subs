getting<00:00:53.100> 25<00:00:53.520> grams<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.879> protein<00:00:53.940> from<00:00:54.300> whey

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
getting 25 grams of protein from whey

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660 
getting 25 grams of protein from whey
protein<00:00:55.050> powder<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.410> 25<00:00:56.190> grams<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.610> protein

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
protein powder and 25 grams of protein

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
protein powder and 25 grams of protein
from<00:00:57.449> chicken<00:00:57.960> breast<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.350> there<00:00:58.500> any

crack back there I wouldn't get all of

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.810 
crack back there I wouldn't get all of
your<00:01:33.509> protein<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:34.140> from<00:01:34.799> powders<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.549> would

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
your protein from from powders I would
