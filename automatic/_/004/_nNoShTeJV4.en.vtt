think<00:01:50.450> that's<00:01:50.750> pretty<00:01:50.930> cool<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.890> next<00:01:52.159> house

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
think that's pretty cool the next house

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.010 
think that's pretty cool the next house
we're<00:01:52.580> looking<00:01:52.820> at<00:01:52.940> is<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.360> cobblestone

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
we're looking at is the cobblestone

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.990 
we're looking at is the cobblestone
house<00:01:54.260> so<00:01:54.500> again<00:01:54.770> it's<00:01:54.980> the<00:01:55.100> same<00:01:55.130> recipe<00:01:55.520> but

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
house so again it's the same recipe but

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.910 
house so again it's the same recipe but
switch<00:01:56.300> out<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.690> blocks<00:01:56.990> for<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.380> cobblestone

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
switch out the blocks for a cobblestone

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.219 
switch out the blocks for a cobblestone
and<00:01:58.190> what<00:01:58.760> you<00:01:58.850> do<00:01:58.970> again<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.600> get<00:01:59.810> your<00:01:59.900> into

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
and what you do again is get your into

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.469 
and what you do again is get your into
stuff<00:02:00.470> and<00:02:00.650> one<00:02:01.159> you<00:02:01.460> go<00:02:01.640> self<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:02.090> cobblestone

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
stuff and one you go self a cobblestone

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.500 
stuff and one you go self a cobblestone

basically I made mine in amount and so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.280 
basically I made mine in amount and so
I'm<00:02:20.240> just<00:02:20.360> going<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.570> get<00:02:20.720> rid<00:02:20.840> of<00:02:20.870> those<00:02:21.050> but

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
I'm just going to get rid of those but

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.170 
I'm just going to get rid of those but
you<00:02:21.380> see<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.710> basic<00:02:22.070> promise<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.820> got<00:02:23.030> some

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
you see the basic promise it's got some

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.790 
you see the basic promise it's got some
ladders<00:02:23.510> down<00:02:23.660> it's<00:02:24.110> got<00:02:24.230> some<00:02:24.440> wire<00:02:24.590> it's

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
ladders down it's got some wire it's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.980 
ladders down it's got some wire it's
pretty<00:02:25.190> deep<00:02:25.370> actually<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.060> realize<00:02:26.660> how<00:02:26.810> deep

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
pretty deep actually I realize how deep

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.020 
pretty deep actually I realize how deep
that<00:02:27.200> was<00:02:27.350> but<00:02:27.980> yeah<00:02:28.310> it's<00:02:28.490> got<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.640> ladder<00:02:28.820> for

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
that was but yeah it's got a ladder for

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.090 
that was but yeah it's got a ladder for
you<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.210> climb<00:02:29.390> out<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.630> when<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.560> get<00:02:30.740> bored

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
you to climb out of when you get bored

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.880 
you to climb out of when you get bored
and<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.970> reckon<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.450> would<00:02:32.600> be<00:02:32.690> great<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.710> do

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
and I reckon this would be great to do

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.230 
and I reckon this would be great to do
if<00:02:34.250> you're<00:02:34.400> travelling<00:02:34.790> around<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
if you're travelling around in the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.060 
if you're travelling around in the
desert<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.840> don't<00:02:36.050> have<00:02:36.140> any<00:02:36.320> water<00:02:36.530> so

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
desert and you don't have any water so

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.980 
desert and you don't have any water so
yeah<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.340> think<00:02:37.520> that's<00:02:37.790> pretty<00:02:37.970> cool<00:02:38.270> and

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
yeah I think that's pretty cool and

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.930 
yeah I think that's pretty cool and
we're<00:02:39.260> moving<00:02:39.410> on<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.890> next<00:02:40.010> one<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.760> the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
we're moving on to the next one so the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.000 
we're moving on to the next one so the
next<00:02:41.120> thing<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.420> we<00:02:41.720> are<00:02:41.750> looking<00:02:41.960> at<00:02:42.260> is<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
next thing that we are looking at is the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.660 
next thing that we are looking at is the
tent<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.670> this<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.270> a<00:02:44.300> crafting<00:02:44.810> recipe<00:02:45.490> so<00:02:46.490> as

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
tent and this is a crafting recipe so as

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.160 
tent and this is a crafting recipe so as
you<00:02:46.820> can<00:02:46.970> see<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.270> is<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.390> bit<00:02:47.660> different<00:02:47.870> from

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
you can see it is a bit different from

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.350 
you can see it is a bit different from
the<00:02:48.410> houses<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:49.490> all<00:02:49.580> we<00:02:49.700> got<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.940> do<00:02:50.060> is

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
the houses and all we got to do is

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.910 
the houses and all we got to do is
right-click<00:02:50.570> on<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.990> block<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.620> makes

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
right-click on the block and this makes

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.390 
right-click on the block and this makes
us<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.160> small<00:02:52.610> but<00:02:53.030> awesome<00:02:53.270> tent<00:02:54.010> with<00:02:55.010> a

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
couple of bits in the only thing I don't

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.960

this I think this is probably the best
house<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:51.350> far<00:03:51.620> but<00:03:52.160> then<00:03:52.310> again<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.790> think

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
house so far but then again I think

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.530
