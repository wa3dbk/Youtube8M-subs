00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.070
 Hello my name is Nikolai today I 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.930
 I'll tell you about the mk-150 microphone from the company 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.050
 Sven here so he looks like you see 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.890
 mk-150 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:32.550
 from the firm the light is longtime cheap 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.520
 microphone why did i buy it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.790
 i have jenius but candy seems so 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.850
 he is called first in the household by 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.940
 goodbye microphone will be but 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.090
 and I was attracted by its characteristics here 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.789
 my microphone is jenius 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:59.430
 01 c he has a frequency range from 100 to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.960
 10,000 at the microphone swine frequency range 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.850
 from 50 to 16,000 one and a half times better 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.420
 frequency range sensitivity 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.420
 about the same with their own 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.430
 open this mic wonderful 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.880
 inside 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:25.860
 warranty card instructions instructions 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.630
 No behavior that I want well 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.750
 not really, but thatâ€™s how it looks 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.490
 microphone is it pretty small if 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.579
 compare 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.700
 palms come down with this little how 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.330
 microphone 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.149
 but what's the plus point of this pickup to the world 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.920
 the fact that he is so taken out and 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.009
 inserted into the mount before fixing it 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.520
 can be fixed on the table food for example 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.759
 or on the monitor 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.340
 fasten and sticky can always 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.890
 pick him up from there again 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.080
 hang it yourself and paste it back 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.250
 convenient though of course you see that 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.870
 much more than this one 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.180
 more than my mother hid my service 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.519
 little brother is getting married 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.950
 what do we do a little test 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.330
 actually I want to compare medium-sized 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.870
 characteristics really 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.209
 aluminum for wives frequencies higher for 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.959
 this i now got my sound 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.790
 This card will turn on both microphones and show 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.680
 you write the spectrum in the program audishin 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.799
 Well for the purity of the experiment, we 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.740
 now we will not keep them evenly 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:47.730
 row near 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.730
 the sound source soup yes it is light 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.650
 microphone James those how long ago to him 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:02.639
 bershad 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:08.849
 right now my microphone is on 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:12.930
 james will now show you the spectrum video 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:17.709
 Now I have an ageless microphone 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.540
 you see how sensitive he is 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.739
 I have noise of course computer from 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:28.780
 system unit and generally now i 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:34.230
 count up to five times two three 4 5 now 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:38.609
 I have a microphone today another microphone 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.609
 the microphone we are testing 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:53.290
 so we see that much more he 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:04:00.370
 catches noise really characteristics 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:03.780
 Do not be silly, count two or three 4 5 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.780
 Now I insert it back. 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:18.100
 Yes, I see that there are two times about two times 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:21.160
 three 4 5 but the sound quality to listen 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.400
 it is necessary but even because what the noise level 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.390
 catches not how he can they really 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.470
 spectrum 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:35.320
 the reflection at the microphone it better Well 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.900
 what else can you say about the microphone color 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:44.290
 he has a cord if you compare your nur and 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.950
 but they are probably the same meter 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.950
 eighty 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.580
 on vuitton 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.590
 of course he was dripping jenius he is stronger on 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.590
 the view seems to be more 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.940
 what else to say about the microphone or not even 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.190
 I know the build quality 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.140
 drawing in principle but Dima stuffing 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.970
 really they are different it is pretty 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:18.570
 I wonder what thank you so much 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:21.140
 all the best and power will be with you 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.140
 microphone
