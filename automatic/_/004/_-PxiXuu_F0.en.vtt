00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.220
EHL lesson number three hundred
twenty seven

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.460
These are our Students:

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.499
They are too young and too beautiful to be
smart and that's why they want to study.

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.989
On this planet, out of seven billion
individuals only a hundred and fifty one million of students

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:19.489
and only a tiny percentage of those will become part of

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:23.390
the Grande Family of the Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne better known as

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.839
EHL.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.009
Here are EHL students:

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.189
while they study they will have to shed
the hip and trendy clothes and put on

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.710
something a little more...

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.760
presentable.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.100
"Mais c'est trop pas la mode à Paris quoi!?!"

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.960
Yes, but this is not Paris this
is Switzerland. Here you will find

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.750
banks, clocks, mountains, chocolates and EHL.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.840
EHL was founded in 1893 by Jacques Tschumi.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.980
The same year, Guy De Maupassant died, Mao Tsé Toung was born

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.580
New Zealand achieve for universal suffrage and the new york stock exchange crash!

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.060
That did not stop people coming to Switzerland for their vacations.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.600
For only there, can you find the world-famous
Swiss sense of hospitality.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.830
The Swiss sense of hospitality is a subset of
"savoir-être":

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.880
the knowledge and practice of rules of
politeness.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.890
Out of seven billion individuals of
which a hundred and fifty one million are students,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.160
only a select few will learn the "savoir-être"

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.440
to become the hospitality leaders of
tomorrow. EHL is not a cooking school!

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.930
It is a management school.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.810
Here students will not learn how to cook tomatoes

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.820
but how to make them attractive for the clients.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.090
Today, EHL teaches over eighteen hundred
students from almost ninety different

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.940
countries how to make tomatoes
attractive and please their clients.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.140
In a hundred and twenty years, EHL have

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.830
trained over twenty five thousand students.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.560
In a hundred and twenty years, The World
has known the liberal, democratic, soviet,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.130
cultural, sexual, February, October, August, spring, jasmine and velvet revolution.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.450
but EHL is still the number one hospitality
management school in the World.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.939
It is not number one for the sake of
being number one...

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.140
It is number one so that you can be number one!

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.140
EHL is your key to hospitality management career! More on GETIN.EHL.EDU
