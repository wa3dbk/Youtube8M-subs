00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
prepare for it I don't think they spent

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.529 
going to get his players thinking they
can<00:01:41.619> run<00:01:41.859> through<00:01:42.069> a<00:01:42.159> wall<00:01:42.399> so<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:42.939> would<00:01:43.209> say

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
can run through a wall so I would say

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.599 
can run through a wall so I would say
it's<00:01:43.869> youngstown<00:01:44.829> state<00:01:44.859> is<00:01:45.189> probably<00:01:45.459> going

it's youngstown state is probably going

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.359

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
to over perform against these d1 teams I

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.419 
to over perform against these d1 teams I
wouldn't<00:01:48.700> be<00:01:48.840> overreact<00:01:49.840> as<00:01:50.109> you<00:01:50.289> said<00:01:50.619> what's

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
wouldn't be overreact as you said what's

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.709 
wouldn't be overreact as you said what's
your<00:01:51.549> second<00:01:51.909> main<00:01:51.999> point<00:01:52.270> about<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.569> game

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
I'd also say that was kind of the

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.029 
I'd also say that was kind of the
perfect<00:01:54.189> storm<00:01:54.549> both<00:01:55.119> weather<00:01:55.389> wise<00:01:55.599> and<00:01:56.170> not

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
perfect storm both weather wise and not

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.349 
perfect storm both weather wise and not
including<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:57.639> weather<00:01:57.819> when<00:01:58.029> he<00:01:58.090> came<00:01:58.209> to

including the weather when he came to

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.940 
including the weather when he came to
this<00:01:58.450> pit<00:01:58.659> Panther<00:01:59.020> team<00:01:59.229> because<00:01:59.560> there<00:01:59.740> was

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
this pit Panther team because there was

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.519 
this pit Panther team because there was
about<00:02:00.819> what<00:02:01.479> about<00:02:01.630> an<00:02:01.719> hour<00:02:01.840> long<00:02:02.109> delay<00:02:02.380> or

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:02.529 
about what about an hour long delay or

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:03.809 
about what about an hour long delay or
more<00:02:02.770> when<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.130> came<00:02:03.249> to<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.459> weather<00:02:03.639> before

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
more when it came to the weather before

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.609 
more when it came to the weather before
the<00:02:04.060> game<00:02:04.209> started<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.779> think<00:02:04.990> everything<00:02:05.469> went

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
the game started I think everything went

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.769 
the game started I think everything went
against<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.099> spit<00:02:06.340> Panther<00:02:06.700> team<00:02:06.880> including

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:07.779 
against the spit Panther team including

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:09.569 
against the spit Panther team including
the opponent<00:02:08.349> as<00:02:08.410> they<00:02:08.530> were<00:02:08.590> preparing<00:02:09.190> for

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.579 
the opponent as they were preparing for

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.190 
the opponent as they were preparing for
this<00:02:09.670> game<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.119> I<00:02:10.479> think<00:02:10.689> what<00:02:10.780> happened<00:02:11.079> also

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
this game and I think what happened also

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.190 
this game and I think what happened also
as<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.500> had<00:02:11.709> Paul<00:02:11.950> Chryst<00:02:12.370> who<00:02:12.849> was<00:02:13.299> again

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
as you had Paul Chryst who was again

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.050 
as you had Paul Chryst who was again
looking<00:02:14.470> at<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.860> cincinnati<00:02:15.400> game<00:02:15.489> with<00:02:15.879> his

a<00:04:57.980> lot<00:04:58.130> to<00:04:58.160> be<00:04:58.340> desired<00:04:58.490> as<00:04:58.910> they<00:04:59.360> look<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.540> make

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
a lot to be desired as they look to make

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.210 
a lot to be desired as they look to make
the<00:04:59.840> change<00:05:00.080> from<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.350> previous<00:05:00.380> regime<00:05:00.890> to

the change from the previous regime to

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.980 
the change from the previous regime to
the<00:05:01.340> new<00:05:01.460> regime<00:05:01.640> and<00:05:01.970> also<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.600> didn't<00:05:02.870> like

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
the new regime and also I didn't like

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.300 
the new regime and also I didn't like
the<00:05:03.110> way<00:05:03.140> sincere<00:05:03.590> he<00:05:03.680> played<00:05:03.890> I've<00:05:04.100> never

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.650 
the way sincere he played I've never
liked<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.669> way<00:05:04.760> Sunseri<00:05:05.240> played<00:05:05.510> the

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
liked the way Sunseri played the

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.540 
liked the way Sunseri played the
quarterback<00:05:06.080> for<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.650> Pitt<00:05:06.860> Panthers<00:05:07.040> and<00:05:07.460> I

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
quarterback for the Pitt Panthers and I

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.430 
quarterback for the Pitt Panthers and I
still<00:05:07.850> don't<00:05:07.970> think<00:05:08.030> he's<00:05:08.300> going<00:05:08.510> to<00:05:08.630> be<00:05:08.750> the

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
still don't think he's going to be the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.650 
still don't think he's going to be the
kind<00:05:09.680> of<00:05:09.800> guy<00:05:09.950> who<00:05:09.980> week<00:05:10.520> in<00:05:10.730> week<00:05:10.940> out<00:05:11.120> can

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
kind of guy who week in week out can

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.540 
kind of guy who week in week out can
complete<00:05:12.020> sixty<00:05:12.470> sixty-five<00:05:12.890> percent<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.460> his

passes<00:05:13.940> in<00:05:14.030> this<00:05:14.150> offense<00:05:14.480> I<00:05:14.660> think<00:05:15.020> in<00:05:15.110> this

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
passes in this offense I think in this

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.840 
passes in this offense I think in this
particular<00:05:15.380> game<00:05:15.860> he<00:05:16.070> very<00:05:16.340> well<00:05:16.430> might<00:05:16.790> I

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
particular game he very well might I

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.159 
particular game he very well might I
think<00:05:17.060> Cincinnati's<00:05:17.540> in<00:05:17.660> some<00:05:17.810> trouble<00:05:18.020> here

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
think Cincinnati's in some trouble here

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.960 
think Cincinnati's in some trouble here
but<00:05:18.710> I<00:05:18.740> also<00:05:18.950> like<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:19.250> Andhra<00:05:19.640> I<00:05:19.700> think<00:05:19.910> it

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
but I also like the Andhra I think it

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.850 
but I also like the Andhra I think it
stays<00:05:20.210> low<00:05:20.360> scoring<00:05:20.660> main<00:05:21.050> point<00:05:21.350> from<00:05:21.530> uvr

Cincinnati's offense is in rebuilding
mode<00:05:58.100> and<00:05:58.340> more<00:05:58.820> importantly<00:05:59.210> their<00:05:59.660> defenses

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
mode and more importantly their defenses

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.140 
mode and more importantly their defenses
was<00:06:00.710> one<00:06:00.919> of<00:06:01.040> the<00:06:01.100> best<00:06:01.310> sure<00:06:01.580> I<00:06:01.700> mean<00:06:02.000> they

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
was one of the best sure I mean they

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.090 
was one of the best sure I mean they
were<00:06:02.210> second<00:06:02.870> in<00:06:02.960> sacks<00:06:03.410> so<00:06:03.710> this<00:06:03.860> is<00:06:03.979> an

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
were second in sacks so this is an

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.130 
were second in sacks so this is an
aggressive<00:06:04.400> defense<00:06:05.120> but<00:06:05.540> I<00:06:05.570> just<00:06:05.840> think<00:06:06.080> we

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
aggressive defense but I just think we

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.900 
aggressive defense but I just think we
shouldn't<00:06:06.470> make<00:06:06.620> too<00:06:06.650> many<00:06:06.979> excuses<00:06:07.250> for<00:06:07.790> his

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:30.949 
going to see a better defensive effort

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:32.739 
going to see a better defensive effort
out<00:06:31.039> of<00:06:31.159> pit<00:06:31.370> and<00:06:31.610> as<00:06:31.999> far<00:06:32.120> as<00:06:32.240> Cincinnati's

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:32.749 
out of pit and as far as Cincinnati's

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:34.119 
out of pit and as far as Cincinnati's
offense<00:06:33.110> is<00:06:33.259> concerned<00:06:33.680> it's<00:06:33.830> going<00:06:33.949> to<00:06:34.009> be<00:06:34.099> a

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129 
offense is concerned it's going to be a

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:36.279 
offense is concerned it's going to be a
work<00:06:34.370> in<00:06:34.520> progress<00:06:34.759> for<00:06:35.180> a<00:06:35.539> couple<00:06:35.870> of<00:06:35.930> weeks<00:06:35.990> i

work in progress for a couple of weeks i

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.659 
work in progress for a couple of weeks i
think<00:06:36.439> that<00:06:36.529> pit<00:06:36.710> defense<00:06:37.099> will<00:06:37.249> clamp<00:06:37.490> down

think that pit defense will clamp down
