00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.870
 two 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.689
 hello youtube friends today I bring you a 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.990
 new video in which I 'm going to show you 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:22.390
 how to install minecraft maps edition 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.119
 9.5 in other versions I say abuse 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.289
 that edition 9.5 since the more bears nothing 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.089
 plus the newest version so far 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.059
 I do not know if they are going to bring cultures 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.730
 versions but procedure is equal to 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.519
 Of course, what they will need is a 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.809
 file compressor or decompressor 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:48.899
 with as it is said I do not know with six in this 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.899
 case I'm using spam is to provide 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:57.440
 we open it and then here I have a map 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:02.780
 can do it from different 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.740
 ways but they are pressed because 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.860
 this one they downloaded will be file like this 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:15.710
 if there are all the maps we are going to give 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:19.880
 extract to go to choose route here seek 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.700
 the computer game folder wetting and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 kraft words are all your maps 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.060
 you are going to what 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.960
 and so they leave it and this sum is already 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.960
 now it is installed 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.490
 let's do I'm going to do a test with 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.490
 activity 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.030
 that is to the minecraft we go to the play 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.409
 and here is the map every epic parkour 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.330
 let's play and this is the map 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.120
 because it appeared 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.120
 the map is removed from your parkour map 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.009
 It can also be from this map 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.280
 but in another good video that has been 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.280
 all 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.070
 that has been all 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.070
 we see in our video
