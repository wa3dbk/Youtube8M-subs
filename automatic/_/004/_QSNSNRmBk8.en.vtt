that<00:00:55.700> and<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.360> front<00:00:56.660> our<00:00:57.020> list<00:00:57.470> it<00:00:58.780> may<00:00:59.780> be<00:00:59.810> a

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
that and the front our list it may be a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.690 
that and the front our list it may be a
wing<00:01:00.140> will<00:01:00.320> help<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:00.770> we<00:01:00.830> just<00:01:00.980> put<00:01:01.160> max

pressure<00:01:02.060> we<00:01:02.690> get<00:01:02.840> more<00:01:02.960> downforce<00:01:03.410> we<00:01:03.620> should

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
pressure we get more downforce we should

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.980 
pressure we get more downforce we should
push<00:01:04.040> harder<00:01:04.400> into<00:01:04.520> the<00:01:04.670> ground<00:01:04.880> lifting<00:01:05.870> our

okay<00:03:55.150> I'll<00:03:55.300> downshift<00:03:55.750> what<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:55.930> break<00:03:56.170> though

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
okay I'll downshift what I break though

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.589 
okay I'll downshift what I break though
that's<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.550> was<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.700> good<00:03:57.850> idea

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.780 

that's<00:04:04.170> all<00:04:04.349> off<00:04:04.439> the<00:04:04.560> ground<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:05.040> don't<00:04:05.310> care<00:04:05.549> I

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
that's all off the ground I don't care I

the instant replay to confirm there you
go<00:04:19.500> it's<00:04:19.739> up<00:04:20.720> take<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.750> picture<00:04:23.150> that<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.479> in<00:04:24.750> the

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
go it's up take a picture that is in the

go it's up take a picture that is in the
air<00:04:25.490> no<00:04:26.490> longer<00:04:26.789> let's<00:04:27.000> fail<00:04:27.180> see<00:04:27.419> just<00:04:27.660> like

air no longer let's fail see just like
that<00:04:27.810> didn't<00:04:28.710> take<00:04:28.800> 45<00:04:29.220> minutes

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
that didn't take 45 minutes

that didn't take 45 minutes
it<00:04:29.880> is<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> wheelie<00:04:30.750> but<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.229> the<00:04:31.350> worst

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
it is a wheelie but it is the worst

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.460 
it is a wheelie but it is the worst

wheelie ever done I'm aware of that but

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.800 
wheelie ever done I'm aware of that but
it<00:04:34.620> counts<00:04:34.770> really<00:04:35.610> what's<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.630> definition

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
it counts really what's the definition

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.589 
it counts really what's the definition
