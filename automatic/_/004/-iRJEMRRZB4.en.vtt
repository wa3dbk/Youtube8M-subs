00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
still 99 percent done because we haven't

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
read that the reason why they kind of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.100 
read that the reason why they kind of
stop<00:00:46.950> negotiating<00:00:47.750> negotiating<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> while

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.010 
think they might move it another month
maybe<00:02:10.679> do<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> next<00:02:11.940> month<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.599> following

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
maybe do the next month the following

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.700 
maybe do the next month the following
one

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
one

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.120 
one
I<00:02:13.800> think<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.310> without<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.030> best<00:02:15.270> choice<00:02:15.780> for

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
I think that without the best choice for

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.730 
I think that without the best choice for
top<00:02:17.130> ranking<00:02:17.610> HBO<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.120> mean<00:02:18.450> right<00:02:19.290> now<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.500> don't

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
top ranking HBO I mean right now I don't

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.470 
top ranking HBO I mean right now I don't
think<00:02:19.890> there's<00:02:20.160> any<00:02:20.310> pay-per-view<00:02:21.000> fight<00:02:21.210> is

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
think there's any pay-per-view fight is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.680 
think there's any pay-per-view fight is
happening<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.020> August<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.760> don't<00:02:24.600> know

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
happening in August so I don't know

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.690 
happening in August so I don't know
we'll<00:02:24.900> see<00:02:24.930> we'll<00:02:25.500> see<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:26.190> would<00:02:26.340> suck<00:02:26.670> to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
we'll see we'll see it would suck to

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.240 
we'll see we'll see it would suck to
have<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.270> pay<00:02:27.450> per<00:02:27.510> view<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.710> pay<00:02:28.890> per<00:02:28.950> view

against<00:02:39.600> showtime<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:42.000> would<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.150> crazy<00:02:42.390> man

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
against showtime that would be crazy man

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.050 
against showtime that would be crazy man
I<00:02:43.140> don't<00:02:43.770> think<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.190> even<00:02:44.340> possible<00:02:44.400> to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
I don't think is that even possible to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.820 
I don't think is that even possible to
pay<00:02:45.210> per<00:02:45.270> view<00:02:45.630> fights<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.170> same<00:02:46.380> day<00:02:46.620> that

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
pay per view fights in the same day that

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.580 
pay per view fights in the same day that
would<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> dumbass<00:02:48.060> move<00:02:48.510> but<00:02:48.840> hopefully

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
would be a dumbass move but hopefully

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.150 
would be a dumbass move but hopefully
hopefully<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.760> doesn't<00:02:50.970> happen<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:52.160> yeah

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
hopefully that doesn't happen and yeah

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.560 
hopefully that doesn't happen and yeah
