00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
just going to follow the edge of the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.380 
just going to follow the edge of the
tree<00:00:22.369> start<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.519> making<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:23.910> triangle

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
tree start with making the one triangle

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.910 
tree start with making the one triangle
and<00:00:25.130> then<00:00:26.130> go<00:00:26.340> around<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> other<00:00:26.849> one<00:00:30.920> stop

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.560 
and then go around the other one stop
there<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.669> always<00:00:32.790> use<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.030> knife<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.300> go

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
there so we can always use a knife to go

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:46.450 
there so we can always use a knife to go
