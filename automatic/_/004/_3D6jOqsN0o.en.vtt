if these methods don't work for you you

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.590 
if these methods don't work for you you
can<00:01:43.080> fold<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> cards<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.950> half<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:45.060> come

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
can fold the cards in half and then come

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690 
can fold the cards in half and then come
to<00:01:45.870> the<00:01:45.960> white<00:01:46.140> board<00:01:46.380> okay<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.400> method

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
to the white board okay for method

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.460 
to the white board okay for method
number<00:01:47.820> one<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.510> this<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.900> will<00:01:49.020> need<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
number one for this you will need to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.800 
number one for this you will need to
warm<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.830> your<00:01:49.979> hot<00:01:50.159> glue<00:01:50.310> gun<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.850> after

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
warm up your hot glue gun and after

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.170 
warm up your hot glue gun and after
cutting<00:01:52.049> out<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.710> frames<00:01:53.040> its<00:01:53.760> we<00:01:54.000> will

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
cutting out all the frames its we will

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.450 
cutting out all the frames its we will
refer<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.990> little<00:01:55.590> white<00:01:55.890> pieces<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.340> go

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
refer to as little white pieces to go

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.030 
refer to as little white pieces to go
around<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> outside<00:01:57.320> you<00:01:58.320> need<00:01:58.470> to<00:01:58.619> take<00:01:58.770> one

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
around the outside you need to take one

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.969 
around the outside you need to take one
of<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.190> quads<00:01:59.430> each<00:01:59.610> set<00:01:59.760> aside<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.860> run<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
of the quads each set aside and run the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.240 
of the quads each set aside and run the
hot<00:02:02.130> glue<00:02:02.369> around<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.170> then<00:02:04.170> spit<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.130> out

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
hot glue around it and then spit it out

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.830 
hot glue around it and then spit it out
if<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.909> time<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.860> put<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.979> frame<00:02:08.220> on

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
if you have time to and put the frame on

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.929 
if you have time to and put the frame on
continue<00:02:09.840> until<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:10.890> all<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.670> frames

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
continue until you have all the frames

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.800 
continue until you have all the frames
attached<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> bottom<00:02:13.439> card<00:02:14.810> method

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
attached to the bottom card method

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.280 
attached to the bottom card method
number<00:02:15.930> two<00:02:16.610> whoops<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.819> ton<00:02:18.209> better<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:19.200> a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
number two whoops a ton better it's a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.610 
number two whoops a ton better it's a
bit<00:02:19.440> stronger<00:02:20.540> takes<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.690> bit<00:02:21.840> more<00:02:21.870> time<00:02:22.050> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
bit stronger takes a bit more time and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.410 
bit stronger takes a bit more time and
it's<00:02:22.830> Messier<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.490> once<00:02:23.970> again<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.390> looks

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
it's Messier but once again it looks

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.830 
it's Messier but once again it looks
much<00:02:25.349> much<00:02:25.950> better<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:27.240> do<00:02:27.420> method<00:02:27.720> number

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
much much better so to do method number

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.720 
much much better so to do method number
two<00:02:28.140> we're<00:02:28.770> going<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.950> be<00:02:29.099> tap<00:02:29.280> hot<00:02:29.459> glue

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
two we're going to be tap hot glue

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.530 
two we're going to be tap hot glue
