them<00:01:55.390> on<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.570> 4.2<00:01:56.020> but<00:01:56.290> across<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> next<00:01:56.830> two

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
them on the 4.2 but across the next two

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.690 
them on the 4.2 but across the next two
and<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.160> half<00:01:57.250> grand<00:01:58.050> wheel<00:01:59.050> design<00:01:59.470> is<00:01:59.700> respect

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
and a half grand wheel design is respect

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.870 
and a half grand wheel design is respect
to<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.030> v10<00:02:01.620> not<00:02:02.620> sure<00:02:02.800> I<00:02:02.830> particularly<00:02:03.730> go

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
to the v10 not sure I particularly go

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.430 
to the v10 not sure I particularly go
for<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.210> either<00:02:04.330> really<00:02:04.750> it's<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:04.900> bit<00:02:05.050> fussy

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
for that either really it's a bit fussy

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.800 
for that either really it's a bit fussy
but<00:02:06.190> they<00:02:06.310> are<00:02:06.430> 19<00:02:06.820> inches<00:02:07.210> front<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.630> rear

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
but they are 19 inches front and rear

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.470 
but they are 19 inches front and rear
bigger<00:02:08.770> than<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.100> v8<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:12.160> aperture<00:02:12.580> here<00:02:13.120> is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
bigger than the v8 this aperture here is

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.270 
bigger than the v8 this aperture here is
quite<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.930> lot<00:02:14.170> wider<00:02:14.410> than<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.739> is<00:02:14.830> on<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> v8

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
quite a lot wider than it is on the v8

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.460 
quite a lot wider than it is on the v8
basically<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.120> get<00:02:16.270> more<00:02:16.450> air<00:02:16.720> into<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.200> bigger

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
basically to get more air into a bigger

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.590 
basically to get more air into a bigger
engine<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.760> get<00:02:18.850> more<00:02:18.940> power<00:02:19.180> out<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.390> it

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
engine so you get more power out of it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.120 
engine so you get more power out of it
partly<00:02:20.050> how<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.260> get<00:02:20.410> more<00:02:20.530> power<00:02:20.680> out<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.890> it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
partly how you get more power out of it

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.630 
partly how you get more power out of it
around<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.150> back<00:02:22.950> few<00:02:23.950> other<00:02:24.100> differences

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
around the back few other differences

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.120 
around the back few other differences
obviously<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.780> oval<00:02:26.200> exhausts<00:02:26.770> they<00:02:26.950> look

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
obviously the oval exhausts they look

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.540 
obviously the oval exhausts they look
quite<00:02:27.280> cool<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.720> diffuser<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.470> bigger<00:02:30.190> it's

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
quite cool the diffuser is bigger it's

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.320 
quite cool the diffuser is bigger it's
deeper<00:02:31.060> basically<00:02:31.750> again<00:02:32.650> cuz<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.910> manage<00:02:34.180> the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
deeper basically again cuz to manage the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.370 
deeper basically again cuz to manage the
air<00:02:34.420> underneath<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.930> car<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.140> bit<00:02:35.260> more

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
air underneath the car a bit more

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.220 
air underneath the car a bit more
efficiently<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.120> as<00:02:37.120> at<00:02:37.270> front<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.810> get<00:02:38.020> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
efficiently and as at front you get the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.729 
efficiently and as at front you get the
nice<00:02:38.739> LED<00:02:39.489> lights<00:02:39.700> again<00:02:40.260> inside<00:02:41.260> we've<00:02:41.709> got

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
nice LED lights again inside we've got

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.490 
nice LED lights again inside we've got
some<00:02:42.070> nice<00:02:42.280> red<00:02:43.030> rims<00:02:43.360> around<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.870> dials<00:02:44.290> to

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
some nice red rims around the dials to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500 
some nice red rims around the dials to
distinguish<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.130> v10<00:02:45.520> we've<00:02:45.730> also<00:02:45.850> got<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> v10

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
distinguish the v10 we've also got a v10

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.050 
distinguish the v10 we've also got a v10
badge<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.200> surprisingly<00:02:47.650> enough<00:02:47.910> only<00:02:48.910> other

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
thing that's different inside here is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.960 
thing that's different inside here is
another<00:02:50.739> little<00:02:50.950> red<00:02:51.220> ring<00:02:51.459> around<00:02:51.610> the

another little red ring around the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.150 
another little red ring around the
caeliar<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.630> other<00:02:52.720> than<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.900> it's<00:02:53.470> exactly

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
caeliar and other than that it's exactly

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.009 
caeliar and other than that it's exactly
as<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> 4.2<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.269> there's<00:02:55.450> nothing<00:02:55.630> wrong<00:02:55.840> with

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
as a 4.2 and there's nothing wrong with

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.259 
as a 4.2 and there's nothing wrong with
that<00:02:56.140> because<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.590> one<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.860> best

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
that because this is one of the best

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:05.330 
that because this is one of the best
supercar<00:02:58.269> in<00:02:58.480> series<00:02:58.840> there<00:02:59.230> is

right behind the wheel of the audi r8
v10<00:03:11.579> first<00:03:12.579> thing<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.849> notice<00:03:13.680> way<00:03:14.680> more<00:03:14.980> than

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
v10 first thing you notice way more than

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.440 
v10 first thing you notice way more than
anything<00:03:15.250> else<00:03:15.489> probably<00:03:15.970> just<00:03:16.120> heard<00:03:16.269> that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
anything else probably just heard that

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.960 
anything else probably just heard that
is<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.900> noise<00:03:17.019> it<00:03:17.379> is<00:03:17.590> absolutely

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
is the noise it is absolutely

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.750 
is the noise it is absolutely
sensational<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.480> it's<00:03:20.349> matched<00:03:20.709> by<00:03:21.099> monster

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
sensational and it's matched by monster

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.589 
sensational and it's matched by monster
performance<00:03:21.909> as<00:03:22.450> well<00:03:22.629> I<00:03:24.209> mean<00:03:25.209> that's<00:03:25.359> just

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
performance as well I mean that's just

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.369 
performance as well I mean that's just
shifting<00:03:25.959> up<00:03:26.129> or<00:03:27.129> house<00:03:27.819> at<00:03:28.030> five<00:03:28.299> it<00:03:29.140> actually

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
shifting up or house at five it actually

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.879 
shifting up or house at five it actually
revs<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:30.519> eight<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.819> half<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:32.230> from<00:03:32.560> six

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
revs to eight and a half and from six

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.460 
revs to eight and a half and from six
all<00:03:33.069> modes<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.370> goes<00:03:33.609> like<00:03:34.049> train<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.260> really

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
all modes it goes like train it really

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.640 
all modes it goes like train it really
does<00:03:35.709> but<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:37.180> thing<00:03:37.480> is<00:03:37.510> not<00:03:37.959> just<00:03:38.409> a

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
does but this thing is not just a

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.490 
does but this thing is not just a
fabulous<00:03:38.950> engine<00:03:39.549> in<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.599> not<00:03:40.750> so<00:03:40.870> fabulous<00:03:41.139> car

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
fabulous engine in a not so fabulous car

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.119 
fabulous engine in a not so fabulous car
I<00:03:41.680> actually<00:03:42.040> think<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.609> rest<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:44.010> well<00:03:45.010> it

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
I actually think the rest of it well it

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.830 
I actually think the rest of it well it
certainly<00:03:45.370> as<00:03:45.609> good<00:03:45.819> as<00:03:45.939> the<00:03:46.060> engine<00:03:46.180> the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
certainly as good as the engine the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.259 
certainly as good as the engine the
chassis<00:03:47.260> itself<00:03:47.590> might<00:03:47.920> even<00:03:48.280> be<00:03:48.700> better<00:03:48.970> than

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
chassis itself might even be better than

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.720 
chassis itself might even be better than
engine<00:03:49.750> yet<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.319> r8<00:03:50.620> was<00:03:50.829> always<00:03:51.069> a<00:03:51.099> fantastic

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
engine yet the r8 was always a fantastic

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.490 
engine yet the r8 was always a fantastic
handling<00:03:52.060> mid-engine<00:03:52.480> car<00:03:52.510> really<00:03:53.170> nicely

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
handling mid-engine car really nicely

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.339

nasty tricks up its sleeve it's just

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.059 
nasty tricks up its sleeve it's just
fantastic<00:04:03.189> the<00:04:03.819> steering<00:04:04.419> is<00:04:04.510> great<00:04:05.069> even

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
fantastic the steering is great even

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.619 
fantastic the steering is great even
this<00:04:06.160> paddle<00:04:06.519> shift<00:04:06.760> gear<00:04:07.030> change<00:04:07.329> which<00:04:07.510> is

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
this paddle shift gear change which is

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.839 
this paddle shift gear change which is
the<00:04:07.720> same<00:04:07.930> as<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.199> Lamborghini<00:04:08.680> gearbox<00:04:09.190> st.

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
the same as the Lamborghini gearbox st.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.539 
the same as the Lamborghini gearbox st.
great<00:04:10.060> in<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.209> Lamborghini<00:04:10.690> but<00:04:10.989> in<00:04:11.109> this

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
great in the Lamborghini but in this

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.640 
great in the Lamborghini but in this
it's<00:04:12.549> much<00:04:12.760> smoother<00:04:13.329> it's<00:04:13.959> actually<00:04:14.230> faster

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
it's much smoother it's actually faster

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.860 
it's much smoother it's actually faster
I<00:04:14.949> think<00:04:15.250> as<00:04:15.370> well

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
I think as well

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.300 
I think as well
if<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.650> write<00:04:17.829> this<00:04:17.949> thing<00:04:18.010> out<00:04:18.370> 10

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
if you to write this thing out 10

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.280 
if you to write this thing out 10
it's<00:04:20.669> at<00:04:20.760> least<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.180> nine<00:04:21.389> it<00:04:21.660> might<00:04:21.989> even<00:04:22.200> be

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
it's at least a nine it might even be

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.480 
it's at least a nine it might even be
nine<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.710> half<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:23.160> think<00:04:23.580> it's<00:04:24.030> fantastic

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
nine and a half I think it's fantastic

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.639 
nine and a half I think it's fantastic
here's<00:04:26.490> why
