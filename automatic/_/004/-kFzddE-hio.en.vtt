planning on bedding him I'm building
Fletcher<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.580> thought<00:02:48.210> we'll<00:02:48.360> probably<00:02:48.540> play

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.330 
Fletcher I thought we'll probably play
around<00:02:48.900> him<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.170> think<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.500> there<00:02:49.650> at<00:02:50.250> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
around him I think it there at the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.910 
around him I think it there at the
moment<00:02:50.460> um<00:02:51.260> he's<00:02:52.260> playing<00:02:52.470> pretty<00:02:52.590> good<00:02:52.680> rugby

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
moment um he's playing pretty good rugby

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.320 
moment um he's playing pretty good rugby
at<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.100> moment<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.610> more<00:02:53.760> we<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:54.030> isolate

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
at the moment so the more we can isolate

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.450 
at the moment so the more we can isolate
those<00:02:54.720> sort<00:02:54.960> of<00:02:55.020> guys<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:56.100> play<00:02:56.310> around

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
those sort of guys and and play around

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.620 
those sort of guys and and play around
the<00:02:56.580> manipulate<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> wee<00:02:57.180> bit<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.360> think<00:02:57.390> we

the manipulate a wee bit I think we

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.730
