00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.710
 well what you have benny again 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.780
 entertain the bar is and should 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.190
 today she is top 5 end it fell 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.350
 we thought so sure now 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.020
 like the gourmet has the server 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.600
 end games and we have the five 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.189
 short and effective fall thought out 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.010
 can always build fast and yes the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.720
 are absolutely deadly 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.489
 The first is a very simple one 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.350
 waterfall you can of course, too 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.579
 with other blocks i want to tell you 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.280
 just go times longer I go 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.860
 Just go in and yes to bank 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.870
 of course, normally and yes 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.360
 Normally people have when they are 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.489
 just have no hit in the water bucket 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.719
 doing so with the water could always 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.010
 which now turn right around that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.649
 to get water away 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.030
 but because the work band opened open 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.860
 the whole time only the workbench 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.149
 and most do not know that one 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.949
 if you can not do it anyway 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.260
 water can turn off as off 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.140
 properties and so on and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.909
 so most are the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.470
 littleness just drown there 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.670
 and yes it was basically that you can do it 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.340
 of course with other blocks 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.659
 do and say easy and is that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.250
 to build whole just to the sea 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.939
 talking and under water on board 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.590
 Of course you can do that very easily 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.900
 the country simply bornemann a hole 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.479
 then digs the workbench is for 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.030
 example so accurately placed and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.030
 to say pure water and over it in the people 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.670
 Let's just grass in management 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.409
 business award absolutely deadly if the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.090
 world now have no mobile phone 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.070
 as I said with the web pages 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.979
 is that an incredibly strong trap 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.170
 because no one understands how you do it 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.119
 must also say to have to bale 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.130
 So you can build fast 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.259
 do not always fall for the trap because you 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.090
 yes is always debated and 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.670
 that's why a few samplers are constantly falling 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.250
 and that falls a complete second 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.390
 fall that is also relatively simple 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.390
 principle, it is the same 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.159
 herne lava and in the back you have one 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.380
 water and here is a quasi eight 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.179
 blocks in between and in the end hears 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.160
 the whole on with the water both the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.019
 water flow stops you then turns 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.910
 quite simply to the edge where have 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.170
 we just put it is clearly 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.480
 I show that in short if you 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.920
 then the people are called for to nod 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.810
 mostly not and then fall through the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.590
 Water flow into the country will not come then 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.450
 more extinct 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.280
 so and now coincidence number three is too 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.140
 very simple that simply submerges 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.900
 my blog so a small excavation 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.390
 So put everything away and put it all away 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.370
 character is of course there then 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.530
 grass spots just optimally upwards 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.230
 So with earth blocks and then the two 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.790
 gone and yes if now a level though 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.440
 you can always have around the lava 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.630
 place and benny then goes fast 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.630
 can run you can turns 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.370
 easy and the lava grid on the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.079
 side down and you said until you 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.670
 is teleported and outside again 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.680
 and the other one will not be able to survive 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.450
 the trap is out and maybe im 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.950
 best fall just still running 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.709
 and sprint and so it runs right in 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.690
 the larvae and dies and if you have the 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.069
 block degrades underneath then comes the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.989
 Just love from the side and if you are 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.359
 that breaks down then comes from the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.299
 downstairs because it is impossible to 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.760
 Escape except me tender beads cars 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.950
 usually no market nor none 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.720
 likely to bubble through the laboratory noted 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:28.069
 to build the trap relatively quickly 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:30.630
 and then we have the fourth case already 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.310
 basically just a hole but 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.829
 is below having a ladder in Leith is 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.450
 quite easy to build with sticks and in 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.730
 principle , you just have to climb one 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.440
 nod and if one is paired simply 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.290
 do not sink anymore and then you fall in 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:50.280
 Laaber so my people did not respond 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.579
 should down more so incurred 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.190
 Now for the last case, I think everyone 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.870
 or the guest quite normal 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.150
 I would improve it a bit 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.849
 just say it by the way 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.970
 does and lies therein and the 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.319
 most of all , of course, of course 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.200
 because you can not do it anymore because you do not 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.600
 is exploited in the end it was the 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.980
 most does not move 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.810
 if they are still on the edge and 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.640
 they can jump because they really have to 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.560
 already be in sprint and so have the 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.000
 do not even fall in the sprint 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.810
 Just drop it off if it's not early 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.370
 get enough and then die 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.990
 but also has to say most know 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.150
 By now you have to train 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.730
 has to rent in the air so you can 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.070
 only half or maximum five years 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.750
 but still gets relative 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.420
 effectively you always get the 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.330
 trap more often included the one 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.890
 or other kids I would too 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.050
 say and that was actually with the 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.950
 top 5 ender games fall yes the 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.420
 conclusion was 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.070
 yes, in any case, all five are 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.050
 were relatively fast to build 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.670
 relatively effective and you can do it 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.930
 try this i want to say 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.820
 if I did we follow you like 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.080
 Sprits wants her lag button on it and 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.080
 We will not even see you then 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.700
 yes yes what are you here benito horns of 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.700
 gamble the basis
