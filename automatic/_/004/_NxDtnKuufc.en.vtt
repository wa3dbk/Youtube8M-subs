horsepower 250 foot-pounds of torque at
1750<00:01:27.689> rpm<00:01:27.719> so<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.499> scoots<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> that's<00:01:29.789> more

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
1750 rpm so it scoots and that's more

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.690 
1750 rpm so it scoots and that's more
than<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.329> 230<00:01:31.229> horsepower<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.219> you<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.490> out

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
than the 230 horsepower that you got out

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
than the 230 horsepower that you got out
of<00:01:32.819> the<00:01:32.909> 6<00:01:33.179> but<00:01:33.719> you<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:33.960> better<00:01:34.079> fuel<00:01:34.229> economy

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
of the 6 but you get better fuel economy

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.059 
of the 6 but you get better fuel economy
12<00:01:35.520> liters<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> hundred<00:01:36.569> in<00:01:36.719> the<00:01:36.810> city<00:01:37.069> 8.4

12 liters to a hundred in the city 8.4
on<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.340> highway

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
on the highway

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.450 
on the highway
now<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.420> question<00:01:40.900> with<00:01:41.050> any<00:01:41.260> SUV<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:41.980> capable

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
now the question with any SUV is capable

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.250 
now the question with any SUV is capable
of<00:01:42.580> this<00:01:42.760> one<00:01:42.970> is<00:01:43.150> does<00:01:43.570> anybody<00:01:43.840> actually

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
of this one is does anybody actually

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.650 
of this one is does anybody actually
take<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:44.860> out<00:01:44.980> and<00:01:45.130> get<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.280> dirty<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:46.450> of

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
take it out and get it dirty and of

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.500 
take it out and get it dirty and of
course<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.990> answer<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.610> probably<00:01:48.610> not<00:01:48.820> but

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
course the answer is probably not but

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.200 
course the answer is probably not but
that's<00:01:49.750> not<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.350> idea<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:51.520> whole<00:01:51.850> thing

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
that's not the idea the whole thing

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.090 
that's not the idea the whole thing
behind<00:01:52.390> Land<00:01:52.900> Rover<00:01:53.260> is<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.530> fact<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:53.920> you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
behind Land Rover is the fact that you

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.340 
behind Land Rover is the fact that you
could<00:01:54.490> if<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:54.940> wanted<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.630> it's<00:01:55.870> got<00:01:56.140> the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
could if you wanted to it's got the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.320 
could if you wanted to it's got the
capability<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.220> that's<00:01:57.520> what<00:01:57.760> people<00:01:57.940> want

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
capability and that's what people want

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.719 
capability and that's what people want
they<00:01:58.540> want<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.870> bragging<00:01:59.380> rights<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.460> when<00:02:00.640> it

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
on the offroad but far more likely to

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.840

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
that we're not going off-road with it

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.550 
that we're not going off-road with it
let's<00:02:30.880> take<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.270> on<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.630> asphalt<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.230> see<00:02:32.380> how

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
let's take it on the asphalt and see how

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.560 
let's take it on the asphalt and see how
it<00:02:32.680> handles<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.550> does<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.880> very<00:02:34.030> well

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
it handles and it does it very well

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.990 
it handles and it does it very well
I<00:02:34.600> like<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.290> smooth<00:02:35.650> steering<00:02:36.220> response<00:02:36.700> it's

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
I like the smooth steering response it's

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.590

sharp

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
sharp

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.010 
sharp
it<00:02:37.770> responds<00:02:38.770> well<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.040> my<00:02:39.370> input<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:40.540> ride<00:02:40.780> is

well the first thing I noticed about it
is<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.680> feels<00:02:56.980> substantial<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.330> doesn't

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
is it feels substantial but it doesn't

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.420 
is it feels substantial but it doesn't
feel<00:02:58.780> heavy<00:02:59.049> you've<00:02:59.920> got<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:00.930> impression<00:03:01.930> in

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
feel heavy you've got this impression in

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.979 
feel heavy you've got this impression in
the<00:03:03.430> undercarriage<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.299> in<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> steering

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
the undercarriage and in the steering

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.590 
the undercarriage and in the steering
that<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.860> certainly<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.790> cousin<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.420> those

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
that this is certainly a cousin to those

well<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.240> idea<00:04:32.570> behind<00:04:32.750> them<00:04:33.200> Land<00:04:33.500> Rover

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.900 
well the idea behind them Land Rover
says<00:04:34.070> is<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.310> when<00:04:34.580> you're<00:04:34.700> driving

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
says is that when you're driving

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.400 
says is that when you're driving
off-road<00:04:35.420> it<00:04:35.780> gives<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.140> better

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
off-road it gives you a better

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.740 
off-road it gives you a better
perspective<00:04:36.830> of<00:04:37.280> where<00:04:37.490> you're<00:04:37.670> going<00:04:37.700> and<00:04:38.240> I

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
have to admit it really does but when

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.170 
have to admit it really does but when
I'm<00:04:42.290> looking<00:04:42.710> forward<00:04:43.220> there's<00:04:43.550> one<00:04:43.880> thing

great in our Canadian climate but it

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.460 
great in our Canadian climate but it
