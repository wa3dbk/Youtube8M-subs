00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.350 
okay so I've linked the headset with my
PC<00:04:49.170> I<00:04:49.380> think<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.130> sound<00:04:50.370> was<00:04:50.460> really<00:04:50.550> good<00:04:50.910> for

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
PC I think the sound was really good for

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.120 
PC I think the sound was really good for
the<00:04:51.420> price<00:04:51.750> especially<00:04:52.110> under<00:04:52.680> 20<00:04:52.980> pounds

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
the price especially under 20 pounds

the price especially under 20 pounds
with<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.400> headset<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.930> background<00:04:55.290> noise

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
with a headset the background noise
