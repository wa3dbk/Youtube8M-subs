00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
a bunch of times I've seen it where the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.940 
a bunch of times I've seen it where the
quarterback<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.390> literally<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> very<00:00:40.739> athletic

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950

defense<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.010> create<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> lot

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
defense out like this you create a lot

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.400 
defense out like this you create a lot
of<00:00:48.480> space<00:00:48.980> between<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.940> tackle<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.230> Z

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
of space between this tackle and this Z

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.529 
of space between this tackle and this Z
receiver<00:00:52.860> where<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> quarterback<00:00:53.730> can

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
receiver where the quarterback can

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.990 
receiver where the quarterback can
easily<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> two-point<00:00:56.370> conversion

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
easily go in on a two-point conversion

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.469 
here but again the best that I've seen
it<00:01:33.689> done<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.200> when<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.500> had<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.280> very<00:01:36.210> athletic

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.160 
it done is when you had a very athletic
quarterback<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.950> would<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:40.140> a
