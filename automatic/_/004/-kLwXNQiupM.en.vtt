00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.059
 the first thing we have to do 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.220
 have our original ice cream system 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.360
 sandwich as we can see in the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.360
 next video 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.970
 as we can see we have there belief 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:34.110
 our mind the one of 705 the next thing that 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 we have to do is 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.630
 to download 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.120
 the system 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:51.140
 official of the GPS 710 scholarship as 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.320
 we can see 10 meca that's the round in 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.489
 the 700 gp that round comes 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.100
 rod already with the unlocked recovery the 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.540
 bootloader we also have four 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.140
 files that we also have to have 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.000
 is the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.190
 file we said in 10 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.720
 Goals Android Apps 4.1.2 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.520
 well I recommend this is custom rom 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.550
 because it's very fluid is faster than 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.560
 those that officially bring the only 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.830
 problem that you have is when you 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.270
 load off is not going to download it and 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.750
 there everything works normally good 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.800
 what we are going to do now is flash 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.700
 the firmware of the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.710
 the 700 gps for our 105 fish what 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.880
 what we have to do is connect it in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.640
 Debug mode and software mode 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.270

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.790
 flashing called 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.530

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.480
 rom 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.999
 good the options that we have to have 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.019
 is three is a type three cross this and 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:47.689

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:53.420
 surrounded with recovery and the bayern of 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.870

 well we put here 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.040
 we put it to open 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.939
 already 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:08.590
 connected to the phone debugging 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.330
 software 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.349
 and we see that the options are fine 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.470
 connected that the 37 dhiac mode we give 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.810
 launch software toy 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.540
 if it will not be able to in emergency mode 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.290
 the phone is not going to drop is something 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.810
 normal good let's hope that a 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.490
 once the application gives you you do not respond 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.090
 but do not worry, do not go to 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:37.560
 close is because later it's going to 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.560
 run normally 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.819
 good now let's pause the video 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.819
 until the application responds
