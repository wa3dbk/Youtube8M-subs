pressure each force divided by area

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.189 
pressure each force divided by area
equated<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> larger<00:00:54.420> contact<00:00:54.870> patch

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
equated so a larger contact patch

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.760 
equated so a larger contact patch
produces<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> smaller<00:00:56.190> pressure<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> snow

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
produces a smaller pressure on the snow

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.080 
produces a smaller pressure on the snow
but<00:00:58.770> how<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.280> an<00:00:59.460> advantage<00:01:01.039> well<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
but how is this an advantage well in the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.410 
but how is this an advantage well in the
case<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.449> deeper<00:01:03.840> snow<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.650> don't<00:01:04.830> want<00:01:05.420> your

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
case of deeper snow you don't want your

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.210 
case of deeper snow you don't want your
tire<00:01:06.720> cutting<00:01:07.200> through<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> snow<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.040> rather

tire cutting through the snow but rather

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.600 
tire cutting through the snow but rather
floating<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.560> narrow<00:01:10.560> tire<00:01:10.950> produces

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
floating on a narrow tire produces

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.050 
floating on a narrow tire produces
greater<00:01:11.880> pressure<00:01:12.270> which<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.409> turn<00:01:14.060> causes

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
greater pressure which in turn causes

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.410 
greater pressure which in turn causes
the<00:01:15.390> tire<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.900> cut<00:01:16.080> through<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> snow<00:01:17.420> there's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the tire to cut through the snow there's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480 
the tire to cut through the snow there's

traction<00:01:25.009> this<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.310> huge<00:01:26.520> advantage<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:27.210> fat

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
an increased footprint on the snow if

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.569 
an increased footprint on the snow if
the<00:01:39.659> snow<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.900> not<00:01:40.140> very<00:01:40.409> deep<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.340> narrow

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the snow is not very deep and the narrow

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.630 
the snow is not very deep and the narrow
tire<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.240> make<00:01:42.420> contact<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> trail

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
tire can make contact with the trail

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.370 
tire can make contact with the trail
through<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.670> snow<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.840> may<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.259> an

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
through the snow it may have an

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.859 
through the snow it may have an
advantage<00:01:46.619> due<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.549> less<00:01:47.729> tire<00:01:48.000> therefore

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
advantage due to less tire therefore

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.200 
advantage due to less tire therefore
less<00:01:49.049> snow<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> push<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.829> way<00:01:50.210> less

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
less snow to push out of the way less

less snow to push out of the way less

another<00:01:54.299> advantage<00:01:54.860> for<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> fat<00:01:56.130> bike<00:01:56.340> tire

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
another advantage for the fat bike tire

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.359 
another advantage for the fat bike tire
is<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.180> holds<00:01:57.420> huge<00:01:58.229> volumes<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.829> air<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
is that it holds huge volumes of air and

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.030 
is that it holds huge volumes of air and
therefore<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.990> run<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.439> very<00:02:01.740> small

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
therefore it can be run with very small

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.149 
therefore it can be run with very small
tire<00:02:02.369> pressures<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:04.020> causes<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.530> tire<00:02:04.829> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
tire pressures this causes the tire to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.910 
tire pressures this causes the tire to
squish<00:02:05.610> down<00:02:06.049> even<00:02:07.049> more<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> snow

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
squish down even more on the snow

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.839 
squish down even more on the snow
surface<00:02:08.810> increasing<00:02:09.810> contact<00:02:10.289> patch

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
surface increasing contact patch

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.650 
surface increasing contact patch
therefore<00:02:11.849> increasing<00:02:12.390> footprint

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
therefore increasing footprint

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.240 
therefore increasing footprint
now<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.870> still<00:02:16.080> haven't<00:02:16.260> quite<00:02:16.500> got<00:02:16.830> the
