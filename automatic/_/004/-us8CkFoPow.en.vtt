00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
one now here of course White is

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.160 
one now here of course White is
threatening<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.760> take<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.330> not<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.930> pawn

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170

threatening to take is not this a pawn
on<00:02:55.200> e5<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:58.370> black<00:02:59.600> decided<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.720> get<00:03:01.290> out<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.709> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
on e5 so black decided to get out of the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.850 
on e5 so black decided to get out of the
spin<00:03:02.100> by<00:03:02.850> moving<00:03:03.150> Queen<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.690> c7<00:03:04.019> looks<00:03:04.440> very

spin by moving Queen to c7 looks very

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.620 
spin by moving Queen to c7 looks very
logical<00:03:05.780> but<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.959> fact<00:03:07.370> here<00:03:08.370> white<00:03:08.700> already

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
logical but in fact here white already

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.090 
logical but in fact here white already
has<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.260> very<00:03:11.190> strong<00:03:11.549> continuation<00:03:12.950> Knight<00:03:13.950> to

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
g5 was played now threatens to take on

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.150 
g5 was played now threatens to take on
f7<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:19.350> threat<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.860> not<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.600> very<00:03:22.160> small

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
f7 and this threat is not a very small

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.960 
f7 and this threat is not a very small
one<00:03:23.840> because<00:03:24.890> after<00:03:25.890> just<00:03:26.489> imagine<00:03:26.940> that

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
one because after just imagine that

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.759 
one because after just imagine that
white<00:03:27.299> is<00:03:27.329> here<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.840> move<00:03:27.959> then<00:03:28.260> Bishop<00:03:28.590> takes

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
white is here to move then Bishop takes

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.870 
white is here to move then Bishop takes
f7<00:03:29.070> check<00:03:29.430> if<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.820> King<00:03:30.060> goes<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.570> d8<00:03:31.880> then

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
f7 check if the King goes to d8 then

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.640 
f7 check if the King goes to d8 then
night<00:03:33.709> e6<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.950> checkmate

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
night e6 is checkmate

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.729 
night e6 is checkmate
if<00:03:36.939> after<00:03:37.939> Bishop<00:03:38.420> takes<00:03:38.750> f7<00:03:39.079> looking<00:03:39.439> goes<00:03:39.590> to

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
if after Bishop takes f7 looking goes to

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.890 
if after Bishop takes f7 looking goes to
f8<00:03:40.099> then<00:03:40.610> night<00:03:41.030> e<00:03:41.269> 6<00:03:41.689> check<00:03:42.049> wins<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.549> Queen

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
f8 then night e 6 check wins the Queen

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.619 
f8 then night e 6 check wins the Queen
so<00:03:45.430> black<00:03:46.430> must<00:03:46.670> do<00:03:46.760> something<00:03:47.000> against<00:03:47.420> this

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
so black must do something against this

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.789 
so black must do something against this
and<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:48.920> very<00:03:49.819> natural<00:03:50.360> looking<00:03:51.260> move<00:03:51.500> is

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
and a very natural looking move is

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.890 
and a very natural looking move is
canceling<00:03:52.310> inside<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.849> this<00:03:53.599> is<00:03:53.750> what

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
canceling inside that this is what

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.960 
canceling inside that this is what
happened<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.349> game<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:55.459> looks<00:03:55.760> as<00:03:55.939> if

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
happened to the game it looks as if

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.780 
happened to the game it looks as if
Blaque<00:03:56.569> is<00:03:56.930> doing<00:03:57.349> okay<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.129> it's<00:03:58.310> defending

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
Blaque is doing okay and it's defending

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.280 
Blaque is doing okay and it's defending
well<00:03:59.000> but<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:01.370> next<00:04:01.640> move<00:04:01.790> was<00:04:02.140> Bishop<00:04:03.140> takes

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
well but the next move was Bishop takes

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
well but the next move was Bishop takes
f7<00:04:03.590> check<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.480> here<00:04:05.680> black<00:04:06.680> had<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.069> resign

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
f7 check and here black had to resign

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.930 
f7 check and here black had to resign

this the position of the black king can

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.860 
this the position of the black king can
become<00:06:37.250> vulnerable<00:06:37.490> as<00:06:37.940> well<00:06:38.120> and<00:06:38.360> it's<00:06:38.720> not

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
become vulnerable as well and it's not

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.450 
become vulnerable as well and it's not
very<00:06:38.930> difficult<00:06:39.590> for<00:06:39.620> why<00:06:39.830> to<00:06:39.890> finish<00:06:40.310> the

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
very difficult for why to finish the

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.190 
very difficult for why to finish the
development<00:06:41.380> hmm<00:06:42.380> at<00:06:42.530> a<00:06:42.590> certain<00:06:42.800> point

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200

perhaps<00:06:45.200> this<00:06:45.410> this<00:06:45.680> night<00:06:46.100> can<00:06:46.340> go<00:06:46.460> to<00:06:46.520> d<00:06:48.250> 292

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
perhaps this this night can go to d 292

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.740 
perhaps this this night can go to d 292
followed<00:06:50.210> by<00:06:50.300> night<00:06:50.480> to<00:06:50.690> to<00:06:51.020> c4<00:06:51.440> or<00:06:52.750> perhaps

followed by night to to c4 or perhaps

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.909 
followed by night to to c4 or perhaps
Queen<00:06:54.140> to<00:06:54.290> see<00:06:54.440> for<00:06:54.650> right<00:06:54.830> now<00:06:56.650> those<00:06:57.650> kind<00:06:57.860> of

Queen to see for right now those kind of

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.980 
Queen to see for right now those kind of
things<00:06:58.100> will<00:06:58.430> in<00:06:59.360> any<00:06:59.480> case<00:06:59.750> it's<00:07:00.169> a<00:07:01.690> it's<00:07:02.690> just

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
things will in any case it's a it's just

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.050

material without any compensation and

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.940 
material without any compensation and
that's<00:07:05.870> why<00:07:06.940> Ruben<00:07:07.940> find<00:07:08.180> resigned<00:07:08.540> here<00:07:08.950> well

that's why Ruben find resigned here well

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.030 
that's why Ruben find resigned here well
perhaps<00:07:10.600> many<00:07:11.600> of<00:07:11.690> us<00:07:11.930> would<00:07:12.380> continue
