00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:35.066
Cable ties is used for binding fan with the foam 
cooler lid.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:39.066
A utility knife to cut the foam cooler lid.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:44.066
A PVC pipe which has perpendicular angle to 
release cool air

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.899
A Computer Power Source (12V) or any other 
equivalent power 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.266
should reserve a battery to use in case electricity 
gone

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.266
Place the fan onto the lid to determine its shape 
and position

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:16.432
use a pen to mark the shape

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:20.433
Do the same to the other one

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.900
Use utility knife to cut marked shapes on the lid

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.900
Notice: Should cut near inside the marked line, not 
directly cut onto it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.300
This is to avoid the case that the fan is not fit with 
the cut position

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.133
This action is to create a gate for heat passing 
into the cooler

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:54.133
Smoothen the surface around the cut position 
before putting the fan on. 

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:10.533
And do the same to the other

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:16.766
Firstly, create a hole from one corner of the fan

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:22.766
and another one near 

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:29.866
Put the cable tie over these two 2 holes then bind 
it tightly

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:33.866
Do the same to 3 other corners of fan and the 
other fan also

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.600
Impale the PVC pipe through the lid by strongly 
holding and pressing it down

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.600
Put away the impaled lid part

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:14.432
put ices into the foam cooler

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:18.999
don't break the ices into pieces 
will make them melt slower

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.766
cover the lid on

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:25.899
Supply power for the fans by directly connecting 
their cables to the computer power source

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.900
(or battery in case electricity gone)
