anyway there's another peach tree over
there

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289

all my peach trees are showing the same
symptoms<00:00:55.359> whether<00:00:55.870> it's<00:00:56.260> pear<00:00:57.539> plum<00:00:58.559> or<00:00:59.559> peach

to<00:01:05.440> produce<00:01:05.650> fruit<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:07.360> that<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.780> hold<00:01:08.470> of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
to produce fruit is that the hold of

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.020 
to produce fruit is that the hold of
hair<00:01:08.890> so<00:01:09.250> I'm<00:01:09.310> gonna<00:01:09.460> take<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.730> over<00:01:09.790> there<00:01:09.970> a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
hair so I'm gonna take you over there a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.030 
hair so I'm gonna take you over there a
minute<00:01:10.090> show<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.990> pears<00:01:11.290> instead<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.860> being

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
minute show the pears instead of being

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.280 
minute show the pears instead of being
like<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:13.030> size<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.510> baseball

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
like the size of a baseball

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.710 
like the size of a baseball
they're<00:01:14.890> like<00:01:15.070> that<00:01:15.790> big<00:01:15.940> around<00:01:16.060> like<00:01:16.330> half

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
they're like that big around like half

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.450 
they're like that big around like half
the<00:01:16.990> size<00:01:17.230> and<00:01:17.620> that's<00:01:17.830> because<00:01:18.160> we've

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
the size and that's because we've

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.080 
the size and that's because we've
received<00:01:18.850> maybe<00:01:19.140> half<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.310> rainfall<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:21.820> we

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
received maybe half the rainfall that we

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.330 
received maybe half the rainfall that we
normally<00:01:22.240> would<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.740> this<00:01:23.890> brings<00:01:24.040> up<00:01:24.250> the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
normally would so this brings up the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.760 
normally would so this brings up the
question<00:01:24.690> what<00:01:25.690> is<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.170> impact<00:01:26.590> of

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
question what is the impact of

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.340 
question what is the impact of

Greenland and how their temperatures are
warming<00:02:32.440> up<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.950> little<00:02:33.550> bit<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:35.170> their<00:02:35.890> fish

warming up a little bit and their fish
stock<00:02:36.519> piles<00:02:36.819> are<00:02:37.390> changing<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.800> they're

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
stock piles are changing and they're

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.220 
stock piles are changing and they're
wondering<00:02:39.700> if<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:39.970> warming<00:02:40.300> waters<00:02:40.720> may<00:02:40.989> make

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
wondering if the warming waters may make

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.830 
wondering if the warming waters may make
the<00:02:41.470> krill<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.549> shrimp<00:02:43.090> breed<00:02:43.630> at

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
the krill and the shrimp breed at

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.570 
the krill and the shrimp breed at
different<00:02:44.170> times<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.160> they're<00:02:45.310> having<00:02:45.340> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
different times and so they're having to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.369 
different times and so they're having to
do<00:02:45.700> studies<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.150> find<00:02:46.420> out<00:02:46.599> where<00:02:47.200> their

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
do studies to find out where their

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.430 
do studies to find out where their
shrimp<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:47.950> going<00:02:48.129> well<00:02:49.110> it's<00:02:50.110> pretty<00:02:50.290> obvious

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
shrimp is going well it's pretty obvious

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.339 
shrimp is going well it's pretty obvious
where<00:02:50.890> our<00:02:51.069> pears<00:02:51.700> peaches<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.750> plums<00:02:52.989> are

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
where our pears peaches and plums are

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.420 
where our pears peaches and plums are
going<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.709> we're<00:02:53.830> just<00:02:54.010> not<00:02:54.160> getting<00:02:54.310> enough

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
going and we're just not getting enough

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.509 
going and we're just not getting enough
rainfall<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:56.250> question<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:58.980> how<00:02:59.980> do<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.310> have

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
rainfall so question is how do you have

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.550 
rainfall so question is how do you have
a<00:03:00.549> long<00:03:00.910> term<00:03:01.269> survival<00:03:01.840> plan<00:03:02.140> in<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:04.120> face<00:03:04.360> of

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
a long term survival plan in the face of

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.620 
a long term survival plan in the face of
environmental<00:03:05.560> change<00:03:05.970> if<00:03:06.970> something<00:03:07.420> was

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
environmental change if something was

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.180 
environmental change if something was
was<00:03:08.049> bad<00:03:08.260> enough<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.560> wipe<00:03:08.769> out<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
was bad enough to wipe out the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.940 
was bad enough to wipe out the
Neanderthals<00:03:09.849> cro-magnon<00:03:10.810> man<00:03:13.260> what<00:03:14.260> can<00:03:14.799> we

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
Neanderthals cro-magnon man what can we

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.940 
Neanderthals cro-magnon man what can we
do<00:03:15.160> different<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.760> ensure<00:03:16.030> our<00:03:16.269> survival

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.490 

let's<00:03:20.950> go<00:03:21.040> take<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.250> look<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.549> pairs<00:03:22.079> and<00:03:23.079> while

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
let's go take a look in pairs and while

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.330 
let's go take a look in pairs and while
we're<00:03:23.650> here<00:03:23.769> Alan

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
we're here Alan

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.970 
we're here Alan
this<00:03:24.970> tree<00:03:25.299> here<00:03:25.450> died<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:26.139> got<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.470> disease<00:03:26.920> or

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
this tree here died it got a disease or

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.879 
this tree here died it got a disease or
something<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.609> was<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.730> peach<00:03:27.970> tree<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.420> died

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
something that was a peach tree it died

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.800 
something that was a peach tree it died
so<00:03:29.889> I<00:03:29.950> planted<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.370> plum<00:03:30.880> tree<00:03:30.910> right<00:03:31.420> next<00:03:31.660> to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
so I planted a plum tree right next to

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.500 
so I planted a plum tree right next to
it<00:03:32.250> see<00:03:33.250> how<00:03:33.310> small<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.700> plums<00:03:33.910> are<00:03:34.120> that's

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
it see how small the plums are that's

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.580 
it see how small the plums are that's
like<00:03:34.720> half<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.980> size<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.400> they<00:03:36.489> should<00:03:36.760> be<00:03:36.940> I

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
like half the size that they should be I

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.910 
like half the size that they should be I
planted<00:03:38.590> this<00:03:38.680> tree<00:03:38.739> this<00:03:39.040> year

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.960 

this<00:03:43.520> tree<00:03:43.849> here<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.420> planted<00:03:45.160> two<00:03:46.160> or<00:03:46.340> three

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
this tree here I planted two or three

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.360 
this tree here I planted two or three
years<00:03:47.180> ago<00:03:47.300> or<00:03:47.420> so<00:03:47.720> see<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.830> plums<00:03:49.099> they're<00:03:49.340> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
years ago or so see the plums they're a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.400 
years ago or so see the plums they're a
little<00:03:49.489> bit<00:03:49.640> bigger<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:50.510> trees<00:03:50.780> more<00:03:51.020> mature

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
little bit bigger the trees more mature

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.740 
little bit bigger the trees more mature
I<00:03:51.770> topped<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.760> off<00:03:52.940> it<00:03:53.120> was<00:03:53.270> real<00:03:53.480> tall<00:03:53.690> I

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
I topped it off it was real tall I

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.660 
I topped it off it was real tall I
topped<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.319> off<00:03:54.470> there<00:03:55.870> there<00:03:57.340> there<00:03:58.340> and

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
topped it off there there there and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.360 
topped it off there there there and
there<00:03:59.150> so<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.600> it<00:03:59.690> would<00:03:59.810> grow<00:03:59.959> out<00:04:00.370> instead

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
there so that it would grow out instead

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.360 
there so that it would grow out instead
of<00:04:01.430> just<00:04:01.640> up<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:03.290> it's<00:04:03.470> producing<00:04:03.890> fruit<00:04:04.160> this

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
of just up and it's producing fruit this

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.040 
of just up and it's producing fruit this
year<00:04:04.610> first<00:04:04.790> time<00:04:04.940> since<00:04:05.360> I've<00:04:05.510> planted<00:04:05.810> it

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
year first time since I've planted it

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.040 
year first time since I've planted it
and<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.130> plums<00:04:07.430> or<00:04:07.670> maybe<00:04:07.910> half<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.690> size

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
and the plums or maybe half the size

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.380 
and the plums or maybe half the size
that<00:04:09.080> they<00:04:09.410> should<00:04:09.650> be<00:04:10.000> normal<00:04:11.000> plums<00:04:11.209> that

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
that they should be normal plums that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.300 
that they should be normal plums that
you'd<00:04:11.540> get<00:04:11.690> at<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.900> store<00:04:14.950> here's<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.100> pear

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
you'd get at the store here's the pear

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.250 
you'd get at the store here's the pear
trees<00:04:16.669> they've<00:04:17.269> got<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.540> bunch<00:04:17.840> of<00:04:18.019> vines

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
trees they've got a bunch of vines

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.140 
trees they've got a bunch of vines
coming<00:04:18.680> up<00:04:18.889> on<00:04:19.040> them<00:04:19.250> always<00:04:19.400> happens<00:04:19.880> every

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
year we come in and cut the vines back

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.240 
year we come in and cut the vines back
during<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.110> spring<00:04:27.440> when<00:04:27.770> during<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.070> fall

during the spring when during the fall

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.230 
during the spring when during the fall
we'll<00:04:28.460> come<00:04:28.610> in<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:28.820> cut<00:04:28.970> them<00:04:29.060> back<00:04:29.180> and

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
we'll come in and cut them back and

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.030 
we'll come in and cut them back and
fertilize<00:04:29.810> them<00:04:29.960> now<00:04:30.080> these<00:04:30.260> trees<00:04:30.650> we've<00:04:30.860> got

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
fertilize them now these trees we've got

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.740 
fertilize them now these trees we've got
two<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.220> them<00:04:31.400> here<00:04:31.460> these<00:04:32.240> trees<00:04:32.600> were

two of them here these trees were

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.860 
two of them here these trees were
fertilized<00:04:33.260> during<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:34.010> spring<00:04:34.419> last<00:04:35.419> year

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.610 
to give you an idea last year this pear
tree<00:04:40.940> was<00:04:41.120> loaded<00:04:41.419> with<00:04:41.510> pears<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:42.229> size<00:04:42.470> of

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
tree was loaded with pears the size of

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.950 
tree was loaded with pears the size of
baseballs<00:04:42.790> this<00:04:43.790> is<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.000> fraction

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
baseballs this is a fraction

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.400 
baseballs this is a fraction
they've<00:04:45.200> been<00:04:45.290> ate<00:04:46.270> maybe<00:04:47.270> a<00:04:47.360> quarter<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:48.260> the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
they've been ate maybe a quarter of the

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.219 
they've been ate maybe a quarter of the
size<00:04:48.590> that<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.979> Paris<00:04:49.340> should<00:04:49.880> be<00:04:50.150> for<00:04:51.140> this

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
size that the Paris should be for this

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:51.940 
size that the Paris should be for this
time<00:04:51.410> of<00:04:51.470> year

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
time of year

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.040 
time of year
I<00:04:51.979> think<00:04:52.910> it's<00:04:53.000> directly<00:04:53.150> relate<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:53.960> this

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
I think it's directly relate and this

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.070 
I think it's directly relate and this
tree<00:04:54.260> produces<00:04:54.500> pears<00:04:55.010> at<00:04:55.190> size<00:04:55.400> every<00:04:56.330> year

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
tree produces pears at size every year

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.190 
tree produces pears at size every year
for<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.070> past<00:04:58.250> four<00:04:58.669> years<00:04:58.700> or<00:04:59.120> so<00:04:59.330> it's<00:05:00.140> been

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
for the past four years or so it's been

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.580 
for the past four years or so it's been
a<00:05:00.289> very<00:05:00.560> good<00:05:00.770> producing<00:05:01.250> pear<00:05:01.460> tree<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:03.380> year

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
a very good producing pear tree the year

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.560 
a very good producing pear tree the year
that<00:05:03.740> we<00:05:03.890> are<00:05:04.539> very<00:05:05.539> short<00:05:05.840> on<00:05:05.900> rainfall<00:05:06.169> and

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
that we are very short on rainfall and

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.930 
that we are very short on rainfall and
the<00:05:08.570> pears<00:05:08.780> look<00:05:09.020> like<00:05:09.169> this<00:05:09.550> now<00:05:10.550> keeping

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
the pears look like this now keeping

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.270 
the pears look like this now keeping
fine<00:05:11.180> these<00:05:11.390> pears<00:05:11.690> should<00:05:11.870> be<00:05:11.990> like<00:05:12.169> that<00:05:13.070> big

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280

this happens every year vines climb up
on<00:05:34.020> a<00:05:34.050> tree<00:05:34.550> it's<00:05:35.550> no<00:05:35.669> big<00:05:35.849> deal

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
on a tree it's no big deal

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.999

it<00:05:36.419> doesn't<00:05:36.750> hurt<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.410> production<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:37.949> the

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
it doesn't hurt the production of the
