00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.920 
pursuits me which thanks to the fact
that<00:01:11.130> I've<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.180> reflect<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.720> its<00:01:12.840> going

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that I've got that reflect up its going

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.600 
that I've got that reflect up its going
to<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.140> nothing<00:01:13.409> yeah<00:01:13.770> his<00:01:13.920> time<00:01:14.130> seems<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> be

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to do nothing yeah his time seems to be

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.780 
to do nothing yeah his time seems to be
mostly<00:01:14.939> physical<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.049> that's<00:01:16.320> why<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:17.130> wanted

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
mostly physical so that's why I wanted

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.719 
mostly physical so that's why I wanted
to<00:01:17.880> reflect<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.600> switched<00:01:19.049> out<00:01:19.200> right<00:01:19.439> away

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
to reflect and switched out right away

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.010 
to reflect and switched out right away
rather<00:01:20.729> than<00:01:20.820> set<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.210> my<00:01:21.299> dual<00:01:21.479> screens<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
rather than set up my dual screens I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.960 
rather than set up my dual screens I
figured<00:01:22.350> better<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.250> reflect<00:01:23.820> up

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
figured better to just have reflect up

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.140 
figured better to just have reflect up
and<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.330> die<00:01:24.920> anyway<00:01:25.920> he's<00:01:26.610> getting<00:01:26.759> burned

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
and not die anyway he's getting burned

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.149 
and not die anyway he's getting burned
and<00:01:27.600> I'm<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.140> go<00:01:28.229> ahead<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.500> switch<00:01:28.979> out

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and I'm going to go ahead and switch out

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.539 
and I'm going to go ahead and switch out

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
awesome this generation as last

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.179 
awesome this generation as last
generation<00:01:39.299> he<00:01:39.630> says<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.990> his<00:01:40.110> why<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.590> on

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
generation he says that his why not on

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.280 
generation he says that his why not on
the<00:01:41.549> switch<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.060> obviously<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.079> gonna

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the switch and obviously is not gonna

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.830 
the switch and obviously is not gonna
stay<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:43.979> i<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.340> sub<00:01:44.840> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
stay and because i can just sub and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.649

he breaks my my sub because you know why

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.720 
he breaks my my sub because you know why
waste<00:02:17.290> perfectly<00:02:17.620> good<00:02:17.860> sub<00:02:18.220> when<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.459> can<00:02:18.640> be

doing metric tons of damage yeah breaks
my<00:02:22.810> sub<00:02:23.140> at<00:02:23.380> this<00:02:23.530> point<00:02:23.800> as<00:02:24.430> he<00:02:24.459> goes<00:02:24.760> from<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
my sub at this point as he goes from the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.940 
my sub at this point as he goes from the
volt<00:02:25.120> switch<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.660> he<00:02:26.140> switches<00:02:26.380> in<00:02:26.650> his

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
volt switch and he switches in his

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.860 
volt switch and he switches in his
glider<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.910> who's<00:02:28.420> going<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.599> take<00:02:28.750> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
glider and who's going to take the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.449 
glider and who's going to take the
Shadow<00:02:29.080> Ball<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.769> think<00:02:30.010> he<00:02:30.130> takes<00:02:30.340> it

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
Shadow Ball and I think he takes it

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.890 
Shadow Ball and I think he takes it
quite<00:02:30.640> well<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.849> think<00:02:30.970> that's<00:02:31.269> probably<00:02:31.660> an

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
quite well I think that's probably an

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.039 
quite well I think that's probably an
EVO<00:02:32.290> light<00:02:32.560> clogger<00:02:33.400> maybe<00:02:33.580> not<00:02:33.819> though

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
EVO light clogger maybe not though

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.170 
EVO light clogger maybe not though
anyway<00:02:35.049> he<00:02:35.769> switches<00:02:36.040> out<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.610> switches<00:02:37.060> in

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
anyway he switches out and switches in

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.240 
anyway he switches out and switches in
his<00:02:37.480> steel<00:02:37.989> trap<00:02:38.319> other<00:02:38.799> threaded<00:02:39.069> don't

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
his steel trap other threaded don't

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.410 
his steel trap other threaded don't
think<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.489> switch<00:02:39.670> out<00:02:39.819> i<00:02:39.850> go<00:02:40.030> for<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.180> sucker

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
think I switch out i go for the sucker

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.699 
think I switch out i go for the sucker
punch<00:02:40.510> thing<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.019> he<00:02:41.110> would<00:02:41.230> attack<00:02:41.470> and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
to switch out just a plain old switch

this guy and actually I was hoping to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.570 
this guy and actually I was hoping to
take<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.650> volt<00:02:50.830> switch<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.280> get<00:02:51.370> some

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
take the volt switch and get some

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.150 
take the volt switch and get some
recovery<00:02:52.120> instead<00:02:52.959> he<00:02:53.200> predicted<00:02:53.709> that<00:02:53.769> and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
recovery instead he predicted that and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.920 
recovery instead he predicted that and
went<00:02:54.280> for<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.489> flash<00:02:54.700> can<00:02:54.970> may<00:02:55.209> not<00:02:55.390> predicted

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
went for the flash can may not predicted

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.570 
went for the flash can may not predicted
it<00:02:56.049> he<00:02:56.440> then<00:02:56.620> he<00:02:56.769> would<00:02:56.920> have<00:02:57.010> switched<00:02:57.250> but

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
it he then he would have switched but

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.740 
it he then he would have switched but
anyway<00:02:57.819> he<00:02:57.940> goes<00:02:58.120> ahead<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.360> sends<00:02:58.599> out<00:02:58.720> his

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
anyway he goes ahead and sends out his

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.070 
anyway he goes ahead and sends out his

goes<00:03:22.180> for<00:03:22.390> an<00:03:22.450> encore<00:03:22.630> here<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.069> it's

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
goes for an encore here and so it's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.800 
goes for an encore here and so it's
pretty<00:03:24.459> obvious<00:03:24.940> what's<00:03:25.269> gonna<00:03:25.390> happen<00:03:25.720> on

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
pretty obvious what's gonna happen on

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.360 
pretty obvious what's gonna happen on
the<00:03:25.900> next<00:03:26.170> turn<00:03:26.380> but<00:03:26.410> he's<00:03:26.829> going<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.100> switch

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
the next turn but he's going to switch

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.759 
the next turn but he's going to switch
into<00:03:27.549> his<00:03:27.970> glider<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.959> get<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.230> free<00:03:29.440> switch

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
into his glider to get the free switch

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.140 
into his glider to get the free switch
and<00:03:30.220> i<00:03:30.280> really<00:03:30.489> should<00:03:30.670> have<00:03:30.730> predicted<00:03:31.120> that

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
and i really should have predicted that

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.819 
and i really should have predicted that
and<00:03:31.420> switched<00:03:31.660> out<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.139> i<00:03:32.170> figured<00:03:32.620> what<00:03:32.799> the

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
and switched out but i figured what the

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.890 
and switched out but i figured what the
heck<00:03:33.100> i'll<00:03:33.340> just<00:03:33.850> see<00:03:34.239> how<00:03:34.359> this<00:03:34.480> plays<00:03:34.630> out

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
heck i'll just see how this plays out

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.539 
heck i'll just see how this plays out
and<00:03:35.290> so<00:03:35.500> i'm<00:03:35.620> now<00:03:35.799> I'm<00:03:35.889> gonna<00:03:35.980> have<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:36.310> switch

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
and so i'm now I'm gonna have to switch

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.220 
and so i'm now I'm gonna have to switch
and<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.819> go<00:03:37.030> back<00:03:37.569> into<00:03:37.870> my<00:03:38.319> miele<00:03:38.769> my<00:03:39.310> nattu

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
and I go back into my miele my nattu

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.990 
and I go back into my miele my nattu
goes<00:03:41.230> for<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.470> roost<00:03:41.709> recovers<00:03:42.670> a<00:03:42.790> whole

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
goes for the roost recovers a whole

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.840 
goes for the roost recovers a whole
bunch<00:03:43.209> of<00:03:43.299> HP<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:43.989> I'm<00:03:44.709> this<00:03:45.160> guy<00:03:45.370> is<00:03:45.430> going<00:03:45.700> to

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
bunch of HP and I'm this guy is going to

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.819 
bunch of HP and I'm this guy is going to
be<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.090> hardest<00:03:46.329> guy<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:47.049> his<00:03:47.170> team<00:03:47.440> for<00:03:47.620> me<00:03:47.739> to

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
be the hardest guy of his team for me to

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.680 
be the hardest guy of his team for me to
kill<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.730> just<00:03:48.940> got<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.239> figure<00:03:49.359> out<00:03:49.450> how<00:03:49.540> to

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
kill and I just got to figure out how to

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.410 
kill and I just got to figure out how to
take<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.079> out<00:03:50.230> because<00:03:51.220> otherwise<00:03:51.579> I'm<00:03:52.000> kind

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
take it out because otherwise I'm kind

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.660 
take it out because otherwise I'm kind
of<00:03:52.510> gonna<00:03:52.750> be<00:03:53.109> swept<00:03:53.620> by<00:03:53.709> this<00:03:53.889> guy<00:03:54.040> so<00:03:54.489> again

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
of gonna be swept by this guy so again

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.009 
of gonna be swept by this guy so again
anyway<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:54.940> go<00:03:55.120> for<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.299> reflect<00:03:55.630> here<00:03:55.840> just

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
anyway I go for the reflect here just

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.300 
anyway I go for the reflect here just

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
set the reflect back up because that's

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.370 
set the reflect back up because that's
my<00:03:57.430> only<00:03:57.609> hope<00:03:57.910> really<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.989> defending

it's<00:04:07.860> pretty<00:04:08.250> hard<00:04:08.460> even<00:04:08.700> with<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
it's pretty hard even with the

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.550 
it's pretty hard even with the
reflective<00:04:09.750> i'm<00:04:09.870> really<00:04:10.080> glad<00:04:10.170> i<00:04:10.260> put<00:04:10.470> the

reflective i'm really glad i put the

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.930 
reflective i'm really glad i put the
reflect<00:04:10.830> up<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.160> go<00:04:11.250> ahead<00:04:11.490> and<00:04:11.580> send<00:04:11.760> out

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
my Bernie my cyndaquil eruption is still

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.660 
my Bernie my cyndaquil eruption is still
awesome<00:04:18.230> yeah<00:04:19.230> he<00:04:19.530> survives<00:04:20.010> which<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.400> just

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
awesome yeah he survives which I just

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.820 
awesome yeah he survives which I just
couldn't<00:04:20.850> believe<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:22.320> he's<00:04:22.470> gonna<00:04:22.590> go<00:04:22.740> ahead

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
couldn't believe and he's gonna go ahead

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.560 
couldn't believe and he's gonna go ahead
and<00:04:22.950> take<00:04:23.130> me<00:04:23.280> out<00:04:23.370> with<00:04:23.520> earthquake<00:04:23.880> I'm

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
and take me out with earthquake I'm

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.340 
and take me out with earthquake I'm
pretty<00:04:25.020> sure<00:04:25.350> my<00:04:25.800> cyndaquil<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:27.000> modest<00:04:27.570> this

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
pretty sure my cyndaquil is modest this

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.500 
pretty sure my cyndaquil is modest this
generation<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:29.070> do<00:04:29.400> not<00:04:29.760> think<00:04:29.820> it's<00:04:30.090> +<00:04:30.300> speed

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
generation I do not think it's + speed

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.390 
generation I do not think it's + speed
but<00:04:30.750> anyway<00:04:30.990> he<00:04:31.290> goes<00:04:31.410> ahead<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.740> roosts<00:04:32.130> here

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
but anyway he goes ahead and roosts here

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.310 
but anyway he goes ahead and roosts here
and<00:04:32.550> I'm<00:04:33.000> going<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.150> go<00:04:33.270> ahead<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.600> go<00:04:34.110> for<00:04:34.290> the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
and I'm going to go ahead and go for the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.230 
and I'm going to go ahead and go for the
shell<00:04:34.590> smash<00:04:34.890> to<00:04:35.130> thinking<00:04:35.520> that's<00:04:35.970> going<00:04:36.180> to

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
shell smash to thinking that's going to

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.120 
shell smash to thinking that's going to
be<00:04:36.300> my<00:04:36.420> only<00:04:36.630> chance<00:04:36.750> of<00:04:37.170> really<00:04:37.740> being<00:04:37.890> well

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
be my only chance of really being well

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.370 
be my only chance of really being well
being<00:04:38.550> able<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:38.970> do<00:04:39.090> some<00:04:39.270> damage<00:04:39.450> this<00:04:39.720> guy<00:04:39.900> he

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
being able to do some damage this guy he

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.170 
being able to do some damage this guy he
goes<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.830> so<00:04:41.190> since<00:04:41.460> he<00:04:41.610> went<00:04:41.700> for<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.880> ruse<00:04:42.060> I

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
goes and so since he went for the ruse I

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.610 
goes and so since he went for the ruse I
could<00:04:42.419> go<00:04:42.570> for<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.810> second<00:04:43.169> cells<00:04:43.380> match

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
could go for the second cells match

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.400 
could go for the second cells match
since<00:04:43.830> I<00:04:43.950> obviously<00:04:44.310> have<00:04:44.640> sturdy<00:04:45.350> but<00:04:46.350> I

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
since I obviously have sturdy but I

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.200 
since I obviously have sturdy but I
decided<00:04:46.800> no<00:04:47.160> I'm<00:04:47.490> not<00:04:47.640> going<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.880> be<00:04:47.940> greedy

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
decided no I'm not going to be greedy

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.730 
decided no I'm not going to be greedy
I'm<00:04:48.540> just<00:04:48.750> going<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.930> go<00:04:49.050> ahead<00:04:49.169> and<00:04:49.320> attack

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
I'm just going to go ahead and attack

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.800 
I'm just going to go ahead and attack
and<00:04:50.040> do<00:04:50.130> as<00:04:50.250> much<00:04:50.400> so<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.610> can<00:04:50.910> I<00:04:51.180> go<00:04:51.540> ahead<00:04:51.690> and

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
and do as much so I can I go ahead and

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.470 
and do as much so I can I go ahead and
go<00:04:52.020> for<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.290> rockslide<00:04:52.970> gets<00:04:53.970> him<00:04:54.090> down<00:04:54.240> to

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
go for the rockslide gets him down to

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.260 
go for the rockslide gets him down to
pretty<00:04:54.720> low<00:04:54.870> HP<00:04:55.640> earthquake<00:04:56.640> is<00:04:56.820> I<00:04:56.970> believe

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
pretty low HP earthquake is I believe
