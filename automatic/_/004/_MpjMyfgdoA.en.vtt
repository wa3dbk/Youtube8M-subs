00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.330
 if not 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 hello classmates how is this is a 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.460
 minute is once again measured 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.290
 battlefield 4 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 You are after a week of play 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.360
 pretty intense'll give you a little my 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.250
 impressions my opinion of what is 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.420
 being the game 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.670
 the current generation in playstation3 and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.739
 360 on xbox 360 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 we forgot for now of pc we 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.809
 we forget playstation 4 for now 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.780
 when the new generation null comes out 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.180
 we will talk about how is the game that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.910
 what differences do we find worth 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.850
 we are in favor to explain you a little 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.760
 just what you will see playing 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.390
 engineer with the weapon rpg I wear the n 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.149
 nx 4 which is one of the first 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.940
 they give one of my first games because 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.729
 I think the level 7 or 8 but we're going 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.830
 the first two days as like that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.470
 who says not just just entered into 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.880
 this base and in the end you will know how 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.230
 ended not but well let's get down to business 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:39.040
 because the current consoles version 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.170
 is raising many opinions and I already 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.440
 you are asking to see mine how is it 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.450
 but good we are going to divide you a little 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.180
 let's talk first I think we're going 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.730
 to go from bad to better than worse is 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.580
 what I like the most is the first of 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.450
 all in graphics a lot of people are 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.120
 noticing and here something fails, I'm not 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.010
 the opinion that even beats filtres 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.820
 you could get to see a little better 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.890
 I think what you give this time had 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.200
 to do so many versions that he said 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.400
 look let's focus on pc which is the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.250
 important for us the base the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.680
 original and then we put in consoles of 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.370
 new generation the best we can and 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.010
 play 3 and xbox 360 then let's leave it 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.410
 what we can and it gives me the feeling of 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.960
 that even goes from fil 3 looks a bit 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.390
 better not in graphics and it gives me the 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.170
 feeling that not that they are not so 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.800
 polished the fps is they have some 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.900
 brutal falls are very unstable 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.360
 any map from what you already know 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.710
 which is where less vehicles there is good 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.230
 in fact there are no vehicles but although 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.530
 there are many explosions of grenades and such 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.800
 there is a lot of popping 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.980
 let's hope for what I've seen in the 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.770
 playstation 4 and xbox one videos that 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.130
 this is improving and I think that's what 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.760
 worse that you have in good next to the 12 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.530
 players per team the worst it has 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.050
 these versions not because of these 24 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.800
 players make modes like 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.050
 conquests stay a little 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.170
 soulless and for me the best ways 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.060
 to play in these consoles are assault 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.019
 eradication in Spanish and 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.760
 the one of yuzhno to the one of to deactivate and is 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.470
 that I am against the all against 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.420
 you all already know about ideas from 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.790
 domination so are the three modes 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.680
 that I'm playing myself yo more then I think 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.290
 that the vehicles are still the worst 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.130
 unemployed continue to make them 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.790
 of paper in me in my opinion though 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.190
 although it is also true that they have 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.320
 example the tanks and such is no longer 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.730
 they become incapacitated as soon as 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.220
 which have a little more margin of 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.920
 maneuver and good have a lot of things 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.960
 in many more unlockables with what 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.490
 equal to the end of time there is a 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.100
 better balance or at least for 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.140
 tanks the aerial vehicles are the 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.520
 they are loading in my opinion little by little 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.880
 although of that deepen better in another 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.320
 video is worth let's say we can say that 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.080
 the football terrestrials do not leave 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.459
 enduring but the airs but that already 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.100
 slowly 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.230
 it's as if practically good in play 3 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.000
 almost that they could be removed because 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.390
 at least there would be more players not for him 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.230
 for him on the floor and there are maps to 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:38.470
 manager that the jet well the helicopter 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.960
 of attack do not make much sense 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.060
 but well let's go a little talking 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.500
 before I finish all this from the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.820
 things that I do like are the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.350
 novelties for example the theme of 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.500
 resuscitation I like it much more how it is 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.720
 the inclusion of the mode 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.080
 It's pretty fun to play like that 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.730
 some different games especially 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.370
 when you are playing with friends it is very 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.250
 fun to play commander and see what 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.810
 what is happening 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.460
 after one thing that they have included and I 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.490
 I really like it from the field of 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.680
 tests where we can go and try the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.110
 vehicles and make our prophecies without 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.790
 have to be playing online and let's say 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.780
 that hurting your team if you do not know 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:26.400
 control some things but but good 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.950
 are things that both now and in 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.620
 play 4 or the new consoles 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.330
 generation that are going to be are new 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.900
 that I'm really enjoying, I think 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.570
 as in the theme of gameplay is 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.580
 Much is much better game Battlefield 4 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.470
 more difficult 3 and to me yes that gives me the 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.780
 feeling that it 's a new game 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.580
 not so much the graphic aspect because 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.980
 it is true that many things 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.480
 they seem but the gameplay when I'm 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.169
 playing they continue to give that feeling of 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.910
 new game that greater kick those 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.580
 changes in resuscitations that said 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.610
 before in many more des blog 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.780
 I do not know they have many very good things that 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:09.180
 yes, I'm liking it and for the moment 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.219
 What I can tell you is that if you 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.500
 you are going to buy the new console 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.719
 generation plus the batting of 4 and now I 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.569
 I would spend the money to buy it for 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:23.039
 Play 3 Wii Xbox because it really shows 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:25.979
 a little attention pinball version that 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:28.469
 I was saving the tree because I notice it 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:31.530
 a very very loose version very loose and 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:33.690
 I think the new consoles will be 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.020
 another totally different game with those 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:39.050
 64 players 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.240
 better graphics with 60 frames I do not know if 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.509
 they will be stable or not but good much more 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.159
 fluid and an experience much much much 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.199
 older I think we have run a little 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:50.379
 big the game for new consoles 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:53.180
 good forgiveness for the current consoles 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:55.520
 and good guys what I was saying 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.770
 manage to catch for the new hope 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.310
 a few more weeks that you will have it and 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.490
 nothing I see you in another video take care of you bye 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.490
 bye
