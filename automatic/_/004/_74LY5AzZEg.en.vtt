00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.580
 Welcome .. I am Nicolas .. and I am Joan Mister and we are from "My Korean Husband Blog" 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.860
 Where are we today? 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.080
 In the vegetable garden house 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.420
 We are watching a vegetable reserve. Your parents own this farm 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.100
 Yes .. What kind of a protected? 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.080
 Protected (greenhouses) for strawberries 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.580
 All these are strawberries 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.180
 We loved to look at a different place ... it's a really warm place 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.680
 The place is great here and we have to spend more time here 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.740
 Today is Monday..which means a paragraph to comment on your comments 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.620
 Well this comment was on this painting 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.280
 When you wanted me to draw you as a person .. Who is the person? 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.240
 Shakespeare 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.840
 Try again to say it 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 Shakespeare ... is this your attempt at the present? 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.880
 Do you see ??? 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.420
 Shakespeare 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.440
 Yes Shakespeare (Shakespeare) 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.640
 I really regret the mockery 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.980
 My Korean language is very bad ... so I do not have to make fun of English 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 But not Shakespeare 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.500
 Why do not you care? 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 Who wrote the play Romeo and Juliet? 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.560
 Shakespeare 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
 Who is the greatest writer in the history of English? 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.220
 Shakespeare 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960
 Courtney Begg says: Yes, Shakespeare has written all the English literature 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.140
 He knows writing ... a wonderful writer 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.740
 On Facebook says Susan Jackson: I'm scared that next time I see any production related to Shakespeare I will remember these cartoons and loudly 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 Especially in tragedy 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.040
 What did you do with people? 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.540
 Sorry 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.500
 Well, we shot a good video last week, did not we? 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.000
 What was the video about? 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.620
 Funny Stuff 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.920
 Funny things you do in the countryside 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.420
 In the winter season 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 In the winter and the Korean countryside 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.980
 It was not serious 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.780
 I wish everyone noticed it 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 With my wonderful acting skills 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.760
 If you can watch the video here 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300
 With all the entertaining stuff 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.820
 Yes a lot 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440
 Carrie says: That cabbage may make me a kamchi - it looks very well-intentioned 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 Yes, that was your idea of ​​making a kamchi 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.460
 You told me what about the cabbage and the kamchi industry 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.780
 So the cabbage was bad ... I was eating them? ..No 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.420
 Because people use what you want and then throw it out 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.880
 You find plenty of food in the countryside 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.640
 This comment was posted on this comic 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 What would you ask? 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
 I was trying to say the word does not matter (whenever) 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.600
 And you gave me a rude answer 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.760
 It was not rude !! 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.780
 A lot of people minced in the comments section 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.460
 Oh really?? They were not discussing that word 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.460
 In Korean 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.400
 Have you considered? 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.840
 Could you find that Korean word that might meet the word "whatever" in English? 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.140
 I do not know 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.600
 Maybe we say .. 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.020
 I do not think there 's an interview 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 Same feelings 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.060
 And do not use the same way I do not know 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.960
 We have something similar to her but not the same 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.740
 "He gave me an appropriate answer 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.360
 This comment made me very nervous 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.560
 And something I've noticed in Korea 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.500
 We love the wind 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.940
 I started to get used to this kind of humor but I have Western friends 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.100
 Some girls are impossible to say this word 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.500
 It's funny .. it's a difference of cultures 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.140
 We do not joke as much as the Koreans joke about 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.280
 We were watching Modern Farm 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.840
 She applied the wind and then he did it to cover it 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.920
 They consider it a romantic scene 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.280
 We have a competition to win honey and butter 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.880
 I could get them 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.680
 Hard to get but very famous in Korea 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.320
 Depends on the people many of my friends love 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.320
 But we do not like it 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.680
 How dare you 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.800
 For people who try it 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.040
 A week to participate there is a link below 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.700
 To enter the contest and win two 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.880
 Not only in Korea but everywhere in the world 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.000
 We will randomly choose 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.800
 Wayne Mcnetm we will send you these chips 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.820
 And I think very much 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.200
 Or you will love it .. 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.100
 Or you will say, how much do you want to get them 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.220
 Even in Korea it is difficult to get this chips 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.020
 That was all 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.420
 If you enjoy this shooting, we will show you strawberries 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.440
 Not mature .. Will you eat them? 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.320
 No, you can eat it ... I do not want to 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.840
 Strawberries
