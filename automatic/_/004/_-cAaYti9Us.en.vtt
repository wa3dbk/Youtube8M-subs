00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.020

 last here is such a liquid lipstick from 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.259
 Loreal is not exactly buying me and gave 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.050
 as a gift already at the box office 5 from a girlfriend 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:30.840
 I think all of you know these liquid lipstick in 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.240
 such a sponge and a good lipstick 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.889

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.900
 pretty long on lips 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.659
 but I do not like that after all she 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.650
 glitter looks like a shine 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:47.699
 although the property is closer to such an easy 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.710
 On mother it moistens but such here 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.690
 watery for lipstick still seems 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.840
 noblesse 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:57.120
 so I, as a very big not amateur 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.740
 glitter will think what to use it 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.219
 rarely though it is called at all 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.710
 satin fluid lip number i have is 101 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:07.020
 but my first impression is not bad 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.509
 I liked it so I will be more 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.460
 use may be just one try 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.069
