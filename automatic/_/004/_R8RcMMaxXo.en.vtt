00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the trailer it wasn't anything like I

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.090

imagined<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.559> saw<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> teaser

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
imagined because I saw the teaser

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.760 
imagined because I saw the teaser
trailer<00:00:35.520> before<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.960> showed<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> little

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
trailer before and it showed a little

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.560 
trailer before and it showed a little
bit<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.100> now<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.520> one's<00:00:38.730> showing<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.090> lot<00:00:39.270> and

star okay he's not he does I don't

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.070 
star okay he's not he does I don't
believe<00:02:52.160> he<00:02:52.310> has<00:02:52.430> star<00:02:52.730> quality<00:02:52.760> Liam<00:02:53.720> Neeson

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.440 
believe he has star quality Liam Neeson
is<00:02:54.200> definitely<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.620> star<00:02:54.860> but<00:02:55.640> he's<00:02:56.150> only<00:02:56.330> a

is definitely a star but he's only a
supporting<00:02:56.900> role<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:58.130> really<00:02:58.310> comes<00:02:58.550> down

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
supporting role so it really comes down

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.340
