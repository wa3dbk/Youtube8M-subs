idea

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.219 

now<00:01:23.340> wait<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.790> didn't<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.330> any<00:01:24.450> gas<00:01:24.720> cylinders

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
now wait I didn't see any gas cylinders

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.280 
now wait I didn't see any gas cylinders
at<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> front<00:01:26.090> reason<00:01:27.090> look<00:01:27.420> by<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:30.290> heavy

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
at the front reason look by here heavy

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.410 
at the front reason look by here heavy
things<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.579> doesn't<00:01:32.640> matter<00:01:33.119> because

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
things but that doesn't matter because

things but that doesn't matter because
though<00:01:34.110> right<00:01:34.350> over<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> wheel<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.340> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
though right over the wheel and that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.090 
though right over the wheel and that
makes<00:01:36.360> sense

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
makes sense

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.490 
makes sense
wonder<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.490> inside<00:01:39.320> let's<00:01:40.320> go

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
wonder what it's like inside let's go

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.929 
wonder what it's like inside let's go
and<00:01:40.650> check<00:01:42.740> well<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.009> looks<00:01:44.159> rather<00:01:44.430> nicer

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and check well this looks rather nicer

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
of course this doubtless would be the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.889 
of course this doubtless would be the
double<00:01:49.409> bait<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.390> yeah<00:01:51.390> look<00:01:51.630> at<00:01:51.750> that

is fairly standard a lot of caravans are

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.749 
is fairly standard a lot of caravans are
like<00:02:02.280> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
like that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.620 
like that
I<00:02:02.790> wonder<00:02:03.600> what's<00:02:03.780> different<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:05.420> look<00:02:06.420> this

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
I wonder what's different now look this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.290 
I wonder what's different now look this
is<00:02:06.780> unusual<00:02:07.140> instead<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> usual<00:02:08.489> plywood

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
is unusual instead of the usual plywood

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.140 
is unusual instead of the usual plywood
that<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.690> get<00:02:09.869> stained<00:02:10.489> this<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.700> fiberglass

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
that can get stained this is fiberglass

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.280 
that can get stained this is fiberglass
too

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
too

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.039 
too
you<00:02:13.439> can<00:02:13.590> wipe<00:02:13.829> it<00:02:14.069> down<00:02:14.280> easily<00:02:14.750> another<00:02:15.750> good
