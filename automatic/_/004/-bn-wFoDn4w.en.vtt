00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
let's start off with family dinners I

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.730 
let's start off with family dinners I
would<00:00:17.720> probably<00:00:17.869> stick<00:00:18.170> something<00:00:18.529> with<00:00:18.710> a

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
would probably stick something with a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.960 
would probably stick something with a
little<00:00:18.949> bit<00:00:19.160> more<00:00:19.279> of<00:00:19.369> a<00:00:19.430> higher<00:00:19.670> neckline

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
little bit more of a higher neckline

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.849 
little bit more of a higher neckline
because<00:00:20.359> the<00:00:20.869> last<00:00:21.050> thing<00:00:21.230> you'd<00:00:21.410> want<00:00:21.679> is

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
because the last thing you'd want is

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.159 
because the last thing you'd want is
things<00:00:22.310> peeking<00:00:22.789> out<00:00:22.910> of<00:00:23.179> your<00:00:23.660> dress<00:00:23.900> or

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
things peeking out of your dress or

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.009 
things peeking out of your dress or
whatever<00:00:24.679> you're<00:00:24.859> wearing<00:00:25.039> I<00:00:26.029> would<00:00:26.779> stick<00:00:26.990> to

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
whatever you're wearing I would stick to

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.540 
whatever you're wearing I would stick to
things<00:00:27.289> a<00:00:27.439> little<00:00:27.619> bit<00:00:27.800> more<00:00:27.859> conservative

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
things a little bit more conservative

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.159 
things a little bit more conservative
because<00:00:28.820> there<00:00:29.390> aren't<00:00:29.599> gonna<00:00:29.779> be<00:00:29.869> photos

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
because there aren't gonna be photos

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.080 
because there aren't gonna be photos
taken<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:30.589> they're<00:00:30.679> gonna<00:00:30.829> be<00:00:31.070> embedded<00:00:31.939> in

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
taken and they're gonna be embedded in

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.520 
taken and they're gonna be embedded in
the<00:00:32.360> photo<00:00:32.599> album<00:00:32.810> forever

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
the photo album forever

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.020 
the photo album forever
I<00:00:33.800> think<00:00:34.130> it's<00:00:34.250> important<00:00:34.610> to<00:00:34.700> wear<00:00:34.790> something

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
I think it's important to wear something

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.729 
I think it's important to wear something
a<00:00:35.180> little<00:00:35.329> bit<00:00:35.420> more<00:00:35.450> comfortable<00:00:35.960> because<00:00:36.260> it

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
a little bit more comfortable because it

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.650 
a little bit more comfortable because it
is<00:00:36.859> a<00:00:36.890> family<00:00:37.129> dinner<00:00:37.399> and<00:00:37.789> there's<00:00:38.300> gonna<00:00:38.449> be

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
is a family dinner and there's gonna be

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.380 
is a family dinner and there's gonna be
a<00:00:38.690> lot<00:00:39.079> of<00:00:39.230> good<00:00:39.559> food<00:00:42.789> if<00:00:43.789> you<00:00:43.940> guys<00:00:44.090> didn't
