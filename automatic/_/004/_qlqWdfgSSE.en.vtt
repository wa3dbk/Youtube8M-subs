00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.879
 that he is somewhere 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.879
 but he doesn't see that 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.939
 but the fear is not 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.939
 short video

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.659
 the low ant sometimes got worse 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.659
