00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.859
 want other beautiful love heartily 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.830
 Welcome to the Thursday accessories test 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:16.890
 today with this grandiose 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:18.000
 memory card by mobi mobi many of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.010
 you may already have heard of it 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.340
 of these free tickets are in the end 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.769
 the memory cards as integrated wlan 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.230
 have or establish a wireless connection 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.500
 with for example a smartphone 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.620
 tablet or desktop computers this 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.480
 Ruby cards can only do that 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.820
 with mobile devices like for example 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.260
 They chose tablets or smartphones 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.660
 even mobile or mobile 8gb has this 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.360
 card space is also bigger and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.829
 it is so that now almost pictures completely 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.739
 normal camera to be made 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.430
 For example, I often do so early and jpeg 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.010
 jpeg if they are almost directly over 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.140
 wirelessly transmitted 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.650
 on the device for example an iphone 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.930
 or another photo other smartphone 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.390
 and there are then directly to the pictures too 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.010
 see the jpeg just made 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.310
 have been and the problem now I have to 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.360
 only briefly how does the map work 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.270
 just plug it in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 then the camera automatically recognizes ok 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.880
 here is a free ticket in it 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.040
 this will appear in the menu here at the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.420
 70 the actual wlan has but at 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.509
 For example, no cameras 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.280
 Wlan it is very interesting 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.189
 you just click on setting 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.710
 this setting so the yellow menu 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.909
 almost at canon germany simply 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.430
 Simply transfer that one must 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.420
 activate 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.420
 Then there is an app for free 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.070
 in the app store for the different ones 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.930
 I use the app briefly 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.420
 out 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.799
 down here that looks like on ice 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.180
 best you look again before in the 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.799
 wlan attitudes that he too 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.869
 She had mostly found a card 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.490
 he connects automatically but can be 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.009
 that does not happen because of that 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.479
 eagerly looking for art 61 blabla here 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.340
 now here, for example, just click 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.539
 then it had the connection with it 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.290
 go back to the app and then this 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.290
 here if the thing above is green the picture 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.330
 connected one draws the picture here because 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.200
 she just did just that 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.950
 camera you just puts 4 maik sneeze still 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.750
 a little bit higher 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.860
 you can take photographs as normal 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.470
 Be on the eight gigabyte card 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.819
 stored jetpacks become almost direct 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.819
 transferred here on 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.510
 oh yes, since the picture is just that 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.359
 make the next time to see 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.540
 how fast that works when the 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:46.209
 device has the next picture already from 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.790
 nike is really good for example if you are 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.140
 either had a shooting eg customer 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.200
 or 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.850
 even in private matters where just someone 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.810
 it is the like to look at 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.100
 you just want to do that and give it 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.110
 smartphone in the hand or the tablet 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.520
 in the hand of that can then hold and 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.780
 look at the pictures directly to cook or too 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.640
 for yourself a nice control 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.730
 outside the screen, the pictures 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.980
 to look again if you have a camera 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.520
 like this one in this example 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.110
 it briefly the multiple memory slots 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.020
 has, for example, the canon 5d 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.030
 mark three, he must have a cf place and a 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.640
 sd-card slot is there you can on the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.570
 cf card for example only of files 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:29.320
 save and on the eye fi card or 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.760
 You can get a hand out of a card 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.040
 just save the jetpacks and directly 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.010
 We'll send it over here 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.010
 cards slot 2 the eye fi cards slot 1 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.580
 quite normal in the menu just behind 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.019
 Select the Ross and the Jetpacks 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.910
 save separately 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.370
 you need to fear on memory card the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.760
 jetpacks on memory card two 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.080
 Activate everything 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.140
 okay okay now he shows me behind 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:01.750
 at only two times activated what my photo 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.040
 from now you have me the picture directly 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.019
 send her on 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.920
 and there it is already directly 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.720
 charged and tablet comes naturally 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.579
 even cooler here we take care of that 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:20.410
 Direct view was just a picture of 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:21.700
 mike sexton short moment he is and 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.050
 the smaller the pictures are so to 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.570
 Example of a check was quite normal 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.979
 and jpegs in it, for example, then goes 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.780
 The transfer also much faster 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.729
 here sets the picture and on one 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.190
 Of course, this results in a tray 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.240
 again much much cooler and the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.710
 it works well, you can do it too 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.390
 simply take several pictures now 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.850
 all slowly behind and played 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.660
 right here over you can now directly 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.740
 agree back to this 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.860
 you can make it even better 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.170
 right here he says everything now 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.570
 completed and showed here now the 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.660
 Pictures were made to the straight 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.490
 a conception of the eifel mobile sd card 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.200
 offers a great opportunity its dslr 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.640
 Equipped with wlan without equal 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.720
 to buy a new camera 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.940
 the operation is easy and intuitive 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.250
 was there to control the sharpness or 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.530
 to view for customers the card affords 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.160
 a good service from me there are four 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.810
 there are five gsg deduction because it is 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.310
 just works mobile and also 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.600
 so nice if it was on the desktop 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.810
 would work 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.980
 but they are working on getting better 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.870
 desktop computer will be soon 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.720
 hopefully it supports a beta 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.470
 currently in the test phase for windows 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.960
 costs 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.100
 That was part of the test for this week 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.090
 if you like it gives you one 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.470
 Thumbs up might have been 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.000
 Experiences made with the zeal cards 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.460
 then write is just down in the 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.780
 video description the other videos on 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.840
 and gives his side also the others 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.730
 opponent channels and facebook and twitter 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.140
 around a canal and so on everything around 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.140
 in the video description
