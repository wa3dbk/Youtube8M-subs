of<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.790> thingy<00:01:18.950> let<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.240> an

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
of this thingy let see this is an

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.560 
of this thingy let see this is an
optical<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.509> coaxial<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.530> DVI<00:01:26.460> input<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.450> then

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
optical in coaxial in DVI input and then

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.859 
optical in coaxial in DVI input and then
HDMI<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.710> optical<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.460> coaxial<00:01:30.119> power<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
HDMI out optical out coaxial power and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.149 
HDMI out optical out coaxial power and
then<00:01:31.170> there's<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> little<00:01:31.650> switch<00:01:31.860> over<00:01:32.100> here

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
then there's a little switch over here

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.390 
then there's a little switch over here
for<00:01:32.520> power<00:01:33.420> run<00:01:33.890> yeah<00:01:36.829> that<00:01:37.829> third<00:01:38.159> light

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
for power run yeah that third light

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.539 
for power run yeah that third light
should<00:01:38.610> light<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.820> once<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.360> detects<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.549> yep

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
should light up once it detects it yep

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.289 
should light up once it detects it yep
there<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:43.280> basically<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:44.939> how<00:01:45.060> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
there it is basically this is how it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:45.620 
there it is basically this is how it
works

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
works

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.950 
works

this<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.530> HDMI<00:02:06.950> port<00:02:07.210> because<00:02:08.210> it's<00:02:08.360> an

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
this is the HDMI port because it's an

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.760 
this is the HDMI port because it's an
HDMI<00:02:08.660> cable<00:02:09.640> HDMI<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.880> DVI<00:02:10.960> cable<00:02:11.960> it<00:02:12.560> goes

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
HDMI cable HDMI to DVI cable it goes

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.310 
HDMI cable HDMI to DVI cable it goes
right<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.130> here<00:02:13.490> basically<00:02:14.030> HDMI<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.080> same

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
right to here basically HDMI is the same

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.820 
right to here basically HDMI is the same
as<00:02:15.590> DVI<00:02:15.950> except<00:02:16.400> HDMI<00:02:17.210> carries<00:02:17.600> audio<00:02:17.990> DVI

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
as DVI except HDMI carries audio DVI

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.690 
as DVI except HDMI carries audio DVI
does<00:02:19.130> not<00:02:19.310> once<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.390> goes<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.930> here<00:02:20.960> is

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
does not once it goes in here is

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.550 
does not once it goes in here is
whatever's<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:22.820> ear<00:02:23.030> converts<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.960> adds

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
whatever's in ear converts it and adds

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.850 
whatever's in ear converts it and adds
this<00:02:24.860> audio<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.600> stream<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.290> it

card<00:02:53.000> all<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.900> way<00:02:53.990> back<00:02:54.230> there<00:02:54.500> yeah<00:02:54.860> I'll

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
card all the way back there yeah I'll

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:05.020 
card all the way back there yeah I'll
say<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:57.410> connects<00:03:02.890> yeah<00:03:03.890> it's<00:03:04.100> really<00:03:04.610> hard<00:03:04.850> to

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
say it connects yeah it's really hard to

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.430 
say it connects yeah it's really hard to
see<00:03:05.890> but<00:03:06.890> uh<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:08.209> further<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.170> black<00:03:09.380> one

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
see but uh the further one the black one

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.360 
see but uh the further one the black one
is<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.400> input<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.170> HDMI<00:03:12.170> cable<00:03:12.560> closest<00:03:13.130> the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
is the input and HDMI cable closest the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.860 
is the input and HDMI cable closest the
grey<00:03:13.670> one<00:03:13.940> is<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.950> output<00:03:16.209> basically<00:03:17.209> goes<00:03:17.660> in

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
grey one is the output basically goes in

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.949 
grey one is the output basically goes in
and<00:03:18.110> outputs<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.950> then<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.250> grey<00:03:20.180> one<00:03:20.390> goes

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
and outputs and then this grey one goes

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.470 
and outputs and then this grey one goes
to<00:03:21.550> my<00:03:22.550> 3d<00:03:23.209> display<00:03:24.040> port<00:03:25.040> number<00:03:25.310> two<00:03:25.580> port

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
to my 3d display port number two port

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.509 
to my 3d display port number two port
number<00:03:26.720> one<00:03:26.900> has<00:03:27.200> two<00:03:27.440> other<00:03:27.590> HDMI<00:03:28.130> so<00:03:28.340> when<00:03:28.489> I

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
number one has two other HDMI so when I

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.820 
number one has two other HDMI so when I
don't<00:03:28.760> want<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:29.000> use<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.239> Box<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:30.440> know<00:03:30.560> cuz<00:03:30.769> I

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
don't want to use the Box you know cuz I

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
don't want to use the Box you know cuz I
don't<00:03:30.950> want<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.130> keep<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.340> on<00:03:31.430> all<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.820> time

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
don't want to keep it on all the time

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.759 
don't want to keep it on all the time
you<00:03:32.180> know<00:03:32.299> when<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.049> don't<00:03:33.170> want<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.470> use<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:33.590> I

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
you know when I don't want to use that I

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.250 
you know when I don't want to use that I
just<00:03:34.040> switch<00:03:34.220> out<00:03:34.430> right<00:03:34.910> here<00:03:35.150> this<00:03:35.660> is<00:03:35.780> HDMI

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
just switch out right here this is HDMI

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.020 
just switch out right here this is HDMI
all<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.590> do<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.920> switch<00:03:37.160> out<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.610> backs<00:03:37.820> and

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
all I do is switch out the backs and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.470 
all I do is switch out the backs and
that's<00:03:38.120> it

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
that's it

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.860 
that's it
and<00:03:39.370> that's<00:03:40.370> pretty<00:03:41.060> much<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.510> just<00:03:41.720> switch

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
and that's pretty much it I just switch

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.280 
and that's pretty much it I just switch
them<00:03:41.989> out<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:42.410> just<00:03:43.370> switch<00:03:43.580> out<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:44.290> optical

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
them out and just switch out the optical

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.380 
them out and just switch out the optical
port<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:45.830> put<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.430> back<00:03:46.760> into<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.209> back<00:03:47.360> of

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
port and put it back into the back of

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.410 
port and put it back into the back of
the<00:03:47.600> three<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.870> ps3<00:03:48.470> my<00:03:48.650> Triton<00:03:49.280> ones<00:03:49.549> back<00:03:50.269> in

that it's not that expensive but uh it's
well<00:04:47.950> worth<00:04:48.130> it<00:04:48.310> because<00:04:48.340> HDMI<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.180> cleaner

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
well worth it because HDMI is cleaner

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.010 
well worth it because HDMI is cleaner
clearer<00:04:50.440> sharper<00:04:51.330> everything<00:04:52.330> are<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:55.330> if

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
clearer sharper everything are and if

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.570 
clearer sharper everything are and if

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
you don't want to use component like if

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.010 
you don't want to use component like if
it<00:04:57.700> just<00:04:57.880> doesn't<00:04:58.270> work<00:04:58.360> out<00:04:58.570> for<00:04:58.600> you<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:58.810> mean

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
component cables and you want to like

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.219 
component cables and you want to like
you<00:05:04.150> know<00:05:04.240> if<00:05:04.450> you<00:05:04.540> want<00:05:04.690> to<00:05:04.750> share<00:05:05.020> it<00:05:05.140> because

like this monitor has two HDMI and a DVI
you<00:05:08.470> know<00:05:08.590> no<00:05:09.100> component<00:05:09.610> so<00:05:09.820> how<00:05:10.600> it<00:05:10.840> would

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
you know no component so how it would

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.420
