00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.170
 is 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.750
 hello girls good life today the unit 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.030
 do it yourself I recorded a video do 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.680
 yourself about a month ago and 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.480
 I explained to you how to make a 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.199
 homemaker in less than five 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.720
 minutes 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.089
 and today I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.119
 a good thermal water for those who do not know 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.519
 thermal water is a water that has several 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.099
 minerals and she 's very famous now 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.030
 okay if that day of bloggers recipe 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:39.050
 and it serves to soothe and relax the skin 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.449
 moisturize the skin to take oxidation of the skin and 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.489
 prevents against aging then 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.739
 her wonderful water a water that has 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.019
 various utilities and something you have 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.149
 that you are always using something that you 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.980
 It's gotta be good, I think I can give it to you. 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.570
 how to do it in a very practical way 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.399
 It's very quickly 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.649
 it's things that you're at home even 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.359
 very simple materials and all 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.519
 the materials I'm going to use I've spent 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.310
 less than ten reais, in fact I'm just going 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.540
 use two materials and the first is tea 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.520
 camomile 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.520
 So, despite chamomile tea to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.439
 make this water and ocha is ready and 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.090
 son had normally with you do 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.840
 normal at home even 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.140
 I bought the janitor if in that box 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.750
 here it is from the marathon she came 10 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.180
 Sachets but I'll just need me 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.710
 so if you get home a purse 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.350
 a sachet in case you can do more 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.869
 as I had not I bought a wide 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.439
 little water normal water even 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:46.909
 faucet even and you will is if she just 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:50.030
 up to here three old 4 of linens and one 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.549
 What I have is this. 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.560
 here you can use a normal pot 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.200
 that you have to put thermal water 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.420
 but the mega you use ric said that the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.950
 spray is more practical at the time of flight 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.119
 that you will apply 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.140
 so I bought this spray here 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:11.020
 this little box was 3 50 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.690
 50 also then gave seven reais all 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.930
 so with 7 anger to you a water 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.120
 well the process of preparation is 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.490
 very fast in less than five minutes 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.530
 perhaps beyond doubt 15 minutes 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.660
 I explain step by step 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.490
 explaining that the thermal water explains 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.050
 still like arrow use 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.990
 but if you're going to do it at home 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.800
 production process lasts less than five 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.790
 minutes 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.120
 You'll get the spray bottle first. 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.020
 digital mind and put chamomile tea 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.209
 You already left coordination ready 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.180
 motor to vote it in here but 0 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.459
 Finally the chamomile tea has to be 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.459
 so cool then, after you 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.620
 preparing the tea is cool you leave it 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.560
 a little bit in the refrigerator you leave 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.150
 it cools naturally even 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.760
 Anyway, I've already voted for tea. 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.810
 camomile รณ tongue out field but nothing 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.019
 and other're well and now I'll put water 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.900
 normal you will not put the four of 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.579
 whole linens you will vote little 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.519
 because otherwise it will take the effect of 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:23.350
 food and he will sing my love of god 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.690
 People are also super right about when 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.760
 you swing do not drop water 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.650
 or a disaster happened then you 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.750
 are to overcome is going just right 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.000
 provide a well balanced one dinho 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.090
 I do not recommend mixing you guys 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.470
 make this move because you're going 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.510
 sway too much 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.299
 so it's cool to use this mix line 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.670
 ascenso levinho and now do not know 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.500
 is ready is a good tip 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.890
 quickie a tip you can do 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.530
 at home with great practicality and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.170
 cool you use in thermal water always 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.760
 always before passing the moisturizer 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.500
 You can use it before bed too. 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.450
 because it is great for cleaning the skin 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.730
 then to take all the waste out of 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.070
 7 day- a-day makeup is good you 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.359
 would be using it and it 's very cool you 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.000
 also use after you 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.620

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.760
 to hold 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.360
 but the average both you can use the 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.760

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.560
 I say it is a thermal water for skin and 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.910

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.560

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.420

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.790

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.610

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.800
