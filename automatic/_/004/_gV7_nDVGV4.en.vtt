00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.910
 hi how about 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.320
 Today I want us to see how the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.130
 diagrams for 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.970
 let's interpret them and we can have 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.020
 many more patterns 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.850
 no need to d 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.150
 read all the instructions of each 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.660
 back where to have them written 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.779
 let's start with this with 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.289
 that is very simple here what we are going to 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.300
 see is 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.180
 to work simply points of the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.700
 right and upside down 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.240
 to make these hearts I've done it 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.320
 more or less large 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.320
 differentiate well 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.240
 the background of him 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.480
 and this goes to us if we learn to do this 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.650
 well that is my intention is going to 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.480
 teach to be able to weave soon 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:04.510
 what is called interest 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.780
 what is a big figure 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.110
 in a fabric that is made in another 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.110
 colour 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.370
 then that is different from the ya card or the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.760
 fer the one that is those little cartoons 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.970
 that we see Norwegian type 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.620
 in two colors or three or four 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.680
 this would not this indarte then this 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.070
 is going to be our first step to then 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.880
 learn to knit in two colors figures 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.939
 big like that 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.909
 well the first thing they have to know is 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.930
 that basically all the points are 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.660
 they can do in a diagram like 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.690
 what we need is to have a role 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.470
 grid and each table goes to 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.470
 represent 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.000
 each line is one turn and each frame 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.570
 it's a point but how do you start reading 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.300
 the diagram 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.580
 we have it that way in front of us we are always going to 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.580
 start from right to left 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.370
 It is our first point 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.129
 234 etc. 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.459
 in the next turn that would be a 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.860
 back to reading the make of 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.300
 left to right ie the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.150
 opposite and so we go 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.900
 moving forward we always start from right to 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.349
 left and continue left 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.860
 in this case of this diagram as you see 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.040
 all the turns are woven following 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.090
 these indications 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:50.409
 there will be diagrams where it is explained 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.670
 let it be said that the even turns by 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.709
 example are all upside down 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.810
 and that is not included in the diagram 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.940
 it can also happen but that should 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.580
 come in 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.690
 so with this diagram we have weave 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.690
 this heart 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.560
 and that just because it's right and 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.560
 backwards it is reversible 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.810
 it would be on the other side 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.550
 this example has 25 points in 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.670
 total 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.350
 Y 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.490
 a total of 23 laps 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.490
 and let's start 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.740
 the simplest is 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:48.180
 tell 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:50.819
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 points 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.620
 of the right or of the reverse depending on 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:58.459
 what the boss tells us or what 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.459
 we want to make a point to the contrary 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.209
 I think they were 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.530
 12 then 12 12 and the middle one for 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.530
 have the 25 that we ride 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.160
 in this example as you will see I am 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.000
 weaving I have knitted 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.520
 of the right and the heart in reverse point 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 now we can do the opposite to 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.660
 that they see 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.950
 how is it 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.950
 then 12 points 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.740
 I'm puncturing the point like that because 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:48.289
 there was tissue of the continental form 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.289
 Now I'm knitting 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.840
 which is how most of you weave 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.600
 and here would come our first right 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.600
 what is this 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.690
 12 more 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.240
 until the end we see each other now 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.630
 we have woven this first round 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.480
 we got here now we're going to have 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.680
 the next one we start here from 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:42.129
 left to right and here I go 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:45.160
 story 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:47.230
 11 3 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.130
 and 11 because this is this pattern is 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.130
 simply symmetrical 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:00.110
 exactly 11 3 and 11 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:03.529
 if we have decided that the boxes in 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.580
 white are the right then it means 11 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.789
 straight 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.239
 the crosses mean reverse 3 reverse 11 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.239
 straight 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.280
 in each round they will continue to increase as 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.280
 come here the number of backhand points 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.809
 means in him 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.590
 the beginning of him 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.590
 of the heart 12 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:41.050
 11 exact had a reverse that is this 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.050
 now I will have 3 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.910
 and still be right 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.740
 we've done the first one starting from 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.700
 right to left the second of 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.510
 left to right we go to the third 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.580
 here the number of 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:07.240
 points of the reverse the last time we made 3 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.180
 now I would play in 5 then on each side 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:13.440
 3. 4. 5 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:15.600
 ten and twenty twenty-five 25 is not of 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.850
 more to count the total always for not 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.900
 lose us lose us forgiveness and so 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.780
 successively then 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.370
 This is the way 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:29.510
 to weave the 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:32.229
 the heart this this diagram I'm going 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.229
 to leave on the blog 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.069
 www.google.com I hope you practice it 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.069
 you like and see you at the next 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.069
 Thank you
