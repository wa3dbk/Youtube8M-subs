on overnight and this morning i rinsed
it<00:04:15.420> out<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:16.109> went<00:04:16.440> for<00:04:17.400> my<00:04:17.540> six<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.810> half

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
it out and I went for my six and a half

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.219 
it out and I went for my six and a half
mile<00:04:19.290> walk<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:20.450> needless<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.479> say<00:04:21.720> my<00:04:21.750> hair<00:04:22.139> is

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
mile walk so needless to say my hair is

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.290 
mile walk so needless to say my hair is
just<00:04:22.290> a<00:04:22.500> little<00:04:22.680> bit<00:04:22.770> out<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:22.889> control<00:04:23.220> but<00:04:23.520> my

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
just a little bit out of control but my

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.150 
just a little bit out of control but my
point<00:04:24.600> of<00:04:24.720> doing<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.050> deep<00:04:25.229> condition<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:25.979> the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
point of doing the deep condition is the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.950 
point of doing the deep condition is the
fact<00:04:26.340> that<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.580> leaves<00:04:26.760> your<00:04:26.970> hair<00:04:27.180> extremely

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
fact that it leaves your hair extremely

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.020 
fact that it leaves your hair extremely
soft<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.680> moisturized<00:04:29.550> because<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:29.850> really

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
soft and moisturized because I really

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.490 
soft and moisturized because I really
don't<00:04:30.180> have<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.330> lot<00:04:30.540> of<00:04:30.570> product<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.110> can<00:04:31.229> kind

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
don't have a lot of product you can kind

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.570 
don't have a lot of product you can kind
of<00:04:31.560> tell<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:31.979> because<00:04:32.070> my<00:04:32.250> hair<00:04:32.400> does<00:04:32.550> look

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
of tell that because my hair does look

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.390 
of tell that because my hair does look
dry<00:04:32.940> but<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.990> leaves<00:04:34.229> my<00:04:34.470> hair<00:04:34.680> feeling<00:04:35.010> so

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
dry but it leaves my hair feeling so

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.969

up<00:04:47.610> really<00:04:48.030> liking<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.510> macadamia<00:04:49.080> um<00:04:50.030> deep

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
up really liking the macadamia um deep

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.550 
up really liking the macadamia um deep
repair<00:04:51.560> masque<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:54.090> it's<00:04:54.750> expensive<00:04:55.110> i<00:04:55.350> think

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
repair masque so it's expensive i think

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.290 
repair masque so it's expensive i think
it's<00:04:55.680> about<00:04:55.740> twenty<00:04:56.100> eight<00:04:56.220> dollars<00:04:56.250> but<00:04:56.820> i'll

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
it's about twenty eight dollars but i'll

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.730 
it's about twenty eight dollars but i'll
only<00:04:57.450> be<00:04:57.600> using<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:57.990> once<00:04:58.169> or<00:04:58.260> twice<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:58.470> month

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
only be using it once or twice a month

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.589 
only be using it once or twice a month
so<00:04:59.160> that's<00:05:00.060> um<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:01.289> upside<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.889> that<00:05:01.940> so<00:05:02.940> end

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
so that's um the upside to that so end

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.409 
so that's um the upside to that so end
result<00:05:04.200> to<00:05:04.470> my<00:05:04.620> deep<00:05:04.800> conditioned<00:05:05.280> leaves<00:05:06.210> my
