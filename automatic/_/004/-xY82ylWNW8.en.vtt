00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 Hmm 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.600
 hello friends , this day we will be 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.540
 talking about the defense well name well in 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.850
 1825 the Jew aaron ringo performed a 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.579
 complete monograph on the variant and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.500
 decided to call it the pnn that in 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.670
 Hebrew means son of mine 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.400
 efforts 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.769
 this defense leads to an active game where 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.350
 black look for unbalanced positions 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.309
 without strategic possibilities and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.829
 tactics 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.920
 for being an ambitious defense was 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.039
 used by players as such fischer 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.619
 kasparov topalov among others 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.039
 this defense was present in the meter 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.570
 for the 1972 world title between 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:15.660
 fischer spassky and in mexico of 1996 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.270
 between karpov and dogs that this was also 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.090
 one of the favorite weapons of the great vugar 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.580
 gashimov recently deceased 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.710
 the basic idea of benoni is to seek the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.740
 control of the center distance 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.440
 in this way compared to the four 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.410
 follow with the horse at f6 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.849
 inspects the house is 4 leading the white 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.489
 to play on 6 4 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.220
 seeking control of the central house of 5 

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:43.619
 from now on the black 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.479
 intend to push white people forward 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.610
 of 5 for both continues with bids and 5 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.500
 here the black menace is to capture the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.289
 central pawn of white with a pawn 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.009
 side if the first player resolves 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:01.950
 take on 5 black has a game 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.509
 calm after the advance and 6 recovering 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.950
 the material with advantage in 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.959
 development 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.720
 note that white is not possible 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:13.260
 this role in the case 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.030
 example of playing in biscuit and 3 in addition to 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.410
 development. 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.590
 of parts 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.930
 we could follow with the horse in a 6 if 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.930
 instead the white tries 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.470
 supporting the same with b4 we could 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.780
 continue to advance to 5 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.230
 if the white ones continue with the horse in 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.810
 f3 and black capture in 4 we pass 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.620
 the English opening variant well 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.129
 name 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.950
 if the white ones follow with the horse in f3 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:47.519
 and black ones instead of capturing 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.799
 four play for example and 6 white ones 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.260
 can return in the lines of defense 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.500
 well playing name of 5 or continue 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.810
 for example with e 3 or horse in 63 which 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.220
 could carry example defense 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.920
 Semitic hashish 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.379
 after 5 if the white advances and 3 case 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.720
 the black ones so wish can pass the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.780
 attack lines to 9 another link from the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.870
 defense expensive kano playing the pawn by of 4 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.579
 champion for four of five of them 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.040
 other possibilities 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.739
 the most usual is for whites to continue 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.290
 with the advance of 5 leaving open the 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.510
 possibility of black opting for the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.510
 Gambit bank the volga with the b5 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.959
 besides this option blacks can be 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.140
 to decide between modern benoni and benoni 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.239
 that starts with five being one 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.459
 variant that is much more solid than 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.569
 abandon modern but it is also more 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.090
 passive 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.669
 the half game that comes from this line is 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.220
 characterized by many maneuvers in the 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:57.450
 Most black lines look for 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.709
 break the b7 b5 f7 f5 after due 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.379
 preparation 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.709
 white can follow with the 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:10.169
 horse development in 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:14.849
 34 h3 inspecting the house g4 bishop in d 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:20.639
 3 the horse in f3eg 4 to gain space 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:23.400
 in the ward of the king prevent f5 already well name 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.039
 with the advancement of 6 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.860
 this line is so named because 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.300
 we have where benoni the ancient benoni where 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.300
 compared to 4 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:38.039
 blacks play 65 directly without the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.530
 previous horse in f6 initially we go 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.889
 stick to the modern variant where with 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.860
 6 advance the blacks want to get the 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.610
 column and semi-open to activate their 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.610
 king's tower 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.559
 in this situation 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:59.819
 usually white do not capture and 6 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:02.039
 2 after pawn per and 6 pawn per and 6 as 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.559
 have the possibility of obtaining a 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:07.379
 strong center and activate their bishops 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:10.259
 against the position of the opposing king 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:13.319
 have the column fcn open for 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:16.860
 its tower say for example that 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:20.039
 follow the horse on f3 v5 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.860
 attack the pawn down 4 and after having 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.860
 b5 black can play from 5 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.969
 if after b5 instead of capturing the pawn 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:34.499
 White plays and 3 could follow 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:39.319
 champion for 6 4 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:39.319
 bishop for 6/4 and again 5 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:45.149
 so after and 6 whites 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.360
 develop their ladies horse and 3 and 

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:51.719
 we followed champion by 5 pawn by 5 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.349
 and from 6 where we reached the main position 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:58.439
 of defense in its modern variant 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:01.050
 instead of advancing from 6 black ones too 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:03.419
 have at your disposal the variant snake ' 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.550
 which begins with the bishop in 16 who 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.169
 although it looks a bit like 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.050
 how weird it was enough 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.089
 employed by vugar gashimov being 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.870
 also adopted by players like 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:18.509
 carjacking radjabov anamt among others 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.680
 We will concentrate for the moment. 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:24.869
 in the main variant with 16 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.459
 here it is evident that whites 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:29.699
 space advantage 

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:32.249
 the black bishop df 8 ended closed and 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.939
 the blacks have a pawn late in 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:35.430
 6 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:38.669
 on the other hand black has 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.219
 space advantage in the lady's wing sector 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.889
 where he owns the majority of pedestrians who 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:46.800
 can advance by gaining more space 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:50.009
 In addition, the second player has the 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.439
 column and semi open and can play g6 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.689
 to develop his bishop through the 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:57.029
 large diagonal that is open 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:59.990
 pressing in this way in the center and 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:59.990
 in the lady's ward 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.370
 white women in turn have the majority 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.160
 pedestrians in the center and can try to win 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.830
 space in the king's wing preparing advance and 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.520
 5 at the same time as they seek to explore 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.620
 the weakness of the pawn of 6 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:21.630
 to take advantage of homes and four to 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:24.880
 the black game against the lady's wing 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:28.480
