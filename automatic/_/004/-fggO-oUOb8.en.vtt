00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.110
 we were initially preparing 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.100
 projects for other personalities 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.770
 indirectly we met his 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.970
 representative and we access him and what 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.160
 we got into a project of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.930
 investigation and finally that consolidated 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.460
 an ideal house for him he was 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.439
 also looking for a place to live 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.009
 permanently in Barcelona and this was 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.009
 the opportunity 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.350
 and I imagine that because of the essence of 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.000
 architecture I believe that in the past 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.649
 years before perhaps less in the past 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.930
 years my adventure has become very 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.420
 symbolic because I want the symbol 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.309
 represent the intrinsic nature of 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.199
 a city of a character of a 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.760
 person in general then what 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.019
 try in my architecture with the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.190
 independence of many others 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.680
 factors is that 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.210
 have the ability to thrill and over 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.579
 everything to make its occupants happy 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.030
 then the symbolism helps me 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.950
 very much then trying to get 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.520
 the essence of a person I create forms 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.530
 intrinsically related to her I 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.380
 I think this excited him as messi 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.420
 It excites other clients of mine because 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.220
 we really believe and he identified that 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.750
 the house is very much related to him 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.950
 with his idiosyncrasy with his personality 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.950
 with their own torments 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.060
 well it's not a single symbol when 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.240
 we make a building we do not just use 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.850
 a symbol usually I forced my 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.130
 I collaborate with myself to my students 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 etcetera to at least identify 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.360
 20 related symbols are some more 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.670
 directly others more indirectly 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.440
 with the certain personality in the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.060
 case of messi the same thing happened there 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.440
 with about 20 symbols I would say that the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.590
 most important symbol of the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.080
 Messi's personality is the duality in 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.570
 the duality and also the tenacity the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.580
 Self-demand is a person who has gone 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.440
 from little to more and has had to demand 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.660
 himself very much and he is followed 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.340
 demanding though I thought a lot and a lot 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.530
 people think it's a talent really 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.140
 there is suffering and a job 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.090
 continued and all that in his house 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.780
 the main symbolism of his house was 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.620
 Duality 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.790
 the ethereal I solidify the water in the earth 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.459
 the right the left the whole project 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.010
 they have like two faces and then put 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.800
 there are obvious symbols number 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.760
 ten so loved per month and own 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.560
 symbology that this number implies the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.040
 own sphere the soccer ball itself 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.530
 the forcefulness the roundness the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.930
 self-imposed in the house is full of 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.130
 symbols and it really is something complex of 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.130
 explain all of them there are almost 20 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.490
 because the house is a structure like 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.230
 all I do because that's a 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.510
 invariant mine all the houses that I 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.100
 I make are removable that is to say all the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.530
 houses are composed on the basis of 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.170
 prefabricated concrete elements 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.610
 steel and wood in all my 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.870
 architecture is made so the m if it is 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.660
 so then it's a structure 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.840
 important in the form of a hexagon with 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.400
 large centrifugal arches that supports 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.770
 turn other sharp elements 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.880
 metallic ones that in turn 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.160
 they hold an eternity the beams 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.230
 alveolar in the characteristic of being 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.000
 prefabricated and disassembled elements that 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.920
 can be disassembled say can be 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.600
 mount with screws very quickly and 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.400
 you can dismantle what I'm looking for 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.470
 with this is the null impact 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.800
 environmental a house very well 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.120
 studied makes one feel 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.610
 fully integrated with nature 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.440
 is going to change the way you see the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.460
 nature your way of seeing the human you 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.960
 way of seeing life 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.790
 you can transcend as a human 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.710
 living a house perfectly 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.050
 bioclimatic because you are going to feel the 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.450
 pulsar of nature will vibrate 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.910
 like nature and you are going to transcend 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.030
 as a human being this is very important for 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.030
 my
