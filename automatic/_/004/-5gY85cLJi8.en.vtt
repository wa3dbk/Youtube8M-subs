00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.250
 very tasty and autumn what could be 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.410
 better than apple pie 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.049

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.720

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.880
 nutmeg plain flour sugar 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.750
 preferably demerara crude 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.190
 cane and unsalted butter we take 350 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.530
 gram flour 250 grams of butter and mix 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.879
 all this in a bowl for convenience I cut 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.879
 butter into pieces 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:55.420
 add one tablespoon of salt 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.420
 sugar and start all things stir 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.870
 then add 150 milliliters cold 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.510
 ice water and mix again divide 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.400
 dough into two equal parts wrapped in 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.580
 food film and leave in 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.620
 the fridge for about 30 minutes 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.300
 time we take our apples well them 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.100
 fight we clear the peel and core 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.100
 seeds and cut into slices 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.960
 squeeze the juice of one lemon to 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.200
 apples do not oxidize 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.759
 and didn't turn brown now we 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.470
 melt 50 grams unsalted butter 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.340
 add 100 grams of cane sugar 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.210
 cinnamon nutmeg and when you see 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.110
 bubbles add half of our apples 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.459
 mix and leave on a small 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.459
 fire for 10 minutes 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.120
 it's time to preheat the oven at 190 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.469
 degrees but in the meantime you can 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.480
 start rolling out the dough add 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:31.599
 the remaining apples leave them still on 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.730
 four minutes put the dough in the form 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.700
 and top our apples with gravy 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.409
 the top can be different or aimed 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.930
 dough can make patterns but i 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.930
 opted for braids 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.500
 pass the forks around the edges to make a pie 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.500
 looked more neat 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.290
 sprinkle sugar on top 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.290
 powdered and cinnamon 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.769
 send our cake in the oven at 50 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.269
 minutes at 190 degrees 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.160
 from the remaining dough I twisted 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.510
 croissants although of course they should be 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.510
 really puff pastry 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.930
