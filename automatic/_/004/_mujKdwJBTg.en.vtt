these pages I previously made a video on

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.779 
these pages I previously made a video on
this<00:00:24.960> before<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:25.619> many<00:00:25.890> commenters<00:00:26.519> have

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this before but many commenters have

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.519 
this before but many commenters have
said<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.570> script<00:00:27.900> does<00:00:28.080> not<00:00:28.260> work<00:00:28.500> very

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
said that the script does not work very

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.790 
said that the script does not work very
well<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.420> agree<00:00:30.420> as<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> very<00:00:31.260> room<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
well I agree as it was a very room and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.250 
well I agree as it was a very room and
rudimentary<00:00:32.640> implementation<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.750> had<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> lot

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
rudimentary implementation and had a lot

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.250 
rudimentary implementation and had a lot
of<00:00:34.290> bugs<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> developed<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.660> new<00:00:36.930> version

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.350 

this<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.469> what<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> code<00:00:41.100> looks<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.730> i'll

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
this is what the code looks like i'll

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990 
this is what the code looks like i'll
explain<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.320> minute<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:44.489> first<00:00:44.670> let<00:00:44.969> me

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
explain it in a minute but first let me

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
explain it in a minute but first let me
show<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.300> how<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.780> works<00:00:45.989> when<00:00:46.350> you're<00:00:47.280> in

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
show you how it works when you're in

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.549 
show you how it works when you're in
windows<00:00:47.700> explorer<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.050> want<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.320> create

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
windows explorer and you want to create

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.700 
windows explorer and you want to create
a<00:00:49.620> new<00:00:49.770> folder<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.430> usually<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.120> go

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
a new folder you usually have to go

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.740 
a new folder you usually have to go
right<00:00:52.710> click<00:00:53.010> new<00:00:53.850> folder<00:00:55.190> if<00:00:56.750> you're

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
right click new folder if you're

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.330 
right click new folder if you're
organizing<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:58.829> folders<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.739> for

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
organizing your folders and and for

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.119 
organizing your folders and and for
example<00:01:02.820> your<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.359> your<00:01:03.920> organizing<00:01:04.920> your

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
example your your your organizing your

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.880 
example your your your organizing your
music<00:01:05.549> collection<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.170> very<00:01:07.200> tedious

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
music collection it can be very tedious

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.050 
music collection it can be very tedious
to<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.580> over<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.330> over<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.810> over<00:01:09.960> again

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
to do this over and over and over again

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.750 
to do this over and over and over again
so<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.420> script<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:14.070> press<00:01:14.310> ctrl

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
so with this script you just press ctrl

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.600 
so with this script you just press ctrl
in<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:16.290> creates<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.740> new<00:01:16.860> folder<00:01:17.100> much

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
in and it creates a new folder much

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.230 
in and it creates a new folder much
faster<00:01:18.150> much<00:01:18.180> easier<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> let<00:01:20.850> me<00:01:21.000> show<00:01:21.210> you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
faster much easier so let me show you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.480 
faster much easier so let me show you
how<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.689> works

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.480 

in<00:01:25.000> this<00:01:25.299> code<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:25.840> first<00:01:26.770> checks<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.369> you

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
in this code it first checks that you

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.880 
in this code it first checks that you
are<00:01:27.549> running<00:01:27.820> windows<00:01:28.060> explorer<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:29.049> problem

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
are running windows explorer a problem

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.730 
are running windows explorer a problem
that<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.729> previous<00:01:30.939> version<00:01:31.479> had<00:01:31.899> was

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
that the the previous version had was

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.030 
that the the previous version had was
that<00:01:33.009> it<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:34.450> would<00:01:34.689> run<00:01:34.899> on<00:01:35.080> any<00:01:35.229> program<00:01:35.830> or

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
that it it would run on any program or

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.840 
that it it would run on any program or
it<00:01:36.759> would<00:01:37.450> disable<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.740> controlling<00:01:39.369> hotkey

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
it would disable the controlling hotkey

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.940 
it would disable the controlling hotkey
on<00:01:40.060> all<00:01:40.360> programs<00:01:40.659> except<00:01:41.380> for<00:01:41.649> Windows

regular windows program and you do not

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.510 
regular windows program and you do not
need<00:03:54.660> out<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.020> hot<00:03:55.230> key<00:03:55.470> in<00:03:55.680> order<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:56.160> use<00:03:56.340> it

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
need out to hot key in order to use it

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.240

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.630 
so you can just download the compiled
file<00:03:59.580> here<00:03:59.970> or<00:04:00.150> if<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.290> want<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.680> download<00:04:01.860> the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
a HK file I made you can just go to this

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.830 
a HK file I made you can just go to this
address<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:07.730> download<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.030> modify<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.600> as

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
address and download it and modify it as

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.600 
address and download it and modify it as
much<00:04:10.020> as<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:10.200> want<00:04:10.500> for<00:04:10.739> example<00:04:11.220> if<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.430> do

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
much as you want for example if you do

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.610 
much as you want for example if you do
not<00:04:11.730> like<00:04:12.000> control<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.930> can<00:04:12.959> change<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
not like control and you can change the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.150 
not like control and you can change the
hotkey<00:04:14.390> so<00:04:15.390> it's<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.810> very<00:04:15.840> simple<00:04:16.230> script<00:04:16.739> but

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
hotkey so it's a very simple script but

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.789 
hotkey so it's a very simple script but
it<00:04:17.340> is<00:04:17.489> very<00:04:17.549> useful<00:04:17.850> at<00:04:18.510> least<00:04:19.140> I<00:04:19.350> found<00:04:19.620> it

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
it is very useful at least I found it

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.900 
it is very useful at least I found it
very<00:04:19.950> useful<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.880> use<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:23.010> have<00:04:23.820> only

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
very useful to use and I have only

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.350 
very useful to use and I have only
tested<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.510> in<00:04:24.690> vista<00:04:25.290> but<00:04:25.950> i<00:04:26.310> think<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.210> would

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
tested it in vista but i think it would

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.260 
tested it in vista but i think it would
work<00:04:27.419> in<00:04:27.900> XP<00:04:28.440> if<00:04:28.740> anybody<00:04:29.430> can<00:04:29.669> confirm<00:04:30.240> that

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
work in XP if anybody can confirm that

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.460 
work in XP if anybody can confirm that
and<00:04:31.940> so<00:04:33.770> that's<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.930> thanks<00:04:36.930> for<00:04:37.050> watching

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
and so that's it so thanks for watching

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.460 
and so that's it so thanks for watching
and<00:04:37.620> enjoy
