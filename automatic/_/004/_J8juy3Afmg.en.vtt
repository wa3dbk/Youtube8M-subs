00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.090
 hello friends of optics fischer show 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.240
 how to finish a dropshot montage 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.199
 with strange from shore is for me the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.310
 perfect assembly required for this one 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.550
 flight subscribers of the fish and 40s 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.289
 then dropshot hook or man 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:39.660
 can then also a classic hook 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:43.290
 Use dropshot lead and 3 times length 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.489
 it fishing for the shore 40 50 centimeter 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.489
 perfectly adequate 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.770
 to have landlords 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.150
 string threaded around the middle 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.260
 Wilson's eye is laid and that's the way it has to be 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.920
 so great otherwise say by then adjusts 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:37.410
 The hook will be around the two times 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.860
 upper ends slept 56 times 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.860
 enough 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:52.149
 a bit of wet it attracts 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.920
 then you see the hagen is perfect 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.500
 horizontal as next 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.420
 then connects the ancestor with the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.840
 Hauptschule special knot with 100% 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.519
 bearing strength that's very important why 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:16.420
 you see later is then one 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.420
 Eye laid and the secondary school 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.600
 we are dangerous 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.600
 the eye is wrapped 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.980
 and then guided through the eye four times 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.430
 looks a bit quirky, the 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.430
 also 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.239
 but with a bit of practice, that's just fine 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.930
 down 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.930
 at the beginning 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.480
 and why 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.120
 but you take both inside of the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.120
 from the incident 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:04.350
 admin knots with 100% strength at the end 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:12.030
 from the incident as a break point simply 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:21.930
 knot in loops and then hang 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:25.620
 hermann traub be one you the knot 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.380
 through that by the oil and hang that 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.420
 here firm or advantage of the assembly 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.010
 is that this knot that 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.320
 lower load has like this 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.000
 knot if there is a trailer somewhere 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.960
 has and then rips it from the 3 and 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.960
 not the complete assembly 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.950
 Finally, the rubber is on 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:55.890
 The Easter days are mounted there 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:59.260
 through the head as follows 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:03.340
 down led third out so 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:09.480
 about as 5 mm from the head they're gone 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:15.870
 on the hook then kick around here 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:24.120
 roughly measured and therefore pulls through 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:24.120
 so that joy has been raised 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.750
 now you can see that the dare 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.730
 disappeared in the rubber fish that has 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.970
 now also in autumn the advantage 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:40.420
 that one does not send any sheets no 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:44.110
 The leaves can also be donated to dallas 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:47.350
 been traveling between looks as the 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.720
 finished assembling them again 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.030
 then killed too fast at right angles 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.710
 it is over and you can already see through 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.710
 smallest movement which then also 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.930
 generation and you can do it too 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.990
 then perfect by bernard less 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.870
 losses and hope that you with it 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:11.640
 successful time and well worth a fun 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.640
 video and then until next time
