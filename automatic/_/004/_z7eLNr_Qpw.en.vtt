00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
think this was the reason behind the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.540

correction<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.219> there<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
correction or do you think that there is

I<00:00:49.289> think<00:00:49.590> Corrections<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.070> rightward<00:00:50.399> what

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
I think Corrections are rightward what

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.459 
I think Corrections are rightward what
we've<00:00:50.730> seen<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> big<00:00:51.180> sell-off<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.809> gold<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.410> a

we've seen the big sell-off in gold is a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.380 
we've seen the big sell-off in gold is a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the market in my opinion and yet you're

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.939

what we've seen now is I would I think

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.709 
what we've seen now is I would I think
is<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> healthy<00:01:02.969> correction<00:01:03.449> from<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
is a healthy correction from the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.630 
is a healthy correction from the
overblown<00:01:04.110> prices<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.519> been

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
overblown prices that have been

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.340 
overblown prices that have been
sustained<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.240> probably<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.600> year<00:01:06.689> too<00:01:07.080> long

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
sustained for probably a year too long

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.830 
sustained for probably a year too long
so<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.250> central<00:01:08.640> banks<00:01:08.670> stepping<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.659> buy

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
so with central banks stepping in to buy

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.140 
so with central banks stepping in to buy
in<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.409> big<00:01:10.590> sell-off<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.760> signal<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
in the big sell-off that's the signal to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.390 
in the big sell-off that's the signal to
me<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.320> thing<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> bear

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
me that this thing is not in a bear

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.770 
me that this thing is not in a bear
market<00:01:14.610> we're<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.509> heading

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
market we're not going to be heading

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
market we're not going to be heading
lower<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.619> indefinitely<00:01:17.340> we're<00:01:18.000> looking<00:01:18.180> at

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
lower for indefinitely we're looking at

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.270 
lower for indefinitely we're looking at
as<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> correction<00:01:18.900> sideways<00:01:19.710> movement<00:01:20.159> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
as a correction sideways movement and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.890 
as a correction sideways movement and
then<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> believe<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.210> gold<00:01:21.450> market<00:01:21.780> will

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
then I believe this the gold market will

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.510 
then I believe this the gold market will
start<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.170> move<00:01:22.259> higher<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:22.979> price<00:01:23.250> do

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
start to move higher so what price do

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.210 
start to move higher so what price do
you<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.909> bottom<00:01:24.030> I'm<00:01:24.780> looking<00:01:25.220> 1240

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you have at the bottom I'm looking 1240

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
you have at the bottom I'm looking 1240
1260<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.060> what<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.270> project<00:01:27.750> as<00:01:27.900> being<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
1260 is what I project as being a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
1260 is what I project as being a
probably<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.829> reasonable<00:01:29.310> bottom<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
probably a reasonable bottom for the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
probably a reasonable bottom for the
market<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:31.110> won't<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.350> an<00:01:31.439> absolute

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
market and that won't be an absolute

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.289 
market and that won't be an absolute
number<00:01:32.130> that'll<00:01:32.400> probably<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> settlement

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
number that'll probably be a settlement

in which gold is valued and I think

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.899 
in which gold is valued and I think
we're<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.740> long-term<00:01:41.189> change<00:01:41.490> because<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
we're in this long-term change because I

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.910 
we're in this long-term change because I
think<00:01:42.060> inflation<00:01:42.450> actually<00:01:43.320> contrary<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
think inflation actually contrary to a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
think inflation actually contrary to a
lot<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.189> people<00:01:44.430> shoes<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:44.909> gonna<00:01:45.090> kick<00:01:45.659> up

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
lot of people shoes is not gonna kick up

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.120 
lot of people shoes is not gonna kick up
there's<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> lot<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.290> money<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> system<00:01:46.829> but

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
there's a lot of money in the system but

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.499 
there's a lot of money in the system but
it's<00:01:47.280> actually<00:01:47.549> not<00:01:47.670> getting<00:01:47.939> out<00:01:48.090> into<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it's actually not getting out into the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.240 
it's actually not getting out into the
system<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> garden<00:01:49.890> where<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
system like a garden where you have a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.710 
system like a garden where you have a
tank<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.670> water<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> hose<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.600> not

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
tank of water but the hose is not

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.929 
tank of water but the hose is not
spraying<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.229> water<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:53.100> China<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.880> think

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
spraying the water I think China I think

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.550 
spraying the water I think China I think
is<00:01:54.180> slowing<00:01:54.509> down<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.960> long-term<00:01:55.350> way<00:01:55.530> I

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
is slowing down in a long-term way I

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.600 
is slowing down in a long-term way I
think<00:01:55.740> that's<00:01:56.009> gonna<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> negative

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
think that's gonna have a negative

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.370 
think that's gonna have a negative
effect<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.210> commodities<00:01:57.479> long<00:01:57.930> term<00:01:58.200> that's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
effect on commodities long term that's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.230 
effect on commodities long term that's
going<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.649> affect<00:01:58.860> gold<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.520> energy<00:02:00.000> there's

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
going to affect gold the energy there's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.789 
going to affect gold the energy there's
abundance<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.930> energy<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.469> energy

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
abundance of energy I think energy

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.100 
abundance of energy I think energy
prices<00:02:02.189> are<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.549> go<00:02:02.670> down<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:04.020> all

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
prices are going to go down so for all

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.749 
prices are going to go down so for all
those<00:02:04.229> reasons<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.590> think<00:02:04.710> goals<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.219> part

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
those reasons I think goals in that part

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.119 
those reasons I think goals in that part
of<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.909> long-term<00:02:06.119> downtrend<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.500> yet<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.950> say

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
of a long-term downtrend but yet we say

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.979 
of a long-term downtrend but yet we say
that<00:02:08.369> gold<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.970> quote<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
that gold and I quote to you is the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.070 
that gold and I quote to you is the
ultimate<00:02:10.530> fear<00:02:11.039> trade<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.300> is

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
ultimate fear trade so is

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.750 
ultimate fear trade so is
fact<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.680> we're<00:02:13.980> seeing<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.430> bit<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
fact that we're seeing a bit of a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.430 
fact that we're seeing a bit of a
sell-off<00:02:15.000> showing<00:02:15.480> we're<00:02:15.840> not<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.140> fearful

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
sell-off showing we're not that fearful

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.650 
sell-off showing we're not that fearful
and<00:02:16.830> should<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.370> not<00:02:17.640> be<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.030> fearful<00:02:18.330> there's

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
and should we not be so fearful there's

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.730 
and should we not be so fearful there's
still<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> lot<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.260> geopolitical

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
still a lot of geopolitical

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.520 
still a lot of geopolitical
uncertainties<00:02:20.670> hovering<00:02:21.120> around<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.660> agree

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
uncertainties hovering around I agree

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.680 
uncertainties hovering around I agree
with<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.730> ultimate<00:02:24.120> fear<00:02:24.360> trade

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
with you it is the ultimate fear trade

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.300 
with you it is the ultimate fear trade
but<00:02:24.960> in<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.350> end<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.740> think<00:02:25.800> people<00:02:26.220> are

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
but in the end I think people are

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.530 
but in the end I think people are
beginning<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.640> recognize<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.360> there's

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
beginning to recognize that there's

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.570 
beginning to recognize that there's
actually<00:02:27.840> fear<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.350> gold<00:02:28.560> itself<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.340> not

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
actually fear in gold itself it's not

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.130 
actually fear in gold itself it's not
just<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.120> not<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.360> something<00:02:31.050> where

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
just it's not it's something where

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.930 
just it's not it's something where
people<00:02:31.170> project<00:02:31.620> their<00:02:32.040> fears<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:32.820> not

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
people project their fears but it's not

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.280 
people project their fears but it's not
necessarily<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> place<00:02:33.660> where<00:02:33.930> people's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
necessarily the place where people's

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.650 
necessarily the place where people's
fears<00:02:34.800> can<00:02:34.980> get<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.370> swage<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.120> think<00:02:36.240> part<00:02:36.570> of

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
fears can get a swage so I think part of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.060 
fears can get a swage so I think part of
what's<00:02:36.840> occurring<00:02:37.380> now<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.740> people<00:02:37.980> are

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
what's occurring now is people are

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.530 
what's occurring now is people are
wondering<00:02:38.370> well<00:02:38.610> maybe<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.180> not<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
wondering well maybe this is not the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.030 
wondering well maybe this is not the
place<00:02:39.720> where<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.170> hide<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.800> there<00:02:40.920> other

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
place where I can hide and there other

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.010 
place where I can hide and there other
places<00:02:41.250> I've<00:02:41.490> got<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.730> go<00:02:41.820> well<00:02:42.420> gold<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.780> down

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
places I've got to go well gold is down

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.590 
places I've got to go well gold is down
about<00:02:43.200> over<00:02:43.740> 11%<00:02:44.130> for<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.670> year<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.180> that

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
about over 11% for the year is that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.020 
about over 11% for the year is that
because<00:02:45.870> investors<00:02:46.470> are<00:02:46.530> not<00:02:47.400> getting<00:02:47.910> as

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
because investors are not getting as

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.420 
because investors are not getting as
much<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.540> return<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.320> gold<00:02:49.740> as<00:02:49.890> they<00:02:50.040> did<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
much of a return on gold as they did and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.340 
much of a return on gold as they did and
they<00:02:50.520> were<00:02:50.550> looking<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.480> put<00:02:51.660> their<00:02:51.810> money<00:02:51.990> in

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
they were looking to put their money in

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.290 
they were looking to put their money in
equities<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.070> are<00:02:53.160> not<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.640> concerned<00:02:53.820> or

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
equities and are not so concerned or

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.690 
equities and are not so concerned or
fearful<00:02:54.540> at<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> moment<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.500> think<00:02:55.920> getting<00:02:56.550> a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
fearful at the moment I think getting a

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.220 
fearful at the moment I think getting a
return<00:02:56.820> on<00:02:57.060> gold<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.570> kind<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.990> wrong

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
return on gold is kind of the wrong

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.140 
return on gold is kind of the wrong
paradigm<00:02:59.100> or<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.400> wrong<00:02:59.550> approach<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.970> take

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
paradigm or the wrong approach to take

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.270 
paradigm or the wrong approach to take
with<00:03:00.510> gold<00:03:00.750> just<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.950> know<00:03:02.040> John

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
with gold just is you know John

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.699

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.430 
hand it's two different things and I
think<00:03:29.459> we<00:03:29.910> get<00:03:30.090> confused<00:03:30.269> sometimes<00:03:30.780> in<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
think we get confused sometimes in the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.560 
think we get confused sometimes in the
market<00:03:31.920> gold<00:03:32.550> is<00:03:32.790> an<00:03:32.910> instrument<00:03:33.390> that's

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
market gold is an instrument that's

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.050 
market gold is an instrument that's
being<00:03:33.720> used<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.200> variety<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.769> ways<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.970> not

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
being used in a variety of ways it's not

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.090 
being used in a variety of ways it's not
an<00:03:36.269> absolute<00:03:36.750> store<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.530> value<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.980> it

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
an absolute store of value and it

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.920 
an absolute store of value and it
doesn't<00:03:38.370> pay<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.519> dividend<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.420> does<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> only

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
doesn't pay a dividend it does it only

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.050 
doesn't pay a dividend it does it only
increases<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.920> value<00:03:41.250> if<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.519> price<00:03:41.730> goes<00:03:41.760> up

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
increases the value if the price goes up

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.060 
increases the value if the price goes up
so<00:03:42.750> do<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.019> agree<00:03:43.140> with<00:03:43.680> Goldman<00:03:44.040> Sachs

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
so do you agree with Goldman Sachs

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.000 
so do you agree with Goldman Sachs
saying<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.880> Gold's<00:03:45.420> nearly<00:03:45.989> 15-year<00:03:46.739> bull

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010

market<00:03:47.430> Ron<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.850> nearing<00:03:48.540> its<00:03:48.660> end<00:03:48.840> no<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.200> don't

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
market Ron is nearing its end no I don't

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.259 
market Ron is nearing its end no I don't
actually<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.010> think<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.700> what<00:03:50.910> we're<00:03:51.060> in<00:03:51.150> as<00:03:51.239> a

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
actually I think it's what we're in as a

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.240 
actually I think it's what we're in as a
correction<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.170> think<00:03:52.440> Goldman<00:03:52.769> Sachs<00:03:53.040> is

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
correction and I think Goldman Sachs is

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.160 
correction and I think Goldman Sachs is
may<00:03:53.430> be<00:03:53.489> overstating<00:03:54.120> what<00:03:54.630> we're<00:03:54.780> looking<00:03:55.080> at

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
may be overstating what we're looking at

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.440 
may be overstating what we're looking at
right<00:03:55.230> now<00:03:55.590> in<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.190> longer<00:03:56.640> term<00:03:56.670> Goldman<00:03:57.300> likes

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
right now in a longer term Goldman likes

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.880 
right now in a longer term Goldman likes
to<00:03:57.570> come<00:03:57.720> out<00:03:57.810> with<00:03:57.959> definitive<00:03:58.440> statements

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
to come out with definitive statements

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.410 
to come out with definitive statements
all<00:03:59.010> right<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.550> don't<00:03:59.640> think<00:03:59.820> in<00:04:00.269> the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
all right and I don't think in the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.330 
all right and I don't think in the
commodities<00:04:00.870> market<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.320> can<00:04:01.470> have<00:04:01.709> overly

commodities market you can have overly
definitive<00:04:02.850> statements<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.420> that's<00:04:03.989> what

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
definitive statements and that's what

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.390 
definitive statements and that's what
gold<00:04:04.350> is<00:04:04.440> showing<00:04:04.739> us<00:04:04.830> now<00:04:05.010> gold<00:04:05.250> is

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
gold is showing us now gold is

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.920 
gold is showing us now gold is
traditionally<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.030> hedge<00:04:06.360> against<00:04:06.810> inflation

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
traditionally a hedge against inflation

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.630 
traditionally a hedge against inflation
now<00:04:07.500> there<00:04:07.709> are<00:04:07.769> two<00:04:07.890> elements<00:04:08.040> at<00:04:08.430> play<00:04:08.610> here

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
now there are two elements at play here

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.640 
now there are two elements at play here
on<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.030> one<00:04:09.150> hand<00:04:09.390> we<00:04:09.600> haven't<00:04:10.019> seen<00:04:10.200> much

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
on the one hand we haven't seen much

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.039 
on the one hand we haven't seen much
inflation<00:04:11.010> because<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:12.030> your<00:04:12.299> water<00:04:12.750> tank

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049

host<00:04:13.380> pipe<00:04:13.650> analysis<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:15.000> on<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.720> other<00:04:15.870> hand

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
host pipe analysis but on the other hand

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.770 
host pipe analysis but on the other hand
we've<00:04:16.560> got<00:04:16.590> central<00:04:17.130> bank's<00:04:17.630> stimulating<00:04:18.630> and

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
we've got central bank's stimulating and

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.330 
we've got central bank's stimulating and
stimulating<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:19.530> stimulating<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.160> economy

so<00:04:20.910> why<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.120> gold<00:04:21.390> not<00:04:21.600> rising<00:04:21.840> on<00:04:22.140> that<00:04:22.289> so<00:04:23.039> I

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
so why is gold not rising on that so I

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.159 
so why is gold not rising on that so I
think<00:04:23.340> there's<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.820> there<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.479> people<00:04:24.930> think

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
think there's a there that people think

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.330 
think there's a there that people think
that<00:04:25.289> because<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.890> central

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
that because the central

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.520 
that because the central
banks<00:04:26.550> are<00:04:26.669> pumping<00:04:27.120> lots<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.449> money<00:04:27.720> into<00:04:28.260> the

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
banks are pumping lots of money into the

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.110 
banks are pumping lots of money into the
system<00:04:28.949> that<00:04:29.190> somehow<00:04:29.430> automatically

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
system that somehow automatically

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.580 
system that somehow automatically
inflation<00:04:30.630> is<00:04:30.720> gonna<00:04:30.870> come<00:04:31.139> first<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.530> all

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
inflation is gonna come first of all

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.770 
inflation is gonna come first of all
let's<00:04:31.830> assume<00:04:32.160> if<00:04:32.400> Latian<00:04:32.760> did<00:04:32.970> come<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.389> think

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
let's assume if Latian did come I think

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.330 
let's assume if Latian did come I think
the<00:04:33.870> bond<00:04:34.080> market<00:04:34.440> would<00:04:34.620> correct<00:04:34.949> that<00:04:35.070> very

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
the bond market would correct that very

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.250 
the bond market would correct that very
quickly<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.790> bond<00:04:35.940> market<00:04:36.270> would<00:04:36.419> rise<00:04:36.840> and

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
quickly the bond market would rise and

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.680 
quickly the bond market would rise and
it<00:04:37.350> would<00:04:37.530> put<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.040> stop<00:04:38.729> on<00:04:38.940> what<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.660> know

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
it would put a stop on what the you know

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.000 
it would put a stop on what the you know
the<00:04:39.840> fat<00:04:40.020> or<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.199> other<00:04:40.350> central<00:04:40.710> banks<00:04:40.919> are

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
the fat or the other central banks are

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.409 
the fat or the other central banks are
doing<00:04:41.250> but<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.610> think<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.970> thing<00:04:42.150> that<00:04:42.180> people

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
doing but I think the thing that people

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.090 
doing but I think the thing that people
are<00:04:42.600> missing<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.470> money<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:43.889> going

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
are missing is that the money is going

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.460 
are missing is that the money is going
into<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:44.639> tank<00:04:45.030> in<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.660> garden<00:04:46.020> it's<00:04:46.290> not

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
into this tank in the garden it's not

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.900 
into this tank in the garden it's not
coming<00:04:46.680> out<00:04:46.860> into<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.160> hose<00:04:47.340> into<00:04:47.820> the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
coming out into the hose into the

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.340 
coming out into the hose into the
general<00:04:48.270> economy<00:04:48.479> and<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.810> think<00:04:48.990> that's<00:04:49.139> the

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
general economy and I think that's the

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.260 
general economy and I think that's the
reason<00:04:49.470> why<00:04:49.800> you're<00:04:50.280> not<00:04:50.430> seeing<00:04:50.729> gold<00:04:51.030> and

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
reason why you're not seeing gold and

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.640 
reason why you're not seeing gold and
inflation<00:04:51.690> come<00:04:51.840> together<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.380> think<00:04:52.410> it's

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
inflation come together and I think it's

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.620 
inflation come together and I think it's
puzzling<00:04:52.889> people<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.360> think<00:04:54.540> they're

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
puzzling people and I think they're

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.150 
puzzling people and I think they're
gonna<00:04:54.720> remain<00:04:55.050> puzzled<00:04:55.320> I<00:04:55.560> think<00:04:55.919> there<00:04:56.010> are

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
gonna remain puzzled I think there are

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.300 
gonna remain puzzled I think there are
other<00:04:56.550> ways<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:57.000> gain<00:04:57.960> safety<00:04:58.500> besides<00:04:59.070> gold

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
other ways to gain safety besides gold

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.500 
other ways to gain safety besides gold
I'm<00:04:59.430> not<00:04:59.610> saying<00:04:59.880> it's<00:05:00.000> an<00:05:00.090> intraday

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
I'm not saying it's an intraday

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.600 
I'm not saying it's an intraday
interesting<00:05:00.990> commodity<00:05:01.410> but<00:05:01.979> I<00:05:02.010> wouldn't<00:05:02.340> I

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
interesting commodity but I wouldn't I

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.129 
interesting commodity but I wouldn't I
do<00:05:02.669> throw<00:05:03.120> are<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.419> other<00:05:03.600> ways<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:03.990> gain

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
do throw are the other ways to gain

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.440 
do throw are the other ways to gain
safety<00:05:04.620> then<00:05:04.800> well<00:05:05.460> for<00:05:05.760> one<00:05:05.910> thing<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:06.210> think

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
safety then well for one thing I think

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.060 
safety then well for one thing I think
you<00:05:06.570> know<00:05:06.660> it's<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.930> subtle<00:05:07.169> world<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:07.800> every

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
you know it's a subtle world and every

the past few weeks bonds have rallied
about<00:05:19.590> 30<00:05:19.950> percent<00:05:20.190> though<00:05:20.820> they<00:05:20.940> went<00:05:21.090> up<00:05:21.180> to
