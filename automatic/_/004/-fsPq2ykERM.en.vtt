little spring in the bottom that kind of
holds<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.500> into<00:01:51.619> place<00:01:52.270> using<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.630> very<00:01:53.869> simple

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
holds it into place using it very simple

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.319 
holds it into place using it very simple
you<00:01:55.280> just<00:01:55.460> slide<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.939> in

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
you just slide it in

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.580 
you just slide it in
take<00:01:57.079> your<00:01:57.320> angle<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:57.770> you<00:01:57.890> want<00:01:59.560> tighten<00:02:00.560> it

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
take your angle that you want tighten it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.390 
take your angle that you want tighten it
up<00:02:00.770> there<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.490> little<00:02:02.119> hole<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.420> this

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
up there is a little hole in this

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.610 
up there is a little hole in this
so<00:02:04.090> if<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.390> was<00:02:04.570> slippery<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.200> could<00:02:05.380> put<00:02:05.590> a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
so if it was slippery you could put a

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.340 
so if it was slippery you could put a
screwdriver<00:02:05.950> in<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:07.180> tighten<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.690> up<00:02:07.810> what

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
screwdriver in it and tighten it up what

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.440 
screwdriver in it and tighten it up what
I<00:02:08.380> like<00:02:08.710> about<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.400> that<00:02:09.430> is<00:02:09.880> one<00:02:10.270> more

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
I like about that is that is one more

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.530 
I like about that is that is one more
place<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:11.260> hold<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.530> tool<00:02:12.240> screwdrivers<00:02:13.240> you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
place to hold the tool screwdrivers you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.030 
place to hold the tool screwdrivers you
can<00:02:13.720> put<00:02:13.870> them<00:02:13.990> in<00:02:14.050> your<00:02:14.140> pocket<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.800> can<00:02:14.980> put

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
can put them in your pocket you can put

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.830 
can put them in your pocket you can put
them<00:02:15.370> anywhere<00:02:15.880> when<00:02:16.210> you're<00:02:16.390> on<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.600> ladder

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
them anywhere when you're on the ladder

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.020 
them anywhere when you're on the ladder
this<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.740> safe<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.370> don't<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.850> worry

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
this is safe you don't have to worry

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.450 
this is safe you don't have to worry
about<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.510> falling<00:02:20.050> out<00:02:20.320> of<00:02:20.350> your<00:02:20.470> pocket<00:02:20.560> you

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
about it falling out of your pocket you

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.280 
about it falling out of your pocket you
know<00:02:21.610> exactly<00:02:21.940> where<00:02:22.240> it's<00:02:22.390> at<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:23.140> can<00:02:23.260> just

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
know exactly where it's at you can just

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.770 
know exactly where it's at you can just
trim<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.830> got<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> top<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:27.040> set

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
trim it got it to the top and it's set

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.440 
trim it got it to the top and it's set
so<00:02:28.780> we<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> place<00:02:30.100> for<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.370> screwdriver<00:02:30.910> we

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
so we have a place for a screwdriver we

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.680 
so we have a place for a screwdriver we
have<00:02:31.660> our<00:02:31.900> tool<00:02:32.200> holder<00:02:32.560> on<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.740> side<00:02:33.420> most<00:02:34.420> of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
have our tool holder on the side most of

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.930 
have our tool holder on the side most of
these<00:02:34.810> batteries<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:36.190> battery<00:02:36.550> operated

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
these batteries or battery operated

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.460 
these batteries or battery operated
tools<00:02:37.240> you're<00:02:37.780> going<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.960> probably<00:02:38.140> want<00:02:38.320> to

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
tools you're going to probably want to

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.320 
tools you're going to probably want to
just<00:02:38.530> bang<00:02:38.920> from<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.190> bottom<00:02:39.580> they<00:02:39.910> seem<00:02:40.180> to

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
just bang from the bottom they seem to

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.660 
just bang from the bottom they seem to
fit<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.570> best<00:02:40.960> in<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.290> way<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.860> their<00:02:42.490> more

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
fit the best in that way in their more

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.030 
fit the best in that way in their more
balanced<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.750> lot<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.320> them<00:02:44.440> are<00:02:44.560> still<00:02:44.770> thick

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
balanced a lot of them are still thick

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.890 
balanced a lot of them are still thick
on<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.250> top<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.910> can<00:02:46.090> kind<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.420> throw<00:02:46.600> them<00:02:46.810> in

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
on the top you can kind of throw them in

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.530 
on the top you can kind of throw them in
there<00:02:47.110> but<00:02:47.500> they<00:02:48.130> seem<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.460> as<00:02:48.970> far<00:02:49.210> as<00:02:49.360> my

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
there but they seem to as far as my

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.930 
there but they seem to as far as my
experience<00:02:49.780> fits<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.740> best<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.190> way<00:02:51.370> which

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
experience fits the best that way which

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.850 
experience fits the best that way which
while<00:02:52.210> you're<00:02:52.390> up<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.690> ladder<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.530> pretty

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
while you're up on a ladder is pretty

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.770 
while you're up on a ladder is pretty
easy<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.250> grab

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
easy to grab

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.470 
easy to grab

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
I also been toying with it because it

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.090 
I also been toying with it because it
seems<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:58.870> when<00:02:59.050> I'm<00:02:59.170> on<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.320> ladder<00:02:59.560> either

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
pounds according to the rating but I can

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.070 
pounds according to the rating but I can
guarantee<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.940> it's<00:03:30.940> built<00:03:31.300> for<00:03:31.630> much<00:03:31.810> more

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
guarantee you it's built for much more

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.199 
guarantee you it's built for much more
than<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.320> again<00:03:32.770> way<00:03:33.280> over<00:03:33.610> built<00:03:33.850> but

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
than that again way over built but

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.990 
than that again way over built but
that's<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.080> sign<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.530> quality<00:03:35.680> product<00:03:36.459> so

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
that's the sign of a quality product so

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.910 
that's the sign of a quality product so
there's<00:03:37.840> probably<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.200> million<00:03:38.380> things<00:03:38.739> that

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
there's probably a million things that

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.610

you could decide to hang in here but
there<00:03:41.800> are<00:03:41.980> some<00:03:42.220> options<00:03:42.430> from<00:03:43.300> hangman's

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
there are some options from hangman's

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.309 
there are some options from hangman's
you<00:03:44.170> can<00:03:44.350> buy

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 
and the reason I left it off is because

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.740 
and the reason I left it off is because
I<00:04:00.650> don't<00:04:00.980> see<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.489> as<00:04:01.610> something<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.450> would

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
I don't see it as something that I would

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.170 
I don't see it as something that I would
use<00:04:02.989> all<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.470> time<00:04:03.650> I'm<00:04:04.280> not<00:04:04.579> on<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.819> ladder

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
use all the time I'm not on a ladder

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.599 
use all the time I'm not on a ladder
painting<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.989> lot<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.500> know<00:04:06.829> some<00:04:07.159> people<00:04:07.310> are

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
painting a lot I know some people are

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:08.770 
painting a lot I know some people are
and<00:04:07.790> that's<00:04:07.939> probably<00:04:08.269> one<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.599> main

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
and that's probably one of the main

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.259 
and that's probably one of the main
reasons<00:04:09.200> they'd<00:04:09.349> want<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.650> buy<00:04:09.829> this<00:04:09.890> but<00:04:10.760> for

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
reasons they'd want to buy this but for

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.960 
reasons they'd want to buy this but for
me<00:04:11.329> it's<00:04:11.659> one<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.989> those<00:04:12.079> occasional<00:04:12.709> uses<00:04:13.189> and

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
me it's one of those occasional uses and

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.339 
me it's one of those occasional uses and
I<00:04:14.030> also<00:04:14.180> want<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.480> show<00:04:14.599> you<00:04:14.689> it's<00:04:14.870> pretty<00:04:15.140> easy

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
I also want to show you it's pretty easy

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.189 
I also want to show you it's pretty easy
out<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:15.709> on<00:04:18.430> so<00:04:19.430> with<00:04:19.669> it<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.870> can<00:04:21.049> go

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
out and on so with it on and it can go

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.980 
out and on so with it on and it can go
on<00:04:21.229> either<00:04:21.650> side<00:04:22.100> it<00:04:22.820> doesn't<00:04:23.060> matter<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.690> threw

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
on either side it doesn't matter I threw

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.420 
on either side it doesn't matter I threw
it<00:04:24.139> on<00:04:24.199> this<00:04:24.410> side<00:04:24.650> that<00:04:24.680> give<00:04:24.979> it<00:04:25.100> a<00:04:25.130> little

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
it on this side that give it a little

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.750 
it on this side that give it a little
bit<00:04:25.610> easier<00:04:26.180> view<00:04:26.539> for<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.960> camera<00:04:30.440> but<00:04:31.430> again

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
bit easier view for the camera but again

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.909 
bit easier view for the camera but again
that's<00:04:31.970> in<00:04:32.150> place<00:04:32.389> if<00:04:32.780> we<00:04:33.080> wanted<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.500> move<00:04:33.680> it

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
that's in place if we wanted to move it

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.300 
that's in place if we wanted to move it
we<00:04:34.460> can<00:04:34.669> throw<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.270> side<00:04:36.190> with<00:04:37.190> the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
we can throw it to the side with the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.129 
we can throw it to the side with the
paint<00:04:37.520> ring<00:04:37.699> you<00:04:37.789> can't<00:04:38.389> throw<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.780> up<00:04:38.900> front

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
paint ring you can't throw it up front

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.360 
paint ring you can't throw it up front
but<00:04:39.669> put<00:04:40.669> it<00:04:40.760> in<00:04:40.849> whatever<00:04:41.060> place<00:04:41.419> we<00:04:41.690> want

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.189 

drop<00:04:46.370> our<00:04:46.550> paint<00:04:46.849> can<00:04:47.090> in<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.570> start<00:04:47.930> painting

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
drop our paint can in and start painting

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.980 
drop our paint can in and start painting
we<00:04:48.830> can<00:04:49.039> then<00:04:49.190> use<00:04:49.370> this<00:04:49.669> tool<00:04:50.360> holder<00:04:50.720> on<00:04:50.870> the

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
we can then use this tool holder on the

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.439 
we can then use this tool holder on the
side<00:04:51.229> for<00:04:51.650> paint<00:04:51.979> brushes<00:04:52.250> or<00:04:52.789> anything<00:04:52.820> else

side for paint brushes or anything else
that<00:04:53.599> we<00:04:54.050> can<00:04:54.260> figure<00:04:54.620> out<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:55.010> will<00:04:55.160> fit<00:04:55.400> in

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
that we can figure out that will fit in

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.930 
that we can figure out that will fit in
there<00:04:55.669> but<00:04:56.229> if<00:04:57.229> you're<00:04:57.410> painting<00:04:57.789> this<00:04:58.789> is
