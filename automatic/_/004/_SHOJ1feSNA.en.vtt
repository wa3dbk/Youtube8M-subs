tonight and you can see I've got the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.380 
tonight and you can see I've got the
energy<00:01:05.670> coming<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.540> around<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.020> again

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
energy coming in all around it again

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.730 
energy coming in all around it again
there's<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> energy<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> water<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
there's the energy in the water and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.350 
there's the energy in the water and
there's<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> energy<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> little

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
there's the energy from the little

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.320 
there's the energy from the little
tester<00:01:12.990> eyes<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.310> over<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.820> thing<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
tester eyes it's all over this thing and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.440 
tester eyes it's all over this thing and
in<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.439> glass<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.890> water<00:01:17.159> I've<00:01:17.759> actually<00:01:18.090> got

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
in that glass of water I've actually got

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420

there that's a super cap that's loading
up<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> run<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:53.970> pulse

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
up and then I'm going to run this pulse

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
up and then I'm going to run this pulse
motor<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.780> show<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.049> how<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.380> energy<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.159> be

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
motor to show you how that energy can be

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.359 
motor to show you how that energy can be
used<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.700> make<00:01:56.850> Maggie<00:01:57.329> work<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.380> I've<00:01:59.219> got

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
used to make Maggie work and I've got

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.580 
used to make Maggie work and I've got
the<00:01:59.520> battery<00:01:59.759> pulled<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.659> little<00:02:01.200> pulse

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the battery pulled on this little pulse

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.200 
the battery pulled on this little pulse
motor<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.700> coming<00:02:02.969> out

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
motor it's just going to be coming out

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.530 
motor it's just going to be coming out
of<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.689> super<00:02:04.079> cap<00:02:04.350> their<00:02:05.030> spin<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.240> up

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
of that to super cap their spin this up

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.619 
of that to super cap their spin this up
and<00:02:07.200> there<00:02:07.380> goes<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:08.179> spinning<00:02:09.179> up<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.509> can

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
and there goes that spinning up you can

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.479 
and there goes that spinning up you can
see<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> little<00:02:10.020> LED<00:02:10.709> indicator<00:02:11.220> light<00:02:11.459> is

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
see the little LED indicator light is

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.890 
see the little LED indicator light is
that<00:02:11.819> fire

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
that fire

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.110 
that fire
and<00:02:13.530> then<00:02:13.680> here's<00:02:13.920> Maggie<00:02:14.250> if<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.670> put<00:02:14.879> Maggie

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and then here's Maggie if you put Maggie

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.080 
and then here's Maggie if you put Maggie
near<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.659> magnet<00:02:16.170> there<00:02:16.920> goes<00:02:17.099> Maggie<00:02:17.430> and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
near that magnet there goes Maggie and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.569 
near that magnet there goes Maggie and
that's<00:02:19.079> how<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.319> can<00:02:19.560> make<00:02:19.680> Maggie<00:02:20.010> work<00:02:20.370> on

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
that's how you can make Maggie work on

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.979 
that's how you can make Maggie work on
this<00:02:20.700> set<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.180> use<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> pulse<00:02:22.560> motor<00:02:23.659> so<00:02:24.659> that's

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
this set up use a pulse motor so that's

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.050 
this set up use a pulse motor so that's
the<00:02:25.170> experiment<00:02:25.709> for<00:02:25.890> tonight<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.700> very

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the experiment for tonight it's very

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.089 
the experiment for tonight it's very
interesting<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.900> project<00:02:28.470> we're<00:02:28.620> working<00:02:28.650> on

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
interesting a project we're working on

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.539 
interesting a project we're working on
here<00:02:29.430> with<00:02:29.609> this<00:02:30.290> spatial<00:02:31.290> energy<00:02:31.769> cohesion

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
here with this spatial energy cohesion

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.630 
here with this spatial energy cohesion
and<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.900> would<00:02:34.079> study<00:02:34.319> dr.<00:02:34.680> Stifler<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.459> you're

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
and I would study dr. Stifler if you're

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.149 
and I would study dr. Stifler if you're
interested<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:36.329> first<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.079> go<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> his

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
interested in this first and go to his

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.330 
interested in this first and go to his
website<00:02:38.450> Stifler<00:02:39.450> scientific<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.859> start

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
website Stifler scientific and start

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.640 
website Stifler scientific and start
studying<00:02:41.579> his<00:02:41.970> work<00:02:42.239> he<00:02:42.989> developed<00:02:43.409> all<00:02:43.530> of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
studying his work he developed all of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.140 
studying his work he developed all of
this<00:02:43.829> we're<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.579> doing<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:46.129> side<00:02:47.150> experiments

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
this we're just doing a side experiments

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.330 
this we're just doing a side experiments
basically<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.049> this<00:02:49.409> is<00:02:49.620> running<00:02:49.920> off<00:02:50.069> of

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
basically that this is running off of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.180 
basically that this is running off of
that<00:02:50.700> water<00:02:50.970> glass<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.379> is<00:02:52.920> thought<00:02:53.159> i

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
that water glass and that is thought i

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.759 
that water glass and that is thought i
would<00:02:53.400> show<00:02:53.609> that<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.120> folks<00:02:54.299> tonight

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
would show that to the folks tonight

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.099 
would show that to the folks tonight
these<00:02:55.769> new<00:02:56.069> exciter<00:02:56.819> circuits<00:02:57.359> are<00:02:57.599> work<00:02:57.840> just

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
these new exciter circuits are work just

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.199 
these new exciter circuits are work just
like<00:02:58.290> some<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.430> other<00:02:59.519> stuff<00:02:59.609> we<00:02:59.970> worked

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
like some of the other stuff we worked

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.030 
like some of the other stuff we worked
down<00:03:00.389> before<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.970> pretty<00:03:03.540> neat<00:03:03.750> stuff<00:03:04.049> maybe

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
down before and pretty neat stuff maybe

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.170 
down before and pretty neat stuff maybe
you<00:03:05.159> liked<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.579> as<00:03:05.700> long<00:03:05.819> as<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.030> give<00:03:06.150> a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
you liked it as long as you give a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.110 
you liked it as long as you give a
magnet<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.920> she<00:03:08.220> won't<00:03:08.370> work<00:03:08.790> if<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.090> don't

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
magnet and she won't work if you don't

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.990 
magnet and she won't work if you don't
have<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> magnet<00:03:09.900> for<00:03:10.519> alrighty<00:03:11.519> thanks<00:03:11.849> for
