00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.550

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.420

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.330

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:24.109
 strand of the temporal zone and shearing the volume 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:27.400
 thinning discharging hair and asking 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.400

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.440
