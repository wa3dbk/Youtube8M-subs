00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
about how to select the right bowling

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.919 
about how to select the right bowling
ball<00:00:07.950> today<00:00:08.519> we're<00:00:08.730> going<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.910> talk<00:00:09.150> about<00:00:09.179> how

to select the right bowling ball for the
tournament<00:00:12.420> bowler<00:00:18.920> man<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> hard

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
tournament bowler man what a hard

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.859 
tournament bowler man what a hard
decision<00:00:20.550> there<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.359> much<00:00:21.510> information

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
decision there are so much information

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.779 
decision there are so much information
out<00:00:22.410> there<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.830> know<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.070> talked<00:00:23.310> about<00:00:23.430> core

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
out there you know we talked about core

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.359 
out there you know we talked about core
design<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.720> talked<00:00:24.990> about<00:00:25.140> low<00:00:25.500> RG<00:00:25.949> versus

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
design we talked about low RG versus

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.839 
design we talked about low RG versus
high<00:00:26.580> RG<00:00:28.099> asymmetrical<00:00:29.099> cores<00:00:29.340> versus

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
high RG asymmetrical cores versus

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.209 
high RG asymmetrical cores versus
symmetrical<00:00:30.420> cores<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.960> mean<00:00:31.500> there's<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.070> much

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
symmetrical cores I mean there's so much

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.670 
symmetrical cores I mean there's so much
out<00:00:32.460> there<00:00:32.700> pin<00:00:33.480> placement<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.110> we'll<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
out there pin placement so we'll get to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.560 
out there pin placement so we'll get to
some<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.219> bit<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.940> let<00:00:36.120> me<00:00:36.239> see<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
some of that a bit but let me see if I

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.350 
some of that a bit but let me see if I
can<00:00:36.750> somehow<00:00:37.380> simplify<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.730> when

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
can somehow simplify this for you when

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.470 
can somehow simplify this for you when
you're<00:00:39.510> talking<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:39.989> RG<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.100> low<00:00:41.790> RG<00:00:42.270> ball

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
you're talking about RG a low RG ball

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.420 
you're talking about RG a low RG ball
which<00:00:42.690> would<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.200> core<00:00:43.500> here<00:00:43.800> versus<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
which would be this core here versus a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.470 
which would be this core here versus a
high<00:00:44.940> RG<00:00:45.390> core<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.860> lower<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.340> RG<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.270> more

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
high RG core the lower the RG the more

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
high RG core the lower the RG the more
master<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.260> center<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.890> bowling

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
master is in the center of that bowling

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.220 
master is in the center of that bowling
ball<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.879> sooner<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.239> ball<00:00:51.600> wants<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.050> get

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
ball the sooner that ball wants to get

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.310 
ball the sooner that ball wants to get
rolling<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.890> high<00:00:53.460> RG<00:00:53.940> ball<00:00:54.180> there's<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:55.020> mass

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
rolling a high RG ball there's more mass

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.099 
rolling a high RG ball there's more mass
to<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> outer<00:00:56.250> shell<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.539> longer<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
to the outer shell so the longer that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.840 
to the outer shell so the longer that
ball<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.739> take<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.100> get<00:00:59.219> into<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.550> roll

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
ball is going to take to get into a roll

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.810 
ball is going to take to get into a roll
so<00:01:00.180> food<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.109> thought<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.800> lower<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> RG

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
so food for thought is the lower the RG

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.539 
so food for thought is the lower the RG
the<00:01:03.510> less<00:01:03.750> resistance<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.559> has<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.949> rotation

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the less resistance it has to rotation

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.109 
the less resistance it has to rotation
the<00:01:05.970> earlier<00:01:06.390> wants<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.140> roll<00:01:07.400> not<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the earlier wants to roll not not the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.840 
the earlier wants to roll not not the
same<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.750> symmetrical<00:01:10.590> core<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.369> core<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
same for a symmetrical core that core is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.429 
same for a symmetrical core that core is
going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.150> take<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.600> bit<00:01:12.750> longer

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
going to take a little bit longer

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.039 
going to take a little bit longer
the<00:01:13.680> other<00:01:13.890> difference<00:01:14.159> between

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
the other difference between

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.630 
the other difference between
asymmetrical<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.259> symmetrical<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.549> an

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
asymmetrical and symmetrical is that an

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.789 
asymmetrical and symmetrical is that an
asymmetrical<00:01:18.390> ball<00:01:18.570> once<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.110> does<00:01:19.290> make<00:01:19.560> its

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
asymmetrical ball once it does make its

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.410 
asymmetrical ball once it does make its
move<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:21.180> more

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
move it's going to be much more

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.560 
move it's going to be much more
pronounced<00:01:22.200> than<00:01:22.650> say<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.310> symmetrical<00:01:24.240> core

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
pronounced than say a symmetrical core

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.679 
pronounced than say a symmetrical core
so<00:01:25.110> two<00:01:25.170> completely<00:01:26.100> different<00:01:26.460> motions<00:01:27.210> when

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
so two completely different motions when

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.969 
so two completely different motions when
throwing<00:01:27.960> these<00:01:28.140> bowling<00:01:28.500> balls<00:01:28.530> down<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
throwing these bowling balls down the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.280

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
way for you tournament bowlers out there

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.800 
way for you tournament bowlers out there
you're<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.369> need<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.820> wide<00:01:33.119> variety<00:01:33.420> of

you're going to need a wide variety of

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.899 
you're going to need a wide variety of

ball is going to go down the lane also
if<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.750> keep<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.080> pin<00:02:46.260> above<00:02:46.680> my<00:02:46.950> fingers<00:02:47.430> it's

if I keep the pin above my fingers it's

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.340 
if I keep the pin above my fingers it's
going<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.210> tend<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.510> make<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.900> ball<00:02:49.140> go<00:02:49.320> a

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
going to tend to make that ball go a

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.350 
going to tend to make that ball go a
little<00:02:49.500> bit<00:02:49.680> longer<00:02:49.890> down<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.400> lane<00:02:50.610> then<00:02:51.240> if

little bit longer down the lane then if

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.510 
little bit longer down the lane then if
I<00:02:51.480> were<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.720> say<00:02:51.930> put<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.230> pin<00:02:52.650> underneath

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
I were to say put that pin underneath
