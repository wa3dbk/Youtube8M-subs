there's a clip towards the end of this
video<00:02:44.700> where<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> do<00:02:45.570> indeed<00:02:45.900> save<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> P<00:02:46.620> roller

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
but then I let in a rebound and that's

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.690 
but then I let in a rebound and that's
normally<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.480> case<00:02:48.710> p<00:02:49.710> rollers<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.550> not

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
normally the case p rollers is it's not

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.430 
normally the case p rollers is it's not
easy<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.120> get<00:02:51.240> your<00:02:51.420> team<00:02:51.660> Lee<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.870> help<00:02:52.110> p<00:02:52.290> with

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
easy to get your team Lee to help p with

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.500 
easy to get your team Lee to help p with
some<00:02:52.530> defending<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.820> p<00:02:53.970> rollers<00:02:54.330> are<00:02:54.480> a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
some defending but p rollers are a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.120 
some defending but p rollers are a
goalkeeper<00:02:55.080> weakness<00:02:55.410> if<00:02:55.590> you're<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> striker

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
goalkeeper weakness if you're a striker

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.490 
goalkeeper weakness if you're a striker
than<00:02:56.400> p<00:02:56.550> rolling<00:02:56.910> or<00:02:57.330> smashing<00:02:57.870> up<00:02:57.990> close<00:02:58.260> is

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
than p rolling or smashing up close is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.640 
than p rolling or smashing up close is
the<00:02:58.650> way<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.830> be<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> trip<00:02:59.670> or<00:02:59.850> a<00:02:59.880> goalie<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.530> what

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the way to be a trip or a goalie so what

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.870 
the way to be a trip or a goalie so what
i<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.830> recommend<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.280> probably<00:03:02.490> if<00:03:02.730> it's

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
i can recommend is probably if it's

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.250 
i can recommend is probably if it's
going<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> p<00:03:03.360> roller<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.780> corner<00:03:04.170> from

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
going in a p roller to the corner from

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.690 
going in a p roller to the corner from
inside<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.590> box<00:03:04.890> i'd<00:03:05.130> say<00:03:05.400> obviously

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
inside the box i'd say obviously

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.220 
inside the box i'd say obviously
manually<00:03:06.330> try<00:03:06.540> many<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.930> position

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
manually try many of the position

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.680 
manually try many of the position
yourself<00:03:07.500> in<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.680> time<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.040> do<00:03:08.280> have

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
yourself in the time that you do have

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.880 
yourself in the time that you do have
obviously<00:03:09.690> it's<00:03:09.840> not<00:03:09.870> always<00:03:10.050> easy<00:03:10.140> but

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
obviously it's not always easy but

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.199 
obviously it's not always easy but
that's<00:03:11.040> all<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> can<00:03:11.220> really<00:03:11.370> say<00:03:11.550> unless<00:03:12.000> you

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
that's all I can really say unless you

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.120 
that's all I can really say unless you
want<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.450> unless<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.140> bigger<00:03:13.500> bilby<00:03:13.920> would

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
want to unless you a bigger bilby would

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.490 
want to unless you a bigger bilby would
get<00:03:14.280> down<00:03:14.490> in<00:03:14.760> time<00:03:15.200> obviously<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.350> too

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500
