00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.860
 Luis Llongueras starts this first 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.750
 style on natural wavy hair 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.670
 separating the crown area with a 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.950
 zigzag line 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.660
 we raise all the hair holding it with 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.610
 one hand and cut it to the tip of 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.360
 scissors of irregular shape looking 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.360
 short measures 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.010
 in the front area we paraded with a 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.010
 line growing towards the lateral 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.980
 we paraded in the same way the zone of 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.990
 bangs leaving it short and irregular and 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.800
 creating a growing line towards 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.800
 right lateral 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.750
 we now work on the layers 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.220
 intermediate raising the wicks and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.600
 always cutting very irregularly 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.600
 at the tip of scissors 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.460
 we comb our hair up 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.860
 holding it with one hand and cut to 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.510
 join the measurements with the upper zone 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.550
 in this way we will get a gradient 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.550
 keeping the length in the neck 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.930
 we will work in the same way around 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.930
 the whole head 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.320
 we base the nape by cutting over the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.130
 skin and leaving a central lock like 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.130
 design touch 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.569
 we peck the tips to avoid areas 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.349
 very thick first on one side and then 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.349
 on the contrary 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.780
 then let go of the wicks that 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.780
 we had reserved 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.890
 we keep them tied with one hand and 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.180
 we parade them irregularly 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.180
 respecting the long 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.540
 we are marching and opening gaps for 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.709
 lighten the style and maintain 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.709
 irregularity of the cut 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.650
 we will work in the same way all 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.650
 the goals that we had reserved 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.450
 it is important to study the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.640
 thickness of the hair on which 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.770
 we are working emptying and parading 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.610
 where necessary to get the 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.610
 Finished we are looking for 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.720
 once the cut is finished 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.460
 we will condition the hair and what 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.150
 we will remove fingers looking for a finish 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.150
 very natural 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.570
 we see the final result a style 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.199
 Informal for customers who want the 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.199
 maximum comfort
