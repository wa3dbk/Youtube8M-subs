00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:08.419
Hello, I'm Jose Carrasco, welcome to the island of Menorca

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:18.733
today I have the pleasure to show to you a 
 majestic property with 725.000 square metres of land

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:28.909
and where you find different constructions which make a total 
 of more than 2.000 square metres of buildings

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:35.699
and where stands an imposing listed grand house 
 which dates from the late 18th century

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.732
which is found in a perfect state of conservation

00:00:39.732 --> 00:00:45.554
it is a house in the classical style with modernist influences

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:57.592
and has over 40 rooms with 5 sitting rooms, 
 2 dining rooms, 17 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms

00:00:57.592 --> 00:01:05.229
accommodation for staff, 2 kitchens, storerooms and larders, etc.,

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.593
it has everything you could imagine

00:01:08.593 --> 00:01:14.898
and as you see, it is on three levels 
 with a tower at the high point

00:01:14.898 --> 00:01:23.221
the facade is flat in a classic style with moulded frames and borders in white

00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:30.873
large windows in an English style and a Baroque-style cornice

00:01:30.873 --> 00:01:37.926
this is the rear part of the main house, and 
 as you can see, it is a recreational area

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:51.010
where there is a beautiful mature garden of 3.600 
 square metres with these lovely old trees

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:57.600
here also you find the tennis court which you can see in the background

00:01:57.602 --> 00:02:03.050
and this swimming pool of more than 60m² surface area

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:18.650
we also find this covered terrace of 100m², an ideal 
 place to hide away from the heat of mid-summer

00:02:18.654 --> 00:02:26.180
this wonderful property not only offers a magnificent, luxurious and elegant house

00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:31.970
but it also has a vast amount of 
 land of more than 700.000 square metres

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.030
it faces south and reaches almost down to a beautiful beach

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:49.030
and within the property we find other agricultural buildings which 
 total more than 800 square metres built area

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:54.700
moreover, it has a varied landscape which is charming

00:02:54.701 --> 00:03:02.460
because you can see the sea and at the same time enjoy the greenery

00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:14.260
just 500 metres from the main house we find a group of buildings and 
 where you find the majority of the farm buildings within the property

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:22.910
here to the side of me we have this drove of friendly pigs

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:31.990
and all of these buildings logically provide possibilities for expansion

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.730
they could be reformed and converted into what you want

00:03:38.728 --> 00:03:45.680
they total more than 800 square metres of buildings

00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:56.770
there are various barns, stables, and there is also 
 an old house used by the gardener

00:03:56.774 --> 00:04:07.450
as you can see there are lovely trees and 
 in the distance we have the sea

00:04:07.452 --> 00:04:22.640
and we have, as I said, two houses, small ones, one of them for the 
 gardener and the other for man who looked after the kitchen garden in its day

00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:25.590
here there is a horse

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.300
here he is standing calmly in the shade of the barn

00:04:32.295 --> 00:04:46.440
and well, logically there are old water tanks, wells, everything you 
 could imagine inside a property such as this one

00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:59.650
it really is a lovely place which reaches almost down 
 to the sea close to an desirable little beach

00:04:59.648 --> 00:05:04.170
and well, you couldn’t ask for anything more

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:12.760
practically the whole of the land of the property is passable by motorised transport

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.180
and little by little we are getting closer to the sea and enjoying the countryside

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:30.790
down this path we found very old trees, 
 holm oaks many hundreds of years old

00:05:30.794 --> 00:05:38.890
there are also pines, and all the time we are getting 
 closer as I said earlier to a lovely beach

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:48.600
a beautiful beach full of charm, it's a place 
 that really characterises our dear island of Menorca

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:57.910
and logically, it gives this property a special value

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:13.900
here for example we find a well on the road,  and you 
 have views of the sea which gives this property such importance

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:23.250
this little paradisiacal beach is Binisafua right next to 
 the property we have been looking at today

00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:31.760
it's a little corner which is especially charming on the Menorquin coastline

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:40.690
a typical place with transparent water, an idyllic enclave where to enjoy the coast

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:45.790
and while making the most of these beautiful images I 
 will remind you of our contact details

00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:50.570

00:06:50.573 --> 00:06:56.110
and our e-mail address is info@sesmoreres.com

00:06:56.108 --> 00:07:00.000
from here and with a fond farewell I will say goodbye to you

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:05.700
and I hope to see you soon in the next video, many thanks!
