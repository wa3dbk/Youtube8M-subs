was a three-episode break on onward from
that<00:01:27.180> point<00:01:27.710> now<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> theory<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.000> it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that point now just a theory and it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.340 
that point now just a theory and it
really<00:01:30.270> doesn't<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.170> like

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
really doesn't have to do with like

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.719 
really doesn't have to do with like
getting<00:01:31.590> people<00:01:31.770> excited<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.369> I'm<00:01:32.549> assuming

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
getting people excited but I'm assuming

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.580 
getting people excited but I'm assuming
that<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> same

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
that this is it going to be the same

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
that this is it going to be the same
thing<00:01:34.650> there's<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.250> three<00:01:35.549> Episode

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
thing there's going to be three Episode

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.080 
thing there's going to be three Episode
breaks<00:01:36.990> until<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.500> next<00:01:37.770> one<00:01:38.009> after<00:01:38.369> this

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
breaks until the next one after this

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.630

overall<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.270> could<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> very<00:01:46.110> good

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
overall that this could be a very good

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.810 
overall that this could be a very good
episode<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.159> pull<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.490> off<00:01:47.640> because

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
episode if they pull this off because

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.789

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
sure everybody knows that and we haven't

is going to be here I'm thinking not i'm
going<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.270> guess<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:10.289> possible<00:02:10.679> because

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
going to guess not it's possible because

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.360 
going to guess not it's possible because
the<00:02:12.489> map<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:13.000> there<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.900> send<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.560> main<00:02:14.739> 6<00:02:15.129> or

the map is there to send the main 6 or

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.289 
the map is there to send the main 6 or
apparently<00:02:16.500> whoever<00:02:17.500> they<00:02:17.950> map<00:02:18.549> chooses<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.269> a

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
apparently whoever they map chooses to a

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.929 
apparently whoever they map chooses to a
place<00:02:19.780> because<00:02:20.349> of<00:02:20.379> friendship<00:02:20.860> issues<00:02:21.220> this

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
place because of friendship issues this

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.990 
place because of friendship issues this
might<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.870> good<00:02:23.290> example<00:02:23.439> of<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.220> don't

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
might be a good example of it I don't

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.069 
might be a good example of it I don't
think<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.299> is<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.450> going<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.720> keep<00:02:25.930> on

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
think that is just going to keep on

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.479 
think that is just going to keep on
being<00:02:26.349> a<00:02:26.439> town<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.709> think<00:02:27.069> it<00:02:27.159> might<00:02:27.280> actually

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
being a town I think it might actually

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.330 
being a town I think it might actually
start<00:02:27.909> being<00:02:28.150> personal<00:02:29.010> maybe<00:02:30.010> we'll<00:02:30.189> have

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
start being personal maybe we'll have

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.300 
start being personal maybe we'll have
another<00:02:30.599> Twilight<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:31.720> Trixie<00:02:32.079> one<00:02:32.310> who

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
another Twilight and Trixie one who

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.089 
another Twilight and Trixie one who
knows<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.750> anyway<00:02:35.019> that's<00:02:35.170> my<00:02:35.230> thoughts<00:02:35.530> I'm

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
knows but anyway that's my thoughts I'm

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.369
