00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 welcome to the good more mayors 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.539
 well I'm here on the outside 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.180
 because I'm going to bring you 22 possibilities 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.970
 of hairstyle in which they can be used 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.550
 or for the pool or for the beach 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.179
 in order to retire these 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.599
 manes and being able to feel a little more 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.510
 coolies 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.519
 good video I 've been a little 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 cheat in the introduction and they are two 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:44.300
 hairstyles but of each of them there are 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.100
 other options in this in this first 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.710
 combed what we're going to do is follow 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.260
 Taking different pigtails as you go 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.159
 see in the video and I the idea what 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.159
 I was trying to do to be a 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.680
 little bit more original is that the color of 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.519
 the gummies are colored for 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.819
 highlight a little more the correct ones and that 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.590
 look a little more original as you see me 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:11.960
 every queue that I do what I'm going to do 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.520
 is to open the top part so that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.649
 is leaving a gap and this way 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.720
 is going to make a visual effect that 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.890
 we still have much more hair and that 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.890
 there is a ponytail 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.590
 well so far from our first 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.749
 combed this can be an option 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.319
 just leave it like that and with the pigtail 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:50.810
 loose we can also find a 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.819
 second option which is the queue that 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.069
 We're going to roll it up to make a 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.200
 low bow that as I told you in the 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.929
 last of my videos takes a lot 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.929
 and look is a pretty original hairstyle 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.050
 and finally as the raid's hairstyle 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.840
 root of all is this that what is 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.360
 keep going with all the pigtails 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.100
 and as you can see it's very important to open it 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.740
 so that you believe then that to that effect 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.600
 of volume in the hair and it seems that what 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.500
 we have to look like we have a lot more 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.500
 quantity 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.250
 in the second hairstyle we're going to start 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.250
 make a pigtail 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.250
 yes 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.030
 and now what we 're going to do is start 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.060
 to turn that little tail in like an effect to 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.610
 May as you see in the image is very 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.490
 important not to tighten is more I have not 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.220
 tight and then I released it a little and 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.900
 then let's hook this monkey with 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.640
 help of forks all those that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.020
 we need it is very important to leave 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.480
 effect like that without tightening the bow now 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.130
 let's get a handkerchief for this 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.320
 season is taking a lot 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.040
 the handkerchiefs to put on our heads 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.170
 and put an option of one of these 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.720
 hairstyles to use for new york 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.730
 I will show you how I position myself in 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.160
 this case this handkerchief is simply a 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.350
 bow tied a bow a tie that 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.110
 note well that our face is happy 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.500
 two hairpins on the sides and so 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.660
 this option would finish combing me 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.990
 it seems fantastic very fine and especially 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.670
 for the beach that is removed well 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.100
 all the orders of the face and we do not 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.040
 bother with the wind etcetera others not 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.879
 we are good at the sunlight 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.879
 on the trail 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.260
 well this is all I hope that I have 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.480
 delighted and now if it's your turn 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.800
 put it into practice these hairstyles do not 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.810
