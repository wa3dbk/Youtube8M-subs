 ps4 now thinks about getting you to 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.409

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.880
 a long time ago 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.250
 I do not know why it did not go out for 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.590
 Geez, but now without scrolling I'm here. 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.670
 I hope people get a good angle. 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.590
 sure the PS3 target there on the standing side is 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 for you to focus more here on 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.090
 playstation 4 that will be the subject here 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.009
 I'll talk to you, beauty. 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.990
 First of all I'll go and neither will I 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.150
 I'll leave my tips to you from 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.700
 how to avoid heating in your 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.520
 playstation 4 problems also beauty 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.710
 first you will buy the ps4 already 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.729
 has ps4 and has not had this problem and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.560
 wants to avoid 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.320
 to avoid in the general case 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.600
 what you do first puts the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.579
 its price in 14 place kind and if more 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.680
 airy in which there is nothing 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.310
 behind has space on the side 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.159
 here everything else in which the warm air that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.390
 is within it can be played to 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.640
 outside and how it is said to circulate the air 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.140
 Hot to not come back paid in. 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.629
 because when the ps4 of a 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.390
 overheating that was last year 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.200
 my gift was in front of the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.720
 television 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.730
 It was like that, and the television was fine. 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.160
 here behind and you know that television 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.200
 It's hot and I was not very connected 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.060
 television warming the ps4 in a 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.599
 very tight place when you did not have a 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.140
 very good property was very much a space 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.330
 his 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.560
 television warming hot air 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.390
 I knew he could not move 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.420
 because in addition to the hot air you leave 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.580
 inside the outside of the television enter 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.019
 inside and drowned out what was 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.230
 wanting to get out or the warm air that 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.330
 skirt was coming back and in that I played 30 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.370
 minutes from the video game the boat already 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.069
 I was on fire from Kentucky. 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.989
 I found this very strange after I 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.880
 I fixed a better place to put it. 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.410
 Never again is that beauty problem that 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.260
 is his control such 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.329
 good first a tip lets you 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.790
 place in an airy place that is not 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.190
 hot an airy place even in itself 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.360
 napoli may have entered inflation and 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.940
 everything else 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.150
 and look at something very cool that I 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.579
 I did what you guys advise me too. 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.660
 to put his feet under him 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.220
 It can be anything you see that 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.700
 you stuff that is pipes and not me 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.670
 mistake 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.079
 back there is even a bottle cap and 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.690
 you put two in front and two behind 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.540
 for that you should be serving 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.250
 also asking in this 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.260
 Do you notice underneath it? I do not know if it will. 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.810
 give focus not know if you are 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.180
 Seeing this drill very well fifth 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.549
 understood and what it warms up like 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.130
 video game can not go beyond 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.319
 to heat the video game more can inject 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.880
 The cd alone on this button will get this 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.660
 barragem heats up and makes a cd is already 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.510
 alone 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.760
 so some ps 43 and you're with that 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.350
 problem and had this problem ejected 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.750
 disc alone because this plastic 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.630
 underneath it heats up and 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.090
 cd understood that for you to put it 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.340
 so with this species it is good that it has 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.530
 more ventilation from below under it 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.630
 warm up just like over and over 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.639
 how hot air get out in here it comes out 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.849
 and has room to move underneath 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.079
 It's also the same thing I tell you 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.989
 guys, how do I pray to God? 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.060
 overheating last year in addition to having 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.010
 given overheating or lost and more 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.690
 of seven games of my hd 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.100
 I had a loss there and then I 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.290
 what a way to solve this for 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.960
 not happening again i did it and 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.550
 I never came back 4 happened this he 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.430
 Do not even get too hot for you. 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.050
 I stopped playing and 34 hours followed 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.970
 The video game is love for you to have. 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.670
 idea and this is exactly the place 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.530
 he's there a lot of people talk about the ps4 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.150
 problems in growth and I do not know the 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.300
 what the crowd 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.050
 this is the following the ps4 problem is 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.510
 overheating 5 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.430
 only this will give you where you live 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.630
 It's also hot if everything is hot. 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.700
 Hot where you live 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.620
 you do not have air conditioning something 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.120
 so kind I highly recommend it 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.270
 You leave a video game in a way. 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.680
 much more chilled refrigerated than 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.160
 can not happen this type of 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.290
