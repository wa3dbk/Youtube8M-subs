00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
so that s not good either this has been

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:17.510 
so that s not good either this has been
extended<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.510> I'm<00:01:06.810> not<00:01:06.869> sure<00:01:15.290> I<00:01:16.520> don't

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
extended but I'm I'm not sure I don't

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.080 
extended but I'm I'm not sure I don't
check<00:01:18.060> out<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.509> does<00:01:18.720> actually<00:01:19.140> anything<00:01:19.380> new

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
check out it does actually anything new

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.070 
check out it does actually anything new
I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.229> faster<00:01:23.659> but<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:24.869> not

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
I think it's actually faster but I'm not

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.010 
I think it's actually faster but I'm not
that<00:01:25.290> sure<00:01:25.590> about<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> anyway<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.780> been

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that sure about that so anyway it's been

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.609 
that sure about that so anyway it's been
more<00:01:34.290> than<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.530> week<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:38.450> know<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.350> it's

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
more than a week and I know I think it's

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.710 
more than a week and I know I think it's
been<00:01:40.860> worth<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.460> considering<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.420> we'll

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
been worth it considering that we'll

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
been worth it considering that we'll
each<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.770> phone<00:01:43.979> gets<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.990> hundred<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.409> twenty

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
each of phone gets a hundred and twenty

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.109 
each of phone gets a hundred and twenty
blue<00:01:46.920> points<00:01:47.220> which<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.399> more<00:01:47.729> than<00:01:47.880> ten

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
blue points which is more than ten

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.240 
blue points which is more than ten
dollars<00:01:48.600> worth<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> stuff<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.950> pretty

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
dollars worth of stuff so that is pretty

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.810 
dollars worth of stuff so that is pretty
good<00:01:51.200> has<00:01:52.200> been<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.560> huge<00:01:52.799> loss<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.130> C<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> think

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.590 

but<00:02:00.079> it's<00:02:01.079> actually<00:02:01.439> faster<00:02:02.299> that's<00:02:03.299> quite

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
but it's actually faster that's quite

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.009 
but it's actually faster that's quite
good

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.869 

let's<00:02:10.019> check<00:02:10.259> out<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.590> junket<00:02:11.039> if<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.700> a

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
let's check out the junket if it's a

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.290 
let's check out the junket if it's a
lighting<00:02:12.180> new<00:02:12.360> here<00:02:12.660> which<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.319> had<00:02:13.709> adopted

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
lighting new here which I had adopted

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:35.600 
lighting new here which I had adopted
but<00:02:15.300> okay<00:02:19.099> I'll<00:02:20.099> take<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:26.450> no<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:27.629> not<00:02:34.610> okay

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
but okay I'll take this no it's not okay

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.009 
but okay I'll take this no it's not okay
but<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.849> think<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.239> actually<00:02:36.599> faster<00:02:39.019> pretty

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
but I think it's actually faster pretty

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.949 
but I think it's actually faster pretty
much<00:02:40.260> faster<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:40.829> think<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:43.709> can<00:02:43.950> see<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
much faster I think you can see that the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.930 
much faster I think you can see that the
icon<00:02:45.959> scale<00:02:46.470> did<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.739> hold<00:02:47.069> on<00:02:47.220> has<00:02:47.579> something

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
icon scale did a hold on has something

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.770 
icon scale did a hold on has something
been<00:02:48.120> cancelled

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.619 

let<00:02:51.780> me<00:02:51.959> just<00:02:52.200> check<00:02:52.349> on<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.739> again<00:02:56.329> has<00:02:57.329> been

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
let me just check on this again has been

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.470 
let me just check on this again has been
cancelled

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
cancelled

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.839 
cancelled
okay<00:03:00.500> it's<00:03:01.500> been<00:03:01.709> canceled

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
okay it's been canceled

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.089 
okay it's been canceled
I<00:03:02.910> think<00:03:03.450> they<00:03:03.569> have<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.810> much<00:03:04.110> more<00:03:04.379> icons<00:03:04.860> over

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
I think they have a much more icons over

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:13.160 
I think they have a much more icons over
here<00:03:09.349> and<00:03:10.670> that's<00:03:11.670> what<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:11.910> think<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.450> think

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
here and that's what I think I think

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
here and that's what I think I think
that's<00:03:13.650> what<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:13.950> much<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.310> perhaps<00:03:21.769> yes<00:03:22.769> I
