00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.830
 I know how loud your ears are 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.610
 it still up to feyenoord 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.259
 art 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.089
 well well of course i have 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:11.679
 lots of friends too 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.309
 within five listings 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.629
 I have known the Martin for a long time with Martin van Geel 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.230
 He has become a true friend Friday he gets that tipster to choose and 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.739
 voip yes he 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.349
 that's a shame because I think if you 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.480
 if you were such a man she is like martin and he gives in time and is 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.340
 that just someone who feyenoord provided it all remain calm when he again 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:33.720
 get on track to 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.530
 and be able to start the way up 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.840
 actually rijswijk changeable cup knows how to start again 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.050
 I feel sorry for the club Feyenoord and for the people hungry 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.320
 because you have the impression with martin of yellow and mario leg it had little 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.730
 respect well well I do not know how that will soon no longer be within the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.139
 selection likes joining with the players works 

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:53.130
 I only know 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.990
 very martin works and i like that 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.920
 have done the file super what I think he is the best candidate in 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.050
 Netherlands to put on that position 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.000
 how do you think that is for the rest of the technical staff as Mario van Klap 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.880
 then get one 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.880
 It is suspected that leon vlemmings also includes free consumption 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.560
 after the winter 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.300
 I would 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.840
 really really strange if I was an assistant trainer even if I fight that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.450
 was pulling jasper 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.140
 yes then I would 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.860
 have to think very carefully about whether I or I would like to continue 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.480
 he says that for two years 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.490
 I am no longer in the group but on the other hand if you live I have you 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.210
 a kind of understanding for the player group 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.390
 if that question you to register yes look at fort hood that is something 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.420
 within that group, I think I am happy that I train, I wish for strength and strength 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.969
 most boys don't 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.089
 as an outsider you can call all things to a wheelchair 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.150
 but I cannot judge both categories under which the ruling comes 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.940
 that is something that is within the group 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.340
 and therefore he brought out about it 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.740
 how exactly does it say, I don't know 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.820
 but the garden could have had an STI anyway 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.200
 in the preparations 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.039
 yes I think that's a shame 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.209
 now in preparation 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.459
 imitates 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.900
 and now bringing in nothing wants to get used to each other and needs more time 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.059
 I don't think the fact that it's waiting for it has been brave enough 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.429
 last years 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:22.530
 you need the emergence types 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.649
 the dead silence 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.659
 but what i do 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.709
 the Belgian for which TNT despite the precarious that he just three thousand people to 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.249
 watch and 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.249
 That is, I say the compliments to the organization here 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.779
 which means that they have done very well 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.419
 yes what like aruba we have made the field based on the 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:47.700
 rates because accommodation is a good thing that we can do we do 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:51.079
 have to make sure that you are welcome, you know that people feel that 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.659
 they feel welcome in the top three but we must succeed 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.209
 but i also have to be scared 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.189
 wilders go wrong with supporters 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.540
 two thirds of all events it is such a bad situation that you will not come up with 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.659
 no but that was more than I expected 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.519
 it is of course also possible for all the supporters and 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.950
 they both missed building I think it is because he also we are startled 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.929
 it is in the interest of feyenoord now 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.649
 I think so and then I talk about Al Sadd 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.269
 as someone who want the club 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.949
 a big heart is nice that that at the level that explains that now 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.949
 not going to do all kinds of weird things again in the old-fashioned way 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.079
 yes i thought you shoot there as feyenoord its nothing anymore 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.930
 but that has been entrusted to gelder times 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.389
 set a new mandate to close the ranks so called 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.659
 yeah its got me think martin in there 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.879
 as one of the best in the netherlands there is perhaps europe so that is and 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.500
 entrusted
