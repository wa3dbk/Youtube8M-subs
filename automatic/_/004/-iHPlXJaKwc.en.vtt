00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.530
 all the beauties I have in mind 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.510
 an inspector for you again because 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.670
 i totally love the parts though i have 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.950
 Originally determined by one 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.320
 half an hour or so come in there 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.450
 in the channel of fixie do and have 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.369
 I very much enjoyed watching and 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.750
 I already have many of them back then 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.180
 found make-ups I think I have 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.230
 even 1 x counterfeited or so on each 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.490
 In case I had it now a whole 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.599
 I have not seen it and I have it now 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.180
 switched back on 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.490
 and she has such a wonderful tutorial 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.900
 which I necessarily for you then 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.220
 virtually as an inspector like 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.850
 wanted to record and that was show 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.830
 wanted 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.940
 I did that now, too 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.570
 you have the desire then you can do that 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.700
 look at 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.160
 I think it's a lot of fun 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.690
 so i have fun again and again 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.420
 tutorials that's always the case with me 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.640
 phased and I like that too 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.740
 totally like yourself now as 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.080
 think of it or just something 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.180
 imitate what somebody else somehow 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.620
 has created and to look like it 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.330
 you look and what you do 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.040
 would have to change and what their own 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.420
 products are with which this works well 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.880
 and what maybe products are with 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.470
 which it does not work at all and 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.030
 today it would not be a case of over 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.020
 believe you will see it soon 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.850
 I had some problems like that 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.259
 to take my bands was a very complete one 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.530
 So bad decisions are there 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.149
 Not too great , but I do 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.460
 but I will definitely below the 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.990
 pixi to video link and watch it 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.509
 it is really on you i find it 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.819
 terrific i love lux so i like that 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.950
 copper-colored around the eye and then 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.929
 she would have such a pink base for 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.490
 eye the only thing I have what 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:45.609
 This is roughly comparable to that 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.609
 luxembourg open should oyster the color 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.280
 so then the exciting part follows 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.130
 and I will give me tips and that 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.049
 corporate in there were with a 217 of 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:04.460
 mac and i hope that as soon as possible 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:11.069
 becomes so spotty because I'm the one 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:14.880
 jambo panzer and as a base on it have it 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:18.650
 already real alarm it can be 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.650
 not as good blind as usual 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.180
 stay quiet by mac 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.320
 then the browser is missing the second one 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.610
 that i am the user and ever 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.890
 never try 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.370
 I'm reaching for his normal one now 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.730
 powder brush you just look better 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.730
 is 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:13.310
 one comes to let or maybe one 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:15.140
 a bit gaga two ok so that's it 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.640
 then the finished make-up I think so 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.200
 actually to be honest pretty 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.910
 cool I am that looks nice 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.220
 I also think it has a bit 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.230
 More of cranberry than the head 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.030
 so ring if you like the color 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.280
 completely miss then you see 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.710
 maybe what I mean 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.890
 through the outer initially times 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.240
 Try and get a photo 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.010
 of which I will pack on the block 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.200
 me again as soon as that is there and 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.820
 I'm practically completely abandoned and 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.140
 to see what that looks like 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.740
 I will answer that as a video synonymous 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.230
 do 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.320
 thank you dear pixi turu that you have the video 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.010
 I love the make up is turned 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.010
 it is very nice
