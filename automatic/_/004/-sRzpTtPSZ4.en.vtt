00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
quite hard to defend against but a West

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.490 
quite hard to defend against but a West
Brom<00:01:18.000> were<00:01:18.119> probably<00:01:18.299> aiming<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:19.020> mid-table

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
Brom were probably aiming for mid-table

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
Brom were probably aiming for mid-table
I'm<00:01:20.009> trying<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.520> aim<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.670> mid<00:01:21.030> table<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.390> well

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
I'm trying to aim for mid table as well

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
I'm trying to aim for mid table as well
our<00:01:22.040> objective<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.369> stay<00:01:23.580> away<00:01:23.700> from

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
our objective is to stay away from

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.520 
our objective is to stay away from
relegation<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.290> could<00:01:25.409> probably

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
relegation but I think we could probably

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920 
relegation but I think we could probably
reach<00:01:25.890> mid-table<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.700> i<00:01:26.790> play<00:01:27.210> my<00:01:27.240> best<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
reach mid-table if i play my best and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.420 
reach mid-table if i play my best and
the<00:01:28.020> team<00:01:28.259> performs<00:01:29.009> well<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.280> we're

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the team performs well but we're

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.920 
the team performs well but we're
currently<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.790> eight<00:01:30.030> position<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.720> West
