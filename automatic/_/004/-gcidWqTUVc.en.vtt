00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
troops and then I threw down the wall

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.150 
troops and then I threw down the wall
breakers<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.350> pretty<00:00:34.500> good<00:00:34.680> strategy

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
breakers that's a pretty good strategy

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.610 
breakers that's a pretty good strategy
because<00:00:35.550> all<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.930> other<00:00:36.960> troops<00:00:37.440> are

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
because all the other troops are

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
because all the other troops are
attacking<00:00:37.890> all<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.790> defenses<00:00:39.210> are<00:00:39.360> attacking

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
attacking all the defenses are attacking

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.869 
attacking all the defenses are attacking
all<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> troops<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:41.160> wall<00:00:41.340> breakers<00:00:41.700> yet

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
all the troops so my wall breakers yet

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
all the troops so my wall breakers yet
time<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.120> get<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.020> smash<00:00:43.290> actual<00:00:43.680> walls

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
time to get in and smash actual walls

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.270 
time to get in and smash actual walls
before<00:00:44.160> being<00:00:44.520> destroyed<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.920> then<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.010> throw

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
before being destroyed and then I throw

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.400 
before being destroyed and then I throw
down<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.610> other<00:00:47.789> troops<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.390> eventually<00:00:48.930> my

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
down my other troops and eventually my

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.760 
down my other troops and eventually my
whole<00:00:49.590> graders<00:00:50.570> but<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.660> think<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.110> prematurely

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
whole graders but I think I prematurely

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.520 
whole graders but I think I prematurely
trigger<00:00:53.760> those<00:00:54.030> hero<00:00:54.390> powers<00:00:54.899> between<00:00:55.050> new<00:00:55.350> by

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
trigger those hero powers between new by

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.090 
trigger those hero powers between new by
the<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:56.270> Young<00:00:57.270> barbarian<00:00:57.899> King<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.350> makes

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the way Young barbarian King just makes

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.850 
the way Young barbarian King just makes
barbarians<00:00:59.730> rage<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:02.420> archer<00:01:03.420> Queen

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
barbarians rage and the archer Queen

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.770 
barbarians rage and the archer Queen
goes<00:01:04.860> invisible<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> few<00:01:05.820> seconds<00:01:06.240> which

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
goes invisible for a few seconds which

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.679 
goes invisible for a few seconds which
is<00:01:07.020> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.470> cool<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.790> useful<00:01:09.090> or

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
is kind of cool but not that useful or

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.630 
is kind of cool but not that useful or
it<00:01:10.170> could<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.380> useful<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.280> use<00:01:11.430> at

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it could be useful if I if you use at

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.020 
it could be useful if I if you use at
the<00:01:11.760> right<00:01:11.909> time<00:01:12.799> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> also<00:01:14.159> quite<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.729> big

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the right time this is also quite a big

the right time this is also quite a big

one<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.689> closest<00:01:52.170> race<00:01:52.380> I've<00:01:52.409> ever<00:01:52.590> gotten

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
one of the closest race I've ever gotten

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.240 
one of the closest race I've ever gotten
in<00:01:53.399> terms<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.970> time<00:01:54.270> limit<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:55.219> managed<00:01:56.219> to

in terms of time limit I managed to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.770 
in terms of time limit I managed to
three<00:01:56.579> star<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.969> guy<00:01:58.100> intervene<00:01:59.100> maybe<00:01:59.939> but

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
three star this guy intervene maybe but

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380 
three star this guy intervene maybe but
well<00:02:01.020> between<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.590> 0<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.340> first<00:02:02.610> second<00:02:03.210> of

well between the 0 and first second of
the<00:02:03.659> ending<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.710> other<00:02:04.950> was<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.130> few

the ending so the other was a few

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.580 
the ending so the other was a few
milliseconds<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:06.060> spare<00:02:06.390> here<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> tired<00:02:07.439> to
