00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
like the same old thing every night

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.560 
like the same old thing every night
everybody's<00:00:29.429> using<00:00:29.670> like<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> same<00:00:30.269> load

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
everybody's using like the same load

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.840 
everybody's using like the same load
outs<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.230> same<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:32.189> know<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> same<00:00:32.460> low

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
outs and the same you know the same low

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.000 
outs and the same you know the same low
doses<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.120> use<00:00:33.329> day<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.570> day<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.440> it's

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
doses that use day in day out and it's

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.410 
doses that use day in day out and it's
kind<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.280> sucks<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.910> community<00:00:36.300> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
kind of sucks because the community is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.330 
kind of sucks because the community is
small<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.230> when<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.469> start<00:00:37.620> seeing<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.129> same

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
small so when you start seeing the same

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
small so when you start seeing the same
people<00:00:38.520> every<00:00:39.059> night<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.809> start<00:00:40.050> seeing

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
people every night and you start seeing

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.440 
people every night and you start seeing
the<00:00:40.469> same<00:00:40.649> load<00:00:41.040> outs<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> same<00:00:41.910> tactics

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
the same load outs and the same tactics

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.060 
the same load outs and the same tactics
everything<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.079> does<00:00:43.110> get<00:00:43.530> boring<00:00:43.739> because

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
everything it does get boring because

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.340 
everything it does get boring because
the<00:00:44.280> game<00:00:44.460> gets<00:00:44.700> stale<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.960> know<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> lot

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the game gets stale and you know a lot

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.049 
the game gets stale and you know a lot
of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> people<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> game<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.520> still<00:00:47.879> like

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
of the people in the game do still like

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.029 
of the people in the game do still like
to<00:00:48.270> sit<00:00:48.570> there<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> motivators<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

care packages and they hell stack and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.590 
care packages and they hell stack and
the<00:00:52.920> witch<00:00:53.129> doctor<00:00:53.160> even<00:00:53.910> though<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.180> still

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the witch doctor even though I still

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.810 
the witch doctor even though I still
don't<00:00:54.780> think<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.110> overpowered<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
don't think it's overpowered in the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.700 
don't think it's overpowered in the
hands<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.449> campers<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> witch<00:00:58.260> doctor<00:00:58.289> is

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
hands of campers the witch doctor is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.889 
hands of campers the witch doctor is
pretty<00:00:58.949> still<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.640> pretty<00:00:59.879> shitty<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.449> don't

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
pretty still it's pretty shitty I don't

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.599 
pretty still it's pretty shitty I don't
like<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.309> could<00:01:02.460> just

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
like it it's because they could just

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.399 
like it it's because they could just
block<00:01:02.850> off<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> area<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.780> can't<00:01:04.019> really<00:01:04.260> get

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
block off the area you can't really get

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080 
block off the area you can't really get
in<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:04.680> even<00:01:05.100> though<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.670> deflect

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
in there even though you can deflect

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.240 
in there even though you can deflect
balls<00:01:06.420> around<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.840> corner<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.560> well

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
balls around the corner with it well

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.649 
balls around the corner with it well
grounded<00:01:08.520> kind<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.030> puts<00:01:09.210> an<00:01:09.330> end<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.570> that

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
grounded kind of puts an end to that

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.320 
grounded kind of puts an end to that
because<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.500> help<00:01:10.710> stack<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.189> does<00:01:11.460> uh<00:01:11.490> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
because the help stack it does uh you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.539 
because the help stack it does uh you
know<00:01:12.450> stack<00:01:12.780> higher<00:01:13.080> than<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> actual<00:01:13.830> uh<00:01:14.130> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
know stack higher than the actual uh I

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.640 
know stack higher than the actual uh I
guess<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.090> say<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.479> damage<00:01:16.080> does<00:01:16.320> from

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
guess you would say the damage does from

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.070 
guess you would say the damage does from
well<00:01:17.130> grounded<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.060> even<00:01:18.450> though<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.840> did

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
well grounded so even though they did

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.980
