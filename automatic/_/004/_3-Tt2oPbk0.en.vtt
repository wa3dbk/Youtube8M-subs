they<00:00:12.269> came<00:00:12.509> out<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:13.849> 5d<00:00:14.849> mark<00:00:15.120> two<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.570> know

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
they came out of a 5d mark two I know

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.570 
they came out of a 5d mark two I know
you're<00:00:16.320> saying<00:00:16.560> how<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.830> heck<00:00:17.100> do<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> do<00:00:17.550> that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
you're saying how the heck do I do that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.450 
you're saying how the heck do I do that
well<00:00:18.539> there's<00:00:18.750> three<00:00:19.170> ways<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.980> do<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.310> so

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
well there's three ways to do that so

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.349 
well there's three ways to do that so
I'm<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> break<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.939> down<00:00:21.119> into<00:00:21.180> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
I'm going to break this down into a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.009 
I'm going to break this down into a
three-part<00:00:21.779> series<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:23.180> basically<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
three-part series and basically the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.429 
three-part series and basically the
first<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.680> we're<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.039> talk<00:00:26.279> about<00:00:26.460> is

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
first one we're going to talk about is

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.260 
first one we're going to talk about is
lighting<00:00:28.439> part<00:00:29.310> 1<00:00:29.929> part<00:00:30.929> 1<00:00:31.140> lighting<00:00:32.270> so

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
lighting part 1 part 1 lighting so

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.319 
lighting part 1 part 1 lighting so
basically<00:00:33.800> for<00:00:34.800> photos<00:00:35.219> we've<00:00:35.579> always<00:00:35.790> it's

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
basically for photos we've always it's

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.690 
basically for photos we've always it's
always<00:00:36.420> been<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> caveat<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.770> photography<00:00:38.520> it's

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
always been a caveat in photography it's

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.549 
always been a caveat in photography it's
always<00:00:38.910> been<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> founding<00:00:39.989> principle

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
always been a like a founding principle

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.889 
always been a like a founding principle
is<00:00:40.770> lighting<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.610> everything<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.300> photography

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
is lighting is everything in photography

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.720 
is lighting is everything in photography
if<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.890> lighting<00:00:44.309> right<00:00:44.520> in

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
if you can get your lighting right in

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
if you can get your lighting right in
photography<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.260> make<00:00:46.410> your

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
photography if you can make your

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.889 
photography if you can make your
lighting<00:00:46.860> look<00:00:47.010> perfect<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.360> squeeze

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
lighting look perfect you can squeeze

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.069 
lighting look perfect you can squeeze
every<00:00:49.680> little<00:00:50.070> ounce<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.850> goodness<00:00:51.600> out<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
every little ounce of goodness out of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
every little ounce of goodness out of
the<00:00:52.260> sensor<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> film<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the sensor or out of the film that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.080 
the sensor or out of the film that
you're<00:00:54.390> using<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.219> make<00:00:56.550> your<00:00:56.760> image

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you're using and you can make your image

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.360 
you're using and you can make your image
just<00:00:57.390> shine<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.530> rock<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.800> image

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370

just shine you can just rock your image
and<00:00:59.579> it's<00:01:00.270> no<00:01:00.449> different<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:00.989> video<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and it's no different with video if you

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.939 
and it's no different with video if you
learn<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> light<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:04.290> video

what they haven't let this is going to
be<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.630> way<00:05:33.780> that<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:34.200> can<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:35.100> single

if you learn to master your lighting

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.510 
if you learn to master your lighting
you'll<00:05:46.500> be<00:05:46.650> able<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:46.919> make<00:05:47.040> stuff<00:05:47.340> out<00:05:47.460> of

you'll be able to make stuff out of

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.620 
you'll be able to make stuff out of
those<00:05:47.700> cameras<00:05:48.120> that<00:05:48.330> is<00:05:48.450> virtually
