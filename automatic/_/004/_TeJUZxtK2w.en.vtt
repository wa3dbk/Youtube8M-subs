00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.600 
we've been close to to having great

results but that's for him not enough he

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.280 
results but that's for him not enough he
wants<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.970> same<00:01:23.180> as<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.450> want<00:01:23.690> I<00:01:23.810> want<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.140> win

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290

wants the same as I want I want to win
and<00:01:24.680> we<00:01:25.100> want<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.370> win<00:01:25.520> he<00:01:26.270> has<00:01:26.390> reasonable

expectations<00:01:27.619> for<00:01:27.830> high<00:01:27.950> expectations<00:01:28.700> which

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
expectations for high expectations which

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:38.150 
expectations for high expectations which
I<00:01:28.970> think's<00:01:29.360> perfect<00:01:29.780> her<00:01:29.960> group<00:01:30.770> of<00:01:30.890> guys

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.430 

well<00:01:39.160> I<00:01:39.340> think<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.970> past<00:01:40.870> season<00:01:41.230> for

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
well I think that the past season for

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
well I think that the past season for
many<00:01:41.590> reasons<00:01:42.040> we<00:01:42.160> had<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> lot<00:01:42.430> of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
many reasons we had a lot of

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.830 
many reasons we had a lot of
psychological<00:01:43.150> pressure<00:01:43.690> so<00:01:44.050> my<00:01:44.950> first

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
psychological pressure so my first

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.390 
psychological pressure so my first
problem<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:47.110> solve<00:01:47.350> was<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.740> bring<00:01:47.950> back<00:01:48.160> the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
problem to solve was to bring back the

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.780 
problem to solve was to bring back the
good<00:01:48.520> atmosphere<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:50.280> main<00:01:51.280> thing<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.640> has

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
good atmosphere and main thing it has

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.300 
good atmosphere and main thing it has
been<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.210> create<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.260> first<00:01:53.620> training<00:01:54.220> camp

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
been to create the first training camp

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.420 
been to create the first training camp
there<00:01:54.670> was<00:01:54.760> a<00:01:54.820> team-building<00:01:55.420> camp<00:01:55.480> and<00:01:56.430> we

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
there was a team-building camp and we

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.860 
there was a team-building camp and we
have<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.550> lot<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.730> fun<00:01:58.030> together<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.510> that's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
have a lot of fun together and that's

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.560 
have a lot of fun together and that's
the<00:01:58.990> best<00:01:59.170> way<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.380> build<00:02:00.070> up<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.640> family

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.630 

everybody<00:02:05.570> has<00:02:05.810> big<00:02:06.260> respect<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.400> think

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
everybody has big respect and I think

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.940 
everybody has big respect and I think
that<00:02:07.790> he<00:02:08.240> pushes<00:02:08.660> he<00:02:08.869> gives<00:02:09.110> salad<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.649> lot<00:02:09.800> of

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
that he pushes he gives salad a lot of

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.030 
that he pushes he gives salad a lot of
motivation<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.840> think<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.260> he's<00:02:12.860> gonna

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
motivation and I think that he's gonna

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.339 
motivation and I think that he's gonna
do<00:02:13.310> really<00:02:13.760> well

that's<00:02:37.209> that's<00:02:37.810> good

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.330

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.610 
say and and I will try to keep this
atmosphere<00:02:56.030> longer<00:02:56.689> because<00:02:57.110> we<00:02:57.349> know<00:02:57.470> that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
atmosphere longer because we know that

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.050 
atmosphere longer because we know that
that<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:57.920> end<00:02:58.159> the<00:02:58.310> best<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.670> when<00:02:58.819> there's

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
that in the end the best is when there's

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.059 
that in the end the best is when there's
the<00:02:59.180> results<00:02:59.599> but<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.079> biggest<00:03:00.500> things<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.890> to
