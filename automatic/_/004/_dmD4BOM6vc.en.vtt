difficult<00:01:57.429> but<00:01:57.880> I<00:01:58.090> mean<00:01:58.539> you'll<00:01:58.929> get<00:01:59.079> it<00:01:59.229> down

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.789 
both the Clippers the same I mean they
do<00:02:03.279> the<00:02:03.490> same<00:02:03.729> job<00:02:04.329> it's<00:02:05.139> just<00:02:05.409> which<00:02:05.619> one

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
do the same job it's just which one

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.620 
do the same job it's just which one
you're<00:02:05.979> more<00:02:06.159> comfortable<00:02:06.340> with<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:06.939> I<00:02:07.179> mean

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
you're more comfortable with so I mean

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.600 
you're more comfortable with so I mean
if<00:02:07.779> you<00:02:07.810> have<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.289> go<00:02:08.470> out<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.770> get<00:02:09.220> both<00:02:09.369> pairs

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
if you have to go out and get both pairs

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.429 
if you have to go out and get both pairs
and<00:02:09.910> try<00:02:10.030> them<00:02:10.179> out<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.360> see<00:02:10.569> which<00:02:11.260> one<00:02:11.409> you

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:11.439
