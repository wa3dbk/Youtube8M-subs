00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.759
 but who already has a long balloon and that 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.930
 pass and it goes with ray file the little one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.269
 hook there is not a hand fault 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.240
 there I wonder if there is not a 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.470
 Mafia drag on the side of the lily anyway 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.300
 the referee has nothing whistled we review with 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.890
 this hook where there is a hand that drags 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.580
 but is there a real intention I do not 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.519
 believe it's not over the lierrois 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.000
 camp in the brugge camp with the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.759
 saola what intervention matthew 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.320
 ryan first big opportunity in this 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.559
 party and the former losada anderlechtois 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.570
 is close to the 0.1 I think that 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.090
 it's castillo that will try unless 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.820
 be it vazquez or even boeck 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.280
 no it's castillo and it goes well his 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.300
 share very very well even 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.160
 ella rae is important the part of lenski 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.090
 not easy to pick one for the porter 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.890
 kings fernando with a lot of calm 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.840
 manages to give boeck and boeck 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.040
 why not try the law if it does not 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.460
 makes beautiful 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.710
 the lawrence of boeck and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.770
 the judgment of Berezovsky was not bad 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.659
 nor is it a huge opportunity to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.610
 goal for the bruges club where he saw 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.070
 within 20 meters of the cage of 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.110
 berezovski who will hit that that's the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.259
 question there are several players who 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.030
 are candidates anyway is what we 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.700
 play now with the queues 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.210
 yes community lets you jump from 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.200
 refaelov he dropped the ball into the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.130
 small beautiful Berezovski digor net 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.450
 the coupon of refaelov the big one 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.640
 class it must be said 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.100
 1 0 for the club brugge forty and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.799
 a minute in this part thomas 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.630
 sucker the boulevard in front of him then he 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.980
 take advantage of it because what makes him 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.430
 the balloon manners 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.430
 to art is perennial to skiing every 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.020
 liberals are in the balloon rectangle 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.670
 goes up very high it's only map and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.340
 the only ones saved themselves mam the line 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.720
 would that rote have no barrios 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.240
 who has miraculous miracle superb 1-2 stop 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.740
 berezovski a first time a 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.380
 second time it was so far 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:24.330
 to be obvious and yet he's well 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.950
 interposed the keeper lierrois losada the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.540
 sanaa in the package there still a lot 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.010
 of world and the recovery that misses 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.250
 phases stopped to read that with the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.160
 Sabbath is that between that no but 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.260
 what a surprising trajectory 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.770
 oh the fault the fault from behind of 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.350
 beijing 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.800
 it's not very clever him who has so much 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.430
 yellow card experience and that's his 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.590
 second 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.430
