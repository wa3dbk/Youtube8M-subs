00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.020
 good girls let's start this 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.730
 makeup with this lung you can 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.529
 do your delineation with what you like 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.110
 I have this eyeliner that is good 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.360
 finite and I like to do this 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.880
 good eyeliner there is delineated is going to 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.870
 being young is not going to be anything dramatic 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.240
 or anything we are going to do a small line 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.090
 little girl nothing else as far as I want 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.990
 achieve my eyeliner then we're going to 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.210
 mark from the middle of our eyelid 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.390
 of this line in the line of 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.600
 tabs half out and that 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.470
 we are going to join it with the other 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.090
 line but only to the tip 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.090
 more or less until he 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.030
 that the line more or less has to 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.150
 stay a little bit like that straight 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.280
 something like that there we do the finite thing that 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.390
 we can because I will not touch anything 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.460
 what is the tear 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.460
 and good then we are going to fill 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.010
 good as we are in our other 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.010
 we do the same procedure 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.810
 it is not so difficult this make me 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.259
 like to use it like that without false eyelashes 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.299
 so you can highlight the outline 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.479
 then with a black pencil we are going to put 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.579
 up here even if it's a little bit 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.289
 that our gaze knows it to me 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.040
 tristan less of the event a little bit 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.860
 the eyes and good look better too 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.080
 that only as far as you've put the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.260
 eyeliner then let's tilt the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.740
 eyelashes I'm not a fan of teaching the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.390
 I really do not do eyelashes because 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.960
 I do not really know why I have too 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.300
 a curling iron is good because actually 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.490
 I also like to pray on the part of 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.740
 because I have very little good then 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.500
 let's make a small line 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.030
 little girl as you can see only 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.990
 so that our eye becomes a little more 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.640
 feline and good let's put mask myself 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.340
 good even though they put more rather more 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.500
 I can not see my face in the eyelashes 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.500
 but well let's equal to paint them 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.500
 and good girls, that's how this is 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.060
 easy makeup for diary 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.680
 I hope you liked it , see you 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.239
 until the next author take care 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.239
 We'll see each other until next time 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.420
 ah
