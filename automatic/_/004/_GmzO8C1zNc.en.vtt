00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello my name is denis and today 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.160
 I want to bring to your attention a review 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.370
 headphone 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:19.350
 new headphones from xiaomi headphones 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.980
 which are produced and positioned 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.949
 as an inexpensive replacement or 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:32.149
 inexpensive analogue of famous headphones 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:37.170
 selmy piston here is such a box 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.850
 the packaging here was already weaker say 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.559
 so if they released the caps with 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.739
 plastic gift box 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.260
 here is the most ordinary package 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:50.820
 made of gray cardboard in 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.760
 Xiaomi's classic style on the back 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.550
 parts we see the characteristics of the headphones 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.570
 they are no different from the legendary 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.570
 headphone pesto 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:14.189
 inside are the headphones themselves 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:19.110
 Here is such a package here we are 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:24.740
 find a set of gum here them 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:30.380
 It turns out 4 little things big and big 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.380
 headphones themselves 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:40.810
 here are the headphones 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:48.130
 Aluminum material is exactly the same 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:51.570
 caps here over bumps remove this here 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.570
 but what kind of caps but material 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:00.640
 headphone wires here unlike 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.160
 kevlar there is no one at the caps here he 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.709
 cheap silicone material i.e. 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.290
 headphones are made of silicone 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:17.650
 the connector here is standard 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:22.660
 the most common non-gold headphones 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:26.470
 have white color and here they are 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.600
 split in and let's say for someone 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:35.650
 it's a flaw for me it is perfect 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 no problem sides have that left what 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.239
 right and the right earphone wire has 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.870
 same length that's somebody's 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.380
 uncomfortable someone wearing them thrown over 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.160
 one 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.420
 one earphone 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.300
 over the head so that he does not interfere in front 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.950
 someone uses like this for which 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.740
 It's the other way around in such research 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.830
 which one length one earphone is longer 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.860
 the other is not comfortable well, not these very 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.250
 comfortable one nuance 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:11.440
 both of us headphones not indicated where what 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.350
 which left which right is it done on 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:20.050
 controls here they are made 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:24.710
 made of plastic here means play and 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:29.330
 rewind up and down play button 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:32.540
 also for lifting the tube and here we are 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.040
 see guell which means that this 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.090
 earpiece he 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:44.360
 left atom where there is no control to us 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:48.410
 background right here such here tell headphones 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:54.400
 they sound just like theirs 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:58.010
 elder brother here and this is not 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.400
 no wonder since these headphones 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.890
 differ from caps only material 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.340
 from which the wire of the headphones is made 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.910
 Well, the governing body and the connector connector 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.020
 here, too, plastic controls 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:17.750
 plastic and they are a little different shape 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:23.530
 all here are the differences very new 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:26.180
 good price a little lower 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:32.690
 therefore, headphones can be freely 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.210
 buy and use here such 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.890
 headphones 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.890
 Thank you for your attention and see you soon
