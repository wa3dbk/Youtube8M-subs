little bit here and there and you know
the<00:03:08.550> one<00:03:08.730> thing<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:08.940> he<00:03:09.180> kind<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.450> just<00:03:09.660> told

the one thing that he kind of just told

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.080 
the one thing that he kind of just told
me<00:03:10.020> was<00:03:10.260> we<00:03:10.740> have<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> lot<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.100> work<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.490> do<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.910> I

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
me was we have a lot of work to do and I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.390 
me was we have a lot of work to do and I
think<00:03:12.150> that's<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.800> hundred<00:03:13.800> percent<00:03:14.220> accurate

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
think that's a hundred percent accurate

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.050 
think that's a hundred percent accurate
and<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.940> think<00:03:15.920> as<00:03:16.920> long<00:03:16.950> as<00:03:17.250> we<00:03:17.370> come<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:17.790> with

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
and I think as long as we come in with

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.699 
and I think as long as we come in with
that<00:03:18.120> mindset<00:03:18.270> of<00:03:18.810> really<00:03:19.170> having<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.500> work

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
that mindset of really having to work

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.740 
that mindset of really having to work
and<00:03:20.040> an<00:03:20.250> understanding<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.239> have<00:03:21.720> to

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
and an understanding that we have to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.810 
and an understanding that we have to
earn<00:03:21.930> everything<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.620> think<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:23.250> think<00:03:23.610> we'll<00:03:23.730> be

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
earn everything I think I think we'll be

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.180 
earn everything I think I think we'll be
okay<00:03:24.060> when<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:24.720> about<00:03:24.920> players<00:03:25.920> who

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
okay when you think about players who

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.380 
okay when you think about players who
have<00:03:26.310> they<00:03:26.430> made<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.940> most<00:03:27.150> with<00:03:27.360> what

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
have they made the most with what
