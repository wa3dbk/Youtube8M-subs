00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.590 

there's<00:03:18.790> two<00:03:19.030> ways<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.240> do<00:03:19.600> this<00:03:21.330> I'm<00:03:22.330> going<00:03:22.480> to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
there's two ways to do this I'm going to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.080 
there's two ways to do this I'm going to
separate<00:03:23.230> these<00:03:24.070> two<00:03:24.130> down<00:03:24.700> here<00:03:24.940> you're

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
separate these two down here you're

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.010 
separate these two down here you're
going<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.240> come<00:03:25.450> from<00:03:25.570> here<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:28.450> bottom<00:03:28.810> half

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
going to come from here the bottom half

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.020 
going to come from here the bottom half
of<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:33.040> then<00:03:33.250> you're<00:03:33.490> going<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.670> separate

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
of it and then you're going to separate

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.309 
of it and then you're going to separate
that<00:03:34.090> into<00:03:34.810> two

if you feel like you need more than that

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:56.770 
if you feel like you need more than that
it<00:03:43.870> can<00:03:44.140> take<00:03:44.319> more

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.699

this right here can be into just a
regular<00:04:04.069> bun<00:04:05.200> if<00:04:06.200> you<00:04:06.319> just<00:04:06.530> wrap<00:04:06.740> it<00:04:06.770> around

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890

your hair around it that would work too

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.009 
your hair around it that would work too
and<00:04:43.229> that'd<00:04:43.559> be<00:04:43.709> really<00:04:43.860> pretty<00:04:44.129> so<00:04:44.779> so<00:04:45.779> don't
