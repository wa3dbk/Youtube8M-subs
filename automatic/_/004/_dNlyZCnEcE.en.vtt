00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.280
 good people here I bring you a new 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.470
 gameplay is about a game of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 demolition on the map of sights you already know 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.180
 this new map that has come out in the tlc 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.070
 of revolution and that the more I play it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.590
 I like the one I like the most 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.509
 It is very funny especially in this mode 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.820
 of game that you are going to see demolition is 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.380
 One pass when you have a good team 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.660
 and coordinates you is perfectly and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.369
 I was playing here in this game 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.680
 counselor and with congratulations with raúl with 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.200
 toret and with asensio fence and you will see how 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.520
 we make a piece of game because 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 we know each one what we have to 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.750
 do we distribute ourselves very well in the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.360
 map and we get cornered enemies 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.340
 in his responso point of reappearance that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.290
 on this map is very well concentrated and 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.090
 it is very easy to predict 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.980
 especially if you do not invade the responsibility 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.750
 Put on your boots, you will see how the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.570
 beginning of the game is frantic 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.400
 killed a lot and the truth is that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.680
 It costs a lot if you take a submachine gun here 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.049
 and the enemies appear very close to you 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.060
 very close in this respawn and and it's going 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.430
 moving from one place to another is not 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.680
 difficult to make a good game 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.990
 I was looking mainly not the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.570
 nuclear but the chain of casualties for that 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.050
 you will see that I am going with two submachine guns 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.159
 and the p of w the excess means is a 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.990
 class that I have created to try 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.910
 get the chain of casualties I believe in 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.170
 the mode of the game mode that I can 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 get is the whole lower house is more 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.950
 easy is I think it's in this in 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.910
 demolition because the rejón is fixed and if 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.440
 you're lucky and they start dating 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.210
 enemies to sack 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.759
 maybe it 's a good run in a chain 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.840
 to kill and the sand is the only one 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.270
 I need to get the teacher 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.770
 murderer you already know and for nothing was 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.690
 looking for a nuclear this class that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.890
 I have no scavenger is the bitch 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.119
 scavenger is practically 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.710
 essential to get a 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.630
 nuclear to not run out of ammunition 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.789
 have to spend a lot of bullets when 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.860
 he has to kill 30 enemies from os 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.080
 I guarantee it and you will see a moment of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.060
 the game where I almost almost do it 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.979
 because I ran out of ammunition and it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.479
 forget steal a weapon but good is 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.220
 great to carry both their rifles 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.630
 especially from the beginning to the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.490
 that I tell you to get the chain of casualties 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.710
 because my intention was to survive a lot 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.470
 time simply reappear fast in 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.820
 the rest and take advantage of that mass departure 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.130
 which is money sometimes the enemies that 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.260
 they go out in 45 at once to chain the 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.650
 low chains like the low harrow 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.810
 sorry and as you can see I'm going with the pw a 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.230
 very good streak 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.390
 until the part the cis keeper and 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.890
 getting pm getting kissed from 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.780
 the enemies are reappearing in 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.489
 the face you are already seeing is that it is 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.930
 complicated seems easy when you are 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.270
 watching here the gameplay of saying fuck 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.099
 is that you have us cornered like that 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.590
 anyone and it's not easy, you see how 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.300
 they reappear practically in the nose 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.370
 you have to coordinate very well there is no need 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.019
 enter the rest of the enemies in the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.269
 reappearance to Gijón here right where 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.860
 they are in the sand because if they do not appear 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.630
 in the houses and that you have to have it very 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.370
 controlled I already know that the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.799
 temptation many times when you see the ub 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.000
 sad is going for them to get close to them 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.530
 because they are seeing them in the minimum 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.330
 country is even a very very temptation 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.280
 big but sometimes you have to think about the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.569
 team in which if you get in you are going to 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.160
 appear on my back since I can 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.750
 catch some fellow you how is 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.220
 It has happened to me several times that some 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.470
 my partner gets in and life where I 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.670
 reappear is that it does not give you time to 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.590
 react as I'm looking at the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.840
 minimap comes a time when I eat 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.790
 we throw so much, go up, do not look at the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.280
 screen and you simply look at the minimap 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.440
 and sometimes you get distracted and you have to 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.599
 They spoil the streaks by yourself but it's like that 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.580
 this is how a moment arrives that you do not know 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.680
 play without the ub sad in the air stress 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.000
 by the way especially when you take out 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.800
 so many in a game when there's no 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.200
 clouds in the air you feel that you do not know 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.810
 where to throw and you get a lot 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.910
 funk here as you see I have a 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.310
 pretty bad streak that 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.990
 you see shooting without bullets and the enemies already 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.180
 they have fled from the game what usually 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.160
 happen in demolition yes that is very 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.510
 controlled the remains but the point 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.000
 negative is that enemies can 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.120
 get to feel claustrophobic if 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.310
 they bring a plan that they come out and they die 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.240
 they come out and die they can not be reborn well not 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.250
 advance 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.590
 then the temptation to pull cable 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.360
 of them I understand and above all 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.180
 Notice that we are not taking out very 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.070
 neither likes nor high vt ol if you take off 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.350
 those gusts I guarantee you that they are going 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.570
 long before these guys and it was also a 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.709
 double command endured for that reason if you do not 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.630
 they had gone before so they 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.920
 I recommend if you are looking for a nuclear 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.530
 in this game mode that you put the 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.080
 low wow response wow 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.210
 hyper combined as you want me here 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.220
 wore the first response wow 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.890
 because as I do not wear I do not have a ghost 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.620
 just in case they pulled out a bird that did not 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.880
 they fucked the streak but good 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.130
 you can combine as you wish here already 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.690
 You see I've run out of ammunition in the 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.240
 that I practically had to kill 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.880
 only one and then a sniper 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.470
 one of that ere is that it's the weapon that was going 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.110
 the enemies in carrying them 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.640
 bad luck because he was at risk 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.190
 that I appeared in how you have 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.080
 seen before very very closely and I do not know 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.790
 clicks did not dominate the quick and I 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.020
 would have killed almost sure if they reach me 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.419
 to appear right now here in the house 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.910
 they kill me almost certainly was acojona dt 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.970
 because I had very little left for 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.200
 nuclear and already at this time when 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.210
 you are close to nuclear that you do not 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.100
 you want to play for a low you do not 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.780
 you risk if you're already playing very, very 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.010
 cautious very carefully about everything 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.470
 having whatever is in the air 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.600
 you have to play with a lot of coconut not go to 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.340
 what crazy for the enemies here I find 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.770
 on the floor we soak it appears 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.620
 the virgin and I find a remington I say 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.600
 Fuck of bassoon and niki painted 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.880
 pearls came to me here I hope he 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.200
 answer change because it does not suit that 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.030
 you move a lot I would answer them because 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.650
 I already told you that it may reappear 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.030
 to fences it finishes places activity that 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.250
 appears to me through the window of the type by 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.870
 there is less markit and mockery raining ton ya 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.920
 it does not give me a game but there are five 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.720
 seconds 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.880
 the game I prefer to stay here 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.560
 waiting for it to end at the beginning of 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.480
 the next round will try to make the 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.350
 low that I have left for the nuclear look 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.270
 the marking 29 0 a real match 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.800
 how are you seeing the enemies too 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.720
 they are taking a good one because 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.980
 they hold everything to the side the whole game 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.810
 like some champions less badly that 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.310
 they were left if the 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.710
 departure is the nuclear improve this what 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.120
 difficult this has been the rest 1 when 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.040
 you have to place the bomb 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.680
 this one that is going to come now is the 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.180
 bus is much more complicated than 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.250
 control and you will see it because the 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.190
 enemies appear by sites that neither 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.930
 what are you waiting for, you see, we were lucky that 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.640
 that people who entered more entered 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.170
 players to the game and this is what 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.030
 good that is that they go entering because 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.530
 if the nuclear moment does not end 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:28.350
 has the c4 ayar bulto and nuclear bomb 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.240
 got and attention to the festival of 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.770
 unstoppable that I get now now once 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.900
 that gets the nuclear passes as with 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.850
 the apps that you feel are released says 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.790
 Well, the work is done, let's go 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.470
 enjoy try my main goal 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.150
 that was the chain of casualties tried to get 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.129
 more respond by fucking my classmates 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.949
 I admit it I'm sorry guys 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:48.360
 you have to do this for the chain of 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:49.649
 low because if it is not almost impossible if 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.599
 you stay behind you have to go to sack 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:54.239
 get into the respawn and look like 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.649
 reappearance like beasts everywhere 

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:58.679
 of the bus with the back by 

00:06:55.649 --> 00:07:00.089
 in front is very difficult guys when you go 

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:02.039
 killed a couple of times the same player 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:04.559
 he pretty much knows where you're 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.269
 you have to move a lot a lot 

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:08.069
 easy the three that look like actions of 

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:09.929
 gameplay but it's not easy to do 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:11.459
 this streak so long in demolition 

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:14.249
 if you do not know how to move if you are not moving 

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:15.929
 constantly and attention to the down that 

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:17.789
 cut me is that it's outrageous as 

00:07:15.929 --> 00:07:19.259
 I'm behind the bus and mom witness 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:21.029
 in the sniper if you get to see the camera 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:23.219
 of death you stay with your mouth open 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:26.969
 how I stayed but good is not 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:30.899
 bad a good streak 37 1 and as already 

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:32.369
 I hope it will guide you so that 

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:34.649
 see how this map of 

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:36.329
 demolition that if you go a good team os 

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:38.129
 I guarantee that you have to be 5 or 6 to 

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:39.779
 do this kind of games if it's not 

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:41.639
 very complicated one alone is 

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:43.439
 complicated because you have to warn 

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.119
 the comrades who do not plant bombs and 

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:47.219
 let them out etcetera etcetera the 

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:48.509
 coordination is very important and nothing 

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:50.160
 I hope you liked this nuclear 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:54.290
 the one that commented 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.290
 greetings goodbye a cumin
