00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.160 
guidance when I'm writing it onto the
canvas<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> before<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.450> start<00:00:45.510> might<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
canvas so before you start might be a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.020 
canvas so before you start might be a
good<00:00:46.410> idea<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.950> actually<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.399> some<00:00:47.640> practice

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030

good idea to actually do some practice
designs<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> piece<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.110> paper<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:50.280> way

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
designs on a piece of paper that way

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.279 
designs on a piece of paper that way
before<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> canvas<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.140> have

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
before you do it on the canvas you have

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.569 
before you do it on the canvas you have
some<00:00:52.500> idea<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.489> look

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
some idea of what it's going to look

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.900 
some idea of what it's going to look
like<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> here<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.280> see<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.610> some<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
like so here as you can see are some of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
like so here as you can see are some of
the<00:00:57.000> designs<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.510> came<00:00:57.840> up<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.260> dyed<00:00:58.440> rien

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the designs that came up with dyed rien

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.439 
the designs that came up with dyed rien
to<00:00:59.010> my<00:00:59.129> sketchbook<00:00:59.609> before<00:00:59.640> actually<00:01:00.239> drawing

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
to my sketchbook before actually drawing

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.709 
to my sketchbook before actually drawing
it<00:01:00.660> onto<00:01:00.989> my<00:01:01.109> canvas<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.210> method<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it onto my canvas so the method that I

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.600 
it onto my canvas so the method that I
use<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.260> writing<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.650> Arabic<00:01:05.040> was<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.430> use

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
use for writing in Arabic was to use

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.850 
use for writing in Arabic was to use
Skype<00:01:05.939> lines<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.420> used<00:01:06.659> four<00:01:06.930> equally<00:01:07.320> separate

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
Skype lines I used four equally separate

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
Skype lines I used four equally separate
guide<00:01:08.100> lines<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> top<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.390> at

the bottom and two in the middle this

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
the bottom and two in the middle this
makes<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.299> much<00:01:12.510> easier<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:13.110> writing<00:01:13.320> an

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
makes it so much easier when writing an

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
practice it makes it really really easy

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.249 
practice it makes it really really easy
to<00:01:19.259> start<00:01:19.560> practicing<00:01:20.689> also<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> guidelines

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
help when trying to position the writing

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
help when trying to position the writing
on<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> canvas<00:01:26.869> here<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.350> see

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
on to the canvas here as you can see

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.140 
on to the canvas here as you can see
other<00:01:28.740> four<00:01:29.070> guidelines<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.820> they're<00:01:29.970> pretty

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
other four guidelines and they're pretty

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
other four guidelines and they're pretty
much<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> same<00:01:30.810> distance<00:01:31.229> apart

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.570 

now<00:01:38.170> we<00:01:38.229> can<00:01:38.500> start<00:01:38.740> drawing<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.189> guidelines

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
now we can start drawing the guidelines

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.249 
now we can start drawing the guidelines
onto<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.030> canvas<00:01:40.270> using<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:41.020> same

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
onto the canvas using the same

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.899 
onto the canvas using the same
measurements<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.979> now<00:01:45.340> here's<00:01:45.580> for<00:01:45.790> the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
measurements so now here's for the

was<00:03:45.579> going<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.849> do<00:03:46.030> this<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.389> just<00:03:46.419> kind<00:03:46.840> of

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
was going to do this I just kind of

restyled<00:03:47.859> it<00:03:47.979> but<00:03:48.849> I<00:03:48.879> guess<00:03:49.449> if<00:03:49.659> you<00:03:49.780> just<00:03:49.930> use

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
restyled it but I guess if you just use

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.809 
restyled it but I guess if you just use
similar<00:03:50.530> colors<00:03:50.949> it<00:03:51.250> will<00:03:51.370> end<00:03:51.549> up<00:03:51.669> looking

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
similar colors it will end up looking

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.199 
similar colors it will end up looking
nice<00:03:52.150> anyways<00:03:53.220> use<00:03:54.220> your<00:03:54.459> fingers<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.819> smudge

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.900 

after<00:04:49.380> that<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.710> design<00:04:50.040> is<00:04:50.070> likely<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.730> be<00:04:50.880> a

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
after that the design is likely to be a

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.670 
after that the design is likely to be a
little<00:04:51.120> bit<00:04:51.330> smudged<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:51.930> hard<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.290> see<00:04:52.320> so

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
little bit smudged and hard to see so

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:02.920 
little bit smudged and hard to see so
just<00:04:52.710> go<00:04:53.040> for<00:04:53.100> in<00:04:53.370> pencil<00:04:53.760> one<00:04:53.850> more<00:04:54.030> time

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.570 

so<00:05:03.930> once<00:05:04.320> you've<00:05:04.500> done<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:04.710> just<00:05:05.160> use<00:05:05.340> spray

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
so once you've done that just use spray

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.310 
so once you've done that just use spray
paint<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:06.030> spray<00:05:06.090> over<00:05:06.390> your<00:05:06.660> whole<00:05:06.930> design

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
paint and spray over your whole design

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.200 
paint and spray over your whole design
this<00:05:07.590> will<00:05:07.740> stop<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.100> pastels<00:05:08.520> from<00:05:08.730> smudging

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
this will stop the pastels from smudging

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:19.880 
this will stop the pastels from smudging
any<00:05:09.360> further<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:18.750> after<00:05:19.230> that<00:05:19.380> just<00:05:19.620> use<00:05:19.860> a

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
any further so after that just use a

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.890 
any further so after that just use a
black<00:05:20.250> marker<00:05:20.730> to<00:05:20.790> fill<00:05:21.180> in<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.480> writing<00:05:21.780> and

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
black marker to fill in the writing and

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.650 
black marker to fill in the writing and
the<00:05:22.350> Moss<00:05:22.800> design<00:05:23.220> this<00:05:23.700> is<00:05:23.910> so<00:05:24.210> much<00:05:24.420> easier

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
the Moss design this is so much easier

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.280 
the Moss design this is so much easier
than<00:05:24.960> actually<00:05:25.110> using<00:05:25.650> paint<00:05:26.870> but<00:05:27.870> you<00:05:27.900> may

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
than actually using paint but you may

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.900 
than actually using paint but you may
need<00:05:28.500> at<00:05:28.710> least<00:05:28.740> two<00:05:29.130> or<00:05:29.250> three<00:05:29.310> markers

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
need at least two or three markers

00:05:29.910 --> 00:06:05.010 
need at least two or three markers
because<00:05:30.150> there's<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:30.960> lot<00:05:31.200> to<00:05:31.350> fill

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.689 

so<00:06:06.020> once<00:06:06.380> you<00:06:06.500> finish<00:06:06.830> with<00:06:06.860> all<00:06:07.160> that<00:06:07.400> just

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
so once you finish with all that just

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.550 
so once you finish with all that just
use<00:06:07.910> the<00:06:08.090> pastels<00:06:08.540> to<00:06:08.660> clean<00:06:08.900> up<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.139> sides<00:06:09.350> a

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
use the pastels to clean up the sides a

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.290 
use the pastels to clean up the sides a
bit<00:06:09.710> and<00:06:09.919> then<00:06:10.070> use<00:06:10.250> black<00:06:10.490> acrylic<00:06:10.760> paint<00:06:11.000> and

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
bit and then use black acrylic paint and

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.330 
bit and then use black acrylic paint and
a<00:06:11.419> paintbrush<00:06:11.720> to<00:06:11.900> paint<00:06:12.380> the<00:06:12.680> edges<00:06:12.979> of<00:06:13.160> the

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
a paintbrush to paint the edges of the

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.219 
a paintbrush to paint the edges of the
canvas<00:06:13.639> this<00:06:14.389> will<00:06:14.570> make<00:06:14.690> it<00:06:14.840> a<00:06:14.900> lot<00:06:15.050> more

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
canvas this will make it a lot more

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:26.280 
canvas this will make it a lot more
neater

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.900 

so<00:06:27.290> after<00:06:27.770> that<00:06:27.890> just<00:06:28.160> let<00:06:28.340> it<00:06:28.460> dry<00:06:28.640> and<00:06:28.700> you

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
so after that just let it dry and you

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.180 
so after that just let it dry and you
finished<00:06:29.300> I'm<00:06:30.200> actually<00:06:30.410> really<00:06:30.830> proud<00:06:31.070> of

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190

finished I'm actually really proud of
