00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.050 

now<00:00:00.979> I'm<00:00:01.100> going<00:00:01.220> to<00:00:01.250> do<00:00:01.400> some<00:00:01.550> shadow<00:00:01.760> color

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:02.060 
now I'm going to do some shadow color

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.570 
now I'm going to do some shadow color
and<00:00:02.330> guess<00:00:03.290> what<00:00:03.500> I<00:00:03.649> mixed<00:00:03.950> it<00:00:04.040> with<00:00:04.129> the<00:00:04.220> exact

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
and guess what I mixed it with the exact

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.860 
and guess what I mixed it with the exact
same<00:00:04.789> colors<00:00:05.120> that<00:00:05.149> I<00:00:05.269> mixed<00:00:05.509> the<00:00:05.600> clouds

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
same colors that I mixed the clouds

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.569 
same colors that I mixed the clouds
shadow<00:00:06.259> with<00:00:06.499> just<00:00:06.799> a<00:00:06.919> little<00:00:07.189> bit<00:00:07.309> different

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:07.579 
shadow with just a little bit different

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:10.419 
shadow with just a little bit different
proportions<00:00:08.120> this<00:00:09.019> is<00:00:09.259> red<00:00:09.559> blue<00:00:10.099> and<00:00:10.339> white

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
proportions this is red blue and white

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.409 
proportions this is red blue and white
and<00:00:11.269> I<00:00:11.839> mixed<00:00:12.200> it<00:00:12.320> so<00:00:12.530> I<00:00:12.830> want<00:00:13.459> it<00:00:13.580> to<00:00:13.730> be<00:00:13.910> just

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:14.419 
and I mixed it so I want it to be just

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.150 
and I mixed it so I want it to be just
barely<00:00:14.690> darker<00:00:15.259> than<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:15.469> sky<00:00:15.709> so<00:00:15.950> you<00:00:15.980> can

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
barely darker than the sky so you can

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.680 
barely darker than the sky so you can
still<00:00:16.340> see<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.610> edge<00:00:16.730> of<00:00:16.880> this<00:00:17.030> mountain<00:00:17.420> but

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
still see the edge of this mountain but

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.260 
still see the edge of this mountain but
I<00:00:17.750> need<00:00:17.930> it<00:00:18.020> to<00:00:18.110> be<00:00:18.200> lighter<00:00:18.500> than<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:18.890> rocks

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
I need it to be lighter than the rocks

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.220 
I need it to be lighter than the rocks
so<00:00:20.270> you're<00:00:20.390> going<00:00:20.510> to<00:00:20.540> see<00:00:20.780> this<00:00:20.960> when<00:00:21.140> it

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
so you're going to see this when it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.500 
so you're going to see this when it
dries<00:00:21.470> as<00:00:21.740> a<00:00:21.770> darker<00:00:22.220> shadow<00:00:22.520> against<00:00:23.030> the<00:00:23.180> sky

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
dries as a darker shadow against the sky

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.480 
dries as a darker shadow against the sky
color<00:00:23.840> because<00:00:24.080> it<00:00:24.230> dries<00:00:24.440> darker<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.160> I'll

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
color because it dries darker and I'll

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.550 
color because it dries darker and I'll
do<00:00:25.610> the<00:00:25.730> same<00:00:25.910> kind<00:00:26.180> of<00:00:26.270> shapes<00:00:26.540> just<00:00:27.290> kind<00:00:27.500> of

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
do the same kind of shapes just kind of

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.070 
do the same kind of shapes just kind of
swooping<00:00:28.090> smile<00:00:29.090> shapes<00:00:29.360> I'll<00:00:29.540> do<00:00:29.660> more<00:00:29.870> on

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
swooping smile shapes I'll do more on

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.720 
swooping smile shapes I'll do more on
this<00:00:30.530> side<00:00:30.800> of<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.010> mountain<00:00:31.310> than<00:00:31.430> I<00:00:31.490> did<00:00:31.700> on

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
this side of the mountain than I did on

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:47.300 
this side of the mountain than I did on
the<00:00:31.910> other<00:00:31.940> side

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.460 

this<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> cool<00:00:48.450> side<00:00:48.810> of<00:00:48.840> mountain<00:00:49.260> see

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
this is the cool side of mountain see

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.800 
this is the cool side of mountain see
because<00:00:50.600> Sun<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.720> not<00:00:51.870> shining<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.810> we're

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
because Sun is not shining on so we're

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.290 
because Sun is not shining on so we're
going<00:00:54.900> to<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.050> more<00:00:55.320> snow<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:59.090> maybe<00:01:00.090> in

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
going to have more snow there maybe in

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.380 
going to have more snow there maybe in
little<00:01:00.570> areas<00:01:01.430> maybe<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.580> little<00:01:02.850> areas<00:01:02.970> I'll

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
little areas maybe in little areas I'll

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.480 
little areas maybe in little areas I'll
just<00:01:03.570> put<00:01:03.810> tiny<00:01:04.320> bits<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.710> light<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.490 
just put tiny bits of light like a

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.890 
just put tiny bits of light like a
little<00:01:05.850> rock<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.240> something<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.660> sticking

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
little rock or something that's sticking

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600 
little rock or something that's sticking
up<00:01:07.080> catching<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.410> light<00:01:07.590> where<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.100> meets<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
up catching the light where it meets the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.570 
up catching the light where it meets the
white<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.240> I'll<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> soft<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.260> soft<00:01:10.920> blend

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
white here I'll do a soft a soft blend

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.180 
white here I'll do a soft a soft blend
in<00:01:11.760> some<00:01:11.940> areas<00:01:12.300> so<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> looks<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
in some areas so it looks like a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.150 
in some areas so it looks like a
smoother<00:01:14.190> transition<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:18.800> now<00:01:19.800> watch<00:01:20.010> I'll

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
smoother transition of it now watch I'll

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.040 
smoother transition of it now watch I'll
take<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> shadow<00:01:20.760> color<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:21.690> edge

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
take the shadow color on the right edge

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.770 
take the shadow color on the right edge
of<00:01:22.440> this<00:01:22.800> valley<00:01:23.100> I'll<00:01:23.790> put<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.210> blue<00:01:24.479> shadow

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
of this valley I'll put that blue shadow

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.710 
of this valley I'll put that blue shadow
color<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.070> gives<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.430> dimension<00:01:26.720> like

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
color so that it gives it dimension like

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.340 
color so that it gives it dimension like
I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.290> got<00:01:28.440> too<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.930> it'll<00:01:31.080> give<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
I think I got too much so it'll give it

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.040 
I think I got too much so it'll give it
to<00:01:31.470> mention<00:01:32.150> but<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.540> careful<00:01:33.720> that

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
to mention but I have to be careful that

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.390 
to mention but I have to be careful that
I<00:01:34.080> don't<00:01:34.380> make<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.740> darker<00:01:35.130> than<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
I don't make it darker than the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
I don't make it darker than the
surrounding<00:01:35.880> rocks<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:36.990> right

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
surrounding rocks like that right

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.740 
surrounding rocks like that right
there's<00:01:37.470> probably<00:01:37.890> too<00:01:38.130> dark<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.570> I'll<00:01:39.570> bring

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
there's probably too dark so I'll bring

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.450 
there's probably too dark so I'll bring
in<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:39.960> light<00:01:40.320> color<00:01:40.619> again<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.070> lighten<00:01:41.400> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
in my light color again and lighten it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.700 
in my light color again and lighten it
up<00:01:41.580> I<00:01:41.880> always<00:01:42.660> have<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.050> conscious<00:01:43.380> about

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
up I always have to be conscious about

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.249 
up I always have to be conscious about
what<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.100> need<00:01:44.400> my<00:01:44.600> colors<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.660> be<00:01:45.780> lighter<00:01:46.020> than

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
what I need my colors to be lighter than

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.780 
what I need my colors to be lighter than
what<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.590> needed<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.070> darker<00:01:47.430> than<00:01:47.580> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
what I needed to be darker than and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.780 
what I needed to be darker than and
white<00:01:48.030> snow<00:01:48.650> is<00:01:49.650> not<00:01:50.009> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.400> darker

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
white snow is not going to be darker

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.540 
white snow is not going to be darker
than<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.270> rocks<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:51.869> laying<00:01:52.080> on<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.490> I

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
than the rocks that it's laying on so I

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.070 
than the rocks that it's laying on so I
have<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.850> careful<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> shadow<00:01:54.720> color

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
have to be careful that the shadow color

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.590 
have to be careful that the shadow color
is<00:01:55.289> never<00:01:55.530> darker<00:01:57.110> than<00:01:59.060> the<00:02:00.060> rocks<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.479> this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
is never darker than the rocks of this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.460 
is never darker than the rocks of this
mountain

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.530
