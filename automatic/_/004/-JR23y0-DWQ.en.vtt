00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.960
 good I am paula to clothe you with 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.500
 our hands and I'm going to present you the 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.500
 draft 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.450
 I will not be virtual so that 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.570
 the camera because I will not be able to be 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.860
 these days with photos but if I 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.850
 I really wanted to participate and tell you 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:37.770
 we carry forward that it is a project that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.810
 we are passionate we like it a lot 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.320
 gives us many joys that also 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.470
 Many 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.079
 good apart with our hands is a 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.130
 project that relies on reuse 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.180
 clothes that people no longer use 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.180
 moisturizes less 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.570
 this pizzeria which is a town 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.200
 furniture factories and many are served 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.200
 times 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.220
 we make shirts 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.280
 hand painted and patched too 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.070
 are the real good clothes handbags 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.830
 everything we can create 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.860
 and do with our hands from 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.720
 materials that have fallen 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.410
 in Jesus 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.160
 the project that about the year 2011 of 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.040
 firmer way with creating a page 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.920
 web and going out markets but hey 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.840
 prior to those two years before it was 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.200
 when we were left without 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.079
 no work for hire 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.509
 it says and we start thinking that 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.229
 we wanted to do something different I had 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.229
 want of it 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.550
 for others and I started thinking that was what 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.310
 I was what I liked to do and 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.380
 well I discovered that sewing was something 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.050
 that motivated me for many years 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.740
 because I had seen my grandmother I saw my 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.740
 aunt sew 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.060
 for me one thing that was in the 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.130
 I remember and nothing because I pointed to a course 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.120
 cutting and sewing for two years 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.800
 I made a cut and 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.680
 and from there it was like a hitch 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.990
 I could not stop sewing and creating and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.720
 do things and it 's one thing that I 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.820
 passionately very much 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.040
 Then everything started there with those 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.740
 with those courses and then we started 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.790
 design it with my partner there that 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.790
 It was what we wanted to do 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.560
 when we really put him 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.480
 firmly to think about how the project is 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.230
 we realize that we do not have money 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.660
 to invest in fabrics 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.050
 well, as our life 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.510
 it's like that then we receive a bag of 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.400
 clothes of people who do not use and good that 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.790
 I knew that we always go 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.500
 collecting clothes for us and there 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.040
 it was when we came up with why not 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.100
 use those clothes that came in good 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.930
 been and that was 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.180
 why not use it again 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.680
 and if we turn on the lamp 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.420
 we said come on let's start 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.989
 do things and that's how it was a bit like 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.909
 little we were creating little things 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.909
 purses at the beginning purses 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.990
 and we started going out to street markets 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.700
 the beginning has been pretty hard because 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.140
 good that everything has to be learned so 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.260
 in the markets of the markets we are 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.230
 learning 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.990
 select those who only carry 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.940
 handicrafts 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:53.120
 and now we are creating 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.070
 a website we have the website what 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.360
 we want marianos in virtual stores 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.360
 to be able to sell online 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.760
 come on we want this project is 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.470
 quite 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.040
 great and that we can be 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.040
 And growing 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.780
 and other things that we also have in 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.239
 view for 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.250
 to be able to realize is that some 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.780
 T-shirts that we buy, of course 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.600
 being reused 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.600
 but we buy them from a company 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.490
 and then there we have a contradiction 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.420
 right now that is that the changes that 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.700
 we buy come from thailand and well no 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.150
 we like we know that there is a hand 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.160
 exploited work and it's one thing that we do not 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.400
 because already staying treated us 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.400
 why 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.009
 so from next year 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:58.180
 in a little kiss we have to start 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:01.229
 to design some project to 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.229
 look for financing 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.290
 to be able to create a 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.220
 a way also that we do 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.220
 those shirts 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.530
 there are enough people who used to work 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.160
 in the part of the furniture in the clothing 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.500
 that has run out of work we know 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.330
 to a girl who is helping us now 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.599
 to sew and 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:30.770
 and good because they do not catch people thinking that 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:32.070
 are now busy and put them at 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.160
 reverse 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.580
 something to them and me so well do this 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.220
 that I like to design and sew and 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.730
 make the project somewhat bigger 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:48.830
 well this I think is the few minutes 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.830
 that we have the basics 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.280
 you have it on the website and leaving 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.810
 pieces of paper in case someone interests more 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.820
 of the project on the website are the 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.400
 products that what we do how what 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.320
 we do a little more detailed completely 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.930
 also in your mail to contact 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.280

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:12.160
 photos so you can see a little more 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:16.170
 that is the part many thanks to all and 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.170
 See you in the next 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.919

 d 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.620
 what if 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.440
 and 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.280
 If the project has a 10 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.280
 growing in him 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.520
 ah 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.479

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.479
 senses 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.980
