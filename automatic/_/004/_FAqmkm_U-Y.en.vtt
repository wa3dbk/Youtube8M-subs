looks<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.789> marbles<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.359> slow<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> start

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350

looks the marbles are slow to start
which<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.850> understandably<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.970> stylistic

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
which is understandably a stylistic

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
choice from the developer but rather

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760 
choice from the developer but rather
annoying<00:01:09.150> at<00:01:09.479> times<00:01:09.510> along<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.530> the
