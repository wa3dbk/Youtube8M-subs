 hello friends today I'll show you the 

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:09.269
 food and balanced diet of 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.030
 aquatic baby turtles and also the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.570
 care and being for your tortuguero 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.570
 fishbowl 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.070
 well let's start with the turtles 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.160
 here as you can see 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.730
 these turtles are told or I tell them 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.279
 or they are called orange ear turtles 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.930
 as you can see there they have like 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.600
 ears are like oranges are aquatic 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.410
 I'm putting it 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.500
 well let's start with the welfare and 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.670
 care and water levels of the sea and the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 aquarium or turtle 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:56.290
 this as they are babies we are going to place them 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:59.290
 two or three fingers of water as you see here 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.620
 look far come up and reaches 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.780
 to the web and I put two fingers because 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.400
 here there are stones then what would be 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:13.280
 three fingers of water understand min 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:18.860
 then to see 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.190
 in another part ready we are there 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.790
 in the part 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.200
 and the aquarium also involves placing 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.200
 the big stones 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.850
 and just like that 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.830
 or yes 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.630
 that reach to excel of three or two 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:49.170
 straight water fingers reach the song 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.899
 to stand out from the water already so that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.479
 can be mounted because they too 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.980
 they breathe oxygen she breathe oxygen 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.920
 in with the head out 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.640
 ready then we already have the cares 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.910
 and well-being or we already said the cares 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.300
 and the welfare of the aquarium ops and 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.450
 tortuguero of these turtles 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.430

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.430

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.420
 It has a little fat 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.850
 no no no no it reads very well for the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.660

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:12.100
 recommended fix against filmax is 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.100
 recommended natural and all 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.769
 the recommended do not buy some kind of 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.920
 cheap food please and we can 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.920
 use 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.640
 and let's also teach them how to 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.680
 arm the torture 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.680
 first it is but at the time 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.430
 let's take a punch bowl like this 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.819
 like the one you see here where I have my two 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.139
 turtles and they are going to place 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.709
 a stone that sticks out of the water in 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.709
 every corner 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.260
 and one in a corner is like that 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.660
 and that 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:06.050
 already as you can see we continue and good 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.300
 has a medium stone the little ones 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.580
 the little ones and a big one with a 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.650
 mountain up here so they can 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.900
 get up and take some sun 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.690
 as you can see when they are small 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.830
 in the shell is fast 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.830
 it's a little soft 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.900
 and they need a lot of sun 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.060
 and that was also note the sun 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.229
 and they have to place is forget like this for 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.180
 that they can sound that because it 's now 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.969
 that are young and are not very tall 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.870
 and also so they can leave 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:45.690
 because as I said but the oxygen 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.790
 also if you want they can decorate the 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.770
 face column listen 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.420
 and this one I like to stick my head in 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.920
 Water 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.260
 also be able to donate 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.090
 with a little turtle also 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.310
 can be mounted 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.580
 we have a little bit of water and so that 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.460
 relax also such then also 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.610
 I understand with these stones to reduce 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.349
 a little water level 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.080
 and so that they also hold under 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.150
 the water and they can stay inside as 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.529
 I said they are small and they do not control everything 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.979
 day 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:22.619
 but the harvest as they already have age as 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.079
 to dive alone but the stones 

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:27.920
 I put them into a computer 

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:31.460
 these stones are not necessary 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.880
 they see that they do not have them they are ornaments for 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.650
 that is good hb this has been the video 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.229
 from today 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.229
