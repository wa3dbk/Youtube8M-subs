00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.970
 bucket full of dirty laundry of a mother 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.270

 We separate by type of clothes 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.440
 bath towels naked this here is a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.970

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.570
 machine this is a clothes that I 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:44.730
 separate and then wash the hand we go 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.090
 separate the light clothing shirts and 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.010
 flame stands on the side of the blessed 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.170
 taking care not to mix one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.480
 little more since this outfit could go 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.910
 along with those of the same type is a 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.739
 shirt but we know it's a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.399
 blame mothers then we let her 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.519
 separated to wash it the hand separates 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.020
 also all underwear briefs 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.450
 these things we do not 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.530
 along with shirts that are 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.720
 sheets are also washed separately 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.270
 we know that this pajama top 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.310
 stain then we can put together 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.760
 also be separate because from the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.340
 The moment you part you know the 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.360
 machine level you'll use it 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.370
 it exists the low the medium and the high by the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.950
 amount of clothes that will or will not 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.420
 a pillowcase goes along with the sheets 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.370
 in the sheets you can 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 note that there is a yellow and a brown 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.580
 never mix the brown yellow ones the clear 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.420
 light and dark together with 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.700
 the dark ones 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.080

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.990
 to wash clothes 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.260
 so to have this amount of 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.630
 light clothes speak that's the minimum part 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:09.030
 the machine from a small volume and now 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.470

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.700
 we put the clothes as 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.700
