00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.370
 rebiun boxing and good today 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.440
 I bring from takara tomy of the 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.750
 alcohol collection and the revolution 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.030
 so it 's granitas that contains all 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.889
 its evolutionary line together with the mere 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.510
 evolution and the mega stone that would come 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.550
 being the great guitarist and well 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.740
 before giving you this review 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.590
 I teach part of the box 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.670
 here we have the four figures in the 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.500
 back we have the four the 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.410
 view of the four figures in all 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.610
 angles the use of the stone friend together 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.570
 with the mega hoop this and so good here 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.540
 we have this the different 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.350
 They evolution is that there are not all 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:54.230
 figures in fact missing figures like mb 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.230
 or mega come for example mega gardebled 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.640
 Well, that would be it, I already broke it 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.220
 this the tape because if it cost me some 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.930
 minutes to open it I did not want to include 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.110
 individuals 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.800
 finally I'm going to draw the figures for 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.800
 show them 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.480
 in view of these brochures that vital 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.480
 Ours is 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.570
 this mega tyra half the friend stone of 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.570
 granite 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.310
 hypocrite 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.130
 well here we have this the little ones 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.010
 brochures with which it comes 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.590
 I'm going to take them out to show them maybe 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.689
 you're 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.100
 has a role in which is that 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.859
 all figures today what this one 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.659
 bring with the code holding onto the 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.450
 true for it to be I guess it's for 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.850
 some kind of gift comes with the text 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:09.479
 Japanese I do not know what I say is here with 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.209
 a brochure where takara tomy offers us 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.010
 some of your products 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.069
 Here they are won me with a tab 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.430
 pokemon between so much that the ex a game 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.730
 of letters this a castle with various 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.230
 this one contains a pokemon core and a 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.840
 Larger list of what is the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.709
 castle we can see different 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.880
 mentions this mega blazy figure 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.390
 game 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.390
 and well this mega also has this month 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.250
 pack of pokemon chips that 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.350
 unfortunately they do not serve much 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.090
 because it was a game that came out in 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.300
 Japan 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.209
 did not go anywhere else and well then 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.019
 these have these have illustrations 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.930
 of the figures this in itself have the 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.489
 size and weight of each pokemon have 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.049
 to arbitrate to whistle 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.880
 So immediate tahilyani is not well 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.760
 now following the figures 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.950
 Well, this pack is a bit special 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.140
 because here we have 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.140
 leave under the bed 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.850
 as I was saying it is a bit special 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.160
 because here we have two figures that are 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.420
 the arbitrary and capital in which 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.930
 nothing any revision since 2004 every 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.750
 each of them measures five centimeters 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:39.750
 they have matte paint finish and here it is 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.750
 show them here we have the referee 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.900
 thanks to this one for it's more this more 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.960
 easy to get them the series of 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.020
 first versions are the faces very 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.040
 and therefore difficult to get here and yes 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.200
 no longer is this the face terms we 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.840
 they put them in an easier way not 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.820
 here we have a pupita with the base 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.920
 grayish I would have liked it to be 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:13.000
 this translucent but good this and here 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.890
 to this workshop to 'put supersize that 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.570
 they had only followed for the tournament 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.109
 American is the first pack that 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:25.319
 includes where this is Japanese 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.319
 which is articulated from his arms 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.820
 after up and down 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.660
 that is legs or legs like you are 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.660
 like to see it 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.469
 they can be removed but they are 

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:43.399
 I recommend that you do it in a way 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:46.309
 be careful because if they do 

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:48.580
 can roughly sweep it and that 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:52.150
 can cause it to be 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.069
 I am of that flower in an easy way and 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.229
 While you do not spend half of it, you 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.430
 your legs are falling legs to each 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.720
 not here we have my little granita cat 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.060
 it also has articulation 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.620
 in its legs 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.560
 legs 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.560
 and in your arms you can move like this 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:19.580
 after giving this all round but 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.580
 they are very rigid 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:26.070
 both this anita workshop and megata were 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.860
 and they end at 36 centimeters 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.550
 6 centimeters and a half and they are from a 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.550
 soft material 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.990
 so be careful if you put them in 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.430
 an enclosed place that has heat 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.410
 because they are very sensitive 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.560
 and they can be ruined in a way 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.510
 this easy for it here is the mega 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.880
 stone unfortunately I do not have 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.330
 the legacy to show you how it works 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:56.420
 the whole but the legacy is supposed 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.610
 issued in the light so I would have to 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.150
 shine all this in the form of green 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.700
 hinting more at symbol of the 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.630
 mega stone for half that is 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:11.270
 in red and black and here is what would come 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.520
 to connect 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.260
 Well here you have friends this is the 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.580
 map of this one 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.870
 gives me pacific evolution 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:26.919
 taylan and such if you are fans of this 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.870
 pokemon everything that has to do with him 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:32.439
 here you do not want to stay that has mega 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:35.889
 stone but hey this one sure is going 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:38.319
 to like a lot this figures figures good 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.139
 I am nothing, I thank you for having 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.659
 seen this little review boxing I see them 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.590
 in the next video that are well 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.590
 take care and bye
