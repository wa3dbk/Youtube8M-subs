you guys like that's the last one that
gets<00:04:40.610> probably<00:04:40.789> might<00:04:40.970> be<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.180> last<00:04:41.360> time<00:04:41.479> I

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
gets probably might be the last time I

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.659 
gets probably might be the last time I
use<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:41.990> that's<00:04:42.289> actually<00:04:42.500> lard<00:04:43.010> I'm<00:04:43.400> using

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
use it that's actually lard I'm using

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.640 
use it that's actually lard I'm using
I'm<00:04:43.789> not<00:04:43.910> using<00:04:44.139> vegetable<00:04:45.139> or<00:04:45.470> anything

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
I'm not using vegetable or anything

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.219 
I'm not using vegetable or anything
that's<00:04:45.830> less<00:04:46.130> lard<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.910> it's<00:04:47.780> been<00:04:47.930> used<00:04:48.139> a

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
that's less lard and it's been used a

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.260 
that's less lard and it's been used a
few<00:04:48.260> times<00:04:48.440> so<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:48.949> think<00:04:49.190> this<00:04:49.820> might<00:04:50.000> be<00:04:50.060> the

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
few times so I think this might be the

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.650 
few times so I think this might be the
last<00:04:50.360> time<00:04:50.510> I<00:04:50.660> use<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:52.210> I'll<00:04:53.210> tell<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.419> what

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660
