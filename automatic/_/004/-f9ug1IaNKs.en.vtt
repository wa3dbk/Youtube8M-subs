probably just a little bridge work or

00:01:50.160 --> 00:02:03.830 
probably just a little bridge work or
neck<00:01:50.430> work<00:01:50.610> would<00:01:50.790> fix<00:01:51.000> that<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:03.420> handles

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
neck work would fix that the handles

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.180 
neck work would fix that the handles
really<00:02:04.020> well<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.440> plays<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.890> bunch<00:02:05.100> of

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
really well it plays like a bunch of

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.980

probably<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.540> stood<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.110> dropped<00:02:10.290> it

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
probably if you stood up and dropped it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.110 
probably if you stood up and dropped it
down<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.619> little<00:02:10.800> bit<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.100> be<00:02:11.190> fine<00:02:11.400> this
