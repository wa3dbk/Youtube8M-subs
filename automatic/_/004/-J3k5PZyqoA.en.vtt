outside<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> surfboard<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
outside of the surfboard is that the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.709 
outside of the surfboard is that the
border<00:00:31.320> makes<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> little<00:00:31.650> bit<00:00:31.800> more<00:00:31.949> lively

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
border makes it a little bit more lively

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.150 
border makes it a little bit more lively
so<00:00:33.719> when<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> board<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.890> over<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
so when the board is going over to the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.680 
so when the board is going over to the
surface<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> water<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.239> flexing

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
surface of the water and it's flexing

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.690 
surface of the water and it's flexing
and<00:00:36.809> twisting<00:00:37.260> basically<00:00:38.250> gives<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.550> bit

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and twisting basically gives you a bit

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.880 
and twisting basically gives you a bit
more<00:00:38.730> release<00:00:39.090> out<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.510> turns<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
more release out of your turns and it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.530 
more release out of your turns and it
holds<00:00:41.040> its<00:00:41.280> memory<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.879> won't<00:00:42.090> sort<00:00:42.390> based

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
holds its memory so it won't sort based

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.069 
holds its memory so it won't sort based
bit<00:00:43.850> I'll<00:00:44.850> show<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.120> here's<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> five<00:00:45.870> eight

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
bit I'll show you here's the five eight

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.350 
bit I'll show you here's the five eight
month<00:00:46.289> organ<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.620> 22<00:00:47.160> inches<00:00:47.280> wide<00:00:47.640> by<00:00:47.910> 200

month organ is 22 inches wide by 200
five-eighths<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> we're<00:00:50.280> talking<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
five-eighths so we're talking to do a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
five-eighths so we're talking to do a
little<00:00:50.879> bit<00:00:50.969> about<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> board<00:00:51.860> you've<00:00:52.860> got<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
little bit about the board you've got a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.580 
little bit about the board you've got a
high<00:00:53.309> volume<00:00:54.180> basically<00:00:54.870> all<00:00:55.199> underneath

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
high volume basically all underneath

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.779 
high volume basically all underneath
your<00:00:55.739> chest<00:00:55.949> all<00:00:56.250> running<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> way

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
your chest all running all the way

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.389 
your chest all running all the way
through<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> board<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.350> side<00:00:58.590> there's<00:00:59.250> my

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
through the board on the side there's my

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
through the board on the side there's my
little<00:00:59.609> sore<00:00:59.850> step<00:01:00.420> back<00:01:00.629> onto<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.989> sizer

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
little sore step back onto a sizer

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.779 
little sore step back onto a sizer
pinches<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.250> house<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.699> bit

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
pinches on some house a little bit

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.939 
pinches on some house a little bit
tighter<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.350> turns<00:01:04.710> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
tighter so that when you do turns you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.490 
tighter so that when you do turns you
have<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> big<00:01:05.460> boxy<00:01:06.119> bulky<00:01:06.479> rail<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
have got a big boxy bulky rail and the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.719 
have got a big boxy bulky rail and the
board<00:01:07.710> will<00:01:07.770> tighten<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.220> service<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
board will tighten to the service of the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.660 
board will tighten to the service of the
walls<00:01:08.880> would<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.030> easier<00:01:10.220> this<00:01:11.220> board<00:01:11.520> here

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
walls would be easier this board here

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.130 
walls would be easier this board here
has<00:01:12.000> got<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.270> extreme<00:01:14.360> wide<00:01:15.360> tail<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
has got the extreme wide tail to it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.649 
has got the extreme wide tail to it
okay<00:01:16.740> mr.<00:01:17.460> face<00:01:17.640> give<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.299> lift<00:01:18.450> on

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
okay mr. face give you a bit of lift on

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.630 
okay mr. face give you a bit of lift on
the<00:01:18.750> wave<00:01:18.930> may<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.159> into<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> way<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the wave may get you into the way it's a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
the wave may get you into the way it's a
lot<00:01:20.790> easier<00:01:20.970> than<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.420> standard<00:01:22.200> short<00:01:22.409> board

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
lot easier than a standard short board

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.999 
lot easier than a standard short board
would<00:01:24.470> if<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> look<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
would if you have a look at the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.920 
would if you have a look at the
underside<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> board

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.200 

this<00:01:29.800> board<00:01:30.100> comes<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.580> standard<00:01:30.970> court

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
this board comes to the standard court

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.020 
this board comes to the standard court
setup<00:01:31.630> before<00:01:31.870> fin<00:01:32.350> setup<00:01:32.820> okay

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
setup before fin setup okay

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.210 
setup before fin setup okay
on<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.900> underside<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.470> board<00:01:35.710> you've<00:01:36.070> got

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
on the underside of the board you've got

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.980 
on the underside of the board you've got
a<00:01:36.250> deep<00:01:36.520> double<00:01:37.030> concave<00:01:37.240> running<00:01:37.810> through

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
a deep double concave running through

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.750 
a deep double concave running through
the<00:01:38.110> pins<00:01:38.320> here<00:01:38.530> we're<00:01:39.250> going<00:01:39.370> to<00:01:39.430> spine<00:01:39.730> and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
the pins here we're going to spine and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.000 
the pins here we're going to spine and
once<00:01:40.150> down<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.450> middle<00:01:40.600> there<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.590> advantage

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
once down the middle there the advantage

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.130 
once down the middle there the advantage
we've<00:01:42.160> having<00:01:42.460> this<00:01:42.640> is<00:01:42.970> basically<00:01:43.450> with<00:01:44.020> it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
we've having this is basically with it

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.930 
we've having this is basically with it
being<00:01:44.320> so<00:01:44.530> extreme<00:01:44.950> on<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.430> double<00:01:45.730> concave

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
being so extreme on the double concave

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.560 
being so extreme on the double concave
there

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
there

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.770 
there
it<00:01:46.810> separates<00:01:47.350> all<00:01:47.620> into<00:01:47.980> two<00:01:48.160> halves<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.630> then
