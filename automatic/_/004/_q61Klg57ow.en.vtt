00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.460
 No 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.780
 hello together, dear blogleser 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.309
 Welcome to another and new 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.589
 long tutorial here krolock only 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.080
 my name is martin krolop and we 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.759
 will make something special today 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.229
 why especially agree is also everything 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.180
 we somehow particularly well 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.210
 we usually take pictures with us 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.320
 pizzas rise and watch with 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.360
 The best photos are the easiest 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.920
 to get out for you in the blog today 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.570
 Let's go the other direction 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.850
 given times in the pro rail and pick 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.590
 us one or 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.450
 the most promising and latest 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.030
 not formally in the photo market namely 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.619
 from bronco have the para 88 in the house 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.060
 we did a flash 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.920
 have us in the long run fetched 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.569
 Two models have ordered us yet 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.429
 a video shoot this evening 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.200
 that will come and take pictures 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.049
 with the complete team a complete 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.030
 Day and non-stop around the clock and what 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.280
 we'll just look the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.860
 couple 880 a parabolic storms relative 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.810
 small, usually he knows unbelievable 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.940
 great from film and television two meters 3 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.850
 meter or what do I know how big and that 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.580
 That's the way I would say this 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.349
 Parabol screen is said to be incredibly cool 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.649
 be he does not need a ring joke more he 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:04.569
 really has a central location of lightning 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.819
 he should de focus and focus 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.319
 he should shed close and far he radiate 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.670
 should make the light soft and hard he 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.099
 should all that is still in 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.239
 perfect shape, therefore, to convey that 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.120
 quality of the light should also 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.650
 be incredibly good and we want 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.940
 just the whole time realistic 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.560
 try and have us because of that 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.200
 and we will do that in the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.420
 subsequent part also video technically 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.750
 we want to accompany different 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.330
 take photos with these couple 88 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.430
 we want very different picture 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.360
 create lux with different looks 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.550
 moods light light characteristics 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.830
 and just look in practice what 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.200
 Can one from a light form 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.819
 to bring out difference without 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.500
 right now an entire range 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.450
 different reflectors soft boxes 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.610
 grids and have something else but 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.470
 really only with a thing in front of it 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.780
 lightning or around us 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.370
 I would say introduction is over 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.540
 we start with different ones 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.470
 the way I theme blocks that just 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.959
 announced 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.609
 I wish you a lot of fun and we say 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.569
 See you again at the end 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.569
 for a small bike
