00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.070
 hello dear hungry of the many 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.750
 many senfsorten which there is one 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.430
 to get exact number was me 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.070
 impossible for me belongs to the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.119
 The tastiest of the figs are unfortunately there 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.250
 it not everywhere 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.589
 and he is also not cheap so 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.029
 I thought it would be nice this 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.220
 to be able to prepare oneself 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.859
 and the recipe for that which you by the way 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.540
 again on my website esslust 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.269
 blog.de finds I discovered in this 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.839
 book from the grÃ¤fe and unzer so the gu 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.030
 publishing company 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:40.739
 it is a true treasure trove if it is us 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.149
 is done and I link 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.530
 it also in the infobox 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.120
 we need fresh figs for it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.680
 to prevent the question 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.180
 even now in the colder season 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.320
 in many Turkish 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.359
 food traders 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.039
 but also with the big ones like Kaufland 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.390
 for example, there is the recipe 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.219
 also works with dried 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.350
 then they cowardly before 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.379
 Soak for at least three hours 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.630
 we need a rod of cinnamon salt 200 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.740
 milliliter of red port wine as a substitute 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.560
 cherry cherry vinegar and coarse grained 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.179
 mustard and this is usually sweet after all 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.610
 it also gives it a sharper edge 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:18.479
 savory variation and you have to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.149
 just according to your taste 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.649
 decide 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.770
 first the figs are halved 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.420
 quartered respected and especially thick 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.989
 Skin pieces can be cut off 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.259
 We will then put them in a pot 

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:36.149
 Add the port to give the interest 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.350
 stick with it and leave everything 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.320
 bring to the boil 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.600
 after that reduce how the temperature and 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.659
 So let it all go at low heat 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.979
 Cook gently for about 15 minutes 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.680
 stir again and season with salt 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.200
 the cherry to give it all 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.190
 stir and simmer again 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.570
 let and now take from the stove 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.899
 now the coarse-grained itself is still 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.850
 stirred in and already we can ours 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.850
 own make in glasses 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.260
 the result is a really delicious 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.080
 because of course to be excellent 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.069
 But meat also goes beyond that 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.830
 versatile can be used 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.260
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.239
 preparation 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.819
 However, if you is dijon mustard prefer 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.500
 or the mustard on a prescription 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.190
 want to test then just look 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.840
 into these videos and if 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.480
 I have not done so yet 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.420
 Of course, very much about your abo stays here 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.420
