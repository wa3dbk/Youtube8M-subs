00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
Oh silly I mean I didn't realize that

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.230 
Oh silly I mean I didn't realize that
they're<00:05:07.470> such<00:05:07.680> poor<00:05:08.070> reaching<00:05:08.550> applications

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
they're such poor reaching applications
