you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.549 

hi<00:00:46.880> I'm<00:00:47.239> Luke<00:00:47.570> gilfeather<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.380> I'm<00:00:48.530> a

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
hi I'm Luke gilfeather and I'm a

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.889 
hi I'm Luke gilfeather and I'm a
mastering<00:00:49.130> engineer<00:00:49.610> I<00:00:49.820> get<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.660> lot<00:00:50.870> of

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
mastering engineer I get a lot of

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.569 
mastering engineer I get a lot of
questions<00:00:51.350> about<00:00:51.500> mastering<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:52.399> what

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
questions about mastering and what

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.000 
questions about mastering and what
mastering<00:00:53.120> is<00:00:53.360> I<00:00:53.600> put<00:00:54.410> together<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.829> little

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
mastering is I put together a little

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.040 
mastering is I put together a little
video<00:00:55.250> here<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.850> try<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.120> explain<00:00:56.570> what<00:00:56.840> goes

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
video here to try to explain what goes

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.189 
video here to try to explain what goes
on<00:00:57.260> in<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:57.680> typical<00:00:58.129> mastering<00:00:58.670> session<00:00:59.199> I'm

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
on in a typical mastering session I'm

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.990 
on in a typical mastering session I'm
going<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.680> generalize<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.309> say<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:01.970> a

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
going to generalize and say that a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.119 
going to generalize and say that a
typical<00:01:02.239> mastering<00:01:02.989> session<00:01:03.230> is<00:01:03.589> divided

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
typical mastering session is divided

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.240 
typical mastering session is divided
into<00:01:04.280> three<00:01:04.670> steps<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:06.560> first<00:01:06.590> step<00:01:06.950> is

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
into three steps the first step is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.249 
into three steps the first step is
loading<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.729> files<00:01:08.000> into<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.450> digital<00:01:08.690> audio

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
loading the files into a digital audio

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.680 
loading the files into a digital audio
workstation<00:01:10.009> the<00:01:10.640> second<00:01:11.090> step<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.540> the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
workstation the second step is the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.690 
workstation the second step is the
aesthetic<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.320> technical<00:01:12.950> processing<00:01:13.610> of

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
aesthetic and technical processing of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.810 
aesthetic and technical processing of
those<00:01:13.940> files<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:16.070> third<00:01:16.280> step<00:01:16.580> is

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
those files and the third step is

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.969 
those files and the third step is
assembling<00:01:17.300> those<00:01:17.600> files<00:01:17.930> into<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.590> final

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
assembling those files into the final

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.240 
assembling those files into the final
compilation<00:01:20.229> depending<00:01:21.229> on<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.380> project<00:01:21.710> and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
compilation depending on the project and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.700 
compilation depending on the project and
what<00:01:22.970> format<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.570> files<00:01:23.810> are<00:01:24.050> submitted<00:01:24.560> in

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
what format the files are submitted in

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.490 
what format the files are submitted in
the<00:01:25.100> first<00:01:25.340> step<00:01:25.580> may<00:01:25.820> include<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.570> sample<00:01:27.320> rate

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
the first step may include a sample rate

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.889 
the first step may include a sample rate
conversion<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.160> higher<00:01:28.430> sample<00:01:29.000> rate<00:01:29.180> so

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
conversion to a higher sample rate so

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.719 
conversion to a higher sample rate so
the<00:01:30.050> subsequent<00:01:30.410> processing<00:01:31.220> done<00:01:31.490> on<00:01:31.610> the

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
the subsequent processing done on the

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.999 
the subsequent processing done on the
digital<00:01:32.119> audio<00:01:32.390> workstation<00:01:33.110> can<00:01:33.560> be<00:01:33.649> done<00:01:33.860> at

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
digital audio workstation can be done at

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.889 
digital audio workstation can be done at
a<00:01:34.039> higher<00:01:34.310> sample<00:01:34.789> rate<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.149> bit<00:01:35.330> depth<00:01:35.570> than

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
a higher sample rate and bit depth than

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.620 
a higher sample rate and bit depth than
the<00:01:36.080> files<00:01:36.350> were<00:01:36.619> submitted<00:01:37.190> in<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:38.330> is<00:01:38.479> also

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
the files were submitted in it is also

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.450 
the files were submitted in it is also
possible<00:01:38.960> in<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:39.470> first<00:01:39.770> step<00:01:40.039> that<00:01:40.310> an

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
possible in this first step that an

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.940 
possible in this first step that an
initial<00:01:41.000> loudness<00:01:41.479> matching<00:01:42.050> or<00:01:42.259> leveling<00:01:42.800> of

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
initial loudness matching or leveling of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.419 
initial loudness matching or leveling of
the<00:01:43.100> files<00:01:43.340> may<00:01:43.670> occur<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:45.619> second<00:01:46.009> step<00:01:46.190> or

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
the files may occur the second step or

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.910 
the files may occur the second step or
the<00:01:46.640> actual<00:01:46.820> processing<00:01:47.690> of<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.899> files<00:01:48.170> is

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the actual processing of the files is

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.859 
the actual processing of the files is
where<00:01:49.220> equalization<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.210> compression<00:01:50.720> are

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
where equalization and compression are

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.810 
where equalization and compression are
usually<00:01:51.290> applied<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.979> lot<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.400> people<00:01:52.670> think

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
usually applied a lot of people think

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.730 
usually applied a lot of people think
this<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.360> only<00:01:53.540> step<00:01:53.900> that<00:01:53.960> goes<00:01:54.320> on<00:01:54.560> in

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
this is the only step that goes on in

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.499 
this is the only step that goes on in
the<00:01:54.829> mastering<00:01:55.250> process<00:01:55.490> yet<00:01:56.000> it's<00:01:56.180> only<00:01:56.360> a

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
the mastering process yet it's only a

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.380 
the mastering process yet it's only a
part<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.140> whole<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.970> third<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.210> final

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
part of the whole the third and final

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.109 
part of the whole the third and final
step<00:01:59.869> of<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:00.229> mastering<00:02:00.710> process<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:01.490> the

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
step of the mastering process is the

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.389 
step of the mastering process is the
Assembly<00:02:02.659> of<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.869> processed<00:02:03.439> files<00:02:03.770> into<00:02:04.159> a

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
Assembly of the processed files into a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.300 
Assembly of the processed files into a
finished<00:02:04.700> compilation<00:02:05.659> this<00:02:06.560> step<00:02:06.829> usually

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
finished compilation this step usually

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.979 
finished compilation this step usually
includes<00:02:07.700> setting<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.209> gap<00:02:08.420> times<00:02:08.750> between

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
includes setting the gap times between

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.699 
includes setting the gap times between
the<00:02:09.229> songs<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.979> album<00:02:10.340> flows<00:02:10.640> together<00:02:11.709> it

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
the songs so the album flows together it

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.550 
the songs so the album flows together it
may<00:02:13.130> also<00:02:13.280> include<00:02:13.959> modifying<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.170> apparent

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
may also include modifying the apparent

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.500 
may also include modifying the apparent
loudness<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.160> each<00:02:16.310> track<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.239> songs

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
loudness of each track so that the songs

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.770 
loudness of each track so that the songs
may<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.170> equal<00:02:18.380> loudness<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.630> not

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
may be of equal loudness this is not

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.569 
may be of equal loudness this is not
always<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.110> case<00:02:21.260> though<00:02:21.680> sometimes<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:22.280> want

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
always the case though sometimes we want

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.850 
always the case though sometimes we want
some<00:02:22.850> songs<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.299> appear<00:02:23.660> quieter<00:02:24.170> or<00:02:24.350> louder

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
some songs to appear quieter or louder

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.140 
some songs to appear quieter or louder
than<00:02:25.190> others<00:02:26.769> also<00:02:27.769> during<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.579> step<00:02:28.850> we'll

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
than others also during this step we'll

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.180 
than others also during this step we'll
cut<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.450> heads<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:29.930> tails<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.590> songs<00:02:30.890> and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
cut the heads and tails of the songs and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.180 
cut the heads and tails of the songs and
apply<00:02:31.489> fades<00:02:32.410> crossfades<00:02:33.410> may<00:02:33.650> also<00:02:33.829> be

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
apply fades crossfades may also be

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.340 
apply fades crossfades may also be
applied<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.940> one<00:02:35.120> song<00:02:35.360> may<00:02:35.600> flow<00:02:35.930> into

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
applied so that one song may flow into

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.420 
applied so that one song may flow into
the<00:02:36.380> other<00:02:38.019> also<00:02:39.019> when<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.320> third<00:02:39.560> step<00:02:39.890> CD

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
the other also when the third step CD

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.250 
the other also when the third step CD
markers<00:02:40.910> are<00:02:41.060> applied<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.989> songs

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
markers are applied so that the songs
