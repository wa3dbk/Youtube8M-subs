00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.140
 hello to all and sonia to click at 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.260
 point fr is today I propose you 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.010
 a recipe using the active rail xl 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.369
 express so the latest fryer 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.040
 without oil that came out this year at 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.990
 October I think we'll do 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.419
 words and sli it's a recipe that 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.970
 I already had peace made using a 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.279
 cooking companion and there we will test it 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.060
 in the active rails it is part 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.269
 also from the book that comes with 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.820
 one of the versions of activery and 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.219
 there are also bloggers who did 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.800
 their versions so the base is the same 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.230
 but then we personalize it according to 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.730
 his desires according to his tastes for example 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.149
 I'm not a big fan of fruits 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.789
 dry 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.859
 so I do not put it aside 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.690
 fines for macadamia nuts 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.890
 things like that but if you will not see 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.629
 very often in my recipes of 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.149
 raisins from dried apricots 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.679
 things like that we start by mixing 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:08.140
 all the ingredients in a salad bowl 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:13.420
 so we have 150 g of oat flakes 50 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.440
 grams of flaked almonds 50 g walnuts 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.500
 of macadamia that I have slightly 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:23.980
 crushed and then I have a mixture of 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.070
 seeds so the gemmi about 20 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.740
 grams of squash seeds pretty much 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.870
 20 grams of sunflower seeds and 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.930
 pine nuts so there is little 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:41.550
 50 grams of these seeds then 100 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.550
 milliliters of maple syrup 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.140
 you can put some agave syrup or 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.300
 to make a mixture of both I vary 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.710
 depending on what I and 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.050
 the occurrence I had little agave syrup 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.050
 I had maple syrup left 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.800
 then we get the spoon 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.610
 is provided with the activery we will put 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.610
 half a spoon of oil 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:13.780
 I use oil isio 4 may you 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.520
 can very well use oil from 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.640
 sunflower oil rapeseed oil 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.459
 grape seed 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:25.100
 but a rather neutral oil and then 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.190
 I put half a spoon of aromas of 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.959
 vanilla if you use extract 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.440
 of vanilla you take a spoon to 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.180
 coffee but not so much art in the world 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.230
 without a little less than the extract 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.230
 so I put a little more 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.489
 then we mix for although the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.530
 oatmeal and the seeds either 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:57.040
 coated then poured the mixture into 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.040
 the active rails 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.760
 in the program ten minutes and it's gone 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.600
 the titraille just ring the ten 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.180
 minutes are up 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.560
 see the rendering is well gilded salary 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.210
 well crispy we will make it rest 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.740
 now let it cool and 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.810
 then we can put it in a 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.230
 hermetic jar he kept one to 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.690
 two weeks 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.920
 I hope you enjoyed this video

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.720
