00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.799 
how you know how you can get the kind of
flying<00:00:13.950> shots<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.460> your<00:00:14.580> video<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.089> it's

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
flying shots in your video and it's

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.210 
flying shots in your video and it's
pretty<00:00:16.020> simple<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.470> bought<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.010> little

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
pretty simple I just bought this little

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.939 
pretty simple I just bought this little
quad<00:00:17.970> remote-controlled<00:00:18.750> quad<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.260> called<00:00:19.890> a

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
quad remote-controlled quad I called a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.400 
quad remote-controlled quad I called a
DJI<00:00:20.250> phantom<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.779> converted<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
DJI phantom and I just converted a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.320 
DJI phantom and I just converted a
little<00:00:22.680> bit<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.580> get<00:00:23.850> better<00:00:24.000> shots

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
little bit so I can get better shots

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.740 
little bit so I can get better shots
with<00:00:24.480> it

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
with it

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.259 
with it
alright<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.369> DJI<00:00:26.730> phantom

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
alright so this is the the DJI phantom

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.929 
alright so this is the the DJI phantom
and<00:00:27.480> basically<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.189> converted<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.640> can

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and basically I converted it so you can

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.870 
and basically I converted it so you can
fly<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.800> fpv<00:00:31.800> which<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.219> first-person<00:00:32.790> view

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
fly it fpv which is first-person view

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.120 
fly it fpv which is first-person view
and<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.020> use<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.469> way<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.710> kind<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
and you can use it this way to kind of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.130 
and you can use it this way to kind of
you<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.309> record<00:00:35.730> actual<00:00:36.180> aerial<00:00:36.570> video<00:00:36.870> but

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
you know record actual aerial video but

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.900 
you know record actual aerial video but
you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.260> actually<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.280> frame<00:00:38.700> your

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
you can actually you can frame your

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.400 
you can actually you can frame your
shots<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.540> know<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:39.750> opposed<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.170> flying

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
shots you know as opposed to just flying

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.709 
shots you know as opposed to just flying
blindly<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.040> hoping<00:00:41.309> getting<00:00:41.850> good<00:00:41.969> shots<00:00:42.000> so

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
blindly and hoping getting good shots so

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.840 
blindly and hoping getting good shots so
what<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> did<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> using<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> standard<00:00:44.520> DJI

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
what I did is a using the standard DJI

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.119 
what I did is a using the standard DJI
phantom<00:00:45.270> controller<00:00:45.629> has<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.440> metal<00:00:46.649> handle

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
phantom controller has this metal handle

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.670 
phantom controller has this metal handle
so<00:00:47.789> using<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.570> screw<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.079> attached<00:00:49.500> this

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so using one screw I attached this

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.299 
so using one screw I attached this
monitor<00:00:50.960> 7-inch<00:00:51.960> monitor<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.860> kind

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
monitor 7-inch monitor it's like a kind

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.799 
monitor 7-inch monitor it's like a kind
of<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> standard<00:00:53.820> thing<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.300> use<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.780> your

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
of a standard thing and you use on your

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.400

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
attached a battery for the monitor

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.660 
attached a battery for the monitor
another<00:01:01.230> battery<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:01.890> video<00:01:02.219> transmitter

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
another battery for video transmitter

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.140 
transmitter and antenna that I pad
allows<00:01:10.979> me<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> fly<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:11.880> longer

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
allows me to fly a little bit longer

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.750 
allows me to fly a little bit longer
range<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.189> know<00:01:14.250> feeds<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
range and and that you know feeds the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.929 
range and and that you know feeds the
video<00:01:14.970> signal<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> monitor<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.400> here<00:01:17.570> I

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
video signal to the monitor and here I

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.460 
video signal to the monitor and here I
added<00:01:20.939> form<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:21.869> softer

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
added form up here just for softer

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.010 
added form up here just for softer
landings<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.400> attached<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> GoPro<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.900> I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
landings but I attached the GoPro and I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.810 
landings but I attached the GoPro and I
just<00:01:25.380> attached<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.100> standard<00:01:26.580> GoPro

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
just attached it and it's standard GoPro

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.179 
just attached it and it's standard GoPro
in<00:01:27.720> okay<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.409> case<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.740> hit<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> ground

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
in okay so in case I hit the ground

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.190 
in okay so in case I hit the ground
really<00:01:29.400> hard<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.880> still<00:01:30.090> protected<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
really hard it's still protected and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.490 
really hard it's still protected and
here<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.030> kind<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.720> know<00:01:33.780> extra

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
here this is kind of a you know extra

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.960 
here this is kind of a you know extra
accessories<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.100> added<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> video

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
accessories I added so this is the video

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.310 
accessories I added so this is the video
transmitter<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> that's<00:01:36.960> actually<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
transmitter and that's actually the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.410 
transmitter and that's actually the
receiver<00:01:37.680> over<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.759> transmits

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
receiver over there so that transmits

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
receiver over there so that transmits
the<00:01:39.540> video<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.409> plug<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.829> using

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the video and you just plug it in using

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550 
the video and you just plug it in using
a<00:01:41.250> standard<00:01:41.670> let<00:01:42.390> me<00:01:42.509> use<00:01:42.750> V<00:01:42.960> cable<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
a standard let me use V cable to the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.240 
a standard let me use V cable to the
GoPro<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:46.409> thing<00:01:46.619> hasn't<00:01:46.799> its<00:01:47.100> own

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
GoPro and then this thing hasn't its own

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.700 
GoPro and then this thing hasn't its own
battery<00:01:47.750> which<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.990> probably<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.680> best

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
battery which was probably not the best

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.319 
battery which was probably not the best
way<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:51.000> how<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> do

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
way to do it but for now that's how I do

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.539 
way to do it but for now that's how I do
it<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:52.350> has<00:01:52.560> its<00:01:52.740> own<00:01:52.829> battery<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.520> power

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
it so this has its own battery to power

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.910 
it so this has its own battery to power
this<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:55.049> here's<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.380> battery<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
this and then here's the battery for the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.880 
this and then here's the battery for the
actual<00:01:56.159> DJI<00:01:56.430> phantom4<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:58.140> start<00:01:58.409> off<00:01:58.649> always

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
actual DJI phantom4 you start off always

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.620 
actual DJI phantom4 you start off always
turn<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.880> transmitter<00:02:00.119> first<00:02:00.799> for<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
turn on the transmitter first for the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.200 
turn on the transmitter first for the
for<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.110> Phantom<00:02:03.820> then<00:02:04.820> put<00:02:05.030> in<00:02:05.119> the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
for the Phantom then put in the

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.330 
for the Phantom then put in the
batteries<00:02:05.600> put<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.259> down<00:02:06.439> wait<00:02:06.799> for<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:07.070> until

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
batteries put it down wait for it until

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.580 
batteries put it down wait for it until
you<00:02:07.610> get<00:02:07.729> basically<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.179> green<00:02:08.929> light<00:02:09.140> blinking

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
you get basically a green light blinking

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.559 
you get basically a green light blinking
and<00:02:09.740> flying<00:02:10.009> in<00:02:10.190> GPS<00:02:10.550> mode<00:02:10.759> or<00:02:11.000> yellow<00:02:11.239> light

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
and flying in GPS mode or yellow light

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.620 
and flying in GPS mode or yellow light
blinking<00:02:12.319> if<00:02:13.040> you're<00:02:13.310> flying<00:02:13.580> in<00:02:13.819> altitude

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
blinking if you're flying in altitude

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.860 
blinking if you're flying in altitude
mode<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.970> always<00:02:16.970> checked<00:02:17.239> our<00:02:17.360> propellers

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
mode and always checked our propellers

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.990 
mode and always checked our propellers
are<00:02:18.020> nice<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.530> tight<00:02:18.650> because<00:02:19.580> some<00:02:19.760> people

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
are nice and tight because some people

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.160 
are nice and tight because some people
have<00:02:20.030> been<00:02:20.239> losing<00:02:20.540> them<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.840> then<00:02:20.930> they<00:02:21.020> lose

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
have been losing them and then they lose

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.430 
have been losing them and then they lose
the<00:02:21.319> whole<00:02:21.440> quad<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.930> plugging<00:02:23.930> your<00:02:24.050> camera

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
the whole quad and plugging your camera

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.809 
the whole quad and plugging your camera
here<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.800> I'm<00:02:27.950> going<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.190> plug<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.640> power

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
here so I'm going to plug in the power

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:36.100 
here so I'm going to plug in the power
here<00:02:29.150> for<00:02:29.390> my<00:02:29.510> video<00:02:30.080> transmitter<00:02:34.959> check<00:02:35.959> that

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
here for my video transmitter check that

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.970 
here for my video transmitter check that
the<00:02:36.230> light<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:38.019> yeah<00:02:39.019> it's<00:02:39.200> on<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.800> should

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
the light is on yeah it's on so I should

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.600 
the light is on yeah it's on so I should
be<00:02:40.069> transmitting<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.610> video<00:02:40.790> signal<00:02:41.000> now<00:02:41.590> and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
be transmitting a video signal now and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.150 
be transmitting a video signal now and
set<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.730> aside<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.680> here<00:02:45.680> I'm<00:02:45.769> going<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.950> power

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
set it aside so here I'm going to power

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.430 
set it aside so here I'm going to power
up<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.580> video<00:02:47.000> receiver<00:02:47.510> receiver<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.319> this

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
up the video receiver receiver to this

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.220 
up the video receiver receiver to this
little<00:02:48.769> battery<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.630> then<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:52.720> actual<00:02:53.720> LCD

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
little battery and then the actual LCD

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.930 
little battery and then the actual LCD
screen<00:02:55.299> plug<00:02:56.299> it<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:59.530> turn<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.860> radio

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
screen plug it in and turn on the radio

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.250 
screen plug it in and turn on the radio
video<00:03:01.940> receiver<00:03:04.810> sometimes<00:03:05.810> it's<00:03:05.959> hard<00:03:06.140> to

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
video receiver sometimes it's hard to

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.720 
video receiver sometimes it's hard to
see<00:03:06.410> whether<00:03:06.560> those<00:03:06.799> lights<00:03:07.070> are<00:03:07.250> on<00:03:07.280> or<00:03:07.579> not

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
see whether those lights are on or not

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.660 
see whether those lights are on or not
and<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.660> Sun<00:03:08.900> Shade<00:03:09.110> sunshine<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:09.920> here<00:03:10.579> you

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
and the Sun Shade sunshine but here you

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.870 
and the Sun Shade sunshine but here you
can<00:03:10.790> actually<00:03:10.910> see<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:12.340> what<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.489> monitor

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
can actually see the what the monitor

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.479 
can actually see the what the monitor
see<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.239> if<00:03:14.329> I<00:03:14.390> grabbed<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:15.110> quad<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:16.130> can<00:03:16.280> see

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
see so if I grabbed the quad you can see

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.810 
see so if I grabbed the quad you can see
that<00:03:16.670> I'm<00:03:17.109> pointing<00:03:18.109> at<00:03:18.170> myself<00:03:18.320> now<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.790> I

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
that I'm pointing at myself now and so I

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.160 
that I'm pointing at myself now and so I
can<00:03:19.970> see<00:03:20.120> basically<00:03:20.420> everything<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:21.049> the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
can see basically everything that the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.550 
can see basically everything that the
quad<00:03:21.380> see<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.609> see<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.880> quad<00:03:23.090> is<00:03:23.239> here<00:03:23.560> and

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
quad see so you see the quad is here and

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.220 
quad see so you see the quad is here and
as<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.799> rotate<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.750> what<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.019> seeing

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
as I rotate it this is what it's seeing

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.780 
as I rotate it this is what it's seeing
so<00:03:27.440> anyway<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:27.799> we'll<00:03:27.980> start<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.340> camera<00:03:28.640> now

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
so anyway so we'll start the camera now

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:38.289 
so anyway so we'll start the camera now
on<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.329> GoPro<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:29.989> we'll<00:03:30.140> record<00:03:30.290> our<00:03:30.650> flight

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:46.220 

we<00:03:39.299> got<00:03:39.450> power

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.710 

let<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.709> hover<00:03:46.890> for<00:03:47.250> now<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.360> can<00:03:48.510> see

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
let it hover for now and you can see

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.699 
let it hover for now and you can see
this<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.140> what<00:03:49.319> we're<00:03:49.500> seeing<00:03:49.709> here

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
this is what we're seeing here

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.910 
this is what we're seeing here
through<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.400> camera<00:03:51.849> there<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.530> as<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.650> rotate

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
through the camera there and as I rotate

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.679 
through the camera there and as I rotate
the<00:03:54.099> camera<00:03:54.310> or<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.730> quad<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:55.329> can<00:03:55.540> look<00:03:55.629> around

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
the camera or the quad I can look around

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.250 
the camera or the quad I can look around
I<00:03:56.290> can't<00:03:57.010> even<00:03:57.040> look<00:03:57.280> at<00:03:57.400> us<00:03:57.459> right<00:03:57.609> now

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
I can't even look at us right now

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:53.680 
I can't even look at us right now
yeah<00:04:00.480> he's<00:04:01.480> standing<00:04:01.719> and<00:04:02.200> it's<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:02.980> flying

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.690 

and<00:04:54.230> now<00:04:54.560> as<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:54.710> can<00:04:54.860> see<00:04:54.920> flying<00:04:55.460> this<00:04:55.640> thing

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
and now as you can see flying this thing

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.700 
and now as you can see flying this thing
is<00:04:56.030> pretty<00:04:56.360> easy<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:57.050> in<00:04:57.200> fact<00:04:57.380> it's<00:04:57.560> almost

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
is pretty easy and in fact it's almost

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.110 
is pretty easy and in fact it's almost
like<00:04:57.890> like<00:04:58.070> playing<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.400> video<00:04:58.550> game<00:04:58.670> so<00:04:59.030> if

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
you've played any flying video games you

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.800 
you've played any flying video games you
should<00:05:00.920> have<00:05:01.190> no<00:05:01.310> problems<00:05:01.760> flying<00:05:02.630> this

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
should have no problems flying this

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.200 
should have no problems flying this
thing<00:05:02.870> it's<00:05:03.620> very<00:05:03.680> stable<00:05:04.010> you<00:05:04.790> know<00:05:04.910> pretty

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
thing it's very stable you know pretty

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.700 
thing it's very stable you know pretty
pretty<00:05:05.480> easy<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:05.840> control

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
pretty easy to control

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.170 
pretty easy to control
doesn't<00:05:07.310> mean<00:05:07.430> you<00:05:07.610> not<00:05:07.760> gonna<00:05:07.880> have<00:05:07.970> any

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
doesn't mean you not gonna have any

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.180 
doesn't mean you not gonna have any
little<00:05:08.630> accidents<00:05:09.230> and<00:05:09.530> like<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:09.890> see<00:05:10.010> up

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
little accidents and like you see up

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.790 
little accidents and like you see up
here<00:05:10.810> and<00:05:11.810> that's<00:05:11.960> just<00:05:12.170> simply<00:05:12.290> because<00:05:12.680> you

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
here and that's just simply because you

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.050 
here and that's just simply because you
know<00:05:12.920> especially<00:05:13.490> at<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.610> beginning<00:05:13.730> when

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
know especially at the beginning when

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.370 
know especially at the beginning when
you're<00:05:14.120> flying<00:05:14.360> this<00:05:14.570> it's<00:05:14.840> hard<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.200> tell

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
you're flying this it's hard to tell

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.260 
you're flying this it's hard to tell
sometimes<00:05:15.590> just<00:05:15.920> how<00:05:16.040> close<00:05:16.280> you<00:05:16.430> are<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.610> two

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
sometimes just how close you are to two

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.940 
sometimes just how close you are to two
objects<00:05:17.810> when<00:05:18.410> you're<00:05:18.530> just<00:05:18.650> looking<00:05:18.860> through

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
objects when you're just looking through

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.190 
objects when you're just looking through
the<00:05:19.070> camera<00:05:19.480> but<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:20.570> great<00:05:20.780> thing<00:05:20.900> about<00:05:20.990> the

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
the camera but the great thing about the

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.990 
the camera but the great thing about the
DJI<00:05:21.470> phantom<00:05:21.860> is<00:05:21.980> that<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.280> know<00:05:22.400> so<00:05:22.910> many

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
DJI phantom is that you know so many

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.910 
DJI phantom is that you know so many
times<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.330> I've<00:05:23.510> had<00:05:23.540> something<00:05:24.140> or<00:05:24.260> fallen

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
times that I've had something or fallen

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.060 
times that I've had something or fallen
down<00:05:25.390> and<00:05:26.390> hit<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.810> ground<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.590> really<00:05:27.620> the

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
down and hit the ground it really the

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.990 
down and hit the ground it really the
worst<00:05:28.250> that's<00:05:28.400> happened<00:05:28.490> is<00:05:28.790> I've<00:05:28.970> just

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
worst that's happened is I've just

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.750 
worst that's happened is I've just
broken<00:05:29.420> a<00:05:29.630> propeller<00:05:29.960> so<00:05:30.320> you<00:05:31.190> know<00:05:31.280> just<00:05:31.580> by

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
broken a propeller so you know just by

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.220 
broken a propeller so you know just by
it<00:05:31.820> takes<00:05:32.300> a<00:05:32.390> few<00:05:32.510> minutes<00:05:32.660> put<00:05:32.960> on<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.110> new

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
it takes a few minutes put on a new

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.480 
it takes a few minutes put on a new
propeller<00:05:33.650> they're<00:05:33.830> really<00:05:34.040> cheap<00:05:34.220> and

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
propeller they're really cheap and

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.730 
propeller they're really cheap and
you're<00:05:34.700> back<00:05:34.940> up<00:05:35.120> flying<00:05:35.420> again

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
you're back up flying again

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.800 
you're back up flying again
now<00:05:37.220> as<00:05:37.730> you<00:05:37.850> can<00:05:37.970> see<00:05:38.090> the<00:05:38.210> shots<00:05:38.420> are<00:05:38.570> pretty

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
now as you can see the shots are pretty

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.480 
now as you can see the shots are pretty
smooth<00:05:39.080> all<00:05:39.320> these<00:05:39.560> shots<00:05:39.800> are<00:05:39.950> you<00:05:40.130> seeing<00:05:40.370> up

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
smooth all these shots are you seeing up

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.370 
smooth all these shots are you seeing up
here<00:05:40.520> or<00:05:40.760> straight<00:05:41.060> you<00:05:41.330> know<00:05:41.450> straight<00:05:42.020> from

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
here or straight you know straight from

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.870 
here or straight you know straight from
the<00:05:42.560> camera<00:05:42.770> I<00:05:43.070> didn't<00:05:43.610> do<00:05:43.700> any

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
the camera I didn't do any

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.930 
the camera I didn't do any
post-processing<00:05:44.630> on<00:05:44.870> it<00:05:45.020> but<00:05:45.710> if<00:05:45.980> for<00:05:46.850> example

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
post-processing on it but if for example

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.000 
post-processing on it but if for example
when<00:05:47.690> you<00:05:47.780> are<00:05:47.900> flying<00:05:48.140> on<00:05:48.320> really<00:05:48.560> windy<00:05:48.830> days

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
when you are flying on really windy days

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.070 
when you are flying on really windy days
and<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:49.550> quad<00:05:49.910> might<00:05:50.210> kind<00:05:50.510> of<00:05:50.600> struggle<00:05:50.960> with

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
and the quad might kind of struggle with

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.870 
and the quad might kind of struggle with
the<00:05:51.200> wind<00:05:51.410> a<00:05:51.590> little<00:05:51.920> bit<00:05:52.220> you're<00:05:52.490> gonna<00:05:52.580> get<00:05:52.820> a

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
the wind a little bit you're gonna get a

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.120 
the wind a little bit you're gonna get a
bit<00:05:53.060> of<00:05:53.180> a<00:05:53.270> shake<00:05:53.510> and<00:05:53.690> in<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.050> video<00:05:54.290> again

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
bit of a shake and in the video again

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.920 
bit of a shake and in the video again
you<00:05:55.430> can<00:05:55.610> stabilize<00:05:56.120> that<00:05:56.300> very<00:05:56.540> easily<00:05:56.690> and

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
you can stabilize that very easily and

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.650 
you can stabilize that very easily and

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
and also like I said I customized mind

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.110 
and also like I said I customized mind
so<00:06:15.890> I<00:06:15.919> painted<00:06:16.250> it<00:06:16.550> so<00:06:16.669> it's<00:06:16.790> a<00:06:16.850> different

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
so I painted it so it's a different

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.760 
so I painted it so it's a different
color<00:06:17.300> it's<00:06:17.630> that's<00:06:18.050> just<00:06:18.260> for<00:06:18.410> the<00:06:18.470> look<00:06:18.650> of

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
color it's that's just for the look of

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.750 
color it's that's just for the look of
it<00:06:18.919> and<00:06:19.540> normally<00:06:20.540> comes<00:06:20.780> a<00:06:20.930> comes<00:06:21.290> white<00:06:21.760> and

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
it and normally comes a comes white and

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.780 
it and normally comes a comes white and
also<00:06:23.270> I've<00:06:23.690> converted<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.740> mind<00:06:25.130> so<00:06:25.520> that<00:06:25.550> you

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
also I've converted the mind so that you

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.510

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
can fly the first-person point of view

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.590 
can fly the first-person point of view
