00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.730
 no 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.390
 yo everyone is first for us 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:29.869
 a tutorial on 1000 graf and I'm in 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.680
 Tim's company was exactly set 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:38.870
 on skype and his mother short here I am you 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:43.760
 present it so the clip is how 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.070
 run fast on m bah you take your 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.320
 feet accelerate like debate not 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.180
 if they are aimed at currency they can violate 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.570
 so we put ourselves a creative for good 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.720
 run 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.640
 so we do that finally taken it's a 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.390
 sad day and she was doing well saw the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.100
 subscribers a point where you know faster 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.130
 in fact you simply press on 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.799
 the key where you want convent or 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.880
 of this advanced cold that's it 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.620
 will have like doges with in and ben 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.170
 here I go much faster 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.299
 so then there is more is cons 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.579
 waited but on the other hand it's over a 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.899
 little more buffoon eat so will 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:29.090
 to go to too much that's cool it's cool 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.640
 so we can use earth for 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.140
 the bottom to go faster or there is 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.969
 another another method is the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.299
 ice cream so that goes four thousand times more 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.340
 quick 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.100
 yes but a little break the mouth and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.549
 to break a leg there it goes a lot 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.130
 a lot much faster you 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:52.700
 sprinter you skip your suppressing 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:55.549
 microspy and no and so there is another 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.369
 utility for that and I find it really 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.999
 nice when you're at home 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.299
 quiet well warm no they are 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.299
 machos 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:14.200
 you put down the passage and you 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.780
 sprint and then safe to go 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.650
 hour and a half so I'm half 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.280
 rainbow 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:28.209
 normal normal what normal body and so 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.569
 we are here we sculpte and we jump and 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.599
 so we make bubbles for a network 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.239
 safely and get smashed 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.970
 because yes we're working because it's 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:46.239
 equality anything short a little 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:51.340
 Existing guen tutor for dale of our 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.290
 because of a mine that is safe and 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.640
 going faster so for the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.480
 construction so that will be three blocks of 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.299
 earth one on the other with respect to 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.400
 parents by a destination so of 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:12.700
 figs line so we leave until the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:15.130
 mine looks good when I vote for them 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.370
 it was the battle is next or 1000 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.609
 three blocks of land above and we 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.250
 put the road back and in between 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:27.730
 paths we will put traps and for the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.670
 soil goes if you have the means to have 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.340
 from the first place of the class to 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.900
 go much faster 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.150
 either do you take the way you have 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.709
 like the earth here and so that's what 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.130
 is that we can get to 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:50.530
 a mine safely and quickly 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.650
 on those there not watch the video 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.030
 until the next card your mother 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:02.400
 age well then so next to a 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.400
 new mesh tutorial
