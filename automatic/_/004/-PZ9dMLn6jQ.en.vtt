00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.019
 Hello and welcome to the other Weilburg I show you 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.039
 every program GroÃŸmann 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.209
 can use effectively 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.529
 namely by the version 2 points 0 you can with the program next 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.649
 Mouse movements would record records 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.890
 and then play later you can even save it 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.249
 there is not more money we have 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.849
 they have their books last there are the strawberry lounge and robbery 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.180
 put under way 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.550
 in the quarter too 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.340
 I had started it myself and Werner Merkel made it to the end 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.220
 Amazon to buy one and be copied the title 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.220
 that people's cadre bit slow 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.870
 to cancel that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.250
 Of course that will not work 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.960
 the mouse is moving yes 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.319
 there are quite a few managers 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:00.730
 this will stop the program and make it fast 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.730
 the speed tailors 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.060
 The problem with the matter is that my internet needs to get better slowly 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.680
 when creating also really fit 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.399
 makes enough breaks 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.729
 Wernig record this is then later can play faster 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.470
 we want to use occurs when recording 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.910
 or better afterwards 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.210
 the recording will be finished 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.100
 and one more stopball 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.080
 and if you then the program window the small from the east 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.229
 exists so far 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.770
 so that the playboy had 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.160
 instead of the sports car Sal 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.570
 then the program advertised 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.810
 has completed consultancy in the world and have mecklenburg-western pomerania 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.320
 all the fun it took with Cosmos twelve minutes 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.030
 and if I had done it all manually in the world 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 haywire 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.640
 and so settles the finished result 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.220
 and maybe even interesting 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.270
 I'll show you how cool it looks 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.979
 you are now the position of the mouse so x and y 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.810
 and subtle in the debate about the right side is pressed or 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.909
 Not 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.359
 I think I helped 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.209
 and that's where IBM comes in
