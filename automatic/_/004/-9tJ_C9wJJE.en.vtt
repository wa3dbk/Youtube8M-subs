point of this video is with me Darko is

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.890 
point of this video is with me Darko is
it's<00:04:02.280> not<00:04:02.519> just<00:04:02.579> purple<00:04:03.269> Freddy<00:04:03.510> that's<00:04:03.780> gonna

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
it's not just purple Freddy that's gonna

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.849 
it's not just purple Freddy that's gonna
be<00:04:04.049> back<00:04:04.230> shadow<00:04:04.680> bonnie<00:04:05.160> /<00:04:05.850> shadow<00:04:06.329> a<00:04:06.859> purple

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859

I<00:04:08.010> Bonnie<00:04:08.489> there<00:04:08.910> they're<00:04:09.209> both<00:04:09.329> going<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.570> be

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
I Bonnie there they're both going to be

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.720 
I Bonnie there they're both going to be
in<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.930> game<00:04:10.109> we<00:04:10.290> think<00:04:10.320> yeah<00:04:11.250> that's<00:04:11.489> what<00:04:11.640> we

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
in the game we think yeah that's what we

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.370 
in the game we think yeah that's what we
definitely<00:04:12.120> think<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.660> know<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.870> can't<00:04:13.230> have

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
definitely think you know you can't have

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.840 
definitely think you know you can't have
a<00:04:13.440> shadow<00:04:13.650> Freddy<00:04:13.980> without<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> shadow<00:04:14.519> bonnie

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
a shadow Freddy without a shadow bonnie

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.659 
a shadow Freddy without a shadow bonnie
blog<00:04:15.630> who<00:04:15.810> said<00:04:16.140> they've<00:04:16.680> always<00:04:16.859> been<00:04:17.010> very

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
blog who said they've always been very

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.839 
blog who said they've always been very
similar<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.450> each<00:04:18.750> other<00:04:19.220> with<00:04:20.220> each<00:04:20.250> other

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
similar to each other with each other

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.570 
similar to each other with each other
you<00:04:21.630> know<00:04:21.780> like<00:04:21.989> an<00:04:22.349> partners<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:22.950> crime<00:04:23.130> you

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
you know like an partners in crime you

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.150 
you know like an partners in crime you
know<00:04:23.610> yeah<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.599> definitely<00:04:25.080> so

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
know yeah and definitely so

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.130 
know yeah and definitely so
so<00:04:26.220> we<00:04:26.640> definitely<00:04:26.850> think<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.540> also<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:27.990> would

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
so we definitely think and also it would

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.410 
so we definitely think and also it would
solve<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.710> if<00:04:28.860> shadow<00:04:29.160> bonnie<00:04:29.520> isn't<00:04:30.060> in<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
solve it if shadow bonnie isn't in the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.970 
solve it if shadow bonnie isn't in the
next<00:04:30.690> game<00:04:30.930> we're<00:04:31.140> not<00:04:31.170> going<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.470> know<00:04:31.680> we're

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
next game we're not going to know we're

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.260 
next game we're not going to know we're
not<00:04:32.040> going<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.280> know<00:04:32.370> anything<00:04:32.670> about<00:04:32.910> him<00:04:32.940> at

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
not going to know anything about him at

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.440 
not going to know anything about him at
all<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.870> yeah<00:04:34.260> yeah<00:04:34.530> yeah<00:04:34.800> definitely<00:04:35.450> it's

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
all so yeah yeah yeah definitely it's

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.030 
all so yeah yeah yeah definitely it's
just<00:04:36.600> gonna<00:04:36.690> be<00:04:36.780> another<00:04:36.870> miss<00:04:37.380> we<00:04:37.680> like

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
just gonna be another miss we like

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.980 
just gonna be another miss we like
mysteries<00:04:38.640> but<00:04:38.880> that's<00:04:39.060> too<00:04:39.270> big<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:39.540> Miss<00:04:39.780> yeah

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
mysteries but that's too big a Miss yeah

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.430 
mysteries but that's too big a Miss yeah
I<00:04:40.020> don't<00:04:40.260> know<00:04:40.470> anything<00:04:41.340> really<00:04:41.970> about

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
I don't know anything really about

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.310 
I don't know anything really about
shadow<00:04:43.440> bonnie<00:04:43.800> at<00:04:44.040> all<00:04:44.630> why<00:04:45.630> does<00:04:45.870> he<00:04:45.960> glitch

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
shadow bonnie at all why does he glitch

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.380 
shadow bonnie at all why does he glitch
through<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.250> mini<00:04:47.490> game<00:04:47.760> for<00:04:48.000> instance

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
through in that mini game for instance

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.260 
through in that mini game for instance
why<00:04:48.630> why<00:04:49.380> does<00:04:49.620> he<00:04:49.770> appear<00:04:50.280> or<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:50.700> often<00:04:51.150> and

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
why why does he appear or so often and

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.450 
why why does he appear or so often and
yet<00:04:51.450> it's<00:04:51.660> not<00:04:52.050> explained<00:04:52.530> so<00:04:52.830> they<00:04:53.310> would

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
yet it's not explained so they would

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.930 
yet it's not explained so they would
make<00:04:53.610> sense<00:04:54.060> for<00:04:54.210> Scott<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.750> tie<00:04:54.900> up<00:04:55.050> as<00:04:55.170> many

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
make sense for Scott to tie up as many

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.850 
make sense for Scott to tie up as many
story-wise<00:04:56.940> loose<00:04:57.570> ends<00:04:57.900> as<00:04:58.050> possible

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
story-wise loose ends as possible

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.340 
story-wise loose ends as possible
there's<00:04:59.220> also<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.610> the<00:05:00.000> big<00:05:00.150> space<00:05:00.510> up<00:05:01.140> in<00:05:01.290> the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
there's also the the big space up in the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.320 
there's also the the big space up in the
right-hand<00:05:01.530> corner<00:05:02.040> of<00:05:02.070> uh<00:05:02.520> yeah<00:05:02.970> this<00:05:03.180> is

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
right-hand corner of uh yeah this is

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.110 
right-hand corner of uh yeah this is
well<00:05:03.600> which<00:05:04.380> could<00:05:04.680> quite<00:05:04.980> easily<00:05:05.010> fit<00:05:05.820> to

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
well which could quite easily fit to

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.150 
well which could quite easily fit to
animatronics<00:05:07.020> if<00:05:07.170> Scott<00:05:07.440> warnings<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.040> we

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
animatronics if Scott warnings and we

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.280 
animatronics if Scott warnings and we
already<00:05:08.310> know<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.820> teeth<00:05:09.060> in<00:05:09.270> one<00:05:09.570> but<00:05:10.200> the

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
already know the teeth in one but the

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.760 
already know the teeth in one but the
way<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.530> reflection<00:05:11.100> is<00:05:11.490> it's<00:05:12.440> basically<00:05:13.440> the

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
way the reflection is it's basically the

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.400 
way the reflection is it's basically the
animatronics<00:05:14.340> standing<00:05:14.790> directly<00:05:15.180> up<00:05:15.780> from

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
animatronics standing directly up from

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.950 
animatronics standing directly up from
the<00:05:16.560> teeth<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.010> so<00:05:17.820> there's<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.150> huge<00:05:18.480> space<00:05:18.750> on

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
the teeth and so there's a huge space on

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.450 
the teeth and so there's a huge space on
the<00:05:19.050> right-hand<00:05:19.350> side<00:05:19.440> for<00:05:19.800> potentially

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
the right-hand side for potentially

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.400 
the right-hand side for potentially
another<00:05:20.730> one<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.150> maybe<00:05:21.300> at<00:05:21.570> some<00:05:21.630> point<00:05:22.050> we

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
another one and maybe at some point we

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.140 
another one and maybe at some point we
will<00:05:22.440> get<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.280> see<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:23.610> it<00:05:23.730> could<00:05:23.850> be<00:05:23.880> shut

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
will get to see that it could be shut

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.790 
will get to see that it could be shut
off<00:05:24.180> freddy<00:05:24.420> and<00:05:24.540> shadow<00:05:24.780> bonnie<00:05:25.020> standing

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
off freddy and shadow bonnie standing

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.240 
off freddy and shadow bonnie standing
side<00:05:26.130> by<00:05:26.160> side<00:05:26.790> once<00:05:27.060> again<00:05:27.330> yes<00:05:27.840> so<00:05:28.350> that's<00:05:29.070> a

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
side by side once again yes so that's a

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.770 
side by side once again yes so that's a
predict<00:05:29.580> that<00:05:29.760> could<00:05:29.910> be<00:05:30.000> a<00:05:30.030> prediction<00:05:30.420> for<00:05:30.690> a

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
predict that could be a prediction for a

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.930 
predict that could be a prediction for a
teaser<00:05:31.050> not<00:05:31.950> only<00:05:32.280> we<00:05:32.400> could<00:05:32.520> predict<00:05:32.850> the

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
teaser not only we could predict the

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.610 
teaser not only we could predict the
teaser<00:05:33.150> that<00:05:33.360> maybe<00:05:33.780> we'll<00:05:34.080> get<00:05:34.230> a<00:05:34.290> close-up

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
teaser that maybe we'll get a close-up

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.980 
teaser that maybe we'll get a close-up
of<00:05:34.980> shadow<00:05:35.280> Freddie<00:05:35.670> and<00:05:36.000> then<00:05:36.450> maybe<00:05:36.810> the

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
of shadow Freddie and then maybe the

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.420 
of shadow Freddie and then maybe the
next<00:05:37.140> teaser<00:05:37.440> after<00:05:37.770> that<00:05:37.920> could<00:05:38.100> be<00:05:38.220> another

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
next teaser after that could be another

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.980 
next teaser after that could be another
hint<00:05:38.700> about<00:05:38.790> shadow<00:05:39.240> bonnie<00:05:39.510> that<00:05:39.810> would<00:05:39.900> be

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
hint about shadow bonnie that would be

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.990 
hint about shadow bonnie that would be
interesting<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:40.920> never<00:05:41.220> seems<00:05:41.820> to<00:05:41.910> be<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.180> very

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
interesting and never seems to be a very

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.820 
interesting and never seems to be a very
it<00:05:45.000> would<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.240> would<00:05:45.450> make<00:05:45.780> sense<00:05:45.810> as<00:05:46.380> well<00:05:46.590> you

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
it would it would make sense as well you

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.790 
it would it would make sense as well you
know<00:05:46.980> it<00:05:47.250> would<00:05:47.460> new<00:05:47.940> be<00:05:48.240> fair<00:05:48.570> because<00:05:49.440> like<00:05:49.770> I

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
know it would new be fair because like I

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.380 
know it would new be fair because like I
said<00:05:50.130> if<00:05:50.280> I<00:05:50.400> not<00:05:50.640> involved<00:05:51.090> nights<00:05:51.300> at

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
said if I not involved nights at

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.330 
said if I not involved nights at
Freddy's<00:05:51.660> 2<00:05:51.780> and<00:05:52.260> there<00:05:52.950> was<00:05:53.070> a<00:05:53.100> lot<00:05:53.310> of

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
Freddy's 2 and there was a lot of

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.760 
Freddy's 2 and there was a lot of
complications<00:05:54.120> we've<00:05:54.510> had<00:05:54.720> any<00:05:54.900> animatronics

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
complications we've had any animatronics

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.970 
complications we've had any animatronics
the<00:05:55.950> were<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:56.960> so<00:05:57.960> I<00:05:58.290> think<00:05:58.560> it<00:05:58.680> would<00:05:58.800> balance

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
the were and so I think it would balance

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.680 
the were and so I think it would balance
the<00:05:59.220> AI<00:05:59.460> think<00:05:59.760> he's<00:06:00.060> got<00:06:00.240> i<00:06:00.390> think<00:06:00.600> scott

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
the AI think he's got i think scott

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.300 
the AI think he's got i think scott
knows<00:06:01.020> what<00:06:01.260> tactics<00:06:01.740> he's<00:06:01.890> going<00:06:02.040> to<00:06:02.100> use

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
knows what tactics he's going to use

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.820 
knows what tactics he's going to use
with<00:06:02.580> these<00:06:02.790> two<00:06:03.210> shallow<00:06:03.930> animatronics<00:06:04.680> as

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
with these two shallow animatronics as

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.270 
with these two shallow animatronics as
well<00:06:05.040> as<00:06:05.220> the--<00:06:05.490> and<00:06:06.350> over<00:06:07.350> over<00:06:07.530> gangs<00:06:07.950> as

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
well as the-- and over over gangs as

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.340 
well as the-- and over over gangs as
well<00:06:08.520> yeah<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.330> nightmare<00:06:09.690> ones<00:06:09.900> yeah<00:06:10.169> well

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
well yeah the nightmare ones yeah well

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.090 
well yeah the nightmare ones yeah well
there's<00:06:10.500> definitely<00:06:10.770> there's<00:06:10.860> definitely

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
there's definitely there's definitely

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.250 
there's definitely there's definitely
room<00:06:11.669> for<00:06:11.700> these<00:06:12.300> animatronics<00:06:12.660> he<00:06:13.020> hasn't

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
room for these animatronics he hasn't

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.690 
room for these animatronics he hasn't
introduced<00:06:13.590> the<00:06:13.740> toys<00:06:13.950> or<00:06:14.310> anything<00:06:14.340> like

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
introduced the toys or anything like

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.150 
introduced the toys or anything like
that<00:06:14.820> so<00:06:15.240> I<00:06:15.419> think<00:06:15.630> we'll<00:06:16.020> be<00:06:16.050> safe<00:06:16.860> with

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
that so I think we'll be safe with

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.710 
that so I think we'll be safe with
saying<00:06:17.430> maybe<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:17.790> shadow<00:06:18.030> animatronics<00:06:18.660> and

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
saying maybe the shadow animatronics and

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720 
saying maybe the shadow animatronics and
the<00:06:18.840> original<00:06:19.020> a<00:06:19.470> nightmare<00:06:19.980> Russians<00:06:20.490> yeah

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
the original a nightmare Russians yeah

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.820 
the original a nightmare Russians yeah
exactly<00:06:20.880> that<00:06:21.360> would<00:06:21.510> that<00:06:21.930> would<00:06:21.990> still<00:06:22.500> it

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
exactly that would that would still it

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.170 
exactly that would that would still it
would<00:06:22.919> explain<00:06:23.160> the<00:06:23.280> story<00:06:23.430> your<00:06:23.910> tie<00:06:24.060> up

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
would explain the story your tie up

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.270 
would explain the story your tie up
loose<00:06:24.210> let<00:06:24.510> loose<00:06:24.840> ends<00:06:25.080> and<00:06:25.380> hopefully<00:06:26.160> we'll

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
loose let loose ends and hopefully we'll

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.550 
loose let loose ends and hopefully we'll
learn<00:06:26.310> about<00:06:26.490> the<00:06:26.880> bite<00:06:27.090> of<00:06:27.169> 87<00:06:28.169> but<00:06:28.320> there<00:06:28.470> we

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
learn about the bite of 87 but there we

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.750 
learn about the bite of 87 but there we
go<00:06:28.680> guys<00:06:28.890> let<00:06:29.160> us<00:06:29.220> know<00:06:29.340> what<00:06:29.460> you<00:06:29.520> think<00:06:29.669> down

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
go guys let us know what you think down

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.010 
go guys let us know what you think down
in<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.000> comments<00:06:30.330> section<00:06:30.360> below<00:06:30.660> do<00:06:30.930> you

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
in the comments section below do you

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.310 
in the comments section below do you
think<00:06:31.320> this<00:06:31.710> bowtie<00:06:32.340> potentially<00:06:33.140> alludes<00:06:34.140> to

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
think this bowtie potentially alludes to

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.500 
think this bowtie potentially alludes to
shadow<00:06:34.830> bonnie<00:06:35.130> or<00:06:35.340> perhaps<00:06:35.880> it's<00:06:36.180> just<00:06:36.300> as

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
shadow bonnie or perhaps it's just as

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.850 
shadow bonnie or perhaps it's just as
all<00:06:36.900> shadow<00:06:37.470> Freddy's<00:06:37.860> but<00:06:38.130> let<00:06:38.580> us<00:06:38.610> know

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
all shadow Freddy's but let us know

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.320 
all shadow Freddy's but let us know
down<00:06:39.280> in<00:06:39.370> the<00:06:39.430> conversation<00:06:39.939> below<00:06:40.060> your

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
down in the conversation below your

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.209 
down in the conversation below your
thoughts<00:06:40.599> and<00:06:40.810> theories<00:06:41.349> it<00:06:41.710> really<00:06:42.039> really

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:42.219 
thoughts and theories it really really

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:44.730 
thoughts and theories it really really
is<00:06:42.280> appreciate<00:06:42.789> ya<00:06:43.629> let<00:06:44.080> us<00:06:44.169> know<00:06:44.319> if<00:06:44.439> you<00:06:44.590> do

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
is appreciate ya let us know if you do

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.230 
is appreciate ya let us know if you do
think<00:06:45.099> shadow<00:06:45.370> bonnie<00:06:45.639> is<00:06:45.789> going<00:06:45.969> to<00:06:46.060> make<00:06:46.210> a

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
think shadow bonnie is going to make a

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.300 
think shadow bonnie is going to make a
return<00:06:46.689> as<00:06:46.960> well<00:06:47.199> and<00:06:47.439> even<00:06:47.860> if<00:06:48.069> it's<00:06:48.189> got

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
return as well and even if it's got

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.649 
return as well and even if it's got
nothing<00:06:48.550> to<00:06:48.580> do<00:06:48.729> with<00:06:48.849> the<00:06:48.909> bowtie<00:06:49.300> we<00:06:49.479> just

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 
nothing to do with the bowtie we just
