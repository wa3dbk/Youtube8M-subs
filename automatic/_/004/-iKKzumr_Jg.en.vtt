00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello to all friends of experience but go 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.130
 always the presentation of lg gicoate e 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.740
 right now we are comparing 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.599
 on the lgg 3 processor now that there is 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.370
 monster on the back 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.040
 we immediately see the excused differences 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.440
 which blocks them both 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.439
 then as you see in this case 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.380
 exchanging the black leather version with 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.359
 six colors for ig 43 in leather with 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.840
 various colors and three in polycarbonate with 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.310
 metallic effect like the g3 like 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.349
 dimensions I must say that there is not one 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.770
 great difference on average the g4 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.540
 if it is still a little stretched to the level 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.670
 width here an extra millimeter 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.680
 for ig quato therefore as dimensions not 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.570
 holy display has remained the same e 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.210
 on average they have increased this is not 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.640
 maybe I expected a positive thing 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.649
 this is practically the same phone 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.079
 it is also due to the fact that the g4 has a 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.160
 not slightly curved display now 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.680
 I know if you can see very well 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.300
 because the light is what it is but it is there 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.379
 a slight curve we are not at 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.609
 g2 flex levels triple the two though 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.439
 they almost assured that it is there anyway 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.060
 a more mature of all is the radius of 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.380
 warp and three meters that makes the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.420
 difference also in that case of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.729
 call etc. and so on 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.439
 both have removable batteries also 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.000
 of 43 thousand milan fair 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.220
 what has changed of the processors that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.290
 goes from a slogan 800 1 to 1 st blanco 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.939
 808 the 230 watt low GP n 418 2 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.890
 gigabytes of ram in addition to school 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.750
 depression against 3 gigabytes per 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.780
 all the only version that second from 2 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.229
 gigabytes of expandable memory for the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.220
 g4 sorry changed interface is 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.869
 relatively changed now not 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.630
 I will lose time climbed the small hill 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.130
 differences because there are certainly a few 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.649
 from an interface point of view, let me know 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.299
 say what you change the camera 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.170
 undoubtedly sorry we also have here 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.240
 added call now here it is 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.090
 opening you saw faster on g 4 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.009
 and opening 0 6 seconds on what g 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.360
 just interface slightly 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.950
 drawn as you see 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.049
 but what has changed and this too 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.620
 or the possibility of putting them all 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.540
 manuals and you can select 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.360
 and we have the shutter speed available 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.540
 rice is the opening of the diaphragm and so on 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.740
 etc. diaphragmata after arrives af 18 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:17.440
 against f24 of the dl therefore surely 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.630
 brighter photos for the g4 than between 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.240
 the other on the back also a 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.750
 sensor that detects the color spectrum 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.560
 to make the photos then more current more 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.050
 also defined among other things also display 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.670
 year or both are 5.5 inches hd 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.070
 therefore we have the same definition 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.440
 different technology or when 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.690
 mi ps classic account an eps as in 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.340
 this causes the brightness to be a 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.380
 good 30 doing higher and this yes 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.990
 immediately sees something far away b brightness at 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.240
 maximum is something else 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.700
 once more a lg technology before 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.920
 bike technology in principle therefore 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.480
 this causes the color range to 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.120
 20 percent higher than that 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.280
 of the classics of ps this I must say that 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.050
 I have not had a good time in the past 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.330
 this smartphone is adoc hand and tested 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.980
 there is a dinner of images in comparison 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.340
 and actually you see this 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.380
 this superior color range 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.720
 compared to the classic ips with a page 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.820
 arg b for this comparison is all if 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.270
 sell know when I saw the rays 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.650
 40 I immediately say 699 euros in June and I have to 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.280
 say that at a price the only pirates 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.900
 top of the range 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.489
 but at least this year before on one 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.770
 basic version against the giants a 2 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.590
 expandable memory so for this 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.820
 short video for comparison is all if 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.500
 he sees particular questions as always 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.420
 fatemeh in the comments left quite a 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.070
 video we were the next videos a 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.070
