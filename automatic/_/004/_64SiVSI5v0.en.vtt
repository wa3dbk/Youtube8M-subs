00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.069
 fast 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.010
 the site no one claims that the 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.410
 suppliers of apple screens will 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.410

 iphone 6 and will have versions with screen 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.650
 4.7 in 5.5 inches was also revealed 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.000
 that manufacturers have already begun to 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.640
 production of print readers 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.310
 digital and chip for crystal displays 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.840
 remembering that these are the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.790
 rumors there is no official word 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.430
 about apple 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.590
 and talking about rumors a new motorola 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.840
 droid can be released later this year 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.510
 this information was revealed by the site 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.030
 It was the arena that says that motorola must 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.220
 use of new generation materials in the 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.340
 composition of this device and also says 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.470
 that the screen should be larger than the 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.810
 total device size 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.940
 this means that the motorola can or 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.610
 increase the overall screen size or 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.420
 reduce the size of the side edges of the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.030
 appliance 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.820
 most likely you know the role 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.230
 the most famous wall of windows xp that 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.140
 this is it 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.750
 what few know is that the photographer who 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.329

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.250
 I knew she would be so popular. 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.450
 he would have made a better contract with 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.280
 microsoft 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.950
 charles or go is the name of this photographer 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.660
 he says he might have lost some 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.989
 cents for each time the picture 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.840
 for example and look at it if it 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.090
 I would have asked for a penny for each copy 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.870
 of windows xp sold he would have profited 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.760
