Hello there Unboxers! This is Sakis Karpas, your usual host. Today I will present you the IPS LED LCD Monitor by LG.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is the 237L model equipped with IPS technology.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:49.000
IPS technology features consistency and less changes in color temperature while offering a color impression identical to that of the original image.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.400
Moreover, this monitor has the benefits of several other features like Mobile HD Link

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.500
which allows you to connect and watch HD content from your phone with a micro HDMI cable

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.000
LG’s exclusive True Color Finder for conducting hardware calibration.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.200
and of course Super Energy Saving Mode.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.100
All these are great but the true beauty is hidden inside. So, let's open the package!

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.000
First up is the monitor itself.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.600
We'll take a closer look later on.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.000
Inside we find a power cable

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.350
a micro HDMI Cable

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.750
a VGA cable

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.500
a manual and a CD with the required software

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.000
and lastly, two parts for the TV Stand.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.350
Carefully, we take off the protective cover and we take a closer look at this light monitor.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.200
It only weighs 2.5kg without the TV Stand.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.700
The panel has a matte and anti-reflective design

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.250
while the back side is covered by glossy plastics.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.000
The TV stand requires assemblage but the procedure is quite easy and fast.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.100
You will only need a screwdriver for placing the monitor into the TV stand.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.250
On the back side, aside from the power input, there are two HDMI entries.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.000
One of them has been loaded with Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) support.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:27.800
A D-Sub input and an audio output follow up. The latter one can out an audio signal inputted via one of the HDMI connections.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.000
Let's have a more detailed look at the specifications of this monitor.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.250
First of all, the panel type is LED and the screen size is 23 inches (58cm).

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.150
Resolution: Full HD 1920X1080

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.010
Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (Widescreen)

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.900
Response Time: 14ms

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.000
Response Time (GTG): 5ms

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.860
Color Depth (Number of colors): 16.7M

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.700
Contrast Ratio: 1000:1

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.000
Aside from being a lightweight monitor, it is an elegant one too with only 15mm thickness.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.300
Of course, you can change the angle of your screen for a perfect presentation.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.300
Changes to settings can be applied through touch controls on the lower right corner of the monitor.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.350
After testing the LG IPS237L Monitor, our overall impressions are excellent.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.700
The overall screen and color quality is top notch

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.000
while the black level performance and the application of the monitor in videogames and movies returns a highly satisfactory result.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.600
An important aspect of the overall user experience is the panel position, that feels like it protrudes from the monitor.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.700
Our only complaint is that the viewing angle could have been a lot wider.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.000
LG IPS237L is priced at €200.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
A great monitor that is intended for both demanding users and those who would like a top tier monitor that they can afford.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:17.250
Our upcoming giveaway is about two LG IPS237L monitors. So, stay tuned to Unboxholics YouTube Channel and of course on GameOver.gr!
