which I really like this little man card

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.270 
which I really like this little man card
but<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:51.960> can<00:03:52.080> put<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.320> mine<00:03:52.650> cart<00:03:52.920> right

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
but you can put that mine cart right

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.340 
but you can put that mine cart right
here<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.330> can<00:03:54.420> make<00:03:54.600> stuff<00:03:54.810> drop<00:03:55.140> from

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
here and you can make stuff drop from

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.260 
here and you can make stuff drop from
the<00:03:55.410> top<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.920> go<00:03:56.370> into<00:03:56.610> slide<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.180> will

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
the top and go into slide and it will

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.480 
the top and go into slide and it will
fly<00:03:57.600> down<00:03:57.630> into<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.290> mine<00:03:58.440> cart<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.220> guess

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
fly down into the mine cart so I guess

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.890 
fly down into the mine cart so I guess
we'll<00:03:59.730> use<00:03:59.880> this<00:03:59.970> little<00:04:00.120> barrel<00:04:00.510> piece<00:04:00.690> right

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
while because you have to put each

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.110 
while because you have to put each
little<00:05:04.860> rock<00:05:05.100> beats<00:05:05.340> exactly<00:05:05.850> where<00:05:06.000> it's

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
little rock beats exactly where it's

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.909 
little rock beats exactly where it's
supposed<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.510> be<00:05:06.570> which<00:05:07.200> gets<00:05:07.410> tiring<00:05:07.620> after<00:05:07.710> a

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
supposed to be which gets tiring after a

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.170 
supposed to be which gets tiring after a
while<00:05:07.979> I'm<00:05:08.250> pretty<00:05:08.460> sure<00:05:08.610> I<00:05:08.700> probably<00:05:08.940> didn't

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
while I'm pretty sure I probably didn't

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.129 
while I'm pretty sure I probably didn't
get<00:05:09.270> all<00:05:09.389> of<00:05:09.419> them<00:05:09.600> right<00:05:09.630> which<00:05:09.870> is<00:05:09.900> pretty

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
get all of them right which is pretty

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.840 
get all of them right which is pretty
crazy<00:05:10.350> but<00:05:10.560> it's<00:05:10.770> still<00:05:10.919> really<00:05:10.979> cool<00:05:11.370> all<00:05:11.639> my

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
crazy but it's still really cool all my

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.460 
crazy but it's still really cool all my
biggest<00:05:12.180> complaint<00:05:12.570> is<00:05:12.630> how<00:05:12.810> barren<00:05:13.229> it<00:05:13.350> is

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
biggest complaint is how barren it is

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.440 
biggest complaint is how barren it is
right<00:05:13.770> here<00:05:14.190> I<00:05:14.310> mean<00:05:14.490> you<00:05:15.000> can<00:05:15.090> look<00:05:15.270> at<00:05:15.360> the

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
right here I mean you can look at the

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.480 
right here I mean you can look at the
mine<00:05:15.660> it's<00:05:16.020> just<00:05:16.290> there's<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.740> whole<00:05:17.010> chunk<00:05:17.280> of

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
mine it's just there's a whole chunk of

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.890 
mine it's just there's a whole chunk of
this<00:05:17.639> that's<00:05:17.820> missing<00:05:18.330> over<00:05:18.570> there<00:05:18.690> it's<00:05:18.840> very

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
this that's missing over there it's very

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.450 
this that's missing over there it's very
complete<00:05:19.500> but<00:05:19.680> over<00:05:19.889> here<00:05:20.040> I<00:05:20.070> felt<00:05:20.190> they<00:05:20.340> could

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
complete but over here I felt they could

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.440 
complete but over here I felt they could
have<00:05:20.550> put<00:05:20.669> a<00:05:20.700> little<00:05:20.850> bit<00:05:21.000> more<00:05:21.150> rock

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
have put a little bit more rock

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.490 
have put a little bit more rock
structure<00:05:21.870> which<00:05:21.990> would<00:05:22.110> have<00:05:22.200> been<00:05:22.260> nice

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
structure which would have been nice

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.780 
structure which would have been nice
there<00:05:23.010> probably<00:05:23.190> would<00:05:23.370> have<00:05:23.430> raised<00:05:23.639> the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
there probably would have raised the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.129 
there probably would have raised the
price<00:05:24.000> which<00:05:24.180> would<00:05:24.330> have<00:05:24.389> been<00:05:24.450> unfortunate

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
price which would have been unfortunate

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.780 
price which would have been unfortunate
but<00:05:25.440> down<00:05:25.650> here<00:05:25.889> you<00:05:25.950> can<00:05:26.070> see<00:05:26.190> even<00:05:26.370> more

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
but down here you can see even more

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.520 
but down here you can see even more
silver<00:05:27.180> pieces<00:05:27.419> and<00:05:27.690> there's<00:05:27.810> more<00:05:28.020> up<00:05:28.260> here

featuring no exploding features are

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.180 
featuring no exploding features are
pretty<00:05:49.289> common<00:05:49.530> but<00:05:49.770> this<00:05:49.890> one<00:05:50.070> is<00:05:50.160> really

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
pretty common but this one is really

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.460 
pretty common but this one is really
ingeniously<00:05:50.940> designed<00:05:51.110> actually<00:05:52.110> you<00:05:52.200> have

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
to use the stick of dynamite to activate

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.219 
to use the stick of dynamite to activate
this<00:05:54.300> feature<00:05:54.450> which<00:05:54.720> is<00:05:54.780> really<00:05:55.050> fantastic

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
this feature which is really fantastic

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.750 
this feature which is really fantastic
so<00:05:55.770> if<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:55.919> put<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.160> stick<00:05:56.250> of<00:05:56.370> dynamite<00:05:56.460> in

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
so if you put the stick of dynamite in

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.670 
so if you put the stick of dynamite in
right<00:05:56.940> there<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:57.600> you<00:05:57.690> push<00:05:57.930> on<00:05:58.050> this<00:05:58.229> it

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
right there and you push on this it

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.140 
right there and you push on this it
actually<00:05:58.860> pushes<00:05:59.280> up<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.550> ticket<00:05:59.850> dynamite

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
actually pushes up the ticket dynamite

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.000 
actually pushes up the ticket dynamite
which<00:06:00.270> crosses<00:06:00.539> this<00:06:01.139> little<00:06:01.500> rock<00:06:01.650> piece<00:06:01.889> to

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
which crosses this little rock piece to

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.320 
which crosses this little rock piece to
go<00:06:02.100> pushed<00:06:02.370> up<00:06:02.520> so<00:06:02.550> it's<00:06:02.789> really<00:06:03.030> cool<00:06:03.270> that

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330
