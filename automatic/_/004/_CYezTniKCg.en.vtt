00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the Scotch quick dry adhesive glue I'm

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.330 
the Scotch quick dry adhesive glue I'm
just<00:01:05.970> kind<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.180> dotting<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.780> there<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
just kind of dotting it on there and I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.530 
just kind of dotting it on there and I
wanted<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> try<00:01:08.909> something<00:01:08.939> different<00:01:09.330> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
wanted to try something different this

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
wanted to try something different this
time<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.080> don't<00:01:10.290> usually<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> light<00:01:11.369> color<00:01:11.610> on

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
time I don't usually do a light color on

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.700 
time I don't usually do a light color on
a<00:01:11.880> dark<00:01:12.150> quite<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> thought

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
a dark quite like this but I thought

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
a dark quite like this but I thought
that<00:01:13.890> would<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.070> kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:15.090> different<00:01:15.930> twist

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that would be kind of a different twist

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.340 
that would be kind of a different twist
to<00:01:16.830> do<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.430> also<00:01:17.909> flipped<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.689> reindeer<00:01:19.110> when<00:01:19.320> I

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to do I also flipped the reindeer when I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.160 
to do I also flipped the reindeer when I
cut<00:01:19.619> him<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.090> he<00:01:21.090> normally<00:01:21.450> faces<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> other

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
cut him so he normally faces the other

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.440 
cut him so he normally faces the other
way<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:23.340> don't<00:01:23.729> even<00:01:23.909> remember<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.330> my

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
way I don't even remember what my

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.320 
way I don't even remember what my
thinking<00:01:24.810> was<00:01:24.900> about<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.939> but<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.119> some

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
thinking was about that but for some

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.969 
thinking was about that but for some
reason<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.810> notion<00:01:27.990> appealed<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> me<00:01:28.650> so

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
reason that notion appealed to me so

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.160 
now doesn't it the bag measures about
five<00:01:59.549> by<00:01:59.850> eight<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.479> little<00:02:00.689> mini<00:02:00.840> bag

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
five by eight so it's a little mini bag

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.749 
five by eight so it's a little mini bag
and<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.829> thought<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.130> would<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> fun<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
and I thought it would be kind of fun to

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.270 
and I thought it would be kind of fun to
put<00:02:03.149> teacher<00:02:03.570> gifts<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.409> we're<00:02:04.950> getting<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
put teacher gifts in as we're getting to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.310 
put teacher gifts in as we're getting to
that<00:02:05.399> time<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.759> year<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.210> went<00:02:06.869> ahead<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.140> used

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
that time of year I went ahead and used

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.210 
that time of year I went ahead and used
a<00:02:08.959> scallop<00:02:09.959> punch<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.410> i<00:02:10.470> want<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.770> say<00:02:10.979> that's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
a scallop punch and i want to say that's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.550 
a scallop punch and i want to say that's
like<00:02:11.459> mmm<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.080> hat

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
like mmm one and a hat

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
like mmm one and a hat
it's<00:02:13.739> going<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.010> bigger<00:02:14.190> than<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.550> I

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
it's going to be bigger than that I

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.750 
it's going to be bigger than that I
think<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.440> boy<00:02:16.440> one<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.800> five<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.370> sore

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
think it's like boy one in five a sore

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.339 
think it's like boy one in five a sore
too<00:02:19.069> that's<00:02:20.069> not<00:02:20.310> super<00:02:20.580> big<00:02:20.910> but<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.390> thought

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
too that's not super big but I thought

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.839 
too that's not super big but I thought
the<00:02:22.470> scalp<00:02:22.739> punch<00:02:22.980> would<00:02:23.099> be<00:02:23.220> fast<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.640> easy

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
the scalp punch would be fast and easy

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.640 
the scalp punch would be fast and easy

kind of cute and then I start saying
well<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.400> wonder<00:03:38.819> what<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.060> would<00:03:39.150> look<00:03:39.239> like<00:03:39.299> if

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
well I wonder what it would look like if

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.550 
well I wonder what it would look like if
I<00:03:39.720> stamped<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:40.380> slate<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.670> you'll<00:03:42.319> just<00:03:43.319> a

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
I stamped it in slate so you'll just a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.099 
I stamped it in slate so you'll just a
little<00:03:43.829> couple<00:03:44.459> iterations<00:03:44.639> here<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.540> maybe

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
little couple iterations here so maybe

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.110 
little couple iterations here so maybe
if<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.620> feel<00:03:46.799> like<00:03:46.829> weighing<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.519> on<00:03:47.639> you

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
if you feel like weighing in on you

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.240 
if you feel like weighing in on you
liked<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.660> slate<00:03:48.930> better<00:03:49.260> than<00:03:49.530> which<00:03:50.100> is

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
liked the slate better than which is

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.370 
liked the slate better than which is
this<00:03:50.400> sort<00:03:50.609> of<00:03:50.670> dark<00:03:51.450> grey<00:03:51.660> or<00:03:51.900> do<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.170> like

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380

the<00:03:52.620> red<00:03:52.769> better<00:03:53.030> now<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.060> sneak<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.900> also

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
the red better now I sneak and I also

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.770 
the red better now I sneak and I also
back<00:03:55.560> this<00:03:55.829> slate<00:03:56.190> with<00:03:56.459> you'll<00:03:57.420> see<00:03:57.630> in<00:03:57.690> a

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
back this slate with you'll see in a

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.870 
back this slate with you'll see in a
minute<00:03:57.870> I'm<00:03:58.109> going<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.290> back<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.739> with<00:03:58.950> another

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
minute I'm going to back it with another

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.319 
minute I'm going to back it with another
layer<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.690> red<00:04:01.590> that's<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.190> little<00:04:02.519> bit<00:04:02.790> larger

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
layer of red that's a little bit larger

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.539 
layer of red that's a little bit larger
so<00:04:03.870> first<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.769> was<00:04:04.889> trying<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.160> see<00:04:05.280> well<00:04:05.430> how

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
so first I was trying to see well how

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.930 
so first I was trying to see well how
would<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.880> look<00:04:05.940> if<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.389> did<00:04:06.569> that<00:04:06.600> oh<00:04:07.549> I<00:04:08.549> don't

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
would that look if I did that oh I don't

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.009 
would that look if I did that oh I don't
like<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:11.480> don't<00:04:12.480> know<00:04:12.540> why<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.900> I

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
like that I don't know why is that I

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.229 
like that I don't know why is that I
didn't<00:04:13.290> like<00:04:13.440> that<00:04:13.560> oh<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.709> do<00:04:13.910> because<00:04:14.910> the

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
didn't like that oh I do because the

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.349 
didn't like that oh I do because the
edges<00:04:15.720> it's<00:04:16.440> like<00:04:16.709> white<00:04:17.010> on<00:04:17.220> white<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:18.209> then

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
edges it's like white on white and then

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.779 
edges it's like white on white and then
I<00:04:18.389> put<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.780> on<00:04:18.840> red<00:04:19.139> and<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.459> kind<00:04:20.489> of

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
I put it on red and so that kind of

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.839 
I put it on red and so that kind of
blurs<00:04:21.150> if<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:21.840> were<00:04:22.019> on<00:04:22.260> not<00:04:23.010> exactly<00:04:23.460> even

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
blurs if you were on not exactly even

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.969 
blurs if you were on not exactly even
stamping<00:04:24.450> it<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.810> kind<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.080> eliminates<00:04:25.860> that

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
stamping it that kind of eliminates that

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.270 
stamping it that kind of eliminates that
problem

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
problem

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.850 
problem
it's<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:27.820> closed<00:04:28.210> cut<00:04:28.570> it's<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.930> closed<00:04:29.139> stamp<00:04:29.470> so

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
it's a closed cut it's a closed stamp so

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.730 
it's a closed cut it's a closed stamp so
that<00:04:30.610> was<00:04:30.730> my<00:04:30.760> wiggle<00:04:31.270> way<00:04:31.389> around<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.930> all

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
that was my wiggle way around it all

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.879 
that was my wiggle way around it all
right<00:04:32.980> enough<00:04:33.070> about<00:04:33.310> that<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:34.139> finally<00:04:35.139> I<00:04:35.650> get

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
right enough about that so finally I get

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.520 
right enough about that so finally I get
out<00:04:36.190> this<00:04:36.430> red<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.510> white<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:37.960> sparkly

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.020 
bag just go ahead and tie that on and
this<00:04:47.290> is<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:47.980> I<00:04:48.010> called<00:04:48.220> it<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.460> 7-minute

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
this is it and I called it the 7-minute

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.000 
this is it and I called it the 7-minute
bag<00:04:49.180> this<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.050> five<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.650> half<00:04:50.710> minute

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
bag this is a five and a half minute

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.500 
bag this is a five and a half minute
video<00:04:51.250> but<00:04:51.460> their<00:04:51.580> stuff<00:04:51.820> at<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.030> end<00:04:52.180> and

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
video but their stuff at the end and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.850 
video but their stuff at the end and
well<00:04:52.930> then<00:04:53.139> there<00:04:53.260> was<00:04:53.380> that<00:04:53.410> going<00:04:53.770> around

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
well then there was that going around

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.040 
well then there was that going around
about<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.310> stamp<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.210> I'm<00:04:55.570> figuring<00:04:55.900> by<00:04:55.960> the

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
about the stamp and I'm figuring by the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.170 
about the stamp and I'm figuring by the
time<00:04:56.230> you<00:04:56.320> cut<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.560> stuff<00:04:56.770> out<00:04:56.980> and<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:58.030> make

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
time you cut the stuff out and you make

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.760 
time you cut the stuff out and you make
the<00:04:58.300> bag<00:04:58.480> it's<00:04:58.780> probably<00:04:59.169> about<00:04:59.410> seven

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
the bag it's probably about seven

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.890 
the bag it's probably about seven
minutes<00:04:59.950> I<00:05:00.220> hope<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.669> enjoy<00:05:00.970> this<00:05:01.240> coming<00:05:01.780> up
