can see the little earth right there any
kind<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> major<00:01:34.920> solar<00:01:35.729> eruption<00:01:36.420> near<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
kind of major solar eruption near that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.630 
kind of major solar eruption near that
and<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.409> will<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> particle<00:01:38.189> event

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
and we will have a particle event

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.580 
and we will have a particle event
however<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.570> doesn't<00:01:39.750> really<00:01:40.049> look<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.290> it's

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
however it doesn't really look like it's

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
however it doesn't really look like it's
very<00:01:40.710> likely<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.430> major<00:01:41.640> solar<00:01:41.970> active

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
very likely the major solar active

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.330 
very likely the major solar active
regions<00:01:42.659> are<00:01:42.810> significantly<00:01:43.770> north<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
regions are significantly north of it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.550 
regions are significantly north of it
there<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> coronal<00:01:45.600> hole<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.110> left<00:01:46.409> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
there is a coronal hole to the left of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590 
there is a coronal hole to the left of
it<00:01:46.710> that's<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.189> dark<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.149> now

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it that's the dark thing right there now

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.480 
it that's the dark thing right there now
if<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.259> magnetic<00:01:49.710> filament<00:01:50.280> were<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
if this little magnetic filament were to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.429 
if this little magnetic filament were to
rip<00:01:50.640> off<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.360> would<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.810> an<00:01:51.899> earth<00:01:52.020> facing

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
rip off it would be in an earth facing

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.080 
rip off it would be in an earth facing
position<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.979> will<00:01:53.040> probably<00:01:53.399> accelerate

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
position and will probably accelerate

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.179 
position and will probably accelerate
protons<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.689> electrons<00:01:54.720> toward<00:01:55.409> Earth<00:01:55.560> but

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
protons and electrons toward Earth but

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.499 
protons and electrons toward Earth but
other<00:01:56.340> than<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.520> folks<00:01:56.850> we've<00:01:57.060> got<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> few

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
other than that folks we've got a few

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.480 
other than that folks we've got a few
filaments<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.200> few<00:01:58.590> active<00:01:58.920> regions<00:01:59.219> none<00:01:59.369> of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
filaments a few active regions none of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.980 
filaments a few active regions none of
them<00:01:59.579> look<00:01:59.729> too<00:01:59.880> bad<00:02:00.060> that's<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> news<00:02:00.750> folks

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
them look too bad that's the news folks

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.530 
them look too bad that's the news folks
be<00:02:01.320> safe
