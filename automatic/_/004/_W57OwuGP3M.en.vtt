my phone let's just go ahead and get

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.099 
my phone let's just go ahead and get
into<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:21.930> one<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.320> when<00:00:22.650> our<00:00:23.039> tests<00:00:23.880> and

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
into it first one is when our tests and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.540 
into it first one is when our tests and
obviously<00:00:25.109> nobody<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.740> likes<00:00:25.859> testing

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
obviously nobody really likes testing

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.450 
obviously nobody really likes testing
but<00:00:26.939> right<00:00:27.689> before<00:00:27.869> break<00:00:28.320> i<00:00:28.590> think<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.690 
all plan to give you tests on the same
day<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.890> fail<00:00:35.130> all<00:00:35.340> those<00:00:35.489> tests

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
day so that if you fail all those tests

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
day so that if you fail all those tests
before<00:00:35.850> break<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.780> screwed<00:00:36.960> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
have a class to go to the next one is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.450 
have a class to go to the next one is
just<00:01:16.740> math<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.909> general<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:19.040> don't<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.310> I'm

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
just math in general I don't think I'm

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.420 
just math in general I don't think I'm
ever<00:01:20.580> gonna<00:01:20.820> use<00:01:21.180> X<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:22.590> oh<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> don't<00:01:23.340> even

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
ever gonna use X like oh my I don't even

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.460 
ever gonna use X like oh my I don't even
wanna<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.729> into<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.720> don't<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.290> I'm

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
wanna get into it I don't think I'm

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.380 
wanna get into it I don't think I'm
gonna<00:01:25.590> ever<00:01:25.920> use<00:01:26.280> any<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.610> these<00:01:26.759> formulas<00:01:27.240> in

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
gonna ever use any of these formulas in

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.690 
gonna ever use any of these formulas in
real<00:01:27.540> life<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.869> maybe<00:01:28.110> maybe<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.549> I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
real life and maybe maybe like if I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.859 
real life and maybe maybe like if I
become<00:01:30.060> an<00:01:30.530> engineer<00:01:31.530> or<00:01:32.750> something<00:01:33.750> like

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
become an engineer or something like

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.810 
become an engineer or something like
that<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.560> what<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:34.920> aren't<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.610> do

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that but what if we aren't going to do

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.840 
that but what if we aren't going to do
that<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.630> don't<00:01:36.689> need<00:01:36.990> trig<00:01:37.560> in

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
that then I don't need trig in

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.210 
that then I don't need trig in
precalculus<00:01:38.850> math<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.320> problem<00:01:41.040> in

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
precalculus math is just a problem in

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
precalculus math is just a problem in
itself<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.970> you're<00:01:42.119> working<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.930> homework

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
itself when you're working on homework
