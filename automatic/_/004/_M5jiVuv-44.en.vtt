I'm using a matte black shadow and a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.420 
I'm using a matte black shadow and a
smaller<00:02:22.850> brush<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.930> define<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.650> corners<00:02:25.130> of

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
smaller brush to define the corners of

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.890 
smaller brush to define the corners of
the<00:02:25.550> lids<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.910> little<00:02:29.150> bit<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.690> shadow

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
the lids so a little bit of the shadow

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.170 
the lids so a little bit of the shadow
goes<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> long<00:02:30.590> way<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.190> I'm<00:02:31.520> really<00:02:31.970> just

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
goes a long way so I'm really just

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.360 
goes a long way so I'm really just
carefully<00:02:32.780> kind<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.140> dabbing<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.130> on<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
carefully kind of dabbing it on the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.940 
carefully kind of dabbing it on the
outsides<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.120> lids<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.720> then<00:02:36.290> spreading

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
outsides of the lids and then spreading

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:46.850 
outsides of the lids and then spreading
it<00:02:37.130> upward<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.180> blends

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.710 

and<00:02:47.860> then<00:02:48.040> I'm<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.190> really<00:02:48.910> trying<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.420> make

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
and then I'm just really trying to make

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.660 
and then I'm just really trying to make
it<00:02:49.900> smooth<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.560> I'm<00:02:50.680> taking<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.160> brush<00:02:51.400> with

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670

it'll<00:02:52.090> almost<00:02:52.240> has<00:02:52.540> no<00:02:52.570> product<00:02:53.260> on<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.590> and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
it'll almost has no product on it and

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.880 
it'll almost has no product on it and
just<00:02:53.950> spreading<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.520> out<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:55.740> then<00:02:56.740> I'm<00:02:56.860> just

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
just spreading it out and then I'm just
