I<00:00:14.700> got<00:00:14.910> planned<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:16.520> taking<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.580> take<00:00:17.850> around

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
I got planned and taking a take around

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.929 
I got planned and taking a take around
so<00:00:18.770> start<00:00:19.770> with<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> main<00:00:20.130> entranceway<00:00:20.550> here

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
so start with the main entranceway here

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.929 
so start with the main entranceway here
this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> cool<00:00:22.410> little<00:00:22.500> design<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.220> came<00:00:23.580> up

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
this is a cool little design I came up

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.170 
this is a cool little design I came up
with<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> fly<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:26.970> just

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
with on the fly and I think it just

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.050 
with on the fly and I think it just
looks<00:00:27.240> really<00:00:27.660> awesome<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:29.250> team<00:00:29.460> colors<00:00:29.880> are

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
looks really awesome the team colors are

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.780 
looks really awesome the team colors are
obviously<00:00:30.599> red<00:00:31.230> black<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.130> white<00:00:34.610> more<00:00:35.610> so

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
obviously red black and white more so

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.619 
obviously red black and white more so
based<00:00:36.030> off<00:00:36.239> my<00:00:36.660> favorite<00:00:37.500> NBA<00:00:38.370> team<00:00:41.629> we'll

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
start with the underneath part because

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.110 
start with the underneath part because
it's<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.719> most<00:00:45.899> boring<00:00:46.170> right<00:00:46.500> now<00:00:47.120> basically

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
or an elevator but you know

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.940 
or an elevator but you know
so<00:02:14.210> that<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.570> up<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.110> second<00:02:15.410> floor

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
so that it up to the second floor

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.800 
so that it up to the second floor
this<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.400> probably<00:02:16.580> what<00:02:16.760> I'll<00:02:16.850> finish<00:02:17.150> next

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
this is probably what I'll finish next

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.990 
this is probably what I'll finish next
working<00:02:18.140> on<00:02:18.320> this<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:19.190> then<00:02:19.370> just<00:02:19.400> duplicate

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
working on this and then just duplicate

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.810 
working on this and then just duplicate
it<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.300> other<00:02:20.420> side<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:22.400> got<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.610> little

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
it to the other side you got a little

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.880 
it to the other side you got a little
archway<00:02:23.240> here<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.750> walk<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.470> got<00:02:24.620> all

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
archway here to walk in and you got all

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.880 
archway here to walk in and you got all
these<00:02:25.300> nosebleed<00:02:26.300> seats<00:02:27.130> um

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
um I think goes good with the design the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.010 
um I think goes good with the design the
overall<00:02:37.790> look<00:02:38.120> at<00:02:38.300> my<00:02:38.390> team<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.810> everything

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
and I just like the way it looks um

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.890 
and I just like the way it looks um

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
for that right now I mean it's kind of

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
finger it's just kind of like a lounge

label them and stuff and I'm trying to

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.750 
label them and stuff and I'm trying to
determine<00:03:29.209> if<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:29.780> should<00:03:29.959> keep<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.380> walls

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
determine if I should keep the walls

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.810 
determine if I should keep the walls
stone<00:03:31.760> brick<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.270> I<00:03:32.330> kind<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.570> like<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:33.820> mm

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
stone brick so I kind of like that mm

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.870 
stone brick so I kind of like that mm
this<00:03:35.540> was<00:03:36.020> going<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.200> be<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.380> bathroom<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.190> put

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
this was going to be a bathroom I put

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.880 
this was going to be a bathroom I put
tinted<00:03:38.180> glass<00:03:38.390> in<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.810> can<00:03:39.650> see<00:03:39.830> this

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
tinted glass in so you can see this

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.640 
tinted glass in so you can see this
through<00:03:40.130> but<00:03:40.610> it's<00:03:40.760> just<00:03:41.000> not<00:03:41.300> big<00:03:41.720> enough<00:03:41.780> so

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
through but it's just not big enough so

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.130 
through but it's just not big enough so
I<00:03:42.680> guess<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:43.220> might<00:03:43.880> make<00:03:44.030> it<00:03:44.060> into<00:03:44.180> like<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> test

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
I guess I might make it into like a test

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.710 
I guess I might make it into like a test
area<00:03:45.380> test<00:03:46.190> if<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.459> liked<00:03:46.640> our<00:03:46.760> skybox<00:03:47.270> or<00:03:47.540> not

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
area test if you liked our skybox or not

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.030
