condition to jigs right now
I<00:01:29.180> started<00:01:30.049> grinding<00:01:30.470> this<00:01:30.560> plug<00:01:30.860> out<00:01:31.100> in<00:01:31.310> 18

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
I started grinding this plug out in 18

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.270 
I started grinding this plug out in 18
to<00:01:31.820> 24<00:01:32.420> feet<00:01:32.659> of<00:01:32.780> water<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.770> best<00:01:34.009> way<00:01:34.250> to

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
to 24 feet of water and the best way to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.440 
to 24 feet of water and the best way to
describe<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.119> those<00:01:35.930> fish<00:01:36.350> are<00:01:36.560> not

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
describe it is those fish are not

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.749 
describe it is those fish are not
conditioned<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:39.110> seeing<00:01:39.860> things<00:01:40.310> like<00:01:40.700> this

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
conditioned to seeing things like this

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.300 
conditioned to seeing things like this
so<00:01:41.630> if<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:41.869> if<00:01:42.140> there's<00:01:42.320> one<00:01:42.619> thing<00:01:42.799> you<00:01:43.009> want

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
so if you if there's one thing you want

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.959 
so if you if there's one thing you want
to<00:01:43.490> experiment<00:01:44.090> with<00:01:44.710> cranking<00:01:45.710> on<00:01:45.799> our<00:01:46.009> lakes

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.580 

that<00:01:49.969> realm<00:01:50.240> that's<00:01:50.420> almost<00:01:50.780> uncomfortable

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
that realm that's almost uncomfortable

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.929 
that realm that's almost uncomfortable
and<00:01:51.740> when<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:51.950> throw<00:01:52.159> this<00:01:52.340> thing<00:01:52.579> out<00:01:52.729> boy
