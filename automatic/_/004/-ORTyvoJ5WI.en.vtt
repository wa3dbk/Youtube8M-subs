00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.320
 If I think that 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.790
 the archer had a great night us 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.160
 We were always insistent in trying to 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.750
 make the goal but but I think he 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.240
 avoided many clear goal options but 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.740
 good thing is that they are having 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.830
 the options that there is a lot of volume 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.250
 offensive and that at some point it's going to 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.250
 open the arch 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.239
 Well suddenly a little concentration 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.640
 but good that a week to work 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.890
 that to be a little more effective in 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.140
 attack and the option that we have left to be able 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.350
 concrete and good 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.820
 always be decisive and to cÃºcuta 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.149
 we have to go to attract the three 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.149
 points 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.300
 not the teacher 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.090
 always tells us that 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.180
 It has to hurt to not be able to get the 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.070
 three points but 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.440
 but we must be calm because 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.080
 there was always an offensive volume always 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.210
 the team proposed and good as 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.950
 important is that there is always that 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.260
 proposal there is always a hunger to go 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.510
 forward sometimes they grab other 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.510
 sometimes not but but there is always the desire 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.700
 I think we have made it very clear 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.980
 until we have had many options 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.790
 of goal and is a good symptom for the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.860
 team 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.590
 and we hope to continue coupling 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.570
 more keep trying more for the team and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.080
 God forbid you get good many 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.080
 goals for us 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.840
 good you have to be very smart 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.270
 I think we should be very focused 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.010
 in defense and in attack be very 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.090
 forceful for any end that 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.650
 we have a goal to make it concrete and 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.130
 handle the game and so they bring the 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.130
 three points
