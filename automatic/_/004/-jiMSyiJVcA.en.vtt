the shoot was that big that you can just

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:05.580 
the shoot was that big that you can just
put<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.960> whole<00:02:57.140> Apple<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.670> he's<00:02:58.760> gone

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.260 

we'll<00:03:06.590> add<00:03:06.710> in<00:03:06.860> apple<00:03:07.130> juice<00:03:07.400> basically<00:03:07.850> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.240 
we'll add in apple juice basically the
sweetness<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.780> mean<00:03:08.990> that's<00:03:09.140> very<00:03:09.260> alkalizing

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
sweetness I mean that's very alkalizing

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.140 
sweetness I mean that's very alkalizing
obviously<00:03:11.030> equities<00:03:11.390> in<00:03:11.510> cities<00:03:12.080> but<00:03:12.970> I'm<00:03:13.970> not

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
obviously equities in cities but I'm not

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:23.630 
obviously equities in cities but I'm not
so<00:03:14.390> worried<00:03:14.660> about<00:03:14.720> think<00:03:15.140> lately<00:03:15.560> alkalizing

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.160 

so<00:03:24.640> that's<00:03:24.819> all<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.060> juice<00:03:25.239> done<00:03:25.540> there<00:03:25.930> as

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
so that's all the juice done there as

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.259 
so that's all the juice done there as
you<00:03:26.409> can<00:03:26.560> see<00:03:26.739> it's<00:03:26.920> kind<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.129> a<00:03:27.220> briny<00:03:27.549> orange

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
you can see it's kind of a briny orange

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.679 
you can see it's kind of a briny orange
color<00:03:28.920> if<00:03:29.920> you'd<00:03:30.099> put<00:03:30.340> Locker<00:03:30.790> after<00:03:31.420> bag<00:03:31.569> of

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
color if you'd put Locker after bag of

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.809 
color if you'd put Locker after bag of
spinach<00:03:31.930> or<00:03:32.290> some<00:03:32.530> parsley<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.189> there<00:03:33.220> or<00:03:33.610> some

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
spinach or some parsley in there or some

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.350 
spinach or some parsley in there or some
kale<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.810> would<00:03:34.989> be<00:03:35.140> completely<00:03:35.709> green<00:03:36.360> more

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
kale it would be completely green more

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.920 
kale it would be completely green more
like<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:40.090> that's<00:03:40.209> what's<00:03:40.480> in<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.659> green

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
like that so that's what's in a green

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.809 
like that so that's what's in a green
juice<00:03:41.140> it's<00:03:41.440> just<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.769> vegetable<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.489> fruit
