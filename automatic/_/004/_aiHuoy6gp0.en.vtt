00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:14.470 

Peggy<00:00:01.829> three

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.980 

it's<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.540> world<00:00:15.690> tour<00:00:16.130> contains<00:00:17.130> 35<00:00:17.700> venues<00:00:18.029> and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
it's a world tour contains 35 venues and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.060 
it's a world tour contains 35 venues and
the<00:00:19.050> idea<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.259> not<00:00:19.380> only<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.619> reflect<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> fact

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the idea is not only to reflect the fact

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.950 
the idea is not only to reflect the fact
that<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.369> global<00:00:20.610> game<00:00:20.759> but<00:00:20.939> also<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
that is a global game but also the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.950 
that is a global game but also the
different<00:00:22.230> style<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.590> place<00:00:22.829> so<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:24.119> 2v2

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
different style is a place so a 2v2

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.139 
different style is a place so a 2v2
match<00:00:25.320> might<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.189> played<00:00:26.489> in<00:00:26.520> a<00:00:26.730> very<00:00:26.880> small

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:27.149 
match might be played in a very small

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:32.900 
match might be played in a very small
venue<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:28.290> smaller<00:00:28.590> national<00:00:29.189> goalies

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.510 

so<00:00:33.900> you<00:00:34.560> know<00:00:34.650> it<00:00:34.800> creates<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.160> different<00:00:35.310> type

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
so you know it creates a different type

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.020 
so you know it creates a different type
of<00:00:35.550> dynamic<00:00:35.790> than<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.420> 66<00:00:37.110> match<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.680> a

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
of dynamic than a 66 match in a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.360 
of dynamic than a 66 match in a
tournament<00:00:39.030> type<00:00:39.150> stadium<00:00:39.710> or<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> futsal

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
tournament type stadium or a futsal

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.369 
tournament type stadium or a futsal
mattress<00:00:41.760> 585<00:00:42.360> open<00:00:42.720> no<00:00:42.809> walls<00:00:43.050> obviously

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
mattress 585 open no walls obviously

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.420 
mattress 585 open no walls obviously
have<00:00:43.470> a<00:00:43.530> very<00:00:43.559> different<00:00:43.920> type<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.040> gameplay

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.580 

we<00:00:47.430> also<00:00:47.580> have<00:00:47.870> different<00:00:48.870> physics<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
we also have different physics of the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.290 
we also have different physics of the
walls<00:00:50.190> themselves<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.790> if<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> play<00:00:51.120> within

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
walls themselves so if you play within

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.210 
walls themselves so if you play within
the<00:00:51.390> gym<00:00:51.720> even<00:00:52.260> within<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.530> gym<00:00:52.739> itself<00:00:53.010> you'll

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
the gym even within a gym itself you'll

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.189 
the gym even within a gym itself you'll
have<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.519> my<00:00:54.269> standard<00:00:54.600> brick<00:00:54.809> wall<00:00:55.019> in<00:00:55.140> one

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
have like my standard brick wall in one

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.320 
have like my standard brick wall in one
sideline<00:00:55.680> potentially<00:00:56.220> and<00:00:56.400> maybe<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> more<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
sideline potentially and maybe a more of

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.549 
sideline potentially and maybe a more of
a<00:00:57.390> fence<00:00:57.600> ball<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> other<00:00:58.110> side<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
a fence ball on the other side and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.500 
a fence ball on the other side and
physics<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> offense<00:00:59.760> vs.<00:01:00.120> brick<00:01:00.360> will

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
physics so the offense vs. brick will

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.180 
physics so the offense vs. brick will
play<00:01:00.660> quite<00:01:00.900> differently<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.739> surfaces

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
play quite differently the surfaces

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.299 
play quite differently the surfaces
themselves<00:01:02.610> which<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.820> hardwood<00:01:03.210> turf

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
themselves which in hardwood turf

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.889 
themselves which in hardwood turf
concrete<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:06.119> being<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> street<00:01:06.690> you

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
concrete just being on the street you

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.840 
concrete just being on the street you
know<00:01:07.649> they'll<00:01:07.890> play<00:01:08.070> slightly<00:01:08.399> different<00:01:08.700> too

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
know they'll play slightly different too

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
know they'll play slightly different too
so<00:01:09.300> you<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.050> we<00:01:10.200> won't<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
so you know we won't really want the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.469 
so you know we won't really want the
venue<00:01:11.070> speaketh<00:01:11.490> though<00:01:11.640> more<00:01:12.060> than<00:01:12.090> just

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
venue speaketh though more than just

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.969 
venue speaketh though more than just
kind<00:01:12.899> of<00:01:12.930> window<00:01:13.229> dressing<00:01:13.259> if<00:01:13.800> we're<00:01:13.890> going

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
kind of window dressing if we're going

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.170 
kind of window dressing if we're going
to<00:01:14.039> create<00:01:14.190> all<00:01:14.310> these<00:01:14.399> venues<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.940> wanted

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
to create all these venues we wanted

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
to create all these venues we wanted
them<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> offer<00:01:15.570> something<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> fans<00:01:16.220> an

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
them to offer something to the fans an

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.249 
them to offer something to the fans an
actual<00:01:17.550> element<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.149> the<00:01:18.210> gameplay<00:01:18.570> itself<00:01:18.690> so

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
actual element of the gameplay itself so

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.139 
actual element of the gameplay itself so
you<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.550> one<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.789> cool<00:01:20.910> things<00:01:20.940> we

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
you know it's one of the cool things we

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.850 
you know it's one of the cool things we
have<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:22.110> not<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.440> number<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.710> venues

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
have is it's not just a number of venues

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.170 
have is it's not just a number of venues
at<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> faculty<00:01:23.520> affect<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.880> way<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.000> play

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
at the faculty affect the way you play

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.170 
at the faculty affect the way you play
the<00:01:24.210> game<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.490> know<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.610> created<00:01:26.910> this<00:01:26.970> kind

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the game you know we created this kind

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.180 
the game you know we created this kind
of<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.360> world<00:01:27.690> where<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.440> can<00:01:28.560> kind<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.800> go<00:01:28.950> in

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
of a world where you can kind of go in

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.219 
of a world where you can kind of go in
you<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.550> submerse<00:01:29.880> yourself<00:01:30.050> within<00:01:31.050> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
you can submerse yourself within the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.520 
you can submerse yourself within the
street<00:01:31.470> football<00:01:31.880> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.940> lifestyle<00:01:33.530> by

street football kind of lifestyle by
traveling<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.039> world<00:01:35.070> playing<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> 35

traveling the world playing and up to 35

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.290 
traveling the world playing and up to 35
different<00:01:36.330> venues<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:38.220> deuce<00:01:38.490> truly<00:01:39.060> span

the world venues that kind of help us
really<00:01:41.910> demonstrate<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.569> is<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.050> world
