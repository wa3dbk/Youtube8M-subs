what<00:00:02.669> we<00:00:02.790> see<00:00:03.030> going<00:00:03.060> on<00:00:03.419> behind<00:00:03.840> me<00:00:04.160> is<00:00:05.450> a

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
what we see going on behind me is a

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.129 
what we see going on behind me is a
intervalometer<00:00:08.940> that's<00:00:09.450> been<00:00:09.690> made<00:00:10.099> with<00:00:11.099> a

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
intervalometer that's been made with a

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.010

filming cmhc nominees and if you have a

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.209 
filming cmhc nominees and if you have a
camera<00:00:27.840> such<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.220> has<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:31.219> remote

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
camera such as this that has a remote

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.940 
camera such as this that has a remote
control<00:00:33.050> we'll<00:00:34.050> go<00:00:34.200> over<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:34.980> that

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
control we'll go over there and see that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.330 
control we'll go over there and see that
this<00:00:37.950> kind<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> remote<00:00:38.610> control<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:40.340> which

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
this kind of remote control here which

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.720 
this kind of remote control here which
has<00:00:42.379> a<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.739> button<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.129> press<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
has a little button you press and it

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
has a little button you press and it
lets<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:46.260> frame<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.690> rigged<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> lever

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
lets the frame go I rigged it on a lever

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.720 
lets the frame go I rigged it on a lever
system<00:00:50.449> now<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.719> lever<00:00:51.960> system<00:00:52.320> goes<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
system now that lever system goes up to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.290 
system now that lever system goes up to
here

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
here

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.500 
here
which<00:00:56.020> you<00:00:56.170> can<00:00:56.320> see<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:56.559> made<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.860> little<00:00:57.510> cam

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
which you can see I made a little cam

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.760 
which you can see I made a little cam
out<00:00:59.230> of<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.890> wheel<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.850> real<00:01:01.090> and<00:01:02.020> every

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
out of the wheel of the real and every

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.420 
out of the wheel of the real and every
two<00:01:03.250> pushes<00:01:03.579> on<00:01:03.970> it<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:05.080> pushes<00:01:05.350> down<00:01:05.800> on<00:01:05.860> the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
two pushes on it it pushes down on the

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.719 
two pushes on it it pushes down on the
remote<00:01:07.330> control<00:01:07.890> sends<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:08.979> signal<00:01:09.159> over<00:01:09.520> to

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
remote control sends a signal over to

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.899 
remote control sends a signal over to
the<00:01:09.820> camera<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.270> take<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.840> still<00:01:11.110> frame

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.410 

so<00:01:15.380> using<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:17.719> intervalometer<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.210> good

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
so using this intervalometer it is good

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.529 
so using this intervalometer it is good
for<00:01:21.719> however<00:01:22.140> long<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.920> digital<00:01:23.850> card<00:01:24.149> works

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
for however long the digital card works

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.200 
for however long the digital card works
on<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.140> video<00:01:25.469> camera<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.969> have<00:01:27.179> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
on that video camera so if you have a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.770 
on that video camera so if you have a
video<00:01:27.479> camera<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.140> works<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.700> remote<00:01:30.450> or

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
video camera that works with a remote or

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
video camera that works with a remote or
any<00:01:30.960> camera<00:01:31.469> for<00:01:31.649> that<00:01:31.799> matter<00:01:32.069> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:33.090> rig

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
any camera for that matter you can rig

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.020 
any camera for that matter you can rig
up<00:01:34.009> intervalometer<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.520> allows<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
up intervalometer that allows you to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.550 
up intervalometer that allows you to
walk<00:01:36.450> away<00:01:36.659> from<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.289> time-lapse

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
walk away from your time-lapse

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.319 
walk away from your time-lapse
photography<00:01:38.069> which<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.850> always<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.299> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
photography which is always what I

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.949 
photography which is always what I
wanted<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> go<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.270> kind<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:42.810> how

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
wanted to go so you can kind of see how

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.429 
wanted to go so you can kind of see how
this<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:44.369> works<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.850> way<00:01:45.319> setting<00:01:46.319> up

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
this is it works this way setting up

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.710 
this is it works this way setting up
just<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> piece<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.189> wood

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
just a piece of wood

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.300 
just a piece of wood
and<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:50.010> pressing<00:01:50.820> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.240 

it<00:01:53.820> presses<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.540> button<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:56.130> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
it presses the button for you if you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.730 
it presses the button for you if you
keep<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.759> long<00:01:57.119> enough<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.110> generate

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
keep this long enough you generate

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.850 
keep this long enough you generate
enough<00:01:59.009> force<00:01:59.700> quickly<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:01.380> set<00:02:01.619> off<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
enough force quickly to set off the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.330 
enough force quickly to set off the
camera<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.110> as<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.829> here<00:02:04.860> we're

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
camera and as we can see here we're

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.630 
camera and as we can see here we're
getting<00:02:05.640> down<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.210> end<00:02:07.069> they<00:02:08.069> each<00:02:08.310> time

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
getting down to the end they each time

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.870 
getting down to the end they each time
it<00:02:08.789> takes<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.149> picture<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
it takes the picture so we have the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.250 
it takes the picture so we have the
lighting<00:02:12.269> setup<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.250> that
