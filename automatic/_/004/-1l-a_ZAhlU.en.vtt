that<00:00:19.020> knee<00:00:19.170> joint<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.699> just

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
that knee joint and we're going just

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.269 
that knee joint and we're going just
parallel<00:00:21.720> maybe<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.109> little<00:00:22.350> bit<00:00:22.560> below<00:00:22.740> so

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
parallel maybe a little bit below so

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.009 
parallel maybe a little bit below so
once<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.760> start<00:00:23.820> getting<00:00:24.150> hittin<00:00:24.660> up<00:00:24.750> below

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
once you start getting hittin up below

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
once you start getting hittin up below
parallel<00:00:25.289> point<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.340> glutes<00:00:26.580> are<00:00:26.699> going<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
parallel point the glutes are going to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.609 
parallel point the glutes are going to
start<00:00:27.180> firing<00:00:27.539> up<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.810> little<00:00:28.019> bit<00:00:28.170> more<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
start firing up a little bit more and

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.470 
start firing up a little bit more and
it's<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.670> become<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.119> bit<00:00:30.269> more

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
it's going to become a little bit more

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.269 
it's going to become a little bit more
difficult<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.380> good<00:00:31.619> gives<00:00:31.890> now<00:00:31.980> full

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
difficult but it is good gives now full

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.889 
difficult but it is good gives now full
range<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.700> motion<00:00:33.059> we're<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.809> be

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
range of motion we're just going to be

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.720 
range of motion we're just going to be
pyramiding<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.890> weight<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:35.640> going

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
pyramiding up in weight so we're going

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.280 
pyramiding up in weight so we're going
to<00:00:35.790> start<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.149> 135<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.050> we're<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
to start with 135 and we're going to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
to start with 135 and we're going to
slap<00:00:37.469> another<00:00:37.739> 45<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.340> each<00:00:38.460> side<00:00:38.670> 225<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.629> on

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
slap another 45 on each side 225 so on

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.959 
slap another 45 on each side 225 so on
and<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:39.960> forth<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.129> pyramid<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.700> and

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
and so forth and as we pyramid up and

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.459 
and so forth and as we pyramid up and
wait<00:00:42.120> we're<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.629> decreasing<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
wait we're going to be decreasing the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.380 
wait we're going to be decreasing the
reps<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.340> getting<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.579> nice<00:00:44.789> pyramiding

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
reps so getting that nice pyramiding

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.970 
reps so getting that nice pyramiding
scheme<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.989> we're<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.440> somewhat<00:00:46.800> heavy

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
scheme and we're going somewhat heavy

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.090 
scheme and we're going somewhat heavy
today<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.670> our<00:00:47.820> heaviest<00:00:48.770> but<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.980> can

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
today not our heaviest but as you can

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.950 
today not our heaviest but as you can
see<00:00:50.309> we're<00:00:50.579> kind<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.030> struggling<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.600> some<00:00:51.870> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
see we're kind of struggling and some of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660 
see we're kind of struggling and some of
this<00:00:52.020> heavier<00:00:52.350> weight<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:53.280> been<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> little

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this heavier weight it's been a little

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.670 
this heavier weight it's been a little
bit<00:00:53.820> since<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.210> worked<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.690> heavy<00:00:54.960> leg<00:00:55.289> workout

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
bit since we worked a heavy leg workout

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
bit since we worked a heavy leg workout
so<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.250> want<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> start<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> off<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.149> by

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
so we just want to start it off right by

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.599 
so we just want to start it off right by
giving<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.050> squats<00:00:58.350> we've<00:00:59.190> had<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.579> of

look for that one soon so now that we

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.440 
look for that one soon so now that we
got<00:01:11.189> squats<00:01:11.549> out<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.850> way<00:01:11.939> we're<00:01:12.150> moving

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
with the trap bar squats you're going to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.510 
with the trap bar squats you're going to
be<00:01:27.990> involving<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.619> little<00:01:28.860> bit<00:01:28.950> more<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.369> the

entire<00:01:29.880> leg<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.630> your<00:01:30.810> hand<00:01:31.110> placement

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
entire leg because your hand placement

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.890 
entire leg because your hand placement
is<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.009> more<00:01:32.430> at<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.759> side<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.780> going

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
is now more at your side and it's going

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
is now more at your side and it's going
to<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.049> evenly<00:01:34.590> distributing<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> weight

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to be evenly distributing the weight

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.390 
to be evenly distributing the weight
across<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.630> quads<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> hamstrings<00:01:38.220> so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
across the quads and the hamstrings so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.740 
across the quads and the hamstrings so
it's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.610> little<00:01:38.820> bit<00:01:39.000> more<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> pushing

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
it's a little bit more of a pushing

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.749 
it's a little bit more of a pushing
motion<00:01:39.900> than<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> more<00:01:41.159> push-pull

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
motion than just the more push-pull

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.730 
motion than just the more push-pull
motion<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.420> deadlift<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.680> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
motion like in a deadlift so what you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.050 
motion like in a deadlift so what you
want<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.250> load<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> bar<00:01:44.820> with<00:01:44.939> some

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
want to do is load up the bar with some

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.789 
want to do is load up the bar with some
weight<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.140> very<00:01:46.439> similar

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
weight and it's going to be very similar

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.410 
weight and it's going to be very similar
to<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.520> squat<00:01:47.850> where<00:01:48.060> you're<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> be

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
to a squat where you're going to be

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.810 
to a squat where you're going to be
pushing<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.560> hips<00:01:49.829> back<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.610> going<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
pushing the the hips back it's going to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.359 
pushing the the hips back it's going to
tighten<00:01:51.060> those<00:01:51.240> hamstrings<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
tighten those hamstrings up and as you

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.980 
tighten those hamstrings up and as you
reach<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> top<00:01:53.880> position<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.540> extend<00:01:54.899> the

position and then just reverse the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.389 
position and then just reverse the
motion<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.350> bring<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> weight<00:01:58.770> back<00:01:58.950> down<00:01:59.159> to

and this is going to relieve a little

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.770 
and this is going to relieve a little
bit<00:02:49.530> extra<00:02:50.530> stress<00:02:51.070> off<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.820> lower<00:02:52.120> back<00:02:52.240> and

bit extra stress off the lower back and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.210 
bit extra stress off the lower back and
hamstring<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.560> can<00:02:53.680> get<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> little<00:02:54.130> bit

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
hamstring so you can get a little bit

farther range of motion and for the

farther range of motion and for the

isolate those quads and they'll be pump
them<00:04:16.600> up<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:16.959> get<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.500> lot<00:04:17.620> of

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
you'll do an intense workout and then

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.110 
you'll do an intense workout and then
they're<00:04:28.830> just<00:04:29.100> kind<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.340> one<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.550> those<00:04:29.670> things

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
they're just kind of one of those things

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.550 
they're just kind of one of those things
where<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.480> either<00:04:30.690> forget<00:04:31.020> about<00:04:31.140> or<00:04:31.470> you

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
where you either forget about or you

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.870 
where you either forget about or you
just<00:04:31.680> tack<00:04:31.950> them<00:04:32.100> on<00:04:32.220> at<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.460> end<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:32.730> any

just tack them on at the end of any

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.550 
just tack them on at the end of any
exercise<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:33.780> you're<00:04:33.870> just<00:04:34.050> like<00:04:34.230> well<00:04:34.500> I

exercise and you're just like well I

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.260 
exercise and you're just like well I
guess<00:04:34.980> we<00:04:35.100> got<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.250> do<00:04:35.340> calves<00:04:35.580> try<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.090> hit

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
guess we got to do calves try to hit

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.640 
guess we got to do calves try to hit
those<00:04:36.390> calves<00:04:36.630> constantly<00:04:37.170> because<00:04:37.440> that's

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
those calves constantly because that's

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.140 
those calves constantly because that's
going<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:37.890> how<00:04:38.010> they're<00:04:38.190> gonna<00:04:38.580> grow<00:04:38.880> and

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
going to how they're gonna grow and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.870 
going to how they're gonna grow and
they're<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> very<00:04:40.350> simple<00:04:40.860> exercise<00:04:41.400> it's

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
they're a very simple exercise it's

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.730 
they're a very simple exercise it's
pretty<00:04:42.150> much<00:04:42.270> just<00:04:42.330> plantar<00:04:43.080> flexion<00:04:43.410> and

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
pretty much just plantar flexion and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.070 
pretty much just plantar flexion and
dorsiflexion<00:04:44.400> in<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:45.150> ankle<00:04:45.480> joints<00:04:45.870> so

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
dorsiflexion in the ankle joints so

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.220 
dorsiflexion in the ankle joints so
those<00:04:46.890> meaning<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:48.030> dorsiflexion<00:04:48.960> is

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
those meaning that the dorsiflexion is

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.680 
those meaning that the dorsiflexion is
the<00:04:49.530> heel<00:04:49.860> dropping<00:04:50.520> down<00:04:50.730> so<00:04:51.030> your<00:04:51.180> toe<00:04:51.420> is

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
the heel dropping down so your toe is

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.210 
the heel dropping down so your toe is
more<00:04:51.900> up<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.260> air<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:52.980> going<00:04:53.160> to

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
more up in the air so that is going to

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.920 
more up in the air so that is going to
be<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.430> strikes<00:04:53.760> position<00:04:54.270> as<00:04:54.420> you<00:04:54.690> bring

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
be the strikes position as you bring

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.690 
be the strikes position as you bring
that<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.770> weight<00:04:55.980> downwards<00:04:56.280> because

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
that that weight downwards because

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.470 
that that weight downwards because
you're<00:04:56.880> going<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.060> feel<00:04:57.180> that<00:04:57.210> nice<00:04:57.420> stretch

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
you're going to feel that nice stretch

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.210 
you're going to feel that nice stretch
in<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.900> calf<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.350> then<00:04:58.770> you're<00:04:58.920> gonna<00:04:59.010> use

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
in the calf and then you're gonna use

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.370 
in the calf and then you're gonna use
the<00:04:59.370> plantar<00:04:59.760> flexion<00:05:00.060> by<00:05:00.360> pushing<00:05:00.810> your<00:05:01.020> toes

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
the plantar flexion by pushing your toes

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.370 
the plantar flexion by pushing your toes
into<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.980> ground<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.900> raising<00:05:03.900> up<00:05:04.080> in<00:05:04.290> the
