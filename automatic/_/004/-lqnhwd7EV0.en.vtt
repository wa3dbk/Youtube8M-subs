00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
saying that you know I was receiving

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.680 
saying that you know I was receiving
negative<00:02:08.950> points<00:02:09.310> or<00:02:09.429> anything<00:02:09.610> so<00:02:10.060> we're<00:02:10.630> in

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
negative points or anything so we're in

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.380 
negative points or anything so we're in
the<00:02:10.780> clear<00:02:10.929> there<00:02:11.519> another<00:02:12.519> way<00:02:12.730> which<00:02:13.239> is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the clear there another way which is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.810 
the clear there another way which is
very<00:02:13.570> similar<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.170> lava<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:15.580> just

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
very similar to the lava it's just

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.330 
very similar to the lava it's just
simply<00:02:16.120> drowning<00:02:16.480> him<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:18.040> will<00:02:18.160> take<00:02:18.310> a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
simply drowning him this will take a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.060 
simply drowning him this will take a
little<00:02:18.489> while<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:18.910> we'll<00:02:19.269> just<00:02:19.420> let<00:02:20.200> him<00:02:20.260> stare

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
little while so we'll just let him stare

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.380 
little while so we'll just let him stare
at<00:02:21.160> me<00:02:21.250> helplessly<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.880> say<00:02:22.140> what<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.290> is

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
at me helplessly and say what it is

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.590 
at me helplessly and say what it is
anyway<00:02:25.860> now<00:02:26.860> most<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.310> are<00:02:27.340> thinking

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
anyway now most of you are thinking

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.699 
anyway now most of you are thinking
these<00:02:28.600> are<00:02:28.720> really<00:02:29.049> complicated

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
these are really complicated

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.979 
these are really complicated
why<00:02:30.130> would<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.340> build<00:02:30.580> some<00:02:31.030> silly<00:02:31.420> mechanism

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
why would I build some silly mechanism

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.870 
why would I build some silly mechanism
just<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.320> kill<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.530> villager<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.130> you're<00:02:33.700> right

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
just to kill a villager and you're right

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.180 
just to kill a villager and you're right
but<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:35.170> know<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.320> needed<00:02:35.620> something<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.070> make

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
but you know I needed something to make

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.900 
but you know I needed something to make
a<00:02:36.310> first<00:02:36.549> video<00:02:36.730> about<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.510> there<00:02:37.989> you<00:02:38.079> go<00:02:38.910> most

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
a first video about so there you go most

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.900 
a first video about so there you go most
obvious<00:02:40.420> maybe<00:02:41.110> not<00:02:41.320> obvious<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.160> me<00:02:42.790> it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
obvious maybe not obvious but to me it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.690 
obvious maybe not obvious but to me it
was<00:02:43.030> obvious<00:02:43.980> most<00:02:44.980> obvious<00:02:45.280> way<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.430> kill

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
was obvious most obvious way to kill

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.930 
was obvious most obvious way to kill
them<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.480> just<00:02:46.510> set<00:02:46.900> them<00:02:47.019> on<00:02:47.079> fire

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
them is to just set them on fire

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
them is to just set them on fire
most<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.030> time<00:02:50.270> they'll<00:02:50.480> just<00:02:50.510> stand<00:02:50.810> there

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
most the time they'll just stand there

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.090 
most the time they'll just stand there
like<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.350> help<00:02:51.410> us<00:02:51.590> idiot

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
like and help us idiot

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.180

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
and burn to death so he's just staring

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.820 
and burn to death so he's just staring
up<00:02:55.370> at<00:02:55.460> God<00:02:55.640> saying<00:02:55.940> why<00:02:56.150> God<00:02:56.590> why<00:02:57.590> are<00:02:57.650> you
