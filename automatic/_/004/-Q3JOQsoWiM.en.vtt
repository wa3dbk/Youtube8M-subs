00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
the more the material will wear because

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.820 
the more the material will wear because
it'll<00:03:10.459> be<00:03:10.610> areas<00:03:11.060> where<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.930> steel<00:03:12.260> doesn't

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
it'll be areas where the steel doesn't

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.370 
it'll be areas where the steel doesn't
have<00:03:12.980> as<00:03:13.100> much<00:03:13.280> integrity<00:03:13.670> as<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.900> did<00:03:15.080> if<00:03:15.230> it

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
have as much integrity as it did if it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.570 
have as much integrity as it did if it
was<00:03:16.220> void<00:03:16.519> of<00:03:16.790> an<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.209> inclusions<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.110> so<00:03:19.040> it

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
was void of an of inclusions and so it

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.490 
was void of an of inclusions and so it
will<00:03:19.790> have<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:19.910> tendency<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.690> wearing<00:03:21.170> and

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
will have a tendency of wearing and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.100 
will have a tendency of wearing and
maybe<00:03:21.709> fracturing<00:03:22.459> at<00:03:23.030> those<00:03:23.420> areas<00:03:23.900> where

look at its hardness not only in the
