of the tip you actually take a look at
the<00:00:53.210> tip<00:00:53.480> it's<00:00:53.839> very<00:00:54.379> different<00:00:54.739> from<00:00:55.719> that

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
the tip it's very different from that

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.829 
the tip it's very different from that
and<00:00:57.640> they<00:00:58.640> actually<00:00:58.789> got<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.059> red<00:00:59.300> tip<00:00:59.539> I<00:00:59.660> don't

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
and they actually got a red tip I don't

and they actually got a red tip I don't
actually<00:01:00.109> these<00:01:00.379> four<00:01:00.829> masonary<00:01:01.309> you<00:01:01.699> can

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
actually these four masonary you can

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.600 
actually these four masonary you can
tell<00:01:02.030> by<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.269> actual<00:01:02.420> tools<00:01:02.989> on<00:01:03.289> this<00:01:03.519> for<00:01:04.519> the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
tell by the actual tools on this for the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.080 
tell by the actual tools on this for the
concrete<00:01:05.120> and<00:01:05.890> next<00:01:06.890> is<00:01:07.040> just<00:01:07.280> normal<00:01:07.850> just

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
concrete and next is just normal just

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.319 
concrete and next is just normal just
drilling<00:01:08.689> would<00:01:09.549> once<00:01:10.549> again<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:11.060> tips

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
drilling would once again the tips

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.690 
drilling would once again the tips
totally<00:01:11.900> different<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.380> anything<00:01:12.590> else<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:13.220> got

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
totally different to anything else I got

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.789 
totally different to anything else I got
this<00:01:13.880> point<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:14.329> you<00:01:14.420> can<00:01:14.540> actually<00:01:14.799> start

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
this point so you can actually start

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.600 
this point so you can actually start
where<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:16.189> want<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.490> start<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:18.340> also<00:01:19.340> once

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
where you want to start and also once

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.929 
where you want to start and also once
again<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.030> schools<00:01:20.299> are<00:01:20.479> totally<00:01:20.840> different

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
again the schools are totally different

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.130 
again the schools are totally different
and<00:01:22.939> next<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:24.350> actually<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.070> hole<00:01:25.280> saw<00:01:25.520> kit

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
and next is actually a hole saw kit

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.120 
and next is actually a hole saw kit
there<00:01:27.140> are<00:01:27.380> all<00:01:27.530> different<00:01:27.700> sizes<00:01:28.700> from<00:01:29.299> work

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
there are all different sizes from work

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.469 
there are all different sizes from work
small<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.340> light<00:01:31.520> large<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:34.210> yeah<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.360> way

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
see this one actually has a laser on it

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.940 
see this one actually has a laser on it
and<00:02:10.220> if<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.519> can<00:02:10.640> see<00:02:10.819> that<00:02:10.849> laser<00:02:11.239> or<00:02:11.540> not<00:02:11.950> but

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
and if you can see that laser or not but

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.160 
and if you can see that laser or not but
it's<00:02:13.129> actually<00:02:13.250> laser-guided<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.930> she's

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
it's actually laser-guided so she's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.330 
it's actually laser-guided so she's
pretty<00:02:15.410> sweet

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
pretty sweet

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.790 
pretty sweet
and<00:02:17.060> they<00:02:17.209> actually<00:02:17.330> you<00:02:17.599> can<00:02:17.780> remove<00:02:18.110> this

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
and they actually you can remove this

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.449 
and they actually you can remove this
little<00:02:19.099> plug<00:02:19.430> here<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.530> can't<00:02:21.980> switch<00:02:22.310> it

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
little plug here so you can't switch it

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.089 
little plug here so you can't switch it
on<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.640> off<00:02:23.019> without<00:02:24.019> that<00:02:24.230> plug<00:02:24.650> being<00:02:24.920> in

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
on and off without that plug being in

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.670 
on and off without that plug being in
there<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.730> that's<00:02:25.879> pretty<00:02:26.030> good<00:02:26.209> if<00:02:26.680> people
