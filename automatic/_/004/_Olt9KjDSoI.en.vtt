00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.340
 Hello everyone, welcome to 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.659
 unpacking the cooler so branded tula 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:13.939
 model otherwise I drink 12 cc write 2 sharp 2 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.970
 a circle of color standards 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.580
 performance of this company on who 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.579
 brown 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.550
 Navy blue 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.470
 You can see 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.720
 fan through the front cat 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.710
 on the side 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.140
 contains reviews 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.970
 test laboratories 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.280
 on the other side of the box 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.120
 air cooler characteristics 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.920
 flow 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.970
 noise decibels whether features 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.870
 constructions 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.740
 you can here you can see the reward 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.300
 who got this cooler 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 description in different languages 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.690
 generally 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.860
 let's all open the box 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.860
 let's see what's inside 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.480
 the box is well packed well you and 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.310
 contains two more boxes 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.480
 that is, the probability that the cooler 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.780
 damaged during transport 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.780
 very little 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 let's try to open the box 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.500
 so inside for everything 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.580
 and tight 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.580
 rammed 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 so here are the components 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.190
 general components 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.070
 to this cooler 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.610
 in the composition of these components 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.910
 tarmo dear tarmo paste which 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.300
 sold separately 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.960
 adapters 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.400
 sms 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.650
 three pin send calves fold 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.200
 four pin power connector 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.830
 which is contained on the motherboard 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.950
 because they saw squad three first 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.699
 contact 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.859
 these adapters are different in color 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.209
 Cassini Adapters Black Messina 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.339
 maximize 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:16.959
 fan speed 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.409
 it's 1300 rpm 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.060
 black value 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.880
 we provided the maximum rossini 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.170
 that's half the speed that is there 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.719
 somewhere 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.719
 about seven hundred turns 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.939
 cues blocks 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.939
 four lawsuits 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.189
 Dmitry himself sit down icon 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.189
 but who can be attached to the body 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:45.959
 so in the kit 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.099
 also goes 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.200
 Se Canadian tires 2 are supplied 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.729
 two fans 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:55.729
 so for 400 would 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.039
 let's open another box which 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.039
 goes inside 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.939
 so written on it 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.709
 im then the sed is an attachment kit for 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.709
 processors them way 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.449
 set included 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.449
 mounting brackets 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:34.859
 boutiques 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.899
 and nbc plate 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.279
 m plate creepy stela plate creepy 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:40.589
 stiffness for 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.829
 socket am3 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:43.889
 long 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.169
 you'll see 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.169
 written for all three 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.459
 here are the instructions 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.459
 in a beautiful movie envelope 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:03.829
 Well, two more instructions separately 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.189
 for 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.189
 amd 1a processors for processors 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.729
 here's another TV archive 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.729
 three pin 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.120
 in general, that is 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.800
 no, there is still 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.210
 respondents 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.110
 This tube is needed to install the cooler so 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.189
 how to 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:35.399
 Baltimore spin 

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:36.300
 mass character 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.300
 through the radiator 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.539
 input fastener set for amd processors 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:59.749
 He will find of course poorer than on 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.930
 processors im then it just staples 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.930
 bolts and all without 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.229
 Dr. Eric Besson 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.229
 plate stiffness on the motherboard 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.240
 so let's get another box 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.710
 and see directly 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.710
 cooler 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.020
 blood spa 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.460
 all is well on what is packed 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.400
 allow back 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.569
 let's fast 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.149
 but with one hand it's not easy 

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:19.240
 because he 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.240
 tight fit 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.660
 so directly 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.660
 cooler 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.469
 beautiful Klimovich what percentage 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:35.469
 now the most 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.419
 tower radiator 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:49.969
 with genital corpses 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.050
 on this unpacking is over 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.110
 thanks everyone who watched
