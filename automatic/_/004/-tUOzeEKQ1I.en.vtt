00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
where I talk about something and then to

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.090 
where I talk about something and then to
go<00:00:52.180> over<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.449> play<00:00:52.780> example<00:00:53.260> these<00:00:53.739> will<00:00:53.979> be

go over a play example these will be

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.859 
go over a play example these will be
much<00:00:54.430> shorter<00:00:54.460> they<00:00:55.089> need<00:00:55.269> to<00:00:55.390> be<00:00:55.510> kept<00:00:55.750> short
