against<00:04:54.410> our<00:04:54.530> other<00:04:54.680> wasabi<00:04:55.040> is<00:04:55.220> coming<00:04:55.520> off

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
against our other wasabi is coming off

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.320 
against our other wasabi is coming off
out<00:04:56.810> of<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:56.990> picture<00:04:57.290> there<00:04:57.470> so<00:04:58.190> yeah<00:04:59.180> they're

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
out of the picture there so yeah they're

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.270 
out of the picture there so yeah they're
very<00:04:59.540> similar<00:04:59.960> now<00:05:00.140> one<00:05:00.320> big<00:05:00.590> difference<00:05:01.190> to

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
very similar now one big difference to

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.100 
very similar now one big difference to
see<00:05:01.430> right<00:05:01.610> away<00:05:01.850> is<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.360> wasabi<00:05:02.720> from<00:05:03.020> the

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
see right away is the wasabi from the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.470 
see right away is the wasabi from the
surprise<00:05:03.470> egg<00:05:03.710> does<00:05:03.890> not<00:05:04.190> have<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:05.210> plasma

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
surprise egg does not have the plasma

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.510 
surprise egg does not have the plasma
blade<00:05:06.080> so<00:05:06.440> there's<00:05:06.620> definitely<00:05:07.100> a<00:05:07.130> difference

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
blade so there's definitely a difference

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.730 
blade so there's definitely a difference
there<00:05:07.790> but<00:05:08.330> they're<00:05:08.540> both<00:05:08.750> in<00:05:08.900> a<00:05:08.990> similar<00:05:09.410> pose
