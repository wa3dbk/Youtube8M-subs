there are two main display modes with
the<00:00:59.160> HT<00:00:59.579> 6<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.149> strobe<00:01:00.690> mode<00:01:01.219> which<00:01:02.219> can

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the HT 6 there is strobe mode which can

be<00:01:02.940> turned<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.329> by<00:01:03.539> hitting<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.930> button<00:01:03.989> on

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
be turned on by hitting this button on

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.160 
be turned on by hitting this button on
the<00:01:05.070> right<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> says<00:01:05.939> STR<00:01:06.540> B<00:01:06.780> when<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the right so it says STR B when you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.539 
the right so it says STR B when you
pluck<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> note<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.960> LED<00:01:10.409> displays<00:01:11.010> much<00:01:11.340> like

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
pluck a note the LED displays much like

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.340 
pluck a note the LED displays much like
any<00:01:11.729> other<00:01:11.820> strobe<00:01:12.330> tuner<00:01:12.659> pedal<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
any other strobe tuner pedal and the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.499 
any other strobe tuner pedal and the
idea<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.070> want<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.090> stops

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
idea is that you want to when it stops

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.149 
idea is that you want to when it stops
when<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> line<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.350> horizontal<00:01:16.500> line<00:01:16.860> stops

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
when the line the horizontal line stops

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.870 
when the line the horizontal line stops
is<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.090> tune<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:20.479> normal<00:01:21.479> mode<00:01:22.880> when

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
is you're in tune in normal mode when

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.620 
is you're in tune in normal mode when
you<00:01:23.970> pluck<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> note<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:26.670> idea<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
you pluck a note the idea is that you

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.520 
you pluck a note the idea is that you
want<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.610> LED<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
want that the LED to be in the in the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.530 
want that the LED to be in the in the
center<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> display<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.970> turns<00:01:33.180> blue

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
center of the display and it turns blue

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.219 
center of the display and it turns blue
when<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.740> note<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.310> tune<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.990> idea

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
when the note is in tune so the idea

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.840 
when the note is in tune so the idea
behind<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.560> polyphonic<00:01:38.070> tuner<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.759> it's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
behind a polyphonic tuner is that it's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300 
behind a polyphonic tuner is that it's
able<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.150> detect<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.960> pitches<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.560> all<00:01:41.040> six

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
able to detect the pitches of all six

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.460 
able to detect the pitches of all six
strings<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> same<00:01:42.000> time<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.110> example

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
strings at the same time so for example

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.780 
strings at the same time so for example
if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.009> or<00:01:44.130> two<00:01:44.250> strings<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.640> are

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
if you have one or two strings that are

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.039 
if you have one or two strings that are
out<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.939> tune<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.479> you're<00:01:45.570> trying<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.810> find

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
out of tune and you're trying to find

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.719 
out of tune and you're trying to find
quickly<00:01:46.439> which<00:01:46.950> ones<00:01:47.189> they<00:01:47.310> are

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
quickly which ones they are

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.310 
quickly which ones they are
you<00:01:47.970> simply<00:01:48.270> strum<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.930> open<00:01:49.200> strings

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you simply strum all the open strings

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.960 
you simply strum all the open strings
and<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:51.329> display<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:52.220> a<00:01:53.220> normal<00:01:53.759> style

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
and the display in a normal style

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.179 
and the display in a normal style
setting<00:01:54.479> will<00:01:55.049> tell<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.409> which<00:01:55.680> strings<00:01:56.009> are

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
setting will tell you which strings are

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.819 
setting will tell you which strings are
sharp<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> which<00:01:56.850> strings<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.299> flat<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
sharp and which strings are flat here it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.240 
sharp and which strings are flat here it
tells<00:01:59.100> me<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.430> my<00:01:59.610> g<00:01:59.909> string<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.920> really<00:02:01.920> flat

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
tells me that my g string is really flat

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.780 
tells me that my g string is really flat
so<00:02:02.280> I'm<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> tune<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.719> up<00:02:04.399> until<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.640> is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
so I'm going to tune that up until it is

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.719 
so I'm going to tune that up until it is
right<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> middle<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:08.280> idea<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
right in the middle and the idea is that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.050 
right in the middle and the idea is that
when<00:02:08.970> all<00:02:09.239> six<00:02:09.599> strings<00:02:09.780> are<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.440> tune<00:02:10.709> or<00:02:11.069> four

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
when all six strings are in tune or four

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.720 
when all six strings are in tune or four
or<00:02:12.209> five<00:02:12.390> strings<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:12.900> you're<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.200> bass

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
or five strings if you're on the bass

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.720 
or five strings if you're on the bass
that<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:15.530> blue<00:02:15.739> lights<00:02:15.980> run<00:02:16.430> all<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> way

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
that the blue lights run all the way

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.399 
that the blue lights run all the way
down<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.090> center<00:02:17.269> but<00:02:17.750> if<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.900> wanted<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.230> just

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
down the center but if I wanted to just

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.670 
down the center but if I wanted to just
check<00:02:18.680> one<00:02:19.430> string<00:02:19.790> at<00:02:19.909> a<00:02:19.940> time<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.569> pluck<00:02:21.500> it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
check one string at a time I pluck it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.750 
check one string at a time I pluck it
and<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.980> note<00:02:22.220> shows<00:02:22.519> up<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:24.440> display<00:02:24.890> one

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
and the note shows up in the display one

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.369 
and the note shows up in the display one
of<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.909> presets<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.599> comes<00:02:26.840> shipped<00:02:27.080> with

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
of the presets that comes shipped with

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.009 
of the presets that comes shipped with
the<00:02:27.409> HT<00:02:27.950> six<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.489> drop<00:02:28.819> D<00:02:29.060> setting<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.629> to

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
the HT six is a drop D setting and to

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.839 
the HT six is a drop D setting and to
access<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:31.190> push<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.670> tuning<00:02:32.000> button

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
access that you push the tuning button

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.940 
access that you push the tuning button
until<00:02:34.849> it<00:02:34.970> shows<00:02:35.180> up<00:02:35.209> drop<00:02:35.750> D<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.650> what<00:02:36.799> that

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
until it shows up drop D and what that

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.520 
until it shows up drop D and what that
does<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.459> sets<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.510> polyphonic<00:02:39.170> setting

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
does is that sets the polyphonic setting

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.220 
does is that sets the polyphonic setting
so<00:02:39.890> when<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.069> strum<00:02:40.310> all<00:02:40.430> six<00:02:40.970> strings

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
so when you strum all six strings

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.399 
so when you strum all six strings
it'll<00:02:42.709> tune<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.129> to<00:02:43.159> a<00:02:43.250> drop<00:02:43.610> D<00:02:43.849> tuning<00:02:44.319> one<00:02:45.319> of

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
it'll tune it to a drop D tuning one of

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.350 
it'll tune it to a drop D tuning one of
the<00:02:45.470> cooler<00:02:45.680> features<00:02:46.129> is<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.549> fret<00:02:46.849> offset

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
the cooler features is the fret offset

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.600 
the cooler features is the fret offset

feature it allows if you're using a capo

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.110 
feature it allows if you're using a capo
to<00:02:50.510> program<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.890> polyphonic<00:02:52.640> setting<00:02:52.970> to

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
to program the polyphonic setting to

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.020 
to program the polyphonic setting to
recognize<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.900> capo<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.500> also<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.370> program

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
recognize that capo and also to program

it using drop tunings so to activate the
fret<00:02:59.329> offset<00:02:59.810> feature<00:03:00.079> what<00:03:00.319> I've<00:03:00.410> done<00:03:00.590> is

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
fret offset feature what I've done is

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.740 
fret offset feature what I've done is
I've<00:03:00.829> put<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.010> capo<00:03:01.430> at<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.640> third<00:03:01.910> fret<00:03:02.209> of<00:03:02.450> my

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
I've put a capo at the third fret of my

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.050 
I've put a capo at the third fret of my
guitar<00:03:03.109> and<00:03:03.890> what<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.040> do<00:03:04.160> is<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.400> hold<00:03:04.609> down<00:03:04.849> the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
guitar and what I do is I hold down the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.630 
guitar and what I do is I hold down the
pedal<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:06.590> word<00:03:06.739> fret<00:03:07.040> comes<00:03:07.310> up<00:03:07.459> and

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
pedal and the word fret comes up and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.390 
pedal and the word fret comes up and
then<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.819> strum<00:03:08.180> all<00:03:08.450> six<00:03:08.599> strings<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:10.310> it

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
then I strum all six strings and it

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.830 
then I strum all six strings and it
automatically<00:03:10.819> detects<00:03:11.269> that<00:03:11.450> I'm<00:03:11.540> at<00:03:11.690> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.009 
automatically detects that I'm at the
third<00:03:12.079> fret<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:13.030> then<00:03:14.030> I'm<00:03:14.329> able<00:03:14.599> to<00:03:14.750> fine

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
third fret and then I'm able to fine

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.979 
third fret and then I'm able to fine
tune<00:03:18.340> using<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.430> polyphonic<00:03:20.090> setting<00:03:20.389> not

tune using the polyphonic setting not

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.020 
tune using the polyphonic setting not
only<00:03:21.169> can<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.380> HT<00:03:21.739> six<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.190> Fredd<00:03:22.639> offset

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
only can the HT six is Fredd offset

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.500 
only can the HT six is Fredd offset
feature<00:03:23.959> work<00:03:24.590> great<00:03:24.889> for<00:03:25.099> Capo's<00:03:25.609> but<00:03:26.209> also

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
feature work great for Capo's but also

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.240 
feature work great for Capo's but also
if<00:03:26.690> your<00:03:26.840> band<00:03:27.109> typically<00:03:27.500> Tunes<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.829> half-step

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
if your band typically Tunes a half-step

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.949 
if your band typically Tunes a half-step
or<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.489> whole<00:03:28.760> step<00:03:29.000> down<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.599> work<00:03:29.720> great

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
or a whole step down it can work great

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.420 
or a whole step down it can work great
for<00:03:30.109> drop<00:03:30.349> tunings<00:03:30.709> as<00:03:30.859> well<00:03:31.010> as<00:03:31.160> long<00:03:31.280> as

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
for drop tunings as well as long as

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.920 
for drop tunings as well as long as
you're<00:03:31.549> still<00:03:31.730> remaining<00:03:32.060> standard<00:03:32.660> tuning

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
you're still remaining standard tuning

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.110 
you're still remaining standard tuning
so<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.500> use<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.799> fret<00:03:34.069> offset<00:03:34.579> feature<00:03:34.819> for

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
so to use the fret offset feature for

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.659 
so to use the fret offset feature for
drop<00:03:35.359> tunings<00:03:35.859> you<00:03:36.859> do<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.130> same<00:03:37.340> thing<00:03:37.519> as

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
drop tunings you do the same thing as

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.930 
drop tunings you do the same thing as
before<00:03:38.079> you<00:03:39.079> hold<00:03:39.380> down<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.590> pedal<00:03:40.099> as<00:03:40.790> we

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
before you hold down the pedal as we

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.930 
before you hold down the pedal as we
want<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.150> adjust<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:41.720> it's<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:42.430> negative<00:03:43.430> one

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
want to adjust it so it's a negative one

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.120 
want to adjust it so it's a negative one
which<00:03:44.180> means<00:03:44.389> one<00:03:44.660> half-step<00:03:44.959> below<00:03:45.500> standard

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
which means one half-step below standard

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.979 
which means one half-step below standard
like<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.519> other<00:03:46.639> polyphonic<00:03:47.299> modes<00:03:47.510> once<00:03:47.810> all

the blue lights are in the center it's
in<00:03:49.940> tune<00:03:50.239> now<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.169> one<00:03:51.530> thing<00:03:51.769> with<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.160> is

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
in tune now the one thing with this is

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.449 
in tune now the one thing with this is
when<00:03:52.579> we<00:03:52.700> switch<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.209> single<00:03:53.780> note<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:55.340> will
