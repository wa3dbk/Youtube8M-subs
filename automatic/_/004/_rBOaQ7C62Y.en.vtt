sketches<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.409> important<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.130> me<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.520> get

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
sketches this is important for me to get

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.090 
sketches this is important for me to get
my<00:02:02.820> hand-eye<00:02:03.390> coordination<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.860> I'm<00:02:05.040> just

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
my hand-eye coordination in I'm just

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100 
my hand-eye coordination in I'm just
using<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.850> willow<00:02:06.090> charcoal<00:02:06.600> because<00:02:06.960> it's

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
using the willow charcoal because it's

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.380 
using the willow charcoal because it's
loose<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.740> firm<00:02:07.979> what<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:08.819> trying<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.270> is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
loose and firm what I'm trying to do is

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.430 
loose and firm what I'm trying to do is
find<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> accesses<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.560> body<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.160> an

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
find the accesses of the body this is an

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.870 
find the accesses of the body this is an
not<00:02:11.530> about<00:02:11.770> perfect<00:02:12.100> drawings<00:02:12.610> this<00:02:12.760> is

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
not about perfect drawings this is

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.030 
not about perfect drawings this is
literally<00:02:13.180> trying<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.020> get<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.320> feel<00:02:14.620> and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
literally trying to get the feel and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.760 
literally trying to get the feel and
explain<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.180> know<00:02:16.300> where<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.290> weight<00:02:17.530> is

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
explain you know where the weight is

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.260 
explain you know where the weight is
going<00:02:18.010> through<00:02:18.250> his<00:02:18.400> body<00:02:18.580> looking<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
going through his body looking for the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.810 
going through his body looking for the
accesses<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.050> see<00:02:20.500> you've<00:02:20.710> got<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.220> key<00:02:21.400> access

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
accesses I see you've got the key access

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.080 
accesses I see you've got the key access
of<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.060> hips<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.660> shoulders<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.010> spine

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
of the hips the shoulders and the spine

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.790 
of the hips the shoulders and the spine
once<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.270> find<00:02:25.510> these<00:02:25.690> things<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:26.170> very<00:02:26.380> easy

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
once we find these things it's very easy

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.280 
once we find these things it's very easy
to<00:02:27.040> find<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.910> rest<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.390> form<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.110> you're

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
to find the rest of the form so you're

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.810 
to find the rest of the form so you're
looking<00:02:29.380> for<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.740> kind<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.220> balance<00:02:30.460> of

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
looking for the kind of the balance of

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.210 
looking for the kind of the balance of
the<00:02:30.940> figure<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:32.050> guess<00:02:32.560> we're<00:02:32.800> getting<00:02:32.920> to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the figure and I guess we're getting to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.480 
the figure and I guess we're getting to
kind<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.750> distill<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.200> pose<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.190> speak

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
kind of distill the pose so to speak

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.320 
kind of distill the pose so to speak
with<00:02:36.790> our<00:02:36.940> drawing

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.580 

quaff<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.600> like<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.960> say<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.170> people<00:02:41.350> you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
quaff and I like to say to people you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.020 
quaff and I like to say to people you
know<00:02:41.710> when<00:02:42.190> they're<00:02:42.340> looking<00:02:42.490> at<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.790> model

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
know when they're looking at the model

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.000 
know when they're looking at the model
think<00:02:43.330> about<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.720> pose<00:02:43.960> where<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.770> weight

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
think about the pose where is the weight

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.430 
think about the pose where is the weight
of<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.400> model<00:02:45.610> going<00:02:46.000> down<00:02:46.210> is<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.930> going<00:02:47.230> down

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
of the model going down is it going down

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.950 
of the model going down is it going down
their<00:02:47.770> leg<00:02:48.040> or<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.670> leaning<00:02:48.820> forward<00:02:49.420> can

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
their leg or is it leaning forward can

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.420 
their leg or is it leaning forward can
you<00:02:49.990> feel<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.620> your<00:02:50.800> own<00:02:50.920> body<00:02:51.190> through

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
you feel it in your own body through

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.270 
you feel it in your own body through
your<00:02:51.490> hips<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.450> almost<00:02:52.660> try<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.770> feel<00:02:54.070> the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
your hips and so almost try and feel the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.380 
your hips and so almost try and feel the
pose<00:02:54.460> yourself<00:02:59.010> so<00:03:00.010> I'm<00:03:00.220> imagining<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:01.060> twist

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
pose yourself so I'm imagining the twist

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.460 
pose yourself so I'm imagining the twist
of<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.720> spine

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
of the spine

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.850 
of the spine
I'm<00:03:03.160> imagining<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:04.030> ribcage<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:05.050> I'm

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
I'm imagining the ribcage and I'm

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.410 
I'm imagining the ribcage and I'm
thinking<00:03:06.510> about<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.930> negative<00:03:08.440> space<00:03:09.420> well

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
thinking about the negative space well

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.170 
thinking about the negative space well
I'm<00:03:10.570> trying<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.960> do<00:03:11.140> this<00:03:11.410> as<00:03:12.010> well<00:03:12.310> as<00:03:12.490> I'm

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
I'm trying to do this as well as I'm

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.270 
I'm trying to do this as well as I'm
letting<00:03:13.570> my<00:03:13.720> charcoal<00:03:14.290> move<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.770> whole<00:03:14.950> time

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
letting my charcoal move the whole time

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.090 
letting my charcoal move the whole time
it's<00:03:15.820> kind<00:03:16.300> of<00:03:16.360> searching<00:03:17.400> for<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.489> Lions

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
it's kind of searching for the Lions

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.990 
it's kind of searching for the Lions
make<00:03:21.100> sure<00:03:21.250> you're<00:03:21.400> drawing<00:03:21.610> with<00:03:21.760> your

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
make sure you're drawing with your

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.060 
make sure you're drawing with your
shoulder<00:03:22.420> you<00:03:22.840> want<00:03:23.020> to<00:03:23.140> be<00:03:23.290> able<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.560> see<00:03:23.800> that

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
shoulder you want to be able to see that

shoulder you want to be able to see that
have<00:03:24.190> my<00:03:25.000> body<00:03:25.300> moving<00:03:25.630> as<00:03:26.050> I'm<00:03:26.290> trying<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.650> do

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
have my body moving as I'm trying to do

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.100 
have my body moving as I'm trying to do
the<00:03:27.280> sweep<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:27.970> curve<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.540> spine<00:03:28.840> or

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
the sweep of the curve of the spine or

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.949 
the sweep of the curve of the spine or
the<00:03:29.140> strengths<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.160> that<00:03:30.340> pose<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:31.360> line<00:03:31.600> down

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
the strengths of that pose the line down

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.930 
the strengths of that pose the line down
things<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.800> think<00:03:33.010> about<00:03:33.100> are<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.520> weight<00:03:33.730> of

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
things to think about are the weight of

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.610 
things to think about are the weight of
the<00:03:34.000> pencil<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.660> weight<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.140> mark<00:03:35.350> how

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
the pencil so the weight of the mark how

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.070 
the pencil so the weight of the mark how
much<00:03:35.860> pressure<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.790> put<00:03:36.820> on<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.209> pencil<00:03:37.690> is

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
much pressure you put on the pencil is

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.229 
much pressure you put on the pencil is
it<00:03:38.350> light<00:03:38.590> when<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.430> draw<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.670> should<00:03:40.000> be<00:03:40.090> like

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
it light when you draw it should be like

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.570 
it light when you draw it should be like
music<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.720> know<00:03:40.989> it's<00:03:41.140> not<00:03:41.320> all<00:03:41.530> one<00:03:41.860> note<00:03:42.130> one

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
music you know it's not all one note one

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.790 
music you know it's not all one note one
you<00:03:43.090> know<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.269> want<00:03:43.630> soft<00:03:44.019> areas<00:03:44.560> and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
you know you want soft areas and

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.699 
you know you want soft areas and
stronger<00:03:45.760> areas<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.300> want<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:47.080> kind<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
stronger areas you want the kind of the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.580 
stronger areas you want the kind of the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
and kind of you know lead the eye around

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.410 
and kind of you know lead the eye around
but<00:03:53.230> play<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.100> have<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.310> variation<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.209> its

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
but play and have a variation in its

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.570 
but play and have a variation in its
form<00:03:55.690> okay<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:56.380> I'm<00:03:56.620> going<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:56.890> do<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.040> series<00:03:57.459> of

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
form okay so I'm going to do a series of

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.040 
form okay so I'm going to do a series of
sequential<00:03:58.000> drawings<00:03:58.480> now<00:03:58.660> which<00:03:58.870> is

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
sequential drawings now which is

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.140 
sequential drawings now which is
basically<00:03:59.500> building<00:04:00.010> on<00:04:00.220> what<00:04:00.850> we've<00:04:00.970> done

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
basically building on what we've done

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.540 
basically building on what we've done
with<00:04:01.360> our<00:04:01.510> quick<00:04:01.840> sketch<00:04:02.140> is<00:04:02.350> our<00:04:02.530> warm-ups<00:04:02.950> so

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
with our quick sketch is our warm-ups so

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.080 
with our quick sketch is our warm-ups so
these<00:04:04.180> poses<00:04:04.510> will<00:04:04.810> be<00:04:04.930> five<00:04:05.769> poses<00:04:06.610> of<00:04:06.790> the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
these poses will be five poses of the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.270 
these poses will be five poses of the
moving<00:04:07.420> form<00:04:07.660> so<00:04:08.080> I'm<00:04:08.200> just<00:04:08.440> keeping<00:04:09.130> that

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
moving form so I'm just keeping that

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.090 
moving form so I'm just keeping that
pencil<00:04:09.850> on<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.030> page<00:04:10.420> trying<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:11.590> let<00:04:11.800> it<00:04:11.830> to

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
pencil on the page trying to let it to

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.560 
pencil on the page trying to let it to
search<00:04:12.959> out<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.380> form<00:04:17.850> but<00:04:18.850> basically<00:04:19.269> I'll

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
search out the form but basically I'll

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.800 
search out the form but basically I'll
be<00:04:19.720> taking<00:04:20.080> your<00:04:20.169> steel<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.739> drawing

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
be taking your steel and drawing

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.880 
be taking your steel and drawing
sequentially<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:22.960> I'll<00:04:23.080> be<00:04:23.200> drawing<00:04:23.320> on<00:04:23.620> top

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
sequentially so I'll be drawing on top

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.240 
sequentially so I'll be drawing on top
of<00:04:24.039> the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
of the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.800 
of the
previous<00:04:24.550> drawings<00:04:24.880> which<00:04:25.360> will<00:04:25.510> give<00:04:25.690> the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
previous drawings which will give the

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.260 
previous drawings which will give the
feeling<00:04:26.200> of<00:04:26.260> movement<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.850> figure

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
feeling of movement and of the figure

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.300 
feeling of movement and of the figure
moving<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:29.110> through<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.470> page<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.130> we're

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
moving it through the page so we're

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.830 
moving it through the page so we're
looking<00:04:30.610> really<00:04:30.760> at<00:04:30.910> more<00:04:31.300> of<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.510> linear

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
looking really at more of a linear

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.070 
looking really at more of a linear
contour<00:04:32.500> here<00:04:33.420> so<00:04:34.420> we're<00:04:34.570> not<00:04:34.690> really

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
contour here so we're not really

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.530 
contour here so we're not really
describing<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.800> body<00:04:36.010> with<00:04:36.220> tone<00:04:39.240> so<00:04:40.240> what

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
describing the body with tone so what

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.090 
describing the body with tone so what
I'm<00:04:40.720> trying<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.080> do<00:04:41.200> is<00:04:41.410> I'm<00:04:41.560> really<00:04:41.860> looking

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
I'm trying to do is I'm really looking

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.650 
I'm trying to do is I'm really looking
for<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.310> contour<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.030> I'm<00:04:43.120> looking<00:04:43.420> for<00:04:43.570> the

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
for a contour so I'm looking for the

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.750 
for a contour so I'm looking for the
outline<00:04:44.080> as<00:04:44.770> much<00:04:45.010> as<00:04:45.190> I'm<00:04:45.280> looking<00:04:45.550> for<00:04:45.670> the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
outline as much as I'm looking for the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.940 
outline as much as I'm looking for the
essence<00:04:46.120> I'm<00:04:46.240> also<00:04:46.420> trying<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.930> in<00:04:47.170> sitov

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
essence I'm also trying to in sitov

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.310 
essence I'm also trying to in sitov
imagine<00:04:48.640> that<00:04:48.820> internal<00:04:49.540> structure<00:04:50.110> of<00:04:50.230> the

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
imagine that internal structure of the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.520 
imagine that internal structure of the
body<00:04:50.470> having<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.400> kind<00:04:52.060> of<00:04:52.240> knowledge<00:04:53.020> of<00:04:53.410> the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
body having a kind of knowledge of the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.690 
body having a kind of knowledge of the
skeleton<00:04:54.220> is<00:04:54.460> really<00:04:55.060> important<00:04:55.870> in<00:04:56.610> sort<00:04:57.610> of

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
skeleton is really important in sort of

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.730 
skeleton is really important in sort of
life<00:04:58.060> drawing<00:04:58.510> it's<00:04:58.720> because<00:04:59.169> it's<00:04:59.350> you<00:04:59.470> need

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
life drawing it's because it's you need

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.220 
life drawing it's because it's you need
to<00:04:59.830> imagine<00:05:00.490> those<00:05:01.180> bones<00:05:01.600> they're<00:05:02.020> they're

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
to imagine those bones they're they're

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.810 
to imagine those bones they're they're
kind<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.620> bones<00:05:02.950> of<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.280> drawings

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
kind of the bones of the drawings

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.880 
kind of the bones of the drawings
underneath<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.570> then<00:05:04.960> you're<00:05:05.110> fleshing<00:05:05.800> it

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
underneath and then you're fleshing it

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.980 
underneath and then you're fleshing it
out<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:06.730> what<00:05:06.910> I'm<00:05:07.120> doing<00:05:07.150> here<00:05:07.840> is<00:05:07.900> just

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
out so what I'm doing here is just

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.800 
out so what I'm doing here is just
instead<00:05:08.950> of<00:05:09.070> looking<00:05:09.340> imagining<00:05:10.060> that<00:05:10.270> form

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
instead of looking imagining that form

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.950 
instead of looking imagining that form
underneath<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:12.400> skin<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.270> muscle<00:05:13.720> and

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
underneath the skin and the muscle and

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.980 
underneath the skin and the muscle and
then<00:05:14.590> sort<00:05:15.040> of<00:05:15.130> finding<00:05:15.940> these<00:05:16.090> contours<00:05:16.780> so

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
then sort of finding these contours so

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.230 
then sort of finding these contours so
things<00:05:17.590> like<00:05:17.800> negative<00:05:18.400> space<00:05:18.760> is<00:05:19.030> something

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
things like negative space is something

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.890 
things like negative space is something
that<00:05:19.690> I<00:05:19.930> take<00:05:20.680> into<00:05:20.890> account<00:05:21.370> he<00:05:22.210> sort<00:05:22.480> of<00:05:22.570> it

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
that I take into account he sort of it

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.570 
that I take into account he sort of it
sort<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:23.260> automatic<00:05:23.890> it<00:05:23.980> becomes<00:05:24.310> quite

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
sort of automatic it becomes quite

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.170 
sort of automatic it becomes quite
automatic<00:05:25.270> that<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:27.190> feeling<00:05:27.760> of<00:05:27.850> sort<00:05:28.090> of

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
automatic that that feeling of sort of

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.170 
automatic that that feeling of sort of
looking<00:05:28.600> for<00:05:28.840> those<00:05:28.990> shapes<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.640> I<00:05:30.760> say<00:05:30.970> he

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
looking for those shapes and I say he

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.900 
looking for those shapes and I say he
looking<00:05:31.630> here<00:05:32.050> with<00:05:32.650> a<00:05:32.680> hand<00:05:33.100> and<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.490> body<00:05:33.669> so

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
looking here with a hand and the body so

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.600 
looking here with a hand and the body so
this<00:05:34.090> shape<00:05:34.419> here<00:05:34.840> between<00:05:35.800> the<00:05:36.130> head<00:05:36.340> and<00:05:36.520> the

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
this shape here between the head and the

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.590 
this shape here between the head and the
arm<00:05:36.790> is<00:05:37.090> really<00:05:37.960> important<00:05:38.770> to<00:05:39.250> get<00:05:39.460> that<00:05:39.700> sort

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
arm is really important to get that sort

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.450 
arm is really important to get that sort
of<00:05:40.710> feeling<00:05:41.710> okay<00:05:42.520> change<00:05:44.040> so<00:05:45.040> there's<00:05:45.280> no

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
of feeling okay change so there's no

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.469 
of feeling okay change so there's no
right<00:05:45.790> or<00:05:46.030> wrong<00:05:46.090> mark<00:05:46.890> you<00:05:47.890> can<00:05:48.160> have<00:05:49.090> as<00:05:49.240> many

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
right or wrong mark you can have as many

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.950 
right or wrong mark you can have as many
marks<00:05:49.990> as<00:05:50.169> you<00:05:50.320> like<00:05:50.560> I<00:05:50.979> kind<00:05:51.520> of<00:05:51.610> build<00:05:51.970> that

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
marks as you like I kind of build that

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.590 
marks as you like I kind of build that
form<00:05:53.440> up

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.710 

it's<00:06:00.600> about<00:06:01.050> trying<00:06:01.890> to<00:06:02.390> capture<00:06:03.390> that

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
it's about trying to capture that

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.310 
it's about trying to capture that
feeling<00:06:04.350> of<00:06:04.680> that<00:06:05.000> that<00:06:06.000> movement<00:06:06.510> and<00:06:07.110> when

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
feeling of that that movement and when

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.160 
feeling of that that movement and when
we<00:06:07.470> layer<00:06:07.680> them<00:06:07.860> up<00:06:08.040> you<00:06:08.880> do<00:06:09.060> get<00:06:09.360> quite<00:06:09.600> a<00:06:09.750> sort

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:17.760 
we layer them up you do get quite a sort
of<00:06:10.230> three-dimensional<00:06:12.680> feel

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.770 

Matisse<00:06:18.520> says<00:06:18.759> drawing<00:06:19.090> is<00:06:19.330> like<00:06:19.360> an

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
Matisse says drawing is like an

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.659 
Matisse says drawing is like an
expressive<00:06:20.199> gesture<00:06:20.770> with<00:06:21.009> the<00:06:21.129> advantage<00:06:21.639> of

expressive gesture with the advantage of

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.760 
expressive gesture with the advantage of
permanence<00:06:22.419> and<00:06:22.960> that's<00:06:23.229> a<00:06:23.379> really<00:06:23.650> wonderful

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
permanence and that's a really wonderful

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.040 
permanence and that's a really wonderful
thing<00:06:24.280> because<00:06:24.460> it's<00:06:24.879> it's<00:06:25.660> like<00:06:25.780> when<00:06:25.960> you
