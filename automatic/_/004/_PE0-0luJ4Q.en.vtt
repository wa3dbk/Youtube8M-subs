00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.150
 60 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.600
 because the product that comes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.410
 he arrived this one has standard of communication of the market but the new one 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.929
 technology has other purposes and will change things in the house 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.220
 we have news of wires and cables are worried 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.369
 and is not for less from that year many appliances will dispense this 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.580
 connection type 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.050
 is that the market prepares for the arrival of the wp with another iceberg 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.160
 in Portuguese would be something like another broad band is a form 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.750
 should connect 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.090
 we really have tel a keyboard on your computer miss losing my 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.280
 home is the total freedom of 2008 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.280
 d belief 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.220
 you have already met another standard of wireless communication and 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.220
 fruit 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.340
 it is increasingly common for example in cell phones eliminating 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.820
 wires in which the handset and headset does not turn on if a car rolls 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.620
 paulo other the hybrid is similar 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.620
 only many many more powerful 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.330
 It's much more complicated, but I'll be 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.470
 exchange data and information 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.770
 among the missing because the lines are too heavy 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.180
 so for you to have quality you need a same channel the course of 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.350
 Three handset communication is why my club is a technology 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.110
 ansa 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.450
 very appropriate and balanced backwards 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.490
 for that 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.249
 one more time it took to reach the market 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.240
 in part because it was developed by the American military of the Pentagon 

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:50.800
 our people said to expect a mural for civilian use 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.180
 as speed is one of the marks of the digital era, 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.910
 start taking over from your home more than this the world of news will arrive 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.660
 things like this device for example 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.439
 he skipped the ex-minister's use of medicines 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.900
 very useful for the elderly if the person forgets to take the medicine in the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.980
 time the device emits a signal that can be received by a computer that is 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:21.799
 sent on the internet, the relative can then contact 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:22.669
 person 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.159
 really great 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.590
 and this is just another example but it just promises to change 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.209
 a lot on the gadgets that are out there 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.419
 know beforehand what follows 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.729
 We're much more important today. 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.589
 more than purely and simply with greater speed 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.109
 is the cta as a set 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.809
 for the user that is easy to use that is not that it has 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:48.329
 with only seven energy per which it can connect to these 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.329
 are all concerns that we have 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.329
 today when you are designing and rethinking a new product 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.390
 we are reaching the age of 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.879
 another good idea 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.920
 as the devices with this technology reach the market you go 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.919
 be the first to know stay tuned 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.049
 many other applications are around
