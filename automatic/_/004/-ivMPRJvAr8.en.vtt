 First of all, there is a place to do fingerprint authentication here.

 Oh what this is a caisson 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:52.030
 This is a camera with a line of 5 million pixels because of infrared heat when communicating with infrared light 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.440
 Maybe it's 1500 and this is

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.570
 This is 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.020
 It is a place to plug the charging cable 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.770

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.390
 Because there is a home camera here and there 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.020

 There is a power button and there is a button to adjust the winter volume etc.

 I am here for you, but Well said Well cpu is a dual-core cpu 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:32.550
 There are two cores, so it usually disappears and so much compared 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.699
 It means that the operating speed is fast 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.529
 Re Chinaminietto 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:41.649

 8 saying quad-core cpu 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:48.080
 Oh dear 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:53.240
 I think that you understand if you understand it, but the number of cores is really unusually large 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.470
 Anyway, it's early and games and such sounds become high spec smartphones 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.790

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:02.030
