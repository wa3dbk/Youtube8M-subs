counterweight to the strength of the arm

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.889 
counterweight to the strength of the arm
and<00:01:02.010> must<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.850> attached<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.539> order<00:01:03.780> to

so<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.010> may<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.580> make<00:01:59.760> quite<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.150> few

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
so you may have to make quite a few

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.630 
so you may have to make quite a few
turns<00:02:00.750> before<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.409> arm<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.740> balanced<00:02:02.400> at

turns before the arm is balanced at
every<00:02:03.600> few<00:02:03.810> terms<00:02:04.110> check<00:02:05.040> your<00:02:05.220> progress<00:02:05.490> by

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
every few terms check your progress by

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.640 
every few terms check your progress by
releasing<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.600> arm<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.050> see<00:02:07.229> whether<00:02:07.470> it

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
releasing the arm to see whether it
