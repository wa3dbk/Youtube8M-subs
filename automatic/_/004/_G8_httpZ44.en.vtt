00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.000
 If your phone is hotter than a 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.230
 atari transformer or if when you're 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.029
 playing you feel that your fingers are 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.980
 melt from the heat by touching the screen 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.570
 of the device then I advise you 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.570
 Download the next application 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.710
 good if you want to prevent your phone 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.150
 serve as heating when the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.009
 winter I recommend this application 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.809
 which is called cruyff and an application the 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.029
 which promises to regulate the temperature of 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.759
 our phone there are two critical points 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.800
 of the phones one is the fast one 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.809
 battery discharge and another is the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.970
 overheating a lot of people 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.440
 the phone is too hot and 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.420
 when he puts it in his pocket they go to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 feel an uncomfortable feeling too 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 when he is playing sometimes he touches you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.820
 blow your fingers sometimes it touches you 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.649
 to make your fingers cool 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.689
 because the screen seems to be a 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.189
 good oven this application allows 

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:55.530
 regulate the temperature of your phone 

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:57.629
 so that it does not overheat and then 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.699
 you say those discomforts this application 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.949
 requires android 2.2 we see that it has 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.269
 4.2 rating and comments on 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.220
 most are positive 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.710
 this application as well as previously 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.170
 requires Android 2.2 and the truth that 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.000
 it works very well and the only one then point 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 negative I would say is that it requires to be 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.090
 or rather we have to have the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.470
 phone surrounded so you can 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.439
 work so let's execute it and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.820
 let's get to know it more thoroughly once 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.619
 we execute the application we can see 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.600
 well here the interface that is quite 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.830
 clean and quite understandable we see here 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.530
 the temperature and it tells me 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.120
 for example the temperature is normal or 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.380
 be that my phone is boiling like 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.180
 volcano lava 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.920
 Now if you suddenly have the phone 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.240
 with this elevated temperature or 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.740
 you just want to regulate 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.360
 Your phone's temperature is going to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.860
 press this button here and now 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.740
 application starts working not 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.060
 press he makes his process and ready and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.560
 the application starts working here 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.360
 we can see a fan that starts 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.820
 to move then to indicate that the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.290
 application is working now this 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.940
 application has quite options 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.590
 simple if I pressed this button 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.320
 here simply one unfolds 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.240
 bar where will show us the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.500
 options to share now let's continue 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.300
 seeing and knowing more thoroughly this 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.680
 good application now we see that the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.690
 temperature has risen a bit and that a 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.459
 that is what connects the charger 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.959
 when you are playing when you connect 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.150
 the charger you will see that the temperature 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.190
 the phone is going to go up so 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.420
 example if I connect the charger 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.819
 he is going to connect 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.300
 and we see that as the phone in the mode 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.380
 load tends to overload can 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.700
 overheat better said we see what 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.310
 change leaves a message a state that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.390
 it says cooling during charging so 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.459
 this application takes care that the 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.319
 phone does not overheat when 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.730
 we connect the charger or when we are 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.100
 playing if we have activated this 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.600
 good application as we just saw 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.250
 this application is quite simple and 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.140
 useful only by pressing a button 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.640
 let's get our phone 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.440
 regulate its temperature and it does not 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.700
 overheating now let's see the 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.110
 different options that are also 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.970
 basic here is the button of the three 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.370
 points inclusion here we are going to import 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.590
 the settings here we can change mode 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.640
 Fahrenheit is injured if we want to see 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.470
 that these options are pretty 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.880
 understandable so we go back and see 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.560
 who kept pressed for example this 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.910
 button here we will be able to share 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.769
 this application if we like with 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.120
 our friends now press another the 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.530
 button of the three points and we see that 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.420
 we can customize the application here 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.950
 where it says bottom we see that I placed it 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.390
 a soon orange color has already changed 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.100
 of color and let's create each one 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.510
 more personalized application work 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.250
 continues to work normal we press the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.989
 button begins to regulate the temperature 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.580
 so it's a good application for 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.060
 download and remember that they require 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.050
 2.2 and you need to be a user of the phone 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.090
 good friends here ends 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.800
