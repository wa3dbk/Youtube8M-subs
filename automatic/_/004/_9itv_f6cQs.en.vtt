00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
other things in the fanboy and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.460 
other things in the fanboy and
all<00:01:17.610> that's<00:01:17.759> eight<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.930> that's<00:01:19.200> another

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
all that's eight you know that's another

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
all that's eight you know that's another
story<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.250> comes<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.610> what's<00:01:21.119> coming

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
story but when it comes to what's coming

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820 
story but when it comes to what's coming
out<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.960> we're<00:01:22.170> pretty<00:01:22.350> much<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
out when and we're pretty much on the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.499 
out when and we're pretty much on the
pulse<00:01:23.040> when<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> comes<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> don't

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
pulse when it comes to that so I don't

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300

think<00:01:24.659> Sony<00:01:24.960> needs<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.770> advertise<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
think Sony needs to really advertise to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.210 
think Sony needs to really advertise to
to<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.420> type<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.720> community<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> do

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
to that type of community what I do

all the players to Duke we're bringing
again<00:02:17.769> I<00:02:17.980> don't<00:02:18.219> think<00:02:18.280> Nintendo<00:02:18.730> give<00:02:18.909> a

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
again I don't think Nintendo give a

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.059 
again I don't think Nintendo give a
because<00:02:19.510> as<00:02:19.810> long<00:02:19.989> as<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.290> units<00:02:20.620> are<00:02:20.739> moving

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
because as long as the units are moving

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.740 
because as long as the units are moving
in<00:02:21.189> and<00:02:21.340> selling<00:02:21.670> that's<00:02:22.180> what<00:02:22.390> they<00:02:22.510> care

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
in and selling that's what they care

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.720 
in and selling that's what they care
about<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.200> think<00:02:23.680> that's<00:02:23.859> the<00:02:23.980> strategy<00:02:24.250> so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
about I think that's the strategy so

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.729 
about I think that's the strategy so

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
think it's a great piece of hardware but

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.629 
think it's a great piece of hardware but
at<00:02:41.439> that<00:02:41.469> price<00:02:41.709> point<00:02:41.829> I<00:02:42.189> think<00:02:42.400> it's<00:02:42.519> still

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
at that price point I think it's still

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.789 
at that price point I think it's still
too<00:02:42.819> high<00:02:42.969> it<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.689> a<00:02:43.719> great<00:02:44.049> piece<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.290> hardware

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
too high it is a great piece of hardware

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.890 
too high it is a great piece of hardware

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
you've done 02 no advertising what would

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.479
