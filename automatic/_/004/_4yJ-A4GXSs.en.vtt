00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.299 
brain balance is an after-school
Learning<00:00:06.839> Center<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.470> we<00:00:07.890> work<00:00:08.130> with

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
Learning Center and we work with

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.060 
Learning Center and we work with
children<00:00:08.370> ages<00:00:08.970> 4<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.360> 17<00:00:10.110> who<00:00:10.410> are<00:00:10.559> challenged

interaction<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:14.280> kind<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.179> felt<00:00:15.420> lost

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
interaction I kind of felt lost

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.260 
interaction I kind of felt lost
sometimes<00:00:16.460> because<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.609> always<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:18.029> all

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
sometimes because I always have all

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.029 
sometimes because I always have all
these<00:00:18.420> questions<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.890> what

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
these questions and I and I know what

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.290 
these questions and I and I know what
the<00:00:23.130> question<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.730> don't<00:00:24.000> know<00:00:24.119> how<00:00:24.240> to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
the question is but I don't know how to

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.630 
the question is but I don't know how to
ask<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.810> because<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.980> brain<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.250> always

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
ask it because my brain is always

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.790 
ask it because my brain is always
somewhere<00:00:27.570> else<00:00:27.810> if<00:00:28.310> teachers<00:00:29.310> parents<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
somewhere else if teachers parents and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.970 
somewhere else if teachers parents and
other<00:00:31.800> practitioners<00:00:32.750> recognize<00:00:33.750> or<00:00:34.230> observe

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
other practitioners recognize or observe

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.580 
other practitioners recognize or observe
oh<00:00:35.460> there's<00:00:36.210> something<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.989> with

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
oh there's something going on with

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.450 
oh there's something going on with
little<00:00:38.160> Jeannie<00:00:38.430> she's<00:00:39.059> having<00:00:39.360> difficulty

little Jeannie she's having difficulty
socializing<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.140> then<00:00:44.129> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
socializing if that is so then that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.720 
socializing if that is so then that
could<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.329> indicative<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.739> weakness<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.520> her

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
could be indicative of a weakness in her

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.160 
could be indicative of a weakness in her
neurological<00:00:48.360> development

neurological development

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.080 
neurological development
I<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.559> always<00:00:49.739> hard<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.039> me<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.399> keep<00:00:50.610> my

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
I was always hard for me to keep my

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.990 
I was always hard for me to keep my
brain<00:00:51.870> together<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.410> one<00:00:52.590> place<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.640> always

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
brain together in one place and I always

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.209 
brain together in one place and I always
said<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> bunch<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.110> random<00:00:55.500> stuff<00:00:55.710> at<00:00:55.890> random

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
said a bunch of random stuff at random

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.520 
said a bunch of random stuff at random
times<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.090> wasn't<00:00:57.360> necessary<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.140> that

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
times when it wasn't necessary and that

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.819 
times when it wasn't necessary and that
kind<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.120> made<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.170> awkward<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.199> my<00:01:01.440> friends

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
kind of made it awkward for my friends

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770 
kind of made it awkward for my friends
the<00:01:02.430> children<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.000> work<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.480> brain

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
balance have functional disconnection

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.289 
balance have functional disconnection
syndrome<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.460> underlying

labels<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.170> use<00:01:13.350> with<00:01:13.530> our<00:01:13.560> children<00:01:13.680> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
labels that we use with our children and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
labels that we use with our children and
all<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> means<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.240> different<00:01:15.840> areas<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> the

all it means is different areas of the

growth<00:01:26.310> okay<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.960> grow<00:01:28.170> through

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
growth okay and as we grow through

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.039 
growth okay and as we grow through
several<00:01:28.770> years<00:01:29.070> we're<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> develop

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
several years we're going to develop

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.140 
several years we're going to develop
more<00:01:31.049> progressively<00:01:31.799> higher<00:01:32.520> orders<00:01:33.000> of

function and those orders or function
are<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.840> call<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.229> lower

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
are going to be what we call the lower

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.819 
are going to be what we call the lower
brain<00:01:37.979> mid<00:01:38.729> brain<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> cortex<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
brain mid brain and then the cortex and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.499 
brain mid brain and then the cortex and
the<00:01:41.310> cortex<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.880> start<00:01:42.119> getting<00:01:42.360> more

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the cortex we start getting more

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.899 
the cortex we start getting more
differentiation<00:01:43.790> specialization<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
differentiation specialization of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.340 
differentiation specialization of
function<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:45.810> where<00:01:46.079> learning

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
function and that's where learning

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.840 
function and that's where learning
occurs<00:01:47.280> there<00:01:47.820> are<00:01:48.030> specific<00:01:48.689> milestones

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
occurs there are specific milestones

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.770 
occurs there are specific milestones
neurologically<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.119> need<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.420> reached

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
neurologically that need to be reached

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.670 
neurologically that need to be reached
for<00:01:52.200> children<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.890> ready

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
for children to be ready

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.030 
for children to be ready
for<00:01:54.490> learning<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.890> appropriate<00:01:56.890> behavior

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
for learning and appropriate behavior

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.190 
for learning and appropriate behavior
and<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.060> it's<00:01:58.180> very<00:01:58.360> important<00:01:58.870> that<00:01:58.930> each

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
and so it's very important that each

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.760 
and so it's very important that each
stage<00:01:59.740> of<00:02:00.040> development<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:01.150> child<00:02:02.080> is<00:02:02.260> able<00:02:02.410> to

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
stage of development a child is able to

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.940 
stage of development a child is able to
go<00:02:02.980> through<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.730> specific<00:02:04.390> milestones<00:02:04.990> so

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
go through the specific milestones so

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.850 
go through the specific milestones so
that<00:02:06.100> when<00:02:06.280> they<00:02:06.430> get<00:02:06.730> to<00:02:07.210> school<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:08.590> are

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
that when they get to school they are

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.760 
that when they get to school they are
able<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.550> function<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:11.290> learning

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
able to function in a learning

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.210 
able to function in a learning
environment<00:02:11.860> or<00:02:12.640> able<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.600> function

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
environment or able to function

we're actually growing pathways the
brain<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:34.959> plastic<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.489> can<00:03:36.640> be<00:03:36.760> changed

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
brain is plastic and it can be changed

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.930 
brain is plastic and it can be changed
the<00:03:37.690> way<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.959> brain<00:03:38.200> works<00:03:38.590> is<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.760> works

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
the way the brain works is that it works

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.900 
the way the brain works is that it works
by<00:03:40.260> activation<00:03:41.260> your<00:03:41.920> growth<00:03:42.220> comes<00:03:42.580> from<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
by activation your growth comes from the

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.390 
by activation your growth comes from the
bottom<00:03:43.090> up<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.630> then<00:03:44.440> control<00:03:45.100> and

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
bottom up and then control and

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.740 
bottom up and then control and
meaningful<00:03:45.760> action<00:03:46.060> comes<00:03:46.269> from<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.540> top

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
meaningful action comes from the top

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.350 
meaningful action comes from the top
down<00:03:47.049> so<00:03:47.860> what<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.160> means<00:03:48.430> is<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:48.730> as<00:03:49.120> we

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
down so what that means is that as we

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.430 
down so what that means is that as we
grow<00:03:50.580> its<00:03:51.580> movement<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.360> activation<00:03:53.080> and

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
grow its movement and activation and

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.940 
grow its movement and activation and
stimulations<00:03:54.250> turns<00:03:54.760> on<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.450> brain<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.230> so

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
stimulations turns on the brain and so

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.670 
stimulations turns on the brain and so
to<00:03:57.010> do<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.459> you're<00:03:58.239> actually<00:03:58.510> creating<00:03:59.290> an

to do that you're actually creating an

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.640 
to do that you're actually creating an
environment<00:04:00.340> where<00:04:00.989> children's<00:04:01.989> brains<00:04:02.320> can

environment where children's brains can

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.460 
environment where children's brains can
continue<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.370> grow<00:04:03.549> in

the natural way that they were designed

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.260 
the natural way that they were designed
to<00:04:06.960> grow<00:04:07.140> through<00:04:07.560> movement<00:04:08.070> but<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:09.060> are

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
to grow through movement but you are

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.750 
to grow through movement but you are
controlling<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.020> movements<00:04:10.710> based<00:04:11.370> on

controlling the movements based on
something<00:04:12.450> we<00:04:12.570> call<00:04:12.780> multi<00:04:13.230> modality

that's in a word problem and I have to

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.620 
that's in a word problem and I have to

so we're working from that hemispheric

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.909 
so we're working from that hemispheric
perspective<00:06:06.150> to<00:06:06.660> build<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.110> weakness<00:06:07.590> so<00:06:07.800> it

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
perspective to build the weakness so it

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.510 
perspective to build the weakness so it
can<00:06:08.130> be<00:06:08.400> as<00:06:08.550> strong<00:06:09.240> as<00:06:09.510> the<00:06:09.630> other<00:06:09.750> side

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520
