00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.780 
imagine yourself wearing a suit of armor
and<00:00:07.200> even<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.980> thousand<00:00:08.340> feet<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.610> water

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
and even in a thousand feet of water

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.120 
and even in a thousand feet of water
you're<00:00:09.480> able<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> move<00:00:09.840> your<00:00:10.019> arms<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.590> move

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
you're able to move your arms and move

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.919 
you're able to move your arms and move
your<00:00:11.250> legs<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.929> enact<00:00:12.929> very<00:00:13.230> human-like<00:00:14.929> it's

your legs and enact very human-like it's

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.420 
your legs and enact very human-like it's
one<00:00:16.109> thing<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.350> get<00:00:16.470> there<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:16.980> an<00:00:17.100> entirely

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
one thing to get there it's an entirely

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.359 
one thing to get there it's an entirely
different<00:00:17.640> thing<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.840> get<00:00:19.050> there<00:00:19.369> be

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
different thing to get there be

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.519 
different thing to get there be
comfortable<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.180> work<00:00:21.510> efficiently<00:00:21.840> bring

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
comfortable and work efficiently bring

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.560 
comfortable and work efficiently bring
home<00:00:22.650> meaningful<00:00:23.100> data<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:24.060> will

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
home meaningful data that will

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.040 
home meaningful data that will
ultimately<00:00:25.080> carry<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> science<00:00:26.220> forward<00:00:27.050> so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
ultimately carry the science forward so

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.300 
ultimately carry the science forward so
the<00:00:28.140> exosuit<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.619> an<00:00:28.710> atmospheric<00:00:29.099> diving

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the exosuit is an atmospheric diving

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.609 
the exosuit is an atmospheric diving
system<00:00:29.820> atmospheric<00:00:30.539> meaning<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.019> when<00:00:31.529> you

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
system atmospheric meaning that when you

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.049 
system atmospheric meaning that when you
dive<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> system<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.520> keeps<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:32.969> at

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
dive the system it keeps you here at

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.020 
dive the system it keeps you here at
surface<00:00:33.390> pressure<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:35.219> by<00:00:35.370> protecting<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
surface pressure so by protecting the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.510 
surface pressure so by protecting the
pilot<00:00:36.510> you're<00:00:37.320> removing<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.860> complication

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
pilot you're removing the complication

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.419 
pilot you're removing the complication
of<00:00:38.579> human<00:00:38.850> physiology

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.439 

since<00:00:43.429> you<00:00:44.089> subtract<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.769> restriction<00:00:46.730> then

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
since you subtract the restriction then

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.750 
since you subtract the restriction then
archaeologists<00:00:48.320> can<00:00:48.500> stay<00:00:49.070> down<00:00:49.250> there<00:00:49.460> and

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
archaeologists can stay down there and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.810 
archaeologists can stay down there and
do<00:00:49.909> the<00:00:49.969> excavation<00:00:50.809> good<00:00:50.989> cells

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.209 

bringing<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.329> appropriate<00:00:57.960> people<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:59.039> work

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
bringing the appropriate people to work

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.240 
bringing the appropriate people to work
on<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.519> side<00:01:03.049> taking<00:01:04.049> consideration<00:01:05.040> that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
on the side taking consideration that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.570 
on the side taking consideration that
the<00:01:06.210> Kittredge<00:01:06.600> shipwreck<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.860> more<00:01:08.460> or

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the Kittredge shipwreck is a more or

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.020 
the Kittredge shipwreck is a more or
less<00:01:08.640> deep<00:01:09.270> secret

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.999 

there<00:01:17.030> are<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.180> lot<00:01:17.659> of<00:01:17.689> a<00:01:17.960> lot<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.350> abilities

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
there are a lot of a lot of abilities

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.399 
there are a lot of a lot of abilities
for<00:01:19.250> our<00:01:19.369> work<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.030> our<00:01:20.119> project<00:01:20.659> in<00:01:21.170> this

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
for our work and our project in this

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.680 
for our work and our project in this
kind<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.830> equipment<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.330> it's<00:01:23.479> quite

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
kind of equipment so it's quite

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.920 
kind of equipment so it's quite
important<00:01:24.290> for<00:01:24.380> us<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:25.280> be<00:01:25.430> there<00:01:25.930> piloting

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
important for us to be there piloting

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.340 
important for us to be there piloting
the<00:01:27.670> exosuit<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:28.909> with<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:29.960> kind<00:01:30.229> of

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
the exosuit and with this kind of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.920 
the exosuit and with this kind of
equipment<00:01:30.470> we<00:01:30.920> can<00:01:31.070> stay<00:01:31.820> there<00:01:32.060> for<00:01:32.360> for<00:01:32.869> an

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
equipment we can stay there for for an

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.330 
equipment we can stay there for for an
hour

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.900 

never<00:01:36.340> an<00:01:37.020> archaeologist<00:01:38.020> at<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.710> chance<00:01:39.280> to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
never an archaeologist at the chance to

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.710 
never an archaeologist at the chance to
be<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.090> decide<00:01:40.890> which<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:42.040> actually<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.820> the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
be a decide which is actually the the

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.960 
be a decide which is actually the the
birthplace<00:01:44.230> of<00:01:44.260> further<00:01:45.040> water<00:01:45.280> archeology

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
birthplace of further water archeology

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.710 
birthplace of further water archeology
that<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:48.310> illustrates<00:01:48.610> why<00:01:49.360> it's<00:01:49.540> so

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
that also illustrates why it's so

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.630 
that also illustrates why it's so
important<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.320> trust<00:01:50.740> your<00:01:50.890> team<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.520> work

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
important to trust your team to work

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.640 
important to trust your team to work
effectively<00:01:51.940> together<00:01:52.390> because<00:01:53.230> once<00:01:53.500> you're

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
effectively together because once you're

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.590 
effectively together because once you're
in<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.860> suit<00:01:54.070> you're<00:01:54.670> in<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.910> suit<00:01:55.120> until<00:01:55.510> you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
in the suit you're in the suit until you

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.170 
in the suit you're in the suit until you
let<00:01:55.780> on

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.240
