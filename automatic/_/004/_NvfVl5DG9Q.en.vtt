okay<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.480> was<00:00:03.720> asked<00:00:04.020> about<00:00:04.080> how<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.380> had<00:00:04.560> my

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
okay I was asked about how I had my

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.760 
okay I was asked about how I had my
battery<00:00:05.069> set<00:00:05.400> up<00:00:05.549> for<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.879> 600<00:00:06.540> I've<00:00:07.500> got<00:00:07.680> it

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
battery set up for the 600 I've got it

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.770 
battery set up for the 600 I've got it
set<00:00:08.010> up<00:00:08.040> in<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.309> series<00:00:09.349> I<00:00:10.940> used<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> ec5

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
set up in a series I used the ec5

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.630 
set up in a series I used the ec5
connectors<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.740> there<00:00:14.210> so<00:00:16.190> when<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.250> attach

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
connectors on there so when you attach

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.099 
connectors on there so when you attach
them<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.940> your<00:00:18.060> batteries<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.630> want<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> use

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
them to your batteries you want to use

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.880 
them to your batteries you want to use
the<00:00:20.039> only<00:00:20.340> use<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.580> female<00:00:20.820> ends<00:00:21.380> on<00:00:22.380> your

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the only use the female ends on your

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.509 
the only use the female ends on your
batteries<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:25.340> when<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.699> your<00:00:28.519> your

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
batteries and when you make your your

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.049 
batteries and when you make your your
series<00:00:29.880> connector<00:00:30.619> harness<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.850> buy

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
series connector harness you can buy

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.290 
series connector harness you can buy
these<00:00:33.290> or<00:00:34.290> make<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.980> made<00:00:35.190> mine<00:00:35.430> pretty<00:00:36.210> easy

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
these or make it I made mine pretty easy

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.030 
these or make it I made mine pretty easy
to<00:00:36.450> make<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.930> used<00:00:37.469> them<00:00:39.469> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.590> ten<00:00:40.829> gauge

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to make I used them this is ten gauge

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.970 
to make I used them this is ten gauge
wire<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.730> fairly<00:00:42.000> thick<00:00:42.739> reason<00:00:43.739> being

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
wire here is fairly thick reason being

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.959 
wire here is fairly thick reason being
the<00:00:44.489> batteries<00:00:45.200> they<00:00:46.200> come<00:00:46.530> with<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.250> 12<00:00:47.879> gauge

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the batteries they come with a 12 gauge

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.369 
the batteries they come with a 12 gauge
wiring<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> 10<00:00:50.789> gauge<00:00:51.379> already

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
wiring and I have the 10 gauge already

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.229 
wiring and I have the 10 gauge already
so<00:00:52.860> uh<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.399> wouldn't<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.480> any<00:00:54.690> sinner<00:00:55.969> then<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
so uh I wouldn't go any sinner then the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.450 
so uh I wouldn't go any sinner then the
what<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> batteries<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> 12

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
what they have on the batteries the 12

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
what they have on the batteries the 12
if<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.750> wire<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> probably<00:01:01.350> get<00:01:01.500> hot

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
if you do your wire to probably get hot

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.240 
if you do your wire to probably get hot
on<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.160> might<00:01:02.850> burn<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:04.290> uh<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.769> don't<00:01:05.100> want

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
on you might burn up so uh I don't want

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.620 
on you might burn up so uh I don't want
the<00:01:05.339> 12<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> 10<00:01:07.100> 10<00:01:08.100> gauge<00:01:08.510> like<00:01:09.510> so

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the 12 or with the 10 10 gauge like so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.859 
the 12 or with the 10 10 gauge like so
it's<00:01:09.750> pretty<00:01:09.930> simple<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> make<00:01:11.600> up<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.689> three

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it's pretty simple to make up to three

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.160 
it's pretty simple to make up to three
pieces<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.350> wire<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.799> your<00:01:13.950> three<00:01:14.130> connectors

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
pieces of wire get your three connectors

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.109 
pieces of wire get your three connectors
remember<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.290> your<00:01:16.439> batteries<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.880> use

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
remember on your batteries that you use

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.550 
remember on your batteries that you use
use<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.750> female<00:01:18.990> ends<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.060> I'm<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.409> your

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
use the female ends so I'm not on your

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.310 
use the female ends so I'm not on your
harness<00:01:23.090> that<00:01:24.090> you're<00:01:24.750> gonna<00:01:24.840> connect<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
harness that you're gonna connect to the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.749 
harness that you're gonna connect to the
batteries<00:01:25.740> you're<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> use<00:01:26.250> put<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
batteries you're going to use put the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.289 
batteries you're going to use put the
males<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.220> other<00:01:29.430> end<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.119> course

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
males on there the other end of course

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.190 
males on there the other end of course
because<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.409> ESC<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.850> FC<00:01:33.299> has<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> male<00:01:33.840> ends

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
because the ESC the FC has a male ends

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.340 
because the ESC the FC has a male ends
so<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> top<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:35.040> will<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> females<00:01:36.540> now

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
so the top one will have the females now

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.700 
so the top one will have the females now
when<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.560> run<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:37.860> wires<00:01:39.320> used<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
when you run your wires used to get the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.230 
when you run your wires used to get the
positive<00:01:41.369> Y<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.450> positive<00:01:42.990> here

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
positive Y here so be positive here

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.600 
positive Y here so be positive here
positive<00:01:45.240> down<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:47.009> other<00:01:47.130> side<00:01:47.430> is

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
positive down here the other side is

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.450 
positive down here the other side is
negative<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:49.200> negative<00:01:49.229> now<00:01:49.920> your<00:01:50.070> bottom

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
negative to negative now your bottom

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.020 
negative to negative now your bottom
wire<00:01:51.020> will<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:53.630> positive<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.049> side<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
wire will be positive on one side and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.940 
wire will be positive on one side and
negative<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.840> other

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:13.920 

there<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.010> can<00:02:04.100> see<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.310> sign<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.940> symbols

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:24.250 

yeah<00:02:14.930> see<00:02:16.150> negative<00:02:21.700> positive<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.360> like<00:02:24.170> I

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
yeah see negative positive and like I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.160 
yeah see negative positive and like I
said<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.560> other<00:02:24.650> ones<00:02:24.950> negative<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:27.140> negative

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
said the other ones negative to negative

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.030 
said the other ones negative to negative
and<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.250> read<00:02:28.660> positive<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:32.390> positive<00:02:33.040> it's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
and the read positive to positive it's

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.170 
and the read positive to positive it's
important<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.670> get<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:34.970> right

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
important that you get that right

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.010 
important that you get that right
otherwise<00:02:35.540> you're<00:02:35.750> gonna<00:02:35.870> fry<00:02:36.170> something

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
otherwise you're gonna fry something

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.130 
otherwise you're gonna fry something
that's<00:02:39.020> pretty<00:02:39.260> much<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:41.420> not<00:02:41.690> much<00:02:41.840> to

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
that's pretty much it it's not much to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.949 
that's pretty much it it's not much to
it<00:02:42.790> I'll<00:02:43.790> plug<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.209> up<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.510> show<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.690> how<00:02:44.840> it

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
it I'll plug it up and show you how it

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.140 
it I'll plug it up and show you how it
looks<00:02:44.989> plugged<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:48.370> okay<00:02:49.370> here<00:02:49.670> just<00:02:49.910> plug

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
looks plugged in okay here just plug

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.500 
looks plugged in okay here just plug
into<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.510> batteries<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.910> got<00:02:53.060> one<00:02:53.330> end

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
into the batteries and you got one end

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.729
