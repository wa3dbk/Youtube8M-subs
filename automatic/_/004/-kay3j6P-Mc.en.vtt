to<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.780> something<00:01:18.780> special<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:20.150> this

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
to get something special out of this

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.530 
to get something special out of this
position<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:22.080> white<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:23.070> spite<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
following variation usually white gives

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.480 
following variation usually white gives
the<00:01:30.420> check<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.590> b5<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.759> b3<00:01:33.689> c<00:01:34.110> b3<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:35.159> white

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the check on b5 so b3 c b3 and now white

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.100 
the check on b5 so b3 c b3 and now white
is<00:01:35.850> given<00:01:36.240> check<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.259> b5<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.970> even<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.840> check

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
is given check on b5 but even the check

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.780 
is given check on b5 but even the check
on<00:01:40.439> b5<00:01:40.860> cannot<00:01:41.869> guarantee<00:01:43.009> advantage<00:01:44.009> for

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
on b5 cannot guarantee advantage for

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.770 
on b5 cannot guarantee advantage for
white<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.560> example<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.549> show<00:01:47.970> you
