00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.210 
think it's gonna be a clear winner this
year<00:01:30.110> which<00:01:30.410> is<00:01:30.530> probably<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.830> first<00:01:31.009> time

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
year which is probably the first time

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.889

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
four finishes is a must for us I think a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.570 
four finishes is a must for us I think a
long<00:02:26.840> term<00:02:27.020> plan<00:02:27.260> ahead<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:28.250> we<00:02:28.340> know<00:02:28.430> it's

long term plan ahead and we know it's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.250 
long term plan ahead and we know it's
going<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.760> be<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.880> tough<00:02:29.060> leak<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:29.630> anywhere<00:02:30.110> in
