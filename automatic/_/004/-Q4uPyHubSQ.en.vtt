00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
about youtubers like cherry picking the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.010 
about youtubers like cherry picking the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
best gameplay and of course and this is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
best gameplay and of course and this is
where<00:00:43.290> standards<00:00:43.890> usually<00:00:44.130> come<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:44.730> place

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
where standards usually come into place

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.730 
where standards usually come into place
because<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.930> different<00:00:46.230> people<00:00:46.590> different

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
because for different people different

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.550 
because for different people different
things<00:00:47.310> or<00:00:47.610> difference<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.540> like<00:00:48.900> good<00:00:49.380> or

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.650 
things or difference are like good or
bad<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.130> example<00:00:50.970> this<00:00:51.090> game<00:00:51.330> play<00:00:51.480> right

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the scoreboard so I was doing my part in

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.029 
the scoreboard so I was doing my part in
the<00:01:06.150> gameplay<00:01:06.479> however<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.049> me<00:01:07.170> personally<00:01:07.439> I

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
the gameplay however for me personally I

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.760 
the gameplay however for me personally I
still<00:01:08.640> felt<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.149> this<00:01:09.509> was<00:01:09.899> a<00:01:09.960> bad<00:01:10.229> game<00:01:10.469> play

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
still felt like this was a bad game play

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.279 
still felt like this was a bad game play
at<00:01:10.979> least<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.399> sniping<00:01:11.759> part

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
at least for the sniping part

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.240 
at least for the sniping part
specifically<00:01:13.289> in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.560> last<00:01:13.710> video<00:01:13.890> where<00:01:14.189> I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
specifically in the last video where I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340 
specifically in the last video where I
was<00:01:14.429> talking<00:01:14.670> about<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> FN<00:01:15.270> 57<00:01:15.600> which<00:01:16.140> again

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
was talking about the FN 57 which again

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.959 
was talking about the FN 57 which again
I'm<00:01:16.500> using<00:01:16.530> right<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.520> was<00:01:17.670> some<00:01:17.820> problem

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.239 
I'm using right here it was some problem
because<00:01:18.359> I<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> lots<00:01:19.109> of<00:01:19.289> cool<00:01:19.649> clips<00:01:20.009> with

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249

because I got a lots of cool clips with
pistol<00:01:20.820> however<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.899> aim<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.710> general

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
pistol however my my aim just in general

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.830 
pistol however my my aim just in general
was<00:01:23.159> really<00:01:23.700> sluggish<00:01:23.969> just<00:01:24.359> from<00:01:24.539> my<00:01:24.689> point

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
was really sluggish just from my point

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
was really sluggish just from my point
of<00:01:24.960> view<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.859> for<00:01:26.159> me<00:01:26.310> personally<00:01:26.340> this

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
of view so for me personally this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.410 
of view so for me personally this
gameplay<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:28.079> a<00:01:28.380> bad<00:01:28.619> gameplay<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.429> course<00:01:30.240> if

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
gameplay is a bad gameplay of course if

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.880 
gameplay is a bad gameplay of course if
you<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.049> straight<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.469> look<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.829> the

I'm<00:01:50.009> more<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.909> well<00:01:51.749> you<00:01:51.990> could<00:01:52.170> almost<00:01:53.159> call

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
I'm more of a well you could almost call

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.679 
I'm more of a well you could almost call
me<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.939> guess<00:01:54.179> something<00:01:54.569> like<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
me I guess something like a

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.539 
me I guess something like a
perfectionist<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.039> a<00:01:56.100> positive<00:01:56.310> way

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
perfectionist but like in a positive way

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.639 
perfectionist but like in a positive way
because<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.929> have<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.259> seen<00:01:58.499> my

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
because if you have not seen my

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.529 
because if you have not seen my
perfectionist<00:01:59.159> montage<00:01:59.579> go<00:01:59.909> there<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.509> there

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
perfectionist montage go there go there

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.840 
perfectionist montage go there go there
i<00:02:00.990> will<00:02:01.170> make<00:02:01.439> link<00:02:02.069> somewhere<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.639> you<00:02:02.729> have

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
i will make link somewhere and you have

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.779 
i will make link somewhere and you have
to<00:02:02.999> go<00:02:03.149> there<00:02:03.359> and<00:02:03.479> watch<00:02:03.630> iPad<00:02:04.020> yeah<00:02:04.950> what's

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
to go there and watch iPad yeah what's

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.760 
to go there and watch iPad yeah what's
basically<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:07.289> cannot<00:02:07.530> achieve

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
basically that you cannot achieve

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.730 
basically that you cannot achieve
perfection<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.869> striving<00:02:10.319> for

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
perfection but the striving for

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.160 
perfection but the striving for
perfection<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.820> basically<00:02:12.390> perfection<00:02:13.050> in

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
perfection is basically perfection in

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.100 
perfection is basically perfection in
itself<00:02:13.500> because<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.370> well<00:02:15.360> basically<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
itself because you well basically the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.910 
itself because you well basically the
way

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
way

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.820 
way
to<00:02:17.430> perfection<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.510> already<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.440> goal<00:02:19.650> if

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
to perfection is the already the goal if

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.350 
to perfection is the already the goal if
you<00:02:19.920> know<00:02:20.010> what<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.220> mean<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.580> should

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
you know what I mean and you should

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.910 
you know what I mean and you should
watch<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.630> montage<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.140> want<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.380> know

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
watch the montage if you want to know

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.770 
watch the montage if you want to know
more<00:02:23.190> about<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:23.880> that's<00:02:24.390> basically<00:02:24.510> how

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
more about that but that's basically how

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.809 
more about that but that's basically how
i<00:02:24.959> look<00:02:25.410> at<00:02:25.560> positive<00:02:25.860> perfection<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.610> course

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
i look at positive perfection of course

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.610 
i look at positive perfection of course
there's<00:02:26.940> negative<00:02:27.200> perfection<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.260> well<00:02:28.440> when

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
there's negative perfection as well when

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.940 
there's negative perfection as well when
you're<00:02:28.860> kind<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.220> way<00:02:29.480> more<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:31.410> really

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
you're kind of way more a like really

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.460 
you're kind of way more a like really
nitpicking<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.670> being<00:02:33.540> really<00:02:33.810> precise<00:02:34.260> like

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
nitpicking and being really precise like

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.380 
nitpicking and being really precise like
/<00:02:34.739> really<00:02:34.980> overly<00:02:35.489> precise<00:02:35.850> at<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.150> point

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
/ really overly precise at the point

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.479 
/ really overly precise at the point
where<00:02:36.540> there's<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:37.230> no<00:02:37.500> more<00:02:37.950> performance

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
where there's like no more performance

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.090 
where there's like no more performance
gains<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.970> stuff<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:40.860> would

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
gains and stuff like that and I would

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.850 
gains and stuff like that and I would
probably<00:02:41.489> call<00:02:42.150> myself<00:02:42.270> more<00:02:42.600> poor<00:02:42.989> positive

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
probably call myself more poor positive

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.370 
probably call myself more poor positive
perfectionist<00:02:44.519> however<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.720> usually<00:02:46.230> means

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
perfectionist however this usually means

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.870 
perfectionist however this usually means
that<00:02:46.650> for<00:02:46.739> example<00:02:46.830> when<00:02:47.250> I'm<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:47.849> a

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
that for example when I'm going for a

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.699 
that for example when I'm going for a
game<00:02:48.030> play<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.300> I'm<00:02:48.989> often<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.560> for

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
game play and I'm often going for

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.530 
game play and I'm often going for
gameplay<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.489> I've<00:02:50.580> around<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.269> right

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
gameplay and I've around like this right

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.960 
gameplay and I've around like this right
here<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.989> will<00:02:52.140> most<00:02:52.830> likely<00:02:53.010> lead<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.760> right

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
here I will most likely lead it right

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.970 
here I will most likely lead it right
after<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.330> because<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.959> was<00:02:55.170> feeling<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.530> okay

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
after it because I was feeling like okay

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.670 
after it because I was feeling like okay
this<00:02:56.220> shot<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.489> miss<00:02:56.760> DS<00:02:57.390> shots<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.989> it's<00:02:58.500> just

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
this shot I miss DS shots and it's just

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.009 
this shot I miss DS shots and it's just
so<00:02:58.980> many<00:02:59.160> shots<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.760> I've<00:03:00.330> made<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:00.989> many

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
so many shots and I've made so many

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.170 
so many shots and I've made so many
stupid<00:03:01.350> decisions<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.400> mistakes<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:03.090> they

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
stupid decisions and mistakes and they

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.550 
stupid decisions and mistakes and they
got<00:03:03.360> me<00:03:03.480> killed<00:03:03.720> over<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.110> over<00:03:04.170> again<00:03:04.319> and

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
got me killed over and over again and

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.949 
got me killed over and over again and
then<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:05.190> got<00:03:05.340> they<00:03:05.610> were<00:03:05.670> like<00:03:05.940> lots<00:03:06.239> of<00:03:06.390> crappy

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
then I got they were like lots of crappy

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.890 
then I got they were like lots of crappy
death<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.670> buying<00:03:08.670> behind<00:03:08.940> cover<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.450> lots

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
death with buying behind cover like lots

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.600 
death with buying behind cover like lots
of<00:03:09.989> unnecessary<00:03:10.260> stuff<00:03:10.799> which<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.280> think

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
of unnecessary stuff which I think

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.030 
of unnecessary stuff which I think
nobody<00:03:11.940> wants<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.480> see<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.350> again<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.890> in

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
nobody wants to see and again this in

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.890 
nobody wants to see and again this in
return<00:03:14.190> makes<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.940> bad<00:03:15.150> gameplay<00:03:15.420> for<00:03:15.750> me

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
return makes it a bad gameplay for me

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.630 
return makes it a bad gameplay for me
now<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.709> course<00:03:16.739> when<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.370> talk<00:03:17.610> about

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
now of course when you talk about

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.000 
now of course when you talk about
standards<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.780> kind<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.260> known<00:03:19.470> thing<00:03:19.709> so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
standards this kind of a known thing so

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.860 
standards this kind of a known thing so
for<00:03:20.549> example<00:03:20.640> 4<00:03:21.030> montage<00:03:21.239> standards<00:03:21.780> these

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
for example 4 montage standards these

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.360 
for example 4 montage standards these
days<00:03:22.109> you<00:03:22.380> want<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.709> have<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.829> high<00:03:23.100> point

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
days you want to have a high point

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.849 
days you want to have a high point
streak<00:03:23.730> for<00:03:24.690> me<00:03:24.840> again<00:03:25.109> personally<00:03:25.530> though<00:03:25.650> I

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
streak for me again personally though I

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.380 
streak for me again personally though I
do<00:03:25.920> not<00:03:26.220> just<00:03:26.609> want<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.850> have<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> high<00:03:27.180> point

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
do not just want to have a high point

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.940 
do not just want to have a high point
streak<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.840> want<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.109> have<00:03:28.200> really<00:03:28.650> clean<00:03:28.920> and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
streak I want to have really clean and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.039 
streak I want to have really clean and
simple<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:30.150> should<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.750> should<00:03:30.780> look

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
simple like it should it should look
