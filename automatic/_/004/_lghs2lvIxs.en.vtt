the audio quality should be different

the audio quality should be different
the<00:00:44.879> audio<00:00:45.090> quality<00:00:45.210> should<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:46.200> better<00:00:46.469> some

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the audio quality should be better some

now I'm very close to a wall which is
definitely<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.640> change<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> acoustics

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
definitely going to change the acoustics

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.880 
definitely going to change the acoustics
of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> room<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.140> I've<00:01:01.260> definitely<00:01:01.410> worked

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
real hard and real long to try to figure

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.179 
real hard and real long to try to figure
out<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.549> best<00:01:05.760> method<00:01:06.330> possible<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:07.189> provide

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
out the best method possible to provide

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.670 
out the best method possible to provide
you<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.970> one<00:01:09.119> hundred<00:01:09.390> percent<00:01:09.420> quality<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
you know one hundred percent quality to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.320 
you know one hundred percent quality to
my<00:01:10.890> video<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.280> my<00:01:11.400> girlfriend<00:01:11.909> said<00:01:12.119> when<00:01:12.299> she

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
my video now my girlfriend said when she

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
my video now my girlfriend said when she
was<00:01:12.570> listening<00:01:13.020> back<00:01:13.470> someone<00:01:13.890> said<00:01:14.430> she's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
was listening back someone said she's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.300 
was listening back someone said she's
like<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.780> makes<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.320> voice<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> little<00:01:17.159> bit

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
like it makes you voice out a little bit

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.270 
like it makes you voice out a little bit
higher<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.170> maybe<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.799> deeper<00:01:20.130> voice

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
higher so maybe I do have a deeper voice

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.710 
higher so maybe I do have a deeper voice
and<00:01:20.610> maybe<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.270> me<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.450> somebody

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and maybe if you see me on somebody

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.450 
and maybe if you see me on somebody
else's<00:01:22.140> channel<00:01:22.470> or<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> podcast

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
else's channel or if I'm in a podcast

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.100 
else's channel or if I'm in a podcast
again<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:23.970> something<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.750> might

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
again or something like that I might

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.749 
again or something like that I might
have<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.890> deeper<00:01:26.070> voice<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
have a little bit of a deeper voice and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.600 
have a little bit of a deeper voice and
but<00:01:27.360> either<00:01:27.570> way<00:01:27.890> what<00:01:28.890> I've<00:01:29.009> managed<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> do

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
but either way what I've managed to do

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.660 
but either way what I've managed to do
here<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.500> hopefully<00:01:31.500> remove<00:01:31.950> not<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
here is hopefully remove not just the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.399 
here is hopefully remove not just the
background<00:01:33.090> noise<00:01:33.119> which<00:01:33.450> could<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> little

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
background noise which could be a little

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.920 
background noise which could be a little
humming<00:01:34.860> sound<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.460> also<00:01:35.790> remove<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.659> sort<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
humming sound but also remove a sort of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.749 
humming sound but also remove a sort of
drop<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.710> bass<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.159> customize<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.409> and

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
drop the bass and customize that and

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.859 
drop the bass and customize that and
equalize<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.210> sort<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.479> things<00:01:42.689> are

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
equalize it and that sort of things are

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.920 
equalize it and that sort of things are
that<00:01:42.990> way<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:44.130> come<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.600> good

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that way it can come out with a good

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.690 
that way it can come out with a good
tone<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.590> good<00:01:47.100> pitch<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:48.390> even<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.700> I've
