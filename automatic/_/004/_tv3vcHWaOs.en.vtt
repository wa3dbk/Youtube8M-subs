blossom<00:02:46.220> factory<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:48.410> can't<00:02:48.620> actually

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
blossom factory so you can't actually

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.130 
blossom factory so you can't actually
see<00:02:49.040> them<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.489> there<00:02:49.700> are<00:02:49.849> clay<00:02:50.120> pots<00:02:50.810> and

I've planted fire blossoms in there and
the<00:02:53.599> only<00:02:53.780> way<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.290> these<00:02:55.160> actually<00:02:55.879> grow<00:02:56.090> is

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
the only way that these actually grow is

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.539

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
goes for water leaf there you can see

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.390 
goes for water leaf there you can see
some<00:03:02.480> water<00:03:02.690> leave<00:03:02.930> growing<00:03:03.319> there<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.680> need<00:03:04.310> to

okay<00:05:51.289> we<00:05:51.410> also<00:05:51.530> need<00:05:51.740> some<00:05:51.889> space<00:05:52.190> for

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
okay we also need some space for

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.090 
okay we also need some space for
collecting<00:05:53.030> so<00:05:53.240> I<00:05:53.270> think<00:05:53.389> and<00:05:54.260> we<00:05:54.919> need

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
collecting so I think and we need

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.770 
collecting so I think and we need
torches<00:05:55.370> or<00:05:55.669> so<00:05:55.880> so<00:05:56.060> I<00:05:56.090> think<00:05:56.180> this<00:05:56.449> is<00:05:56.630> cool

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
torches or so so I think this is cool

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.750 
torches or so so I think this is cool
alright<00:05:57.080> guys<00:05:57.260> so<00:05:57.440> let's<00:05:57.530> do<00:05:57.740> this<00:05:57.889> let's<00:05:58.490> do

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
alright guys so let's do this let's do

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.800 
alright guys so let's do this let's do
the<00:05:58.910> stay<00:05:59.470> I'm<00:06:00.470> gonna<00:06:00.650> start<00:06:00.919> on<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.810> right

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
the stay I'm gonna start on the right

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.890 
the stay I'm gonna start on the right
guys<00:06:03.050> so<00:06:03.229> what<00:06:03.350> the<00:06:03.440> aim<00:06:03.680> is<00:06:03.850> in<00:06:04.850> this<00:06:05.479> exercise

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
guys so what the aim is in this exercise

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.800 
guys so what the aim is in this exercise
is<00:06:06.380> to<00:06:06.470> build<00:06:07.010> a<00:06:07.250> shot<00:06:07.580> that<00:06:07.940> is<00:06:08.060> at<00:06:08.210> least<00:06:08.240> five

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
is to build a shot that is at least five

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.080 
is to build a shot that is at least five
blocks<00:06:09.260> wide<00:06:09.560> all<00:06:09.949> the<00:06:10.190> way<00:06:10.280> down<00:06:10.490> to<00:06:10.520> hell<00:06:10.850> and

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
blocks wide all the way down to hell and

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.800 
blocks wide all the way down to hell and
that's<00:06:11.630> going<00:06:11.750> to<00:06:11.870> prevent<00:06:12.289> any<00:06:12.970> of<00:06:13.970> the

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
that's going to prevent any of the

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.080 
that's going to prevent any of the
corruption<00:06:15.110> spreading<00:06:15.949> across<00:06:16.430> that<00:06:16.850> gap

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
corruption spreading across that gap

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.420 
corruption spreading across that gap
into<00:06:17.419> the<00:06:17.630> Frodo<00:06:17.979> so<00:06:18.979> that<00:06:19.250> is<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:19.520> plan<00:06:21.430> but

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
into the Frodo so that is the plan but

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.969 
into the Frodo so that is the plan but
the<00:06:22.580> question<00:06:23.090> is<00:06:23.440> where<00:06:24.440> to<00:06:24.830> build<00:06:25.400> the<00:06:26.240> shaft

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
the question is where to build the shaft

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.879 
the question is where to build the shaft
and<00:06:27.979> I<00:06:28.190> think<00:06:28.580> I'm<00:06:28.789> gonna<00:06:29.030> because<00:06:30.020> the

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
and I think I'm gonna because the

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.260 
and I think I'm gonna because the
problem<00:06:31.130> with<00:06:31.310> the<00:06:31.400> corruption<00:06:31.849> is<00:06:31.970> that<00:06:32.150> it

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
problem with the corruption is that it

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.890 
problem with the corruption is that it
also<00:06:32.479> spawns<00:06:34.120> underneath<00:06:36.760> you<00:06:37.760> know<00:06:37.910> see<00:06:38.660> for

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
also spawns underneath you know see for

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.850 
also spawns underneath you know see for
example<00:06:38.990> what<00:06:39.470> what<00:06:39.710> is<00:06:39.830> that

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
example what what is that

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.399 
example what what is that
okay<00:06:42.610> that<00:06:43.210> was<00:06:43.330> a<00:06:43.360> little<00:06:43.449> bit<00:06:43.689> of<00:06:43.840> a<00:06:44.020> little

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.409 
okay that was a little bit of a little

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:45.899 
okay that was a little bit of a little
bit<00:06:44.500> of<00:06:44.590> sunlight<00:06:44.800> but<00:06:45.129> the<00:06:45.550> corruption

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
bit of sunlight but the corruption

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:48.899 
bit of sunlight but the corruption
actually<00:06:46.150> spawns<00:06:46.479> underground<00:06:47.289> also<00:06:47.740> so<00:06:48.069> if

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:48.909 
actually spawns underground also so if

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:52.679 
actually spawns underground also so if
you<00:06:49.210> if<00:06:49.569> you<00:06:49.780> build<00:06:50.020> your<00:06:50.169> shaft<00:06:51.509> you<00:06:52.509> know<00:06:52.629> if

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:52.689 
you if you build your shaft you know if

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:54.209 
you if you build your shaft you know if
I<00:06:53.050> build<00:06:53.199> the<00:06:53.319> shaft<00:06:53.620> now<00:06:53.830> and<00:06:54.039> there's<00:06:54.159> a

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:54.219 
I build the shaft now and there's a

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:55.170 
I build the shaft now and there's a
little<00:06:54.340> bit<00:06:54.520> of<00:06:54.580> corruption<00:06:55.000> on<00:06:55.090> the

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
little bit of corruption on the

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.390 
little bit of corruption on the
left-hand<00:06:55.539> side<00:06:55.599> of<00:06:55.840> that<00:06:55.900> Sheriff<00:06:56.349> then<00:06:56.979> I<00:06:57.189> am

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
left-hand side of that Sheriff then I am

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.409 
left-hand side of that Sheriff then I am
screwed<00:06:58.770> and<00:06:59.770> that's<00:07:00.520> obviously<00:07:00.909> not<00:07:01.000> what<00:07:01.300> we

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
screwed and that's obviously not what we

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.320 
screwed and that's obviously not what we
want<00:07:01.629> so<00:07:02.159> we're<00:07:03.159> gonna<00:07:03.280> try<00:07:03.520> and<00:07:03.699> find<00:07:03.879> a<00:07:04.000> spot

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
want so we're gonna try and find a spot

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.659 
want so we're gonna try and find a spot
that<00:07:04.360> is<00:07:04.599> perfect<00:07:05.139> for<00:07:05.199> the<00:07:05.379> shape<00:07:05.620> and<00:07:05.949> I

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669 
that is perfect for the shape and I

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.320 
that is perfect for the shape and I
think<00:07:07.270> that<00:07:07.509> maybe<00:07:07.780> this<00:07:08.319> spot<00:07:08.800> right<00:07:08.830> here<00:07:09.330> is

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
think that maybe this spot right here is

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.869 
think that maybe this spot right here is
where<00:07:10.870> are<00:07:11.590> we<00:07:11.680> going<00:07:11.860> to<00:07:11.949> start<00:07:12.189> and<00:07:13.229> and

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:14.879 
where are we going to start and and

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.939 
where are we going to start and and
we're<00:07:15.879> going<00:07:16.029> to<00:07:16.060> be<00:07:16.180> using<00:07:16.419> a<00:07:16.900> little<00:07:17.590> method

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:17.949 
we're going to be using a little method

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:21.839 
we're going to be using a little method
i<00:07:18.039> like<00:07:18.250> to<00:07:18.400> call<00:07:18.610> super<00:07:19.449> fast<00:07:19.900> forward<00:07:20.849> and

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:21.849 
i like to call super fast forward and

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:24.240 
i like to call super fast forward and
basically<00:07:22.569> what<00:07:22.840> we<00:07:23.319> just<00:07:23.469> connect<00:07:23.770> you're

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
basically what we just connect you're

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.860 
basically what we just connect you're
just<00:07:24.340> going<00:07:24.490> to<00:07:24.550> fast<00:07:24.939> forward<00:07:25.120> through<00:07:25.689> the

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 
just going to fast forward through the

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.249 
just going to fast forward through the
initial<00:07:26.830> tunneling<00:07:27.400> part<00:07:27.669> guys<00:07:27.849> so<00:07:28.259> enjoy

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:29.259 
initial tunneling part guys so enjoy

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.850 
initial tunneling part guys so enjoy
watching<00:07:29.919> me<00:07:30.069> dig<00:07:30.520> dirt<00:07:30.939> for<00:07:31.389> the<00:07:31.479> next<00:07:32.020> five

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:32.860 
watching me dig dirt for the next five

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.610 
watching me dig dirt for the next five
minutes<00:07:33.400> or<00:07:33.699> so<00:07:33.939> and<00:07:34.180> maybe<00:07:35.050> I'll<00:07:35.259> put<00:07:35.379> under

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
minutes or so and maybe I'll put under

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.200 
minutes or so and maybe I'll put under
