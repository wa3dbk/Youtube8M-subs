the<00:01:24.260> thing<00:01:24.470> about<00:01:24.680> jazz<00:01:25.010> is<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.580> you're

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
the thing about jazz is that you're

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.430 
the thing about jazz is that you're
always<00:01:26.030> improvising<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:26.960> you're<00:01:27.140> adjusting

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
always improvising and you're adjusting

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.800 
always improvising and you're adjusting
to<00:01:27.800> what's<00:01:28.010> going<00:01:28.310> on<00:01:28.490> at<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.700> moment<00:01:29.300> that

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
to what's going on at the moment that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.860 
to what's going on at the moment that
myself<00:01:30.470> as<00:01:30.650> a<00:01:30.680> pianist<00:01:31.540> you're<00:01:32.540> interacting

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
myself as a pianist you're interacting

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.690 
myself as a pianist you're interacting
with<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.440> soloist<00:01:33.920> you're<00:01:34.130> making<00:01:34.550> up<00:01:34.670> your

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
with the soloist you're making up your

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.270 
with the soloist you're making up your
accompaniment<00:01:35.270> on<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.720> spot<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.290> it's<00:01:36.920> just

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
accompaniment on the spot and it's just

00:01:37.280 --> 00:02:20.010 
accompaniment on the spot and it's just
a<00:01:37.630> joy<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.930> do<00:01:39.170> that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.180 

wjo<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.920> think<00:02:22.670> an<00:02:22.880> orchestra<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:24.680> defined

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
wjo I think an orchestra is defined

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.920 
wjo I think an orchestra is defined
really<00:02:25.520> by<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> number<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.120> things<00:02:26.300> one<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
players in it and to the repertoire and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.960 
players in it and to the repertoire and
in<00:02:31.760> both<00:02:32.090> instances<00:02:33.220> we<00:02:34.220> have<00:02:34.490> extraordinary

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970
