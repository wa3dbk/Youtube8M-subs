00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
hey guys this is a this is a lab 9 solid

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
hey guys this is a this is a lab 9 solid
state<00:00:06.420> guitar<00:00:06.779> amp<00:00:07.020> hundred<00:00:07.529> watts<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:09.080> I'm

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
state guitar amp hundred watts and I'm

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.780 
state guitar amp hundred watts and I'm
just<00:00:10.290> testing<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.769> right<00:00:10.830> now<00:00:11.219> I'm<00:00:11.429> gonna<00:00:11.550> show

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
just testing it right now I'm gonna show

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.249 
just testing it right now I'm gonna show
you<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.030> features<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.719> think<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.019> see<00:00:13.139> it's

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
you the features I think and see it's

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.470 
you the features I think and see it's
missing<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.590> knob<00:00:13.860> for<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.250> reverb<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:15.299> was

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
missing a knob for the reverb this was

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.450 
missing a knob for the reverb this was
actually<00:00:15.839> broken<00:00:16.109> off<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.740> had<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.949> rebuild<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
actually broken off I had to rebuild the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.779 
actually broken off I had to rebuild the
the<00:00:17.850> pot<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.420> was<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.600> there<00:00:19.430> my<00:00:20.430> homemade

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the pot that was in there my homemade

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.080 
the pot that was in there my homemade
slide<00:00:21.180> made<00:00:21.900> from<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.140> ceiling<00:00:22.380> fan<00:00:22.939> piece<00:00:23.939> of

slide made from a ceiling fan piece of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.259 
slide made from a ceiling fan piece of
steel<00:00:24.590> this<00:00:25.590> amp<00:00:25.800> actually<00:00:26.189> had<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> kind<00:00:27.180> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
steel this amp actually had a kind of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.230 
steel this amp actually had a kind of
it's<00:00:27.810> repaired<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.740> had<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> shorted<00:00:29.609> capacitor

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
it's repaired it had a shorted capacitor

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.479 
it's repaired it had a shorted capacitor
read<00:00:30.900> 2<00:00:31.199> ohms<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.130> meter<00:00:34.070> had<00:00:35.070> low<00:00:35.250> output

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
read 2 ohms on the meter had low output

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.970 
read 2 ohms on the meter had low output
because<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.480> preamp<00:00:37.200> section<00:00:37.469> wasn't

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
because the preamp section wasn't

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
because the preamp section wasn't

that<00:00:55.469> are<00:00:55.559> housed<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.420> very<00:00:57.420> large<00:00:57.660> get

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that are housed in it very large get

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950 
that are housed in it very large get
your<00:00:58.590> reverb<00:00:58.800> pan<00:00:59.219> down<00:00:59.489> there<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
your reverb pan down there this is the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.649 
your reverb pan down there this is the
on/off<00:01:01.289> switch<00:01:03.589> different<00:01:05.299> never<00:01:06.299> seen<00:01:06.540> it

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
on/off switch different never seen it

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.609 
on/off switch different never seen it
done<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.380> manner<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:12.049> get<00:01:13.049> myself<00:01:13.229> set

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
done in that manner so I get myself set

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.920 
done in that manner so I get myself set
up<00:01:13.650> here

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:27.940 

show<00:01:18.930> some<00:01:19.140> features<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:21.110> since

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:38.330 

once<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.040> plug<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.830> your

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
once I plug it in and so that your

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.740 
once I plug it in and so that your
master<00:01:38.729> volume<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.330> got<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:40.229> input<00:01:40.979> sections

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
master volume you got to input sections

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:57.950 
master volume you got to input sections
get<00:01:42.750> bright<00:01:43.080> switch<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.979> starters<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
get bright switch so for starters the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.230 
get bright switch so for starters the
compressor<00:01:58.610> which<00:01:59.610> some<00:01:59.880> people

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
compressor which some people

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.399 
compressor which some people
misunderstand<00:02:02.149> it<00:02:03.149> actually<00:02:03.869> limits

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
misunderstand it actually limits

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:26.830 
misunderstand it actually limits
HeroClix<00:02:23.209> ears<00:02:24.209> not<00:02:24.660> near<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.019> much<00:02:25.920> at<00:02:26.100> play

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
HeroClix ears not near so much at play

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:56.809 
HeroClix ears not near so much at play
so<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:27.900> increasing

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.470 

oh<00:02:59.010> yeah<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.310> also<00:03:00.400> have<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.700> dim<00:03:00.879> bulb<00:03:01.060> over

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
oh yeah I also have a dim bulb over

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.229 
oh yeah I also have a dim bulb over
there<00:03:01.870> just<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.620> light<00:03:02.829> bulb<00:03:03.129> right<00:03:03.730> limiting

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
there just a light bulb right limiting

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.240 
there just a light bulb right limiting
the<00:03:04.329> current<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:05.620> doesn't<00:03:05.890> really<00:03:05.980> work<00:03:06.189> that

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
the current it doesn't really work that

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.429 
the current it doesn't really work that
well<00:03:06.549> on<00:03:06.609> tube<00:03:06.970> amps<00:03:07.420> but<00:03:07.569> it's<00:03:07.750> great<00:03:08.230> for

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
well on tube amps but it's great for

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.410 
well on tube amps but it's great for
solid-state<00:03:08.980> absence<00:03:09.609> they<00:03:09.760> don't<00:03:09.939> draw

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
solid-state absence they don't draw

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.030 
solid-state absence they don't draw
large<00:03:10.900> amount<00:03:11.230> of<00:03:11.290> current<00:03:11.530> because<00:03:12.010> of

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
large amount of current because of

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.119 
large amount of current because of
filaments<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.480> ok<00:03:13.780> next<00:03:14.049> thing<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.739> got<00:03:14.890> this

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
filaments so ok next thing you got this

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:38.940 
filaments so ok next thing you got this
I<00:03:36.480> need<00:03:37.480> some<00:03:38.139> insight<00:03:38.500> on<00:03:38.680> that

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
I need some insight on that

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.050 
I need some insight on that
I<00:03:39.239> understand<00:03:40.239> but<00:03:41.049> it<00:03:41.290> does<00:03:41.439> change<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:42.909> got

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
I understand but it does change you got

00:03:43.060 --> 00:05:12.030 
I understand but it does change you got
your<00:03:43.180> Reaper

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
you got multi multi filter I don't know

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.720 
you got multi multi filter I don't know

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
if that has to do with the frequency

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.510 
if that has to do with the frequency
filter<00:05:26.150> that's<00:05:26.330> here<00:05:26.600> might<00:05:27.020> be<00:05:27.050> I<00:05:27.520> don't
