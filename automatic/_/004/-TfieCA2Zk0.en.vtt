00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.220 

okay<00:00:01.110> so<00:00:01.170> once<00:00:01.500> you've<00:00:01.680> animated<00:00:02.129> your<00:00:02.250> cycle

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.230 
okay so once you've animated your cycle

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.720 
okay so once you've animated your cycle
usually<00:00:04.230> you<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:04.620> when<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:04.920> go<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.100> animate

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
usually you you when you go to animate

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.270 
usually you you when you go to animate
your<00:00:05.759> shot<00:00:06.109> you<00:00:07.109> tend<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.710> start<00:00:07.919> all<00:00:08.250> over

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
your shot you tend to start all over

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.430 
your shot you tend to start all over
again<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.970> I've<00:00:09.690> got<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> little<00:00:10.050> bit<00:00:10.170> fed<00:00:10.290> up

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
again and I've got a little bit fed up

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.919 
again and I've got a little bit fed up
of<00:00:10.969> working<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.090> cycles<00:00:12.480> up<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.750> getting

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
of working the cycles up and getting

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.049 
of working the cycles up and getting
those<00:00:13.049> looking<00:00:13.349> great<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.830> then<00:00:13.980> having<00:00:14.880> to

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
those looking great and then having to

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:15.650 
those looking great and then having to
start<00:00:15.269> again

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
start again

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.260 
start again
if<00:00:15.859> that<00:00:16.859> particular<00:00:16.980> gate<00:00:17.400> was<00:00:17.609> required<00:00:18.150> in

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
if that particular gate was required in

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.529 
if that particular gate was required in
a<00:00:18.359> shot<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.470> devised<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> system<00:00:20.510> where<00:00:21.510> I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
a shot so I devised a system where I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.960 
a shot so I devised a system where I
could<00:00:21.630> import<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.380> very<00:00:23.220> same<00:00:23.460> animation

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
could import this very same animation

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.839 
could import this very same animation
into<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> scene<00:00:24.480> fairly<00:00:25.170> quickly<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:28.730> you<00:00:29.730> know

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
into a scene fairly quickly and you know

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.569 
into a scene fairly quickly and you know
and<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.710> tools<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.070> change<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and have a have the tools to change the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.950 
and have a have the tools to change the
direction<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.800> speed<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.809> still<00:00:36.809> all

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
direction and the speed and still all

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.200 
direction and the speed and still all
based<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.469> your<00:00:38.010> initial<00:00:38.250> cycle<00:00:38.850> frame<00:00:39.000> range

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
based on your initial cycle frame range

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.040 
based on your initial cycle frame range
this<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> cycling<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.649> 21<00:00:41.010> frames<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.870> let<00:00:42.989> me

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
this is cycling at 21 frames so let me

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
this is cycling at 21 frames so let me
just<00:00:43.170> quickly<00:00:43.290> show<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.559> how<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.800> works

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.440 

one<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.160> my<00:00:47.219> frames<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.850> cycle<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
one of my frames you can cycle the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.900 
one of my frames you can cycle the
cycles<00:00:48.750> into<00:00:48.840> infinity<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:50.610> walk<00:00:50.760> as

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
cycles into infinity so you can walk as

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.700 
cycles into infinity so you can walk as
far<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.390> your<00:00:51.600> path<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.710> long<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.030> paths

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
far as your path is long it's a paths

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.319 
far as your path is long it's a paths
you<00:00:55.710> these<00:00:56.370> parts<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.789> any<00:00:56.969> length<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
you these parts can be any length it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.639 
you these parts can be any length it
depends<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.750> how<00:00:58.020> long<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.260> make<00:00:58.410> them<00:00:58.530> when

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
depends on how long you make them when

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.560 
depends on how long you make them when
you<00:00:58.710> set<00:00:58.890> up<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.609> speed<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.059> controlled<00:01:03.270> by

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you set up so the speed is controlled by

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.380 
you set up so the speed is controlled by
one<00:01:03.960> curve<00:01:04.460> here<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:08.610> know<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.030> wanted<00:01:09.330> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
one curve here you know if you wanted to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.410 
one curve here you know if you wanted to
speed<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.229> an<00:01:10.350> area<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.299> there

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
speed up an area you just go in there

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.670 
speed up an area you just go in there
and<00:01:12.540> edit<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> curve<00:01:13.020> isn't<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.590> add

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and edit the curve isn't on we can add

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.609 
and edit the curve isn't on we can add
as<00:01:13.799> many<00:01:13.890> keys<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
as many keys as you like to this so you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.380 
as many keys as you like to this so you
know<00:01:16.799> you'd<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> speed<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
know you'd have a speed up here and a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.109 
know you'd have a speed up here and a
slow<00:01:18.659> down<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:21.020> see<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.850> just<00:01:23.850> here

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
slow down here and see that just here

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.870 
slow down here and see that just here
like<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.170> speed<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.890> slow

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
like this there we go speed up and slow

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.280 
like this there we go speed up and slow
down<00:01:27.119> I'm<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.450> doing<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.720> very<00:01:27.960> very

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
down I'm just doing this very very

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
down I'm just doing this very very
crudely<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> show<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.310> how<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> works

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
crudely just to show you how it works

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.649 
crudely just to show you how it works
and<00:01:30.780> how<00:01:31.170> quick<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.570> in<00:01:33.570> this

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and how quick it can be you can in this

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.789 
and how quick it can be you can in this
way<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:33.990> add<00:01:34.140> lots<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.560> speed

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
way you can add lots of little speed

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.230 
way you can add lots of little speed
variations<00:01:35.340> into<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> cycle<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.290> course<00:01:37.290> um

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
variations into the cycle of course um

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.819 
variations into the cycle of course um
the<00:01:39.240> path<00:01:39.509> system<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.170> baked<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.710> any

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the path system can be baked out at any

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.380 
the path system can be baked out at any
time<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.610> return<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> animation

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
time so you can return the animation

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.789 
time so you can return the animation
back<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.780> local<00:01:43.020> controls<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> rig

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
back to the local controls of the rig

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.580 
back to the local controls of the rig
and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.780> start<00:01:46.320> adding

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and then you can go in and start adding

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.980 
and then you can go in and start adding
extra<00:01:47.490> steps<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.090> changing<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> stride

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
extra steps or changing the stride

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.679 
extra steps or changing the stride
lengths<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.560> wish<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.570> is

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
lengths if you wish so you know this is

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.850 
lengths if you wish so you know this is
just<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> very<00:01:52.049> quick<00:01:52.140> way<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.380> getting<00:01:52.530> that

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
just a very quick way of getting that

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.550 
just a very quick way of getting that
nice<00:01:53.100> animation<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> did<00:01:54.090> initially<00:01:54.869> into

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
nice animation you did initially into

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.709 
nice animation you did initially into
your<00:01:55.649> scene<00:01:55.829> very<00:01:56.070> quickly<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.420> doing

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
your scene very quickly and get it doing

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.690 
your scene very quickly and get it doing
some<00:01:57.990> quite<00:01:58.530> complex<00:01:59.130> stuff<00:01:59.369> considering

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
some quite complex stuff considering

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.749 
some quite complex stuff considering
you're<00:01:59.939> only<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.930> using<00:02:01.890> 21<00:02:02.399> frames<00:02:02.640> of

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you're only you know using 21 frames of

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.280 
you're only you know using 21 frames of
animation<00:02:03.469> so<00:02:05.390> I'll<00:02:06.390> show<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.810> quickly<00:02:07.140> how

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
animation so I'll show you quickly how

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.830 
animation so I'll show you quickly how
you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.580> shape<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.800 

pals<00:02:12.840> around<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.409> geometry<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.840> depending<00:02:15.840> on

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
pals around the geometry so depending on

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.509 
pals around the geometry so depending on
what's<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.959> use<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.560> your<00:02:19.739> scene<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.280> know<00:02:20.459> you

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
what's in use in your scene you know you

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.949 
what's in use in your scene you know you
can<00:02:20.730> go<00:02:20.879> in<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.260> change<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.319> paths<00:02:23.840> get<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> bit

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
can go in and change the paths get a bit

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.599 
can go in and change the paths get a bit
of<00:02:25.049> variation<00:02:25.349> in<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.799> direction<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> cats

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
of variation in the direction the cats

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.300 
of variation in the direction the cats
walking<00:02:27.560> again<00:02:28.560> I'm<00:02:28.709> doing<00:02:28.889> this<00:02:28.980> quite

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
walking again I'm doing this quite

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.339 
walking again I'm doing this quite
quickly<00:02:29.510> but<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.629> know<00:02:30.719> it's<00:02:30.930> been<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.079> bit<00:02:31.230> of

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
quickly but you know it's been a bit of

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.679 
quickly but you know it's been a bit of
time<00:02:32.359> shaping<00:02:33.359> the<00:02:33.510> path<00:02:33.689> to<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.079> geometry

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
time shaping the path to the geometry

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.089 
time shaping the path to the geometry
you<00:02:36.689> really<00:02:36.989> need<00:02:37.139> to<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.469> get<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.739> bottom

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
you really need to just get that bottom

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.970 
you really need to just get that bottom
curve<00:02:38.569> close<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.109> ground<00:02:40.319> so<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.769> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
curve close to the ground so that the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.869 
curve close to the ground so that the
feet<00:02:41.670> are<00:02:41.700> contacting<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:44.400> doesn't<00:02:44.669> have<00:02:44.790> to

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
feet are contacting it doesn't have to

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.309 
feet are contacting it doesn't have to
be<00:02:44.970> absolutely<00:02:45.150> precise<00:02:45.840> at<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.109> stage

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
be absolutely precise at this stage

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.140 
be absolutely precise at this stage
because<00:02:46.709> there's<00:02:46.919> plenty<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.310> scope<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:47.819> go<00:02:47.970> in

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
because there's plenty of scope to go in

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.949 
because there's plenty of scope to go in
and<00:02:48.569> edit<00:02:49.139> things<00:02:49.680> once<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.220> part<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.669> working

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
and edit things once the part is working

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.979 
and edit things once the part is working
there's<00:02:52.709> offsets<00:02:53.159> for<00:02:53.909> all<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.239> controls<00:02:54.659> for

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
there's offsets for all the controls for

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.580 
there's offsets for all the controls for
all<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.790> areas<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.299> body<00:02:57.450> torso<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.349> head

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
and the paws they can all be offset so

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.839 
and the paws they can all be offset so
you<00:03:02.849> can<00:03:03.030> still<00:03:03.269> change<00:03:03.569> things<00:03:04.760> even<00:03:05.760> if

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
you can still change things even if

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:06.979 
you can still change things even if
you're<00:03:05.969> not<00:03:06.030> quite<00:03:06.329> getting<00:03:06.540> what<00:03:06.659> you<00:03:06.810> want

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
you're not quite getting what you want

you're not quite getting what you want
in<00:03:07.169> this<00:03:07.349> initial<00:03:07.739> part<00:03:08.669> that<00:03:08.939> it<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.299> can<00:03:09.450> go

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
in this initial part that it you can go

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.050 
in this initial part that it you can go
in<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.900> add<00:03:10.409> an<00:03:10.590> anim<00:03:10.889> layers<00:03:11.129> into<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.669> into

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
in and add an anim layers into the into

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.839 
in and add an anim layers into the into
the<00:03:12.150> rig<00:03:12.469> lower<00:03:13.469> you<00:03:13.769> know<00:03:13.859> so<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.250> paws

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
the rig lower you know so the paws

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.939 
the rig lower you know so the paws
aren't<00:03:15.090> quite<00:03:15.269> contacting<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.530> easy<00:03:16.709> enough

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
aren't quite contacting it's easy enough

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.219 
aren't quite contacting it's easy enough
to<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.129> go<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.699> put<00:03:17.819> an<00:03:18.090> offset<00:03:18.419> in<00:03:18.599> to

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
to just go in and put an offset in to

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:23.899 
to just go in and put an offset in to
help<00:03:19.409> that<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.840> briefly<00:03:22.829> let's<00:03:23.220> just<00:03:23.400> see<00:03:23.609> what

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
help that so briefly let's just see what

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:24.409 
help that so briefly let's just see what
we've<00:03:24.060> got<00:03:24.090> here

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
we've got here

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:29.569 
we've got here
if<00:03:26.780> quickly<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.199> was<00:03:28.409> shaped<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.489> this

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
if quickly that that was shaped to this

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.879 
if quickly that that was shaped to this
particular<00:03:29.849> geometry<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.379> see<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> cat

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
particular geometry you can see the cat

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.659 
particular geometry you can see the cat
now<00:03:32.069> walking<00:03:32.849> down<00:03:33.169> changing<00:03:34.169> direction

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
now walking down changing direction

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.909 
now walking down changing direction
going<00:03:35.669> up<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.000> down<00:03:36.209> over<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.599> hills<00:03:36.919> and

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
going up and down over the hills and

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.020 
going up and down over the hills and
around<00:03:38.269> as<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.449> said<00:03:39.629> there's<00:03:40.439> offsets<00:03:41.159> but<00:03:41.939> all

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
around as I said there's offsets but all

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.819 
around as I said there's offsets but all
the<00:03:42.120> controls<00:03:42.479> so<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.169> know<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.680> have<00:03:43.769> a

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
the controls so you know you can have a

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.629 
the controls so you know you can have a
little<00:03:44.040> head<00:03:44.159> turns<00:03:44.459> or<00:03:44.849> whatever<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:47.370> you

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
little head turns or whatever you you

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.399 
little head turns or whatever you you
want<00:03:47.849> also<00:03:48.599> don't<00:03:48.780> really<00:03:48.930> particularly<00:03:49.229> on

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
want also don't really particularly on

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.699 
want also don't really particularly on
that<00:03:50.030> piece<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.150> animation<00:03:51.269> but<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:52.379> can<00:03:52.530> see

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
that piece of animation but you can see

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.490 
that piece of animation but you can see
how<00:03:52.970> powerful<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.269> tool<00:03:54.449> is<00:03:54.629> and<00:03:54.959> how<00:03:55.169> quick

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
how powerful the tool is and how quick

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.369 
how powerful the tool is and how quick
it<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.769> layer<00:03:56.250> animation<00:03:56.790> into<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:59.239> and

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
it is to layer animation into it and

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.050 
it is to layer animation into it and
remember<00:04:01.379> this<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.590> all<00:04:01.709> still<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.250> based<00:04:02.819> on

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
remember this is all still just based on

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.179 
remember this is all still just based on
21<00:04:03.659> frames<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.169> animation<00:04:05.449> and<00:04:06.709> so<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.919> setup

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
21 frames of animation and so the setup

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.280 
21 frames of animation and so the setup
is<00:04:08.400> something<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.939> will<00:04:09.120> be<00:04:09.239> learning<00:04:09.419> on<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
is something you will be learning on the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.189 
is something you will be learning on the
creature<00:04:11.129> animation<00:04:11.849> course<00:04:12.150> animation<00:04:12.870> 18

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
creature animation course animation 18

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.220 
creature animation course animation 18
so<00:04:13.709> thank<00:04:14.069> you
