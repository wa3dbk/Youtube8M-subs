 educate tina the education sign number 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.130
 one of Latin America in this video 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.200
 we will work on bacterial cultures 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.120
 at the laboratory 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.890
 Most studies 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.630
 related to bacteria are brought to 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.840
 out in the laboratory 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.669
 For this reason , a 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.669
 large amount of culture media 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.270
 the bacteria most studied 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.010
 They are among others more 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.460
 that is used to culture media 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.210
 they contain substances such as sugars 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.159
 or salts people meat extracts or 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.060
 yeast as well as the proper buffer 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.569
 or the right boxers the means of 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.569
 culture 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.759
 we can classify them in two can be 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.759
 liquids or can be solid 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.450
 if they contain water 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.550
 as an agent solidify t then let's go 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.100
 to be referring to means of 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.620
 solid crops while the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.020
 liquid beyond consistency 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.200
 liquid are also known as 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.210
 breeding grounds 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.430
 and when growing bacteria in the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.250
 laboratory should be kept in mind 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.250
 the nutritional needs 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.800
 and the conditions 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.630
 whether they are physical 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.630
 as chemical 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.720
 of the environment because this will allow 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.940
 that crops develop 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.940
 Bacteria in the best way 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:26.560
 a very used crop is the one that performs 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.980
 It is done in the plates boxes of 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.140
 petre and it is clear that bacteria 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.200
 they can only be seen with the naked eye 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.110
 when they have proliferated millions of times 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.120
 and they have formed colonies and this is achieved 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.390
 in the lab when you are 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.069
 placed we have the little box of petris 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.390
 place the culture medium 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.390
 it would be the culture medium 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.080
 and sowing 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.180
 with the bacteria that we need that 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.180
 grow up 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.650
 just this is going to see if one could 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.830
 draw from frank seen from above 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.350
 we will be able to see the grouping of 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.290
 colonies 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.290
 if here we are going to see millions of bacteria 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.130
 and how do you get this good as 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.700
 we mentioned earlier they have to 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.730
 have necessary nutrients for the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.920
 increase 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.860
 and this procedure is done with 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.030
 more often in these plates than I 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.380
 I showed you just 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.260
 and the name comes from the creator 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.490
 what is it was a German bacteriologist 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.490
 richard petri 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.910
 This form of cultivation is widely used 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.010
 even not only at the level 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.360
 research laboratory but 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.420
 also in the food industry 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.190
 because it allows to put in evidence the 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.739
 presence of bacteria that are found 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.390
 in raw materials in drinking water 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.510
 in the environment 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.640
 in already processed foods is obvious 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.130
 so that the choice of means of 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.290
 appropriate culture as well as 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.940
 conditions to which you submit are 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.120
 essential to achieve a 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.500
 optimal growth of a certain 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.500
 bactec 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.500
 then for in vitro culture 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.170
 we need to know optimal conditions 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.399
 whether physical and chemical 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.470
 a culture medium 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.670
 that is nutrients 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.670
 required 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:07.420
 for the development of that colony that 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.420
 it needs to proliferate 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.730
 educational I recommend the following 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.730
 videos so you can keep learning
