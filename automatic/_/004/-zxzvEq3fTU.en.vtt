00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.700
 urban neuroscience therefore helps i 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.379
 parents to better understand the 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.849
 behave your own children in this 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:19.280
 moment that we will talk about 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:22.040
 teenagers but this is the base and is one 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.050
 fundamental basis because in the moment in 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.670
 which we will talk about the sciences on the fly 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.460
 we will talk about those circuits that are being 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.320
 building and if we need to 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.760
 we must build these circuits 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.440
 know why 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.380
 what should we do because these 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.510
 circuits are best built if 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.579
 you have to take away a basic concept 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.290
 fundamental to understanding neuroscience 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.560
 urban to speak in urban neuroscience 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.270
 it's exactly this thing 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.720
 every time the two neurons do 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.230
 connect next time they will do a 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.530
 a little less electrical effort there will be some 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.390
 less resistance to connect again 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.070
 of the omitted because adolescence a little 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.270
 trouble as you remember the adolescence 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.660
 you remember it 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.660
 we do not 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.299
 we little boys no 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.720
 try it shows us if you remember 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.189
 well from 14 to 16 first of all for 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.850
 manage change of our bodies 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.530
 right then they have to deal with learning 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.299
 socialize in a very complex world 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.920
 then they have to manage the pressure of the 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.850
 peers who tell you why the kids 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.560
 as they do not have bark 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.110
 prefrontal they tell you how ugly you are 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.409
 today not really ugly but because you 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.080
 dress like this because the estrogen is right 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.220
 no beastly filters then they have to 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.159
 somehow manage your mood 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.149
 which happens to change constantly 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.530
 women one who carried changes in 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.590
 your life is nothing but everything 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.479
 ok though when you're somehow 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.860
 then in adolescence and bestial you will have to 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.899
 somehow understand what i will be 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.940
 own values ​​for the future is there 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.130
 massacre because the family gives you 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.840
 values and the school gives you the value of 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.850
 future responsibility because you have to 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.640
 grow smart because they have been 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.590
 intelligent you will not be happy 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.450
 ok so now I give you 4 in Latin 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.660
 but it is not because I shoot 4 in Latin e 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.630
 because I'm doing you good 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.560
 then they have to negotiate with their parents 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.630
 constantly they are very good at 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.940
 negotiate andos have only one i 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.900
 boys a single negotiation technique 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.170
 which is that of please no such as the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.690
 woman no the boy tells you please 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.310
 hard, no, the boy has no problems 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.069
 I can go out Friday I can go out 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.200
 Friday 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.540
 happens in the house 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.580
 I can go out, but on Friday Pope wants you 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.200
 can go out to serve the Pope can 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.430
 come out accompany Friday Friday 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.819
 build what i can get out of 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.940
 Friday the female no the female accepts 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.890
 that is, you are different you want to put 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.140
 then they have to go to school 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.790
 obviously they have to go to school then 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.860
 they must sleep then they have to play how much 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.420
 they have to play so they have to play then 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.519
 attention must make the plans for the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.810
 their future and somehow have to 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.239
 make plans for their future e 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 we continue menaiel to when 113 years 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.810
 I do not know what you from big bark 0 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.810
 they look at you as if to say 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.040
 yes, I'm telling you that after puberty, yes 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.629
 can remedy the estrogen causes the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.280
 little girls start looking at each other 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.879
 mirror and begin to be a little 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.280
 worry about their appearance and 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.860
 estrogen also increases the centers 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.360
 cognitive of communication for which it does 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.819
 so that the child can speak to the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.660
 phone with friends now in chat 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.370
 for how long have you ever been 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.019
 had a conversation on the phone myself 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.310
 I tell you mine with my daughter explains to me 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.849
 I tell you all my conversation 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.620
 with my son hello junkie hello i 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.170
 Mirror neurons are much more present 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.590
 and they are the ones who manage to do 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.599
 so that the child is much more conscious 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.780
 of what's happening at home that 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.640
 the boy more or less happens like this I have to 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.829
 ask mom to come out of her 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.099
 sister 4 years younger tells him not 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.099
 now 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.360
 and he tells him why he has to go out 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.400
 and she says why mom a little 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.540
 angry and he tells her but he is not 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.239
 angry with me 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.100
 and the anchovies but no matter is angry 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.090
 if you ask him now you say no and 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.090
 he says I don't understand 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:30.100
 according to you go ask him 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.350
 for example for example parents we are 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.890
 published to your son Giancarlo and he me 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.890
 he replies that it is 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.310
 is not he 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:45.490
 is testosterone 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.020
 but you know how many notes it takes in class is 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.560
 disrespectful and you say it is not 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.830
 disrespectful and testosterone feet yes 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.530
 are all so s teacher will face a 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.990
 question if you answer you know every 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.910
 how much does a boy of 14 think about sex? 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:08.100
 16 years 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:10.890
 thrown out there they calculated that once 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.960
 every 14 seconds as it is good for 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.750
 physical sport both for him and for her but 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.490
 for different reasons so much more than 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.620
 what you can imagine but 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.050
 much more so than sport 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.660
 should do the baby boy too 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.840
 small as much as the maximum 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.840
 possible
