Oh Austin's been already that was

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.390 
Oh Austin's been already that was
incredibly<00:02:22.030> something<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.920> did<00:02:23.920> not<00:02:24.069> think<00:02:24.250> he

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
incredibly something I did not think he

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.890 
incredibly something I did not think he
would<00:02:24.489> be<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.819> easy

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.289 

so<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.799> portal<00:02:30.129> thing<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.549> open<00:02:30.909> and<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
so the portal thing is open and the

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.979 
so the portal thing is open and the
doors<00:02:31.540> open<00:02:32.819> I'm<00:02:33.819> going<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.209> grab<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.720> chest

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
doors open I'm going to grab a chest

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.670

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
ahead now we'll leave the other one

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.490 
ahead now we'll leave the other one
