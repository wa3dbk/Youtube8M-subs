00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hi girls, how are you? I'm doing it today. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.919
 reviews for you from a protector 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.840
 Who does a lot of brushing in the hair? 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.809
 is always looking for the protector 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.480
 heat is important because without it is very 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.150
 important to use that it will protect the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.000
 hair and dryer heat and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.789
 I always like to warn you. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.740
 which makes brush mainly 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.289
 who makes a plaque has to pass a 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.080
 thermal protector before it does not 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.899
 May hair means also 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.719
 I received this product here from the store. 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.379
 on the web along with the product of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.920
 caprock I did review for you at 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.829
 last video that was the balanced pH gives 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.309
 here pro and I also received this 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.079
 thermal protector when I looked like this 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.199
 I did not go too much with his face 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.199
 so simple product voltage should not 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.289
 do that done but already in the first 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.690
 once I used it and it surprises me and I can 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.720
 speak with certainty that it was one of the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.360
 best defenses before one of the best 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.680
 thermal protectors I've used 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 brush in the hair 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.549
 it left the hair very soft a lot 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.890
 very hydrated and so now 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.420
 just want to use it will not be my 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.299
 Preferred because I have several 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 I already preferred a video for you guys. 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.080
 with my defined before preferred 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.450
 to make brush 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.360
 but for sure and come in and do the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.150
 video now it gets into my top 5 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.299
 because it leaves many hair and I 12 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.829
 I enjoyed it very much even 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.409
 packaging so the hopscotch is 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:51.450
 almost lemon 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:56.420
 it comes with 150 grams and promises 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:01.799
 control the volume brightness and frings today 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:04.439
 sunscreen and thermal and a small 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.219
 amount in the children and chooses the 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.219
 hair 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.560
 he has that she had hydrolyzed it 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.830
 help restore set but whats more 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.810
 I liked him, he really loved it. 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.930
 He let his hair grow long 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.180
 and the reader of the blog knows that 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.980
 one of the things I like best 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.660
 when the product leaves the hair soft 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.650
 which is the most amazing when he leaves the 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:38.709
 rough hair then just for you here to 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:41.620
 consistency and I was just for you 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.140
 here he has a lot of sparkle 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.459
 most popular type and nests 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.480
 I do not think I can see it but he has 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.049
 various 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.930
 he has several little brightens and stays in his hand 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.670
 I even figured this out to make a brush 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.590
 had not noticed that he had to 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.200
 shines but still does look at 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.930
 my mother had a full of glitter and 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.560
 wec product is the one that leaves the same 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.760
 like this 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:16.239
 then I was a victim here was this gives pro 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:18.579
 Looked there on the packaging has been trying 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.190

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.200
 I do not think I can come and he's fine. 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.120
 chorozinho smells sweet and if a 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.010
 bit cyclic a very good smell 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:33.100
 also and it makes the hair wonderful 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.100
 I liked it very much recommended it is not too 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.890
 an expensive product I can not remember price but 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.540
 I'll take a look there after I know 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.850
 which is not expensive of the capital's products 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.910
 they are not expensive and then like I did not buy 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.799
 Beauty was the web that sent me I 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.450
 I do not remember price but I'll leave the 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.280

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.790
 That'll give me a look too. 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.220
 and as I said in the last video I never 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.519
 had used nothing of caprock did not know 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.790
 the brand but it surprises me a lot 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.510
 I really enjoyed the year of their products and 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.879
 that's it 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.599
 I used to taste my hair, it got much more 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.370
 If it got shiny it was silky and I 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.290
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.290
