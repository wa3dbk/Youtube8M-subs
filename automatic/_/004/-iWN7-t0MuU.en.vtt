00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.889
 the twentieth of July 1969 

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:11.059
 w 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.249
 Millions of Germans are spellbound by the century event 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.970
 In front of the television screens in shop windows are enthusiastic people 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.470
 many still have an astronaut entering the earth satellite 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.329
 not to believe 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.419
 many doubt that today 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.169
 What if the eagle has never landed on the moon? 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.590
 Karrer 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.510
 Caracas 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.550
 already under President Johnson was clear that mission must now be possible and 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.400
 So they came up with the idea to fake the load at the LAF especially against 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.820
 the Song Contest ESC brings Woryna 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.160
 the moon landings no century event but only the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
 most expensive movie production of all time 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.670
 in the race to the moon Soviet cosmonauts have in the early sixties 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.670
 the nose in front 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.480
 the Oregon in it is the first man in the universe and also the first one 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.140
 Spacewalk is in the sign of Pommer and sure 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.290
 just four years later the big surprise 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.210
 America caught up with the gap and won the race to the moon 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.900
 the audience slaps a swindle triumph who with the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.900
 Technology of that time would not have been possible 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.590
 There is more computing power in every car today than in the car 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.590
 Apollo capsule 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.110
 Neil Armstrong is testing a model of the car, 14 months before the launch date 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.230
 lander 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.230
 nothing is more catastrophic 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.410
 that was not really legally ripe for a moon landing 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.950
 or are all images of the mission faked 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.600
 just the sharp NASA photos can be seen 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.479
 why are there no stars on monday although there are no clouds there? 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.079
 and why does the us flag seem to be blowing in the wind? 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.699
 although there is no atmosphere on the moon 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:34.109
 Hollywood or professional filmmaker Timon clothing stepped 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.090
 It looks much more spectacular 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.799
 then they would surely see stars 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.649
 Percent 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.570
 everything would look so much more like this 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.220
 as people might imagine that a moon landing would look like 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.860
 while NASA may have just smiled at the staging 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.169
 Mor 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.539
 5 percent of Americans believe in the great need 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:04.399
 and the Germans 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.749
 Cooper already funny because this avalanche going on 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.119
 I'm pretty ungerboeck that one would rather have simple creation of new ones 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.119
 Western angel because one-handed government 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.429
 the suspicion of a conspiracy and the explanation of the scientists 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.979
 first, the missing stars a phenomenon that the astronauts after the 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.979
 Explain return yourself 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.979
 therefore there was even one 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:33.699
 the OECD speaks of its star as Usher I know so far 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.689
 normally everything would be lost because everything is already before the turn 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.549
 if necessary, the real world 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.329
 the astronauts on the moon can not see stars because they are on the 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.419
 Sunny side have landed 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.219
 the phenomenon is well known on earth 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.699
 In May you can not see any stars, the sun is so bright that everyone else is 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.319
 Stars stay invisible 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.299
 even at night the starry sky fades away in urban areas 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.299
 a lot of lighting 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:12.519
 secondly, not alive, the us flag sets in motion but the 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.649
 Astronaut himself no turning flagpole it 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.400
 Because there is no atmosphere on the moon, the flag swings for minutes 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.249
 continue 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:24.249
 even without British 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.669
 but how did NASA do it with the kind of primitive computers to the moon 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.449
 made 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.219
 the explanation is simple 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:41.110
 will be on the floor in wall unit large apparatus to Apollo only 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.789
 For that reason, the capsule itself found hardly any of its own instructions 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.069
 computer performance 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.330
 NASA employed 400,000 people at the time 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.129
 if it is really a conspiracy, then all these would not be better until 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.129
 silence today 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.639
 the exciting finished ad copy 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.870
 the one that falls to the polls is not the "conspiracy theory" 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.750
 has propagated the moon landing although they were actually the ones 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.789
 who could have won everything 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.349
 and that would be to the rescue 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.199
 they did not say that 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.099
 why believe so much in the big and fraud 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.099
 especially the Americans themselves 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:30.219
 the sector of the providers gave 1 many believe simply that the principle 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.299
 Government popular and not for the sake of people unemployed this feeling 

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:38.749
 emerged in the late sixties OLEDs after the murders of the Congress 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:43.779
 to Martin Luther King and Marco Merz the government is expecting Canon Inc Volvo 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:46.830
 the cellar after the 1 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.660
 The June 2009, NASA again sent a probe to the moon, it should be after 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.580
 Seek water and provide the final proof 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.580
 Photos of the landing sites the sixth man 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.800
 in the first pictures is still little to see 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.599
 as soon as the probe is close enough they should deliver better photos 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.479
 The conspiracy theory will probably still remain in the world who says 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.819
 because the new NASA does not work this time
