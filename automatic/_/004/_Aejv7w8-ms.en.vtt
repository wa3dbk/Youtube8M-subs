00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello people welcome example 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.340
 with me today there is a new magical 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.380
 knead magic magic from this series 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.170
 we have the intelligent play dough 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.910
 Meanwhile, already three pieces 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:21.510
 Once we have scarab pink 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.820
 pluto and now also super chameleon 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.910
 already totally curious that changes too 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.130
 here the color of the super chameleon and 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.109
 will be those the knead not 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.850
 know 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.820
 she can jump how can you say 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.980
 knead it even changes 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.649
 the color you can pull apart 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.070
 So we really always have a lot 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.280
 fun with this magic play and the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.660
 is from the marketing papaya for kids 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.030
 from zero to three not suitable yes and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.719
 I look it Just have a look 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:01.609
 okay that's green a green chameleon 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.609
 is still packed in a bag 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.700
 First, I knead it to me 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:27.270
 beautiful by is still a bit hard 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.970
 straight but is an interesting driver 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.369
 is green but leafy green 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.649
 maybe there are camels and I have to 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.820
 always good to adjust so this is 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.970
 really such a color 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.000
 already reminds me of a tree or 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.200
 to a plant this chameleon could 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.200
 hide well there 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:58.500
 I'm really curious which one 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.929
 color that now I get partly 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.100
 just once in two parts that I show 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.780
 you too, you can do it that way 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.200
 pull apart or apart 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.410
 tear 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.250
 I will not get it this time 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.110
 I have to do a little bit again 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.350
 meet and then I try that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.350
 once again 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:25.239
 and so now I've got it 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.120
 to tear 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:32.379
 here is the area here it is 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.030
 torn apart and one part 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.870
 I will be out of this fete now 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.049
 Immediately put in water and look like 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:46.750
 the color changes I already have 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:54.549
 something prepared and happens there 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:57.730
 something is just cold right now 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:04.239
 you also need warm water 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:09.099
 use it so we look at the heart 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.689
 not much changed now 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.250
 The whole time with warm water 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.079
 I have my cold water 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.159
 distributed and now have here completely 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.019
 warm water in it 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.359
 and now the devices are still coming 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.879
 Once inside and I see directly 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:27.069
 something changes directly 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:31.780
 brighter out so I'll get her out of there and 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:37.269
 it has become lighter almost yellow 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.989
 very bright green that works 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.989
 with the color change 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.910
 yes very interesting if it is you 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.480
 I liked it then gave me a thumb 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.720
 up 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.970
 and we have the other dough, too 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.610
 the other intelligent knead the other 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.900
 changed to the color and you can 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.880
 look forward to seeing me at about 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.090
 Do a test where I have the two 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.190
 super chameleon knead masses comparisons 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.540
 So this is this magic play 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.640
 the intelligent kneading super chameleon 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.880
 first green then it turns yellow or 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.650
 bright green and in a next video of 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.650

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.110
