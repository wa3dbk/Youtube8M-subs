00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
details so on the left here we have the

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.319 
details so on the left here we have the
model<00:00:43.629> which<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.930> called<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.289> base<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:45.329> here

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
model which is called the base and here

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.180 
model which is called the base and here
on<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.539> right<00:00:46.719> is<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.440> form<00:00:48.070> and<00:00:48.600> they<00:00:49.600> are

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
on the right is the form and they are

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.400 
on the right is the form and they are
virtually<00:00:51.210> identical<00:00:52.210> in<00:00:54.059> terms<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:56.019> sole

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
virtually identical in terms of the sole

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.700 
virtually identical in terms of the sole
you<00:00:57.309> can<00:00:57.489> see<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.960> can<00:00:59.079> see<00:00:59.230> it's<00:00:59.350> just<00:00:59.440> a

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
you can see you can see it's just a

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.170 
you can see you can see it's just a
slightly<00:01:00.129> different<00:01:00.570> coloring<00:01:01.570> use<00:01:01.870> there

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
slightly different coloring use there

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.320 
slightly different coloring use there
and<00:01:04.180> it's<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:05.110> uppers<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:05.640> are<00:01:06.640> the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
and it's the the uppers that are the

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.320 
and it's the the uppers that are the
only<00:01:07.840> difference<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.670> let's<00:01:09.850> let's<00:01:10.150> take<00:01:10.270> a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
only difference so let's let's take a

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.350 
only difference so let's let's take a
look<00:01:10.509> at<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:11.650> base<00:01:11.799> model<00:01:12.220> here<00:01:12.400> actually

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
look at the the base model here actually

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.219 
look at the the base model here actually
reminds<00:01:13.810> me<00:01:13.960> a<00:01:13.990> lot<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.939> cycling<00:01:15.939> shoe<00:01:16.299> in

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
reminds me a lot of a cycling shoe in

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.140 
reminds me a lot of a cycling shoe in
terms<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.710> looks<00:01:17.979> partly<00:01:18.580> because<00:01:18.759> it<00:01:19.000> has

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
terms of looks partly because it has

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.050 
terms of looks partly because it has
just<00:01:19.600> one<00:01:19.990> one<00:01:20.590> strap<00:01:20.920> here<00:01:21.220> which<00:01:21.460> kind<00:01:22.030> of

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
just one one strap here which kind of

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.179 
just one one strap here which kind of
looks<00:01:22.210> like<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.860> kind<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:23.950> looks<00:01:24.070> like<00:01:24.100> a

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
looks like a kind of looks like a

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.530 
looks like a kind of looks like a
triathlon<00:01:24.939> shoe<00:01:25.180> but<00:01:25.960> you<00:01:26.470> use<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.189> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
triathlon shoe but you use that to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.749 
triathlon shoe but you use that to
tighten<00:01:28.540> and<00:01:28.869> loosen<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:30.970> also<00:01:31.090> has<00:01:31.420> a

actually<00:02:29.910> has<00:02:31.010> if<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.070> can<00:02:32.280> really<00:02:32.520> see<00:02:33.360> here

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
actually has if you can really see here

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.370 
actually has if you can really see here
probably<00:02:34.860> not<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.640> there<00:02:36.060> are<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.840> little

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
probably not but there are a little

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.700 
probably not but there are a little
raised<00:02:37.710> little<00:02:38.460> raised<00:02:38.640> bumps<00:02:39.120> all<00:02:39.990> through

raised little raised bumps all through
it<00:02:40.940> which<00:02:41.940> give<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.900> little<00:02:43.530> more<00:02:43.740> traction<00:02:44.540> to

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
it which give a little more traction to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:58.090 
it which give a little more traction to
to<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.500> foot<00:02:54.950> now<00:02:55.950> let's<00:02:56.220> move<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:57.050> the

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
the upper there on the left side but

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.050 
the upper there on the left side but
open<00:03:40.920> there<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.550> right<00:03:42.980> again<00:03:45.680> zero<00:03:46.680> drop

zero<00:03:48.060> drop<00:03:48.270> heel<00:03:48.600> there<00:03:49.380> is<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:51.030> only

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
zero drop heel there is a the only

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.510 
zero drop heel there is a the only
noticeable<00:03:51.900> difference<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:53.220> there's<00:03:53.460> a

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
noticeable difference is that there's a

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.660 
noticeable difference is that there's a
bit<00:03:53.730> more<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.300> toast<00:03:55.200> spring<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.340> base

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
bit more of a toast spring to the base

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.430 
bit more of a toast spring to the base
model<00:03:57.120> there<00:03:57.270> if<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.570> can<00:03:57.720> see<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.320> can

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
model there if you can see that you can

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.470 
model there if you can see that you can
see<00:03:58.590> where<00:03:58.770> it<00:03:58.890> curves<00:03:59.460> up<00:03:59.670> quite<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.060> bit<00:04:00.300> more

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
see where it curves up quite a bit more

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.740 
see where it curves up quite a bit more
I'm<00:04:01.200> not<00:04:01.320> sure<00:04:01.530> if<00:04:01.650> that's<00:04:02.300> due<00:04:03.300> to<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.480> more

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
I'm not sure if that's due to a more

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.240 
I'm not sure if that's due to a more
rigid<00:04:04.610> upper<00:04:05.610> on<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:06.300> form<00:04:06.900> or<00:04:07.230> what's<00:04:07.950> going
