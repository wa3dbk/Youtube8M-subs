00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
white for this look and the weight that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.669 
white for this look and the weight that
I'm<00:00:25.019> using<00:00:25.259> is<00:00:25.619> from<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:26.009> Bed<00:00:26.189> Head<00:00:26.220> palette

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679

then I'm just using a dark charcoal
color<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.960> I'm<00:00:34.079> defining<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.680> crease<00:00:34.710> it

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
color and I'm defining my crease it

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:36.979 
color and I'm defining my crease it
doesn't<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.329> perfect<00:00:36.750> because

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
doesn't have to be perfect because

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.170 
doesn't have to be perfect because
obviously<00:00:37.260> mine<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.949> not<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.789> can<00:00:38.969> use

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
obviously mine is not but we can use

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.450 
obviously mine is not but we can use
this<00:00:39.359> later<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:40.109> a<00:00:40.140> guide<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:41.039> the<00:00:41.160> liquid

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
this later as a guide for the liquid

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.130 
this later as a guide for the liquid
liner<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.090> I'm<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.359> blending<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.899> that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
shade that's what I'm doing here it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.840 
shade that's what I'm doing here it
helps<00:01:26.820> blend<00:01:26.970> everything<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.540> lot<00:01:27.689> easier<00:01:28.079> and

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
helps blend everything a lot easier and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.580 
helps blend everything a lot easier and
then<00:01:29.850> after<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.329> I'm<00:01:30.600> gonna<00:01:30.719> be<00:01:30.990> using<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
then after that I'm gonna be using a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.709 
then after that I'm gonna be using a
shimmery<00:01:32.070> golden<00:01:32.579> brown<00:01:32.939> color<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.390> that's

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
shimmery golden brown color and that's

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.480 
shimmery golden brown color and that's
just<00:01:34.049> gonna<00:01:34.170> help<00:01:34.380> add<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.740> little<00:01:35.130> bit<00:01:35.369> of

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
just gonna help add a little bit of

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.130 
just gonna help add a little bit of
shimmer<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.149> everything<00:01:36.570> else<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.899> matte

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
shimmer because everything else is matte

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.310 
shimmer because everything else is matte
it'll<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.159> change<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> texture<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.149> it

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.389 

so<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.469> should<00:01:43.590> look<00:01:43.740> something<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.130> this

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
so it should look something like this

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
so it should look something like this
and<00:01:47.420> then<00:01:48.420> I'm<00:01:48.539> going<00:01:48.689> back<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.289> same

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
and then I'm going back with the same

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.800 
and then I'm going back with the same
liquid<00:01:49.680> liner<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.490> I'm<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.909> gonna<00:01:51.000> create<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
liquid liner and I'm just gonna create a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.319 
liquid liner and I'm just gonna create a
wing<00:01:52.590> line<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:53.250> upper<00:01:53.549> lash<00:01:53.759> line<00:01:56.329> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
wing line on my upper lash line the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
wing line on my upper lash line the
little<00:01:57.600> wings<00:01:57.780> at<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.109> end<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.590> should<00:01:58.829> kind

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
little wings at the end they should kind

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.590 
little wings at the end they should kind
of<00:01:59.219> meet<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.460> they<00:01:59.789> don't<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> actually

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
of meet up they don't have to actually

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.480 
of meet up they don't have to actually
touch<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.200> they<00:02:01.320> should<00:02:01.530> swoop<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> same

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
touch but they should swoop in the same

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:20.570 
touch but they should swoop in the same
direction

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.640 

and<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:21.300> at<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> scene<00:02:21.780> liquid<00:02:22.080> liner<00:02:22.290> I'm

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.410 
and now at the scene liquid liner I'm
just<00:02:22.860> creating<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.430> smaller<00:02:23.760> thinner<00:02:24.090> line

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
just creating a smaller thinner line

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.450 
just creating a smaller thinner line
underneath<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.350> leaving<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.920> space<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
underneath and leaving a space in the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.580 
underneath and leaving a space in the
middle<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.690> go<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:27.990> with<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.350> matte

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
middle so we can go in with that matte

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.470 
middle so we can go in with that matte
white<00:02:28.830> eyeshadow<00:02:29.040> or<00:02:29.670> whatever<00:02:29.970> color<00:02:30.270> you

decided to use and fill it in now I'm

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.600 
decided to use and fill it in now I'm
just<00:02:37.260> smudging<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.710> my<00:02:37.890> lower<00:02:38.040> lash<00:02:38.310> line

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
with the black eye shadow and moving on

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.700 
with the black eye shadow and moving on
to<00:02:41.610> my<00:02:41.730> inner<00:02:41.910> corner<00:02:42.360> I'm<00:02:43.020> just<00:02:43.290> gonna<00:02:43.380> create

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
to my inner corner I'm just gonna create

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.370 
to my inner corner I'm just gonna create
a<00:02:43.830> little<00:02:43.980> point<00:02:44.540> it'll<00:02:45.540> help<00:02:45.750> really<00:02:46.080> add<00:02:46.350> to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
a little point it'll help really add to

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.520 
a little point it'll help really add to
the<00:02:47.100> cat<00:02:47.400> eye<00:02:47.430> effect<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:49.260> could<00:02:49.410> just

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
the cat eye effect and you could just

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.700 
the cat eye effect and you could just
clean<00:02:49.770> anything<00:02:49.980> up<00:02:50.250> with<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.490> little<00:02:50.790> q-tip

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
clean anything up with a little q-tip

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.740 
clean anything up with a little q-tip

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
and I'm just gonna layer that on but I

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.730 
and I'm just gonna layer that on but I
would<00:02:57.330> definitely<00:02:57.480> recommend<00:02:57.930> fake<00:02:58.500> lashes

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
would definitely recommend fake lashes

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.280 
would definitely recommend fake lashes
for<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.190> look<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.690> this<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.110> final

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
for this look so this is the final

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.860 
for this look so this is the final
result<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.120> here<00:03:03.120> are<00:03:03.240> some<00:03:03.390> pictures<00:03:03.660> from

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
result and here are some pictures from

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.750 
result and here are some pictures from
the<00:03:04.170> first<00:03:04.380> time<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.620> did<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.190> do<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.670> it

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the first time I did it I do think it

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.100 
the first time I did it I do think it
turned<00:03:05.970> out<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.210> little<00:03:06.420> bit<00:03:06.630> better<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.930> first

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
turned out a little bit better the first

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.810 
turned out a little bit better the first
time<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.130> should<00:03:08.280> look<00:03:08.400> something<00:03:08.460> like

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
time but it should look something like

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.110 
time but it should look something like
this<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:10.280> now<00:03:11.280> we<00:03:11.310> get<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.610> turn<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.060> a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
this and now we get to turn it in a

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.810 
this and now we get to turn it in a
Halloween<00:03:12.390> makeup<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:14.220> first<00:03:14.460> thing<00:03:14.670> you're

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
Halloween makeup the first thing you're

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.200

gonna do is create a little cat nose and
there<00:03:18.210> are<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.330> lot<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.630> different<00:03:18.990> ways<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.290> do

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
there are a lot of different ways to do

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.590 
there are a lot of different ways to do
this<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.280> just<00:03:20.460> decided<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:21.000> use<00:03:21.240> the<00:03:21.420> lower

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
this but I just decided to use the lower

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.360 
this but I just decided to use the lower
half<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.960> my<00:03:22.110> nose<00:03:22.320> because<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:22.830> don't<00:03:23.190> really

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
half of my nose because I don't really

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.150 
half of my nose because I don't really
like<00:03:23.490> my<00:03:23.910> nose<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:25.140> I'm<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.440> filling<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.920> in

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
dots where there wouldn't really be

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.750
