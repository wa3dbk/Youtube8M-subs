00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
alternative medicine by definition

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.530 
alternative medicine by definition
involves<00:03:11.600> things<00:03:12.079> other<00:03:12.470> than<00:03:13.120> medicine<00:03:14.120> and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
involves things other than medicine and

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.640 
involves things other than medicine and
instead<00:03:15.049> of<00:03:15.290> medicine<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.420> personally<00:03:17.420> prefer

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
instead of medicine I personally prefer

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.559 
instead of medicine I personally prefer
to<00:03:18.650> provide<00:03:19.130> options<00:03:19.489> that<00:03:19.940> may<00:03:20.299> or<00:03:20.359> may<00:03:20.450> not

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
to provide options that may or may not

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.140 
to provide options that may or may not
be<00:03:21.109> used<00:03:21.290> with<00:03:21.590> some<00:03:21.829> traditional<00:03:22.579> medicine

be used with some traditional medicine

be used with some traditional medicine
so<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:23.690> don't<00:03:24.049> practice<00:03:24.200> alternative<00:03:25.160> medicine

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
so I don't practice alternative medicine

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.509 
so I don't practice alternative medicine
per<00:03:25.790> se<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.380> choose<00:03:27.380> integrated<00:03:28.280> medicine

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
per se I choose integrated medicine

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.250 
per se I choose integrated medicine
because<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:29.060> involves<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.660> best<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:30.079> whatever

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
because it involves the best of whatever

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.750 
because it involves the best of whatever
is<00:03:30.470> available<00:03:30.560> from<00:03:31.069> whatever<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.579> might<00:03:31.700> be

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
is available from whatever it might be

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.000 
is available from whatever it might be
available<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:32.810> then<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.290> person<00:03:33.620> can<00:03:33.739> choose

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
available so then the person can choose

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.530 
available so then the person can choose
what<00:03:34.310> combination<00:03:34.940> they<00:03:35.060> want<00:03:35.359> of

what combination they want of

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.390 
what combination they want of
traditional<00:03:35.989> medicine<00:03:36.410> were<00:03:36.799> natural

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
traditional medicine were natural

traditional medicine were natural
medicine<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.090> then<00:03:38.840> there's<00:03:39.019> holistic
