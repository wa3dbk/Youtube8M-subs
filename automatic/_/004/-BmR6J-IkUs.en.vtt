00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
and then you also have the 30-millimeter

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.729 
and then you also have the 30-millimeter
f<00:00:54.140> 1.4<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.160> it<00:00:55.820> has<00:00:56.059> a<00:00:56.300> really<00:00:56.720> nice<00:00:57.080> solid

really<00:01:01.790> nice<00:01:02.059> guys<00:01:02.330> i've<00:01:02.510> been<00:01:02.629> using<00:01:02.809> this

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
really nice guys i've been using this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.649 
really nice guys i've been using this
for<00:01:03.110> quite<00:01:03.500> some<00:01:03.769> time<00:01:03.799> and<00:01:04.280> i<00:01:04.790> really<00:01:05.269> enjoyed

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
for quite some time and i really enjoyed

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.380 
for quite some time and i really enjoyed
it<00:01:05.690> and<00:01:06.130> this<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.280> one<00:01:07.490> of<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.640> awesome<00:01:08.030> lens<00:01:08.240> i

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
it and this is one of the awesome lens i

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.510 
it and this is one of the awesome lens i
mean<00:01:08.570> compared<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.170> 50<00:01:09.470> millimeter<00:01:09.920> this

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
mean compared to the 50 millimeter this

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.600 
mean compared to the 50 millimeter this
30<00:01:10.790> millimeter<00:01:11.299> is<00:01:11.799> not<00:01:12.799> as<00:01:12.979> close<00:01:13.250> but<00:01:13.580> i

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
30 millimeter is not as close but i

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.420 
30 millimeter is not as close but i
would<00:01:13.820> say<00:01:14.000> probably<00:01:14.470> better<00:01:15.470> than<00:01:15.890> 50

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
would say probably better than 50

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.399 
would say probably better than 50
millimeter<00:01:16.820> now<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.479> 50<00:01:17.960> millimeter<00:01:18.320> is

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
millimeter now the 50 millimeter is

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.039 
millimeter now the 50 millimeter is
still<00:01:18.740> my<00:01:19.190> favorite<00:01:19.220> lens<00:01:20.119> out<00:01:20.330> there<00:01:20.659> but

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
still my favorite lens out there but

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.469 
still my favorite lens out there but
this<00:01:21.770> one<00:01:21.799> it<00:01:22.280> comes<00:01:22.520> very<00:01:22.850> close<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.330> this

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
this one it comes very close to this

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.899 
this one it comes very close to this
guy's<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.380> when<00:01:24.560> I'm<00:01:24.650> in<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.920> shoots<00:01:25.220> or<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:25.640> I

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
guy's so when I'm in the shoots or so I

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.700 
guy's so when I'm in the shoots or so I
have<00:01:26.450> some<00:01:26.659> choices<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.200> need<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:27.439> make

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
have some choices that I need to make

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.740 
have some choices that I need to make
should<00:01:28.189> i<00:01:28.280> use<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.700> 50<00:01:29.060> or<00:01:29.090> should<00:01:29.390> i<00:01:29.450> use<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
should i use the 50 or should i use the

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.620 
should i use the 50 or should i use the
30-millimeter<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:31.729> is<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:31.939> pretty<00:01:32.270> nice

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
30-millimeter so this is a pretty nice

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.139 
30-millimeter so this is a pretty nice
build<00:01:32.990> quality<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.950> focusing<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.640> really

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
build quality and the focusing is really

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.539 
build quality and the focusing is really
nice<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:35.359> smooth<00:01:36.219> transition<00:01:37.219> on<00:01:37.340> there

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
nice and smooth transition on there

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.669 
nice and smooth transition on there
which<00:01:37.789> I<00:01:37.939> really<00:01:38.149> like<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:39.109> usually<00:01:39.500> use

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
which I really like and I usually use

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.730 
which I really like and I usually use

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.399 
there and see exactly how it looks so
here's<00:01:55.310> how<00:01:55.429> it<00:01:55.609> looks<00:01:55.820> on<00:01:55.969> the<00:01:56.030> 5d<00:01:56.570> mark<00:01:56.869> 3<00:01:57.140> and

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
here's how it looks on the 5d mark 3 and

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.950 
here's how it looks on the 5d mark 3 and
i<00:01:58.219> have<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.520> say<00:01:58.549> guys<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:59.090> looks<00:01:59.149> really<00:01:59.689> nice

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
i have to say guys it looks really nice

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.410 
i have to say guys it looks really nice
and<00:02:00.289> it<00:02:00.829> looks<00:02:01.039> like<00:02:01.130> it's<00:02:01.249> built<00:02:01.729> for<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:02.030> 5d

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
and it looks like it's built for the 5d

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.080 
and it looks like it's built for the 5d
mark<00:02:02.719> 3<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:04.280> is<00:02:04.429> a<00:02:04.460> little<00:02:04.700> bit<00:02:04.850> heavy

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
mark 3 and it is a little bit heavy

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.819 
mark 3 and it is a little bit heavy
because<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.479> five-year<00:02:05.899> mar<00:02:06.079> 3<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.409> heavier

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
because the five-year mar 3 is heavier

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.700 
because the five-year mar 3 is heavier
than<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.819> 60d<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.600> have<00:02:08.810> which<00:02:09.050> i'm<00:02:09.229> using

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
than the 60d that I have which i'm using

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.160 
than the 60d that I have which i'm using
my<00:02:09.740> canon<00:02:10.340> 60d<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:11.060> record<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:11.569> video<00:02:11.780> right

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
my canon 60d to record this video right

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.470 
my canon 60d to record this video right
now<00:02:12.250> but<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.700> five<00:02:13.910> year<00:02:13.940> Marjorie<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.450> a

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
now but the five year Marjorie is a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.570 
now but the five year Marjorie is a
little<00:02:14.690> bit<00:02:14.780> heavier<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.680> lens<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.190> also

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
little bit heavier and this lens is also

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.720 
little bit heavier and this lens is also
a<00:02:16.610> little<00:02:16.910> heavy<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.780> if<00:02:18.260> i<00:02:18.560> am<00:02:18.710> using<00:02:18.980> glidecam

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
a little heavy so if i am using glidecam

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.840 
a little heavy so if i am using glidecam
or<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.960> my<00:02:21.080> shoots<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.650> i<00:02:22.430> think<00:02:22.700> this<00:02:22.790> is

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
or so for my shoots and i think this is

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.000 
or so for my shoots and i think this is
going<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.090> be<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.270> little<00:02:23.510> bit<00:02:23.660> heavy<00:02:23.930> for<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.500> so
