things<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.799> recording<00:01:08.450> it<00:01:09.450> doesn't<00:01:09.780> use

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
things like recording it doesn't use

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.679 
things like recording it doesn't use
nearly<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.619> much<00:01:10.740> CPU<00:01:11.189> power<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> nice

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
nearly as much CPU power which is nice

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.870 
nearly as much CPU power which is nice
especially<00:01:12.960> seeing<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.740> minecraft<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.490> java

settings<00:01:24.600> are<00:01:24.750> bombarded<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> whole

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979

bunch<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.220> settings<00:01:26.400> right<00:01:27.150> right<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.530> have

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
bunch of settings right right so we have

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.780 
bunch of settings right right so we have
different<00:01:28.950> types<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.159> things<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.490> chunk

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
different types of things like chunk

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.609 
different types of things like chunk
loading<00:01:30.150> which<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.689> change<00:01:30.960> round<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
loading which we can change round I

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.700 
loading which we can change round I
prefer<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.189> leave<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.320> multi-core<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.680> I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
prefer to leave it on multi-core but I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.980 
prefer to leave it on multi-core but I
mean<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.250> six<00:01:35.579> core<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.560> hey<00:01:37.560> whatever<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
mean I have six core so hey whatever and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.690 
mean I have six core so hey whatever and
this<00:01:39.990> will<00:01:40.200> reduce<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.530> stuttering<00:01:41.130> by<00:01:41.369> going

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
this will reduce the stuttering by going

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.060 
this will reduce the stuttering by going
between<00:01:41.880> chunks<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.079> remember<00:01:43.710> remember

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
between chunks if you remember remember

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.630

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
lag me a little bit enabling that option

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.770 
lag me a little bit enabling that option
would<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.490> disabled<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.659> would

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
back to the detail we can change clouds

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.839 
back to the detail we can change clouds
to<00:03:50.079> completely<00:03:50.500> off<00:03:50.680> we<00:03:51.040> can<00:03:51.159> change<00:03:51.459> them

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
to completely off we can change them

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.649 
to completely off we can change them
specifically<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:54.400> know<00:03:54.519> default<00:03:55.269> or<00:03:55.419> fast

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
specifically to you know default or fast

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.659 
specifically to you know default or fast
let's<00:03:56.139> change<00:03:56.409> it<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.590> fancy<00:03:57.159> and<00:03:57.459> let's

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
let's change it to fancy and let's

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.969 
let's change it to fancy and let's
change<00:03:57.909> the<00:03:58.090> cloud<00:03:58.299> height<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:59.379> can<00:03:59.530> move<00:03:59.680> the

00:03:59.969 --> 00:03:59.979 
change the cloud height you can move the

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.369 
change the cloud height you can move the
clouds<00:04:00.250> way<00:04:00.790> up<00:04:01.030> there<00:04:01.329> although<00:04:01.689> there<00:04:02.199> will

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
clouds way up there although there will

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.229 
clouds way up there although there will
be<00:04:02.650> some<00:04:02.829> graphical<00:04:03.280> glitches<00:04:03.549> along<00:04:03.970> with

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
be some graphical glitches along with

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.149 
be some graphical glitches along with
that<00:04:04.449> so<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:04.870> keep<00:04:05.019> that<00:04:05.079> in<00:04:05.259> mind<00:04:05.470> don't<00:04:05.799> max

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
that so just keep that in mind don't max

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.819 
that so just keep that in mind don't max
it<00:04:06.400> out<00:04:06.930> unless<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.139> just<00:04:08.259> really<00:04:08.409> want<00:04:08.799> to

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
it out unless you just really want to

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.360 
it out unless you just really want to
affect<00:04:11.829> certain<00:04:12.159> aspects<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.120> game

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
affect certain aspects of the game

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.860 
affect certain aspects of the game
now<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:15.550> really<00:04:15.670> depends<00:04:16.150> on<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.329> texture

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
now it really depends on the texture

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.569 
now it really depends on the texture
pack<00:04:17.019> itself<00:04:17.380> though<00:04:17.650> some<00:04:18.040> texture<00:04:18.370> packs

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
pack itself though some texture packs

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.160 
pack itself though some texture packs
will<00:04:18.760> not<00:04:18.940> have<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.329> graphical<00:04:19.780> glitch<00:04:19.930> with

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
will not have that graphical glitch with

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.100 
will not have that graphical glitch with
default<00:04:20.680> they<00:04:21.459> only<00:04:21.700> have<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.210> certain<00:04:22.570> length

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
default they only have a certain length

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.860 
default they only have a certain length
of<00:04:23.350> cloud<00:04:23.980> and<00:04:24.400> that's<00:04:25.390> I<00:04:25.510> think<00:04:25.540> what<00:04:25.780> it

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
of cloud and that's I think what it

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.570 
of cloud and that's I think what it
comes<00:04:25.900> down<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.380> anyway<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:27.130> can<00:04:27.280> change<00:04:27.460> the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
comes down to anyway you can change the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.490 
comes down to anyway you can change the
quality<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:27.970> wouldn't<00:04:28.360> necessarily<00:04:28.420> do<00:04:29.110> too

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
quality I wouldn't necessarily do too

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.140 
quality I wouldn't necessarily do too
much<00:04:29.650> here<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.250> all<00:04:30.340> honesty<00:04:30.700> although<00:04:30.970> guess

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
much here and all honesty although guess

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.920 
much here and all honesty although guess
what<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.390> can<00:04:31.510> even<00:04:31.630> change<00:04:31.840> your

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
what you can even change your

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.870 
what you can even change your
anti-aliasing<00:04:32.710> directly<00:04:33.190> with<00:04:33.310> in<00:04:33.370> Minecraft

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
anti-aliasing directly with in Minecraft

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.300 
anti-aliasing directly with in Minecraft
it<00:04:34.030> does<00:04:34.180> require<00:04:34.360> a<00:04:34.570> restart<00:04:34.780> though<00:04:35.230> so<00:04:35.980> you

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
it does require a restart though so you

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.940 
it does require a restart though so you
keep<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.700> in<00:04:36.850> mind<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:38.530> can<00:04:38.650> have<00:04:38.740> custom

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
keep that in mind you can have custom

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.230 
keep that in mind you can have custom
fonts<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.520> can<00:04:39.580> have<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:39.850> whole<00:04:40.000> bunch<00:04:40.180> of

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
fonts you can have a whole bunch of

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.510 
fonts you can have a whole bunch of
other<00:04:40.330> stuff<00:04:40.480> too<00:04:40.870> which<00:04:41.080> is<00:04:41.110> nice<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:42.130> really

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
other stuff too which is nice it really

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.730 
other stuff too which is nice it really
really<00:04:42.700> is<00:04:43.050> especially<00:04:44.050> with<00:04:44.170> connected

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
really is especially with connected

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.500 
really is especially with connected
textures<00:04:45.160> being<00:04:45.430> fancy<00:04:45.970> oh<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:47.500> much<00:04:47.800> fun<00:04:48.510> you

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
textures being fancy oh so much fun you

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.760 
textures being fancy oh so much fun you
can<00:04:49.630> also<00:04:49.750> change<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.110> animation<00:04:50.320> you<00:04:50.740> can

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
can also change the animation you can

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.860 
can also change the animation you can
pretty<00:04:51.100> much<00:04:51.190> animate<00:04:51.730> or<00:04:51.880> stop<00:04:52.300> animations

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
pretty much animate or stop animations

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.840

nice best detail of although I will not
lie<00:05:01.230> you<00:05:02.230> can<00:05:02.440> turn<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:03.070> weather<00:05:03.400> off<00:05:03.850> you

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
lie you can turn the weather off you

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.330 
lie you can turn the weather off you

have no idea how much I love that you

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.090 
have no idea how much I love that you

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
nice so you know how snow can sometimes

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.670 
nice so you know how snow can sometimes
be<00:05:14.590> very<00:05:14.620> laggy<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.640> snow<00:05:15.970> biomes<00:05:16.419> or<00:05:16.750> rain<00:05:17.230> be

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.330 
be very laggy and snow biomes or rain be
laggy<00:05:18.160> you<00:05:18.910> can<00:05:19.060> turn<00:05:19.210> them<00:05:19.330> off<00:05:20.250> simple<00:05:21.250> as

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
laggy you can turn them off simple as

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.300 
laggy you can turn them off simple as
that<00:05:22.260> no<00:05:23.260> word<00:05:23.440> of<00:05:23.530> a<00:05:23.620> lie<00:05:23.650> it's<00:05:23.979> all<00:05:24.130> right

that no word of a lie it's all right

there and pretty much everything it

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.060 
there and pretty much everything it
really<00:05:28.240> gives<00:05:28.510> you<00:05:28.660> full<00:05:28.960> control<00:05:29.020> over<00:05:29.770> your
