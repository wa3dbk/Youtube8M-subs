00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.670 
laptop is this is my compact Brazoria of
C<00:02:01.619> 700<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.969> got<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> Core<00:02:03.390> 2<00:02:03.420> Duo<00:02:03.680> 1.6

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
C 700 it's got a Core 2 Duo 1.6

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310 
C 700 it's got a Core 2 Duo 1.6
gigahertz<00:02:05.040> 2<00:02:06.000> gigs<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.390> ram<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.780> 160

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
gigahertz 2 gigs of ram and a 160

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.130 
gigahertz 2 gigs of ram and a 160
gigabyte<00:02:07.680> hard<00:02:07.890> drive<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:09.330> ironically<00:02:09.869> it's

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
gigabyte hard drive and ironically it's

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.380 
gigabyte hard drive and ironically it's
faster<00:02:10.920> than<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> Pentium<00:02:11.520> build<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
faster than the Pentium build the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.640 
faster than the Pentium build the
Pentium<00:02:12.720> build<00:02:12.930> has<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> really

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
Pentium build has a really

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.559 
Pentium build has a really
the<00:02:13.860> hard<00:02:14.099> drive<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.150> makes<00:02:15.360> it

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
the hard drive in it and it makes it

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.850 
the hard drive in it and it makes it
really<00:02:15.750> really<00:02:16.140> slow<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.810> yeah<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.590> is

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
really really slow so yeah this is

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.920 
really really slow so yeah this is
actually<00:02:20.310> faster<00:02:21.120> than<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.390> Pentium<00:02:21.689> build

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
actually faster than the Pentium build

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.830 
actually faster than the Pentium build
in<00:02:22.079> most<00:02:22.290> ways<00:02:22.549> so<00:02:23.549> you<00:02:24.180> know<00:02:24.269> I'm<00:02:24.390> using<00:02:24.599> this

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
in most ways so you know I'm using this

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.360 
in most ways so you know I'm using this
and<00:02:25.200> all<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> really<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.799> is<00:02:25.829> browse<00:02:26.159> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
and all I really do is browse the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.940 
and all I really do is browse the
internet<00:02:26.700> anyway<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.319> sufficient

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
internet anyway so this is sufficient

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.970 
internet anyway so this is sufficient
enough<00:02:29.069> for<00:02:29.730> my<00:02:29.909> needs<00:02:29.939> for<00:02:30.659> now<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.950> I

have this 20 inch Dell hooked up as a

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.229 
have this 20 inch Dell hooked up as a
secondary<00:02:34.470> monitor<00:02:34.709> one<00:02:35.579> thing<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.909> already

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
secondary monitor one thing I already

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.420

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
know dual monitors again that was that

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.740 
know dual monitors again that was that
this<00:02:41.129> is<00:02:41.189> just<00:02:41.430> nice<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.299> having<00:02:42.599> two

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
