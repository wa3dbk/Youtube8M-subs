00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
travelling to uh now I'm not gonna be

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500 
travelling to uh now I'm not gonna be
walking<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.710> little<00:00:25.830> ramza<00:00:26.369> actually<00:00:27.240> when<00:00:27.390> we

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
walking a little ramza actually when we

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.910 
walking a little ramza actually when we
doing<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:28.250> um<00:00:29.869> taking<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.050> boat<00:00:31.260> there<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
doing is um taking a boat there and it

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.880 
doing is um taking a boat there and it
only<00:00:32.040> takes<00:00:32.279> 30<00:00:32.460> coins<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.890> it's

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
only takes 30 coins and I think it's

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.670 
only takes 30 coins and I think it's
right<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.780> would<00:00:36.870> take<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> boat<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
right here so you would take a boat to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.889 
right here so you would take a boat to
karanji<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.579> you'd<00:00:38.730> end<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.510> must

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
karanji and you'd end up here in must

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.709 
karanji and you'd end up here in must
appoint<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:41.120> then<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.480> right<00:00:42.690> there

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
appoint and then it's just right there

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.630 
appoint and then it's just right there
so<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.320> long<00:00:43.559> walk<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.070> pretty<00:00:44.520> much

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
so it's not a long walk so pretty much

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.330
