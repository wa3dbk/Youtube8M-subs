00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.410
 you see a ruler living here 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.330
 all dashes and numbers are running 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.210
 you can also have a kind of ruler on paper 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.310
 Then we call it one 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.670
 number line 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.619
 we will now introduce that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.090
 here is a line with a zero de 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:38.100
 round lines on the right and then a 1 2 here 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:40.170
 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.500
 you can go on as long as you 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.500
 world 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.399
 That's the difference with a ruler one 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.500
 number line has no end 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.500
 that's why you put an arrow to the right here 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.910
 so here you see two plus three and you 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.129
 also sees a number line 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.710
 And now let 's see how you do such a thing 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.309
 sum can do with the help of that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.309
 number line 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.270
 for that we first look at 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.939
 that first number the two 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.580
 and we make it red for a moment and then go 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.130
 we on the number line 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.619
 those two indicate the place where the two 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.330
 I give that with a big red dot 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.330
 to here he comes 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.549
 and now I look at the three what it says 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.710
 and three must be added so me 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.280
 now look at the three you make something 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.280
 is blue 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.850
 and now I look at the number line 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.299
 because what should we do 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.700
 we must go from the two we must go 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.570
 add well if I am the two 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.409
 on tel 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.549
 so then I end up with the three 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.159
 two plus one is three so 2 plus 1 is 3 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.439
 are his jump to the right 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.530
 I add one more from the three 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.870
 the I come to the four I still count there 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.030
 a bee on the i come to the 5 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.370
 so if i start from the two and from this 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.800
 two 3 to it then I must count 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.519
 make a big jump over three 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.150
 and I will show that now 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.150
 with a bow 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:34.610
 this is a jump over triangles 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.980
 and which then arrives at the number 5 it 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.280
 end of this blue arc you point to 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:47.140
 the freedom and the answer of the sum 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.140
 is therefore 5 2 plus 3 is 5 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.959
 one last example 7 plus two 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.959
 churches again to the seven 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.579
 here you see it is red and now we put it 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.209
 a thick dot on the number line the 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:08.239
 instead of the 7 you see him here and now 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.630
 let's look at the second number 2 must 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.660
 added to it then we start from 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.359
 the seven draw an arc two 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.510
 places to the right 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.810
 we make a jump of 2 and you see 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.700
 you come out of the 9 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.459
 what we actually do is just continuing 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.000
 to have you start with the seven here 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:36.850
 and then you two get to speak 8 9 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.850
 so you start with the seven eight nine
