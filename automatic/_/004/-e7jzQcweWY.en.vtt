00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.099
 so look try to remove the flag for you 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.830
 with screw this is a cool moment hope my 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.450
 tutorial will help you and probably let's 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.970
 start now i will try 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.439
 show you the screw flasks are you ready 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.150
 look i'm showing meet here's more 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.359
 or less and from he is a little different 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.590
 look like you like my new yeah yeah 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.590
 I usually 700, just do not excuse me 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.219
 you know what I hope they do because 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.219
 that i'm not sure 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.339
 give 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.260
 it and so what do you need to be able to 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.540
 to make window blots you need 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.910
 be able to of course flasks hope you can 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.040
 because on the flask the tutorial didnâ€™t shoot 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.510
 here you need to be able to lead and you need 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.280
 be able to screw thats why you can 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.250
 look here these are my tutorials 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.220
 there I explained to you 3 st and here I explained 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.510
 you screw and after returning from 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.670
 by sea this tutorial 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.680
 where I will try to explain to you intelligibly 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.690
 how to do both with a screw and so for a start 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.000
 you need to learn how to do 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:03.760
 let's say a look in your hands with a half screw that is 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.770
 you should do something like usual 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:14.000
 immediately floor and argue and all and insert 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.650
 You can even so crookedly I'll try 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.330
 do not crooked although I am not a gymnast 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.690
 I can hardly succeed but I will try 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.690
 for you 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.580
 sorry what do you need next 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.130
 probably you need to learn some gamma 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.450
 let me show you what to do and so 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.450
 these are you on what wheel 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.359
 here so survive or not come on come on 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.570
 that you understand how to hat with a screw 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.010
 put your hands here I do it for sure 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.300
 same foot movement 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.010
 although this tutorial is not yet 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.240
 can you explain so little and 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.670
 so to twist anopia I go 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.770
 the same movement as for the flight i do 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.610
 not somehow forests just wanted exactly 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:25.850
 calling on a flight like this 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.990
 position and so hope you understand it 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.670
 so how are you supposed to learn flasks with 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.420
 cop as I already said you should 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.040
 make flasks with a half-screw rack here's 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.540
 you make the same flex half screw 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.890
 rack guess a little more about 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.690
 return a little more add 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:46.110
 add degrees and then you already have 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.700
 get one coordination yourself 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.000
 ruin it all die 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.680
 make a let's try to do as you like 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.709
 beginners ie do 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.640
 curve slept wind-up rack and try 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.180
 add 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.920
 like this 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.980
 discuss class got it i'm really 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.240
 In fact, the young man studied exactly the same 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.910
 a life 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.010
 come back we will agree then when u 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.760
 you are good at you jumping 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.200
 over plyat completeness but at the same time put 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.430
 it was such a position 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.800
 so look 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.320
 1 egg to turn so as not to break 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.310
 this idiot through st . 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:34.360
 as I explained to you clearly hope 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.190
 Yes, and so on the flyaki screw I, as always 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.470
 I do not let go of the land for a second that is 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.700
 I look at the ground all the time 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.200
 starting from when it came off 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.530
 From the earth today I start right away 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.760
 look throughout the flight as 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:51.640
 so that's why it's easy for me i mean i don't 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.410
 getting lost is not difficult for me to put my hands here 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.460
 I hope you too will succeed 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:02.050
 because it is important and cool yes how 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.990
 put hands explained learn the scale 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.340
 first learn to look at the rack 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.960
 I hope you get it better 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.320
 than me because I'm some 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:16.350
 It turns out not flexible and can not get up with 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:18.240
 full snag legs in general 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.060
 Now still understand something that I saw 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.650
 explain something here explains at me 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.470
 hands put a little teach 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.110
 considering so that the screws to the left but not the first 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.290
 put right and after the egg something I reach 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.880
 left but text growth and try to 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.820
 This is very much to think because you 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.440
 You can break the arm began to try 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.450
 do after 2 that is how I showed 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.190
 hands race wonder return hands a little 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.520
 moved your body is supposed to self 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.200
 understand how and when to put your hands here 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.210
 I already showed you the production 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.890
 there was no dislocation or anything that's 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.190
 so I hope that you will succeed 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:58.770
 vlas shoot my back 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:00.750
 Well, so-so specifically, I think it's time 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.730
 finish because Vlad can't 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:08.460
 calm down calm down and jump on 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:10.950
 trampoline asshole sleep and by the way i can you 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.690
 advise buying cool stuff from 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.840
 nozzles on they really like me 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.840
 I just trudge and especially in short 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.780
 T-shirts I generally wine you see I you 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.520
 rendered me panties like to fold 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.770
 dreamed of wine world without jokes 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.800
 I asked him very strongly 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:40.879
 But in general, I hope this tutorial for 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:40.879
 I'm cool you were given why 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.449
 so let's start it
