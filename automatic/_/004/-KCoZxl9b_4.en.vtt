00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
I think the first thing to say is that

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.860 
I think the first thing to say is that
we<00:00:05.190> had<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.340> very<00:00:05.670> productive<00:00:06.029> meeting<00:00:06.420> I

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870

in Las Vegas today that was productive I
thought<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:14.130> thought<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.370> was<00:00:14.550> very

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
thought and we thought it was very

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.010

I<00:00:37.150> thought<00:00:37.840> it<00:00:37.960> was<00:00:38.050> really<00:00:38.110> important<00:00:38.710> to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
I thought it was really important to

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.380 
I thought it was really important to
kind<00:00:38.950> of<00:00:39.100> have<00:00:39.220> an<00:00:39.310> honest<00:00:39.700> and<00:00:39.850> frank

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.360 
kind of have an honest and frank
discussion<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.590> I<00:00:41.680> thought<00:00:41.860> we<00:00:42.040> were<00:00:42.130> able<00:00:42.220> to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
discussion and I thought we were able to

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.940 
discussion and I thought we were able to
do<00:00:42.580> that<00:00:42.730> reestablish<00:00:43.570> communication<00:00:43.950> we

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
do that reestablish communication we

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.680 
do that reestablish communication we
didn't<00:00:45.160> get<00:00:45.250> into<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.700> principal<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.450> core

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
didn't get into the principal the core

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.870 
didn't get into the principal the core
principles<00:00:47.290> of<00:00:47.830> the<00:00:48.010> deal<00:00:48.220> you<00:00:48.580> know<00:00:48.730> that

principles of the deal you know that

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.190 
principles of the deal you know that
wasn't<00:00:49.210> what<00:00:49.330> it<00:00:49.360> was<00:00:49.450> about<00:00:49.600> today<00:00:50.020> was

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
and I feel like there's nothing new at

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.399 
and I feel like there's nothing new at
this<00:01:20.340> point<00:01:20.670> meaning<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.240> felt<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.659> our

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
this point meaning I felt like our

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.249 
this point meaning I felt like our
position<00:01:22.920> has<00:01:23.070> always<00:01:23.220> been<00:01:23.400> very<00:01:23.549> clear<00:01:23.909> I

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
position has always been very clear I

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.889 
position has always been very clear I
felt<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.440> their<00:01:25.710> position<00:01:26.159> over<00:01:26.369> time

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
felt like their position over time

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.480 
felt like their position over time
became<00:01:27.899> something<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.500> didn't<00:01:28.710> realize<00:01:29.070> but

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
became something I didn't realize but

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.190 
became something I didn't realize but
today<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.880> sitting<00:01:30.149> down<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> understood<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
today and sitting down I understood a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600 
today and sitting down I understood a
little<00:01:31.710> bit<00:01:31.920> different<00:01:32.280> where<00:01:32.430> his

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
little bit different where his

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.779 
little bit different where his
perspective<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.360> not<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.399> that<00:01:35.399> I<00:01:35.460> fully

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
perspective was not that that I fully

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.130 
perspective was not that that I fully
agreed<00:01:36.180> with<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.659> was<00:01:36.750> important<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
agreed with it but it was important to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.570 
agreed with it but it was important to
understand<00:01:37.500> his<00:01:37.619> perspective<00:01:38.159> which<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.399> did

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
understand his perspective which I did

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.749 
understand his perspective which I did
lend<00:01:39.330> it<00:01:39.539> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> think<00:01:40.520> it's<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.580> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
lend it and then I think it's just the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.430 
lend it and then I think it's just the
stuff<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.180> I've<00:01:42.270> heard<00:01:42.450> over<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.659> last<00:01:42.840> week

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
stuff that I've heard over the last week

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.289 
stuff that I've heard over the last week
or<00:01:43.590> two<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> did<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.549> before<00:01:44.700> yeah

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
or two that I did not know before yeah

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.960 
or two that I did not know before yeah
so<00:01:46.020> again<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.590> said<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.280> felt<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.940> was

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
so again with that said we felt it was

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
so again with that said we felt it was
important<00:01:48.539> to<00:01:48.810> take<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.289> step<00:01:49.619> forward<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
important to take a step forward and

to call off the dogs BRB song i think

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.640 
to call off the dogs BRB song i think
when<00:02:23.270> we<00:02:23.300> sat<00:02:23.600> down<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.930> was<00:02:23.959> important<00:02:24.440> for<00:02:24.470> us

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
when we sat down it was important for us

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.580 
when we sat down it was important for us
to<00:02:24.680> establish<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:26.180> at<00:02:27.170> least<00:02:27.380> from<00:02:27.500> my

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
to establish that at least from my

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.370 
to establish that at least from my
standpoint<00:02:28.160> it's<00:02:29.030> not<00:02:29.240> about<00:02:29.510> he<00:02:29.840> says<00:02:30.110> she

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
standpoint it's not about he says she

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.340 
standpoint it's not about he says she
said<00:02:30.650> that's<00:02:30.890> not<00:02:31.040> productive<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:32.750> can't

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
said that's not productive and I can't

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.650 
said that's not productive and I can't
look<00:02:33.560> at<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.890> Malusi<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.970> their<00:02:35.120> family<00:02:35.630> is

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
look at the Malusi and their family is

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.050 
look at the Malusi and their family is
part<00:02:36.050> of<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.200> problem<00:02:36.500> they<00:02:37.370> have<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.670> be<00:02:37.790> viewed

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
part of a problem they have to be viewed

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.360 
part of a problem they have to be viewed
as<00:02:38.270> part<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.690> solution<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:40.190> really

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
as part of a solution and that is really

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.070 
as part of a solution and that is really
what<00:02:40.459> my<00:02:40.700> mindset<00:02:41.120> was<00:02:41.270> today<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.840> again<00:02:41.900> I

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
what my mindset was today and again I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.170 
what my mindset was today and again I
think<00:02:42.200> we<00:02:42.500> both<00:02:42.680> walked<00:02:43.010> away<00:02:43.160> feeling<00:02:43.820> really

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
think we both walked away feeling really

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.000 
think we both walked away feeling really
good<00:02:44.330> about<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.690> meeting<00:02:44.959> we<00:02:45.080> had<00:02:45.110> today

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.850

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
you've already done you feel that now

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.130 
you've already done you feel that now
can<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.010> guys<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.489> more<00:02:52.730> no<00:02:53.690> i<00:02:53.720> don't<00:02:53.870> i<00:02:54.110> don't

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
can you guys do more no i don't i don't

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.020 
can you guys do more no i don't i don't
feel<00:02:54.410> that's<00:02:54.620> what<00:02:54.769> today<00:02:55.040> was<00:02:55.190> about<00:02:55.340> you

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
feel that's what today was about you

know<00:02:56.090> again<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.390> core<00:02:57.110> principles<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.860> the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
know again the core principles of the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.550 
know again the core principles of the
deal<00:02:58.130> we<00:02:59.000> didn't<00:02:59.209> really<00:02:59.330> get<00:02:59.510> into<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.110> was

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
deal we didn't really get into it was

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.199 
deal we didn't really get into it was
really<00:03:00.860> about<00:03:00.980> having<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.760> dialogue

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
really about having a dialogue

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.840 
really about having a dialogue
discussing<00:03:03.110> where<00:03:03.290> we<00:03:03.320> are<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:04.220> potentially

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
discussing where we are and potentially

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.930 
discussing where we are and potentially
where<00:03:05.030> we<00:03:05.180> can<00:03:05.360> go<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.870> i<00:03:06.680> think<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.580> air<00:03:07.730> was

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
where we can go and i think the air was

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.729 
where we can go and i think the air was
cleared<00:03:08.390> i<00:03:08.540> think<00:03:08.780> we<00:03:08.870> felt<00:03:09.050> very<00:03:09.170> good<00:03:09.530> i<00:03:09.560> had

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
cleared i think we felt very good i had

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.890 
cleared i think we felt very good i had
a<00:03:09.769> very<00:03:10.040> good<00:03:10.100> relationship<00:03:10.370> with<00:03:11.120> George

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
a very good relationship with George

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.080 
a very good relationship with George
Joanne<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.680> Gavin<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.459> whole<00:03:13.610> way<00:03:13.760> through

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
Joanne and Gavin the whole way through

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.060 
Joanne and Gavin the whole way through
and<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:15.049> think<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.350> were<00:03:15.410> able<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.590> get<00:03:15.709> back<00:03:15.860> on

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
and I think we were able to get back on

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.710 
and I think we were able to get back on
track<00:03:16.280> from<00:03:16.579> that<00:03:16.730> standpoint<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.450> have<00:03:17.690> a

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
track from that standpoint and have a

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.229 
track from that standpoint and have a
conversation<00:03:18.530> next<00:03:19.070> week<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.519> that<00:03:19.640> that

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
conversation next week and that that

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.170 
conversation next week and that that
right<00:03:20.480> there<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.750> something<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:22.060> was<00:03:23.060> an

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
right there is something that was an

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.550 
right there is something that was an
outcome<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.630> was<00:03:23.750> hoping<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.140> have<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.530> I

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
outcome I was hoping you have and I

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.300 
outcome I was hoping you have and I
think<00:03:24.769> we<00:03:24.860> achieved<00:03:24.950> that

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
think we achieved that

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.530 
think we achieved that
and<00:03:26.430> their<00:03:26.849> perspective<00:03:28.520> I<00:03:29.520> mean<00:03:30.270> it's<00:03:30.390> all

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
and their perspective I mean it's all

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
and their perspective I mean it's all
the<00:03:30.630> things<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.900> guys<00:03:31.050> been<00:03:31.230> writing<00:03:31.530> about

the last couple weeks we've always felt
