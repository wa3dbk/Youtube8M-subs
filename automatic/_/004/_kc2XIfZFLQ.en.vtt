00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.449 
that weather yeah that's pretty cool
I<00:02:29.780> think<00:02:30.140> every<00:02:30.410> time<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.650> changes<00:02:30.680> bring

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
I think every time it changes bring

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.070 
I think every time it changes bring
something<00:02:31.819> new<00:02:33.100> but<00:02:34.480> as<00:02:35.480> usually<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.870> would

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
something new but as usually it would

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.360 
something new but as usually it would
probably<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> couple<00:02:36.590> years<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.100> go<00:02:37.220> back

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
probably be a couple years and go back

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.430 
probably be a couple years and go back
to<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.610> old<00:02:37.760> but<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.660> think<00:02:38.930> it's<00:02:39.049> great<00:02:39.170> great

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
to the old but I think it's great great

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.780 
to the old but I think it's great great
