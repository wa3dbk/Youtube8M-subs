ok<00:02:02.770> once<00:02:03.040> playback<00:02:03.490> stops<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:04.120> that<00:02:04.300> was<00:02:04.390> gray

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
ok once playback stops it that was gray

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.899 
ok once playback stops it that was gray
and<00:02:04.659> it's<00:02:04.960> just<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.200> pause<00:02:05.440> interval<00:02:05.979> between

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
and it's just a pause interval between
