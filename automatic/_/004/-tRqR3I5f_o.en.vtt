00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.820
 Justus we have here a new issue hello 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.740
 dear friends with you scrittori this already 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.330
 thirty ninth part of my russian 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.580
 guards minecraft 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.060
 Well, by the name of the video you see 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.600
 probably already understood just this issue 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.480
 will be 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.460
 but let 's move on to update 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.640
 my city, that is , I built ours 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.380
 of course the space station they 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.719
 heard the player not us from cascade rum and 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.930
 not this trouble ash 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.809
 yes of course I built a space 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.559
 station and here it is very important lunch at 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.950
 principle for my city well and you yourself 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.539
 know what this is a space station 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.300
 on his 2 now im viewing 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.270
 first space station and cummed 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.719
 the fence that is everywhere put the fence here 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.180
 here is the entrance is strictly prohibited for ordinary 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.250
 passers-by were sent by that person boun and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.250
 This type of post where 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.130
 by pass take the car on his 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.260
 let's go further here on the right u 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.799
 here you have the ocean here 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.369
 there is a newly built type generator 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.840
 just like that 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.040
 measure and some figs in space measure 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.320
 fittings in space 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.810
 well what's next what we have on 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.880
 space station and such a generator but 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.750
 ordinary electric generator where we have there 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.850
 inside 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.329
 electricity is stored well 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.810
 generator already been but here's the next 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.259
 year we update is well, like monica 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.020
 antennas where monitors space well shorter 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.450
 no sign to the song is difficult to explain on and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.740
 here and of course the next update 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.520
 this is an awesome rocket here is a rocket 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.040
 still the most important thing in space more precisely in 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.159
 cosmo and cosmo country to cosmos dancing and 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.710
 this is how it looks like in principle 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.420
 so big epic bit they 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.590
 tell but I still tell here 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.760
 I first wanted to make a prototype 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.160
 american missiles 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.860
 how are you figures when it's called 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.270
 and here I am, its principle completely 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.760
 redone has long been different 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.040
 look put then black such edges 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.120
 and put the Russian flag from the map 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.280
 countries like this rocket principle 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.340
 all lead to a set of 300 Ghanaians 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.200
 well, and so the price looks right here 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.430
 I have such legs for a rocket 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.700
 here legs like so legs and here I have from 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.319
 Karbala bright white legs for the rocket then 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.200
 have these legs move away 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.300
 Well, the rocket is ready for launch and these legs 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.480
 move away with not when the rocket took off 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.739
 and leg type from and move along the rails 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.640
 here but so on each side 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.790
 of course 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.630
 here is another under the rocket changing there is himself 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.709
 already engine 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.940
 Well, move, so here we have here only 5 9 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.489
 and 5 engines 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.850
 Here is what packages look like in principle 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:13.050
 pimples some look like this 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.330
 under the rocket and that's about legs and about, already 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.880
 told let's drive to the ladder 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.910
 displays a slave called 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.590
 Well, if you assume that at the airport 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.959
 called the gangway then I will too 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.630
 call this slave well, you know what's here 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.750
 already astronauts are planted in a rocket 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.580
 here we still have cancer 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.040
 when the rocket is launched it moves away 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.120
 Here there is even on rails 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.739
 then do here we go and here 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.780
 we have you such an elevator 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.440
 here we rise we rise 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.209
 climb also climb high 0 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.450
 so for to rise here we are 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:55.049
 climbed to the end and here we look 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.170
 view view bow pretty view type i 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.430
 hero into space let's go by ourselves 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.799
 rocket into rocket itself 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.150
 Klitschko us inside nothing special 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:09.600
 no, I just put 33 seats and here 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.230
 and levers and buttons here especially not here 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.250
 dude i already said no that's for sure 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.890
 same Russian flag 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.799
 Everywhere should be but its and blows 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.570
 In principle, I have such a ladder 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.580
 showed you the sides of the rocket once again 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.470
 show is about to behold 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.919
 well and let's get to the last 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.870
 I updated this release again 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.090
 don't know this building is called but you 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.810
 probably already understood the essence of it somewhere 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.190
 we speak mouth we have problems to enter 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.260
 this building let's go 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.030
 but here we have miss corridor on the first 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.130
 floor and in the rooms we have such 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.840
 various buttons and levers such as well visits 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.680
 rockets direction all such 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.330
 and all that kind of fuel check and so on 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.320
 here we also have two 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.040
 man that's well and so every office where 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.770
 there is a window 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.470
 that is, to the right, well, from me 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.110
 was on the left side 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.570
 go to the second floor here with us 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.480
 there is as you can see such a big hall here 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.780
 and goes observant 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.760
 view of the rocket here as if already sitting 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.690
 worker and look at the rocket more precisely as 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.030
 she will take off 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.030
 here we also have different cups 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.990
 such type of camera look there is the same 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:30.930
 Well , here it is yours and it is already normal 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:34.650
 worker looks like there is a director and 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.720
 here is the director or who else is looking at 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.350
 launch near and there already 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.440
 ordinary workers here we have 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.610
 missile launch button here that is well 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.030
 push 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:51.390
 10 9 8 so on all this well if 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.160
 so here and of course I did 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.860
 glass roofs so that you can watch 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.590
 like a rocket and flies in open it in 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.020
 space here is now I showed you all 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.280
 updates os script you subscribe 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.500
 put the likes on the channel 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.460
 write your ideas comment on all the luck 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.960
 bye everyone 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.690
 and by the way, by the way, I forgot to say that 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.650
 I got the idea from Sergey Kolesnikov 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.650
 good luck everyone all bye
