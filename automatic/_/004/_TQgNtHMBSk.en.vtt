00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello friends in the last days the game 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.850
 charly charly has taken a lot 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.250
 popularity by social networks 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.830
 many subscribers asked me for a video 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.130
 about this why I'm here good 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.160
 let's start the game's origin challenge 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.350
 charly on social networks does not stop 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.939
 to talk about the subject a kind of game 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.609
 of the ouija that in the networks is 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.220
 know as the charly charly challenge but 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.740
 its origins are not what it seems 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.630
 during the last 48 hours more than two 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.930
 millions of people have used the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.700
 hashtag charly charly challenge is about 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.770
 of a game that involves putting in 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.280
 balance two cross-shaped pencils 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.600
 up a paper with words but 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.030
 for those who believe in phenomena 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.010
 paranormal the challenge is to do 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.610
 questions that charly a mysterious 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.039
 demon respond by moving the pencils 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.960
 but where did several reports come from and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.260
 tweets indicate that it has its origins in 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.089
 Mexico 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.219
 for example one of the most videos 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.320
 retweeted about the charly charly challenge 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.649
 shows a famous beer brand 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.840
 Mexican and the words and not in Spanish 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.970
 the game is similar to the Ouija board 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.950
 it has also had the name of ouija 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.289
 homemade with the difference that when 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.509
 you play the ouija invoke the spirit or the 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.030
 dead that you want on the contrary in 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.520
 the challenge game of charly invokes only 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.920
 charly for what I could find in 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.200
 google charly is a game as I told you 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.240
 before Mexican even older than the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.819
 ouija there are two ways to play it 1 the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.159
 better known is putting two pencils in 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.740
 vertical and horizontal form as 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.390
 shows in the picture after that the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.940
 pencils should be balanced 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.460
 so that's when you ask a question 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.259
 wooden object will move to the sion or if 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.630
 the object moves then you have 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.490
 established a contact with charly and if 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.289
 does not move then it may be that the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.479
 pencils are not balanced or that 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.700
 It is simply a lie, it is recommended 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.830
 if you see that the game does work 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.350
 be scared do not give up the game if 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.210
 you started you must continue to the end 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.580
 remember that before leaving you must 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.830
 ask charly if he tells you if 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.050
 then you must throw the pencils 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.980
 I usually say goodbye and if he says no 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.290
 then you must keep playing 2 is not 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.330
 very well known but this one is played with two 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.580
 Coins The first thing you should do is 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.190
 say charly charly can I enter the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.290
 game and you should throw the modern ones in a 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.750
 table if the two coins come out expensive 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.330
 then it means that if and if the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.900
 two on the back means no and if 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.730
 they come out 1 face and the other turned stable 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.350
 then once you enter the game 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.019
 you have to ask the questions that you 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.030
 you want but remember not to ask questions 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.250
 of love money or death of some 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.319
 person since it is said that bothers 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.319
 much to the spectrum such as the first 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.420
 to get out you should ask him this guy 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.220
 of playing with the brunettes I knew her 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.010
 I played it a long time ago 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.920
 many times I repeat I played the version with 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.260
 the currencies are now almost 3 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.660
 years that I did not play it back then I 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.670
 I did not know it was a bad thing I just thought 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.040
 that was a simple trivia game with 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.290
 the coins but always when he played 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.409
 my friends we left the game now 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.629
 knowing this I will not play it again 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.629
 version with pencils was unknown to 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.640
 me and if they ask me if I would play it the 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.310
 answer is not because when playing this 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.170
 game you do not know who Charlie is and what 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.690
 would happen if the connection can not be 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.150
 finish 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.490
 as I said earlier the origins 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.350
 of the game seem from mexico the truth is 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.230
 that in Mexico there is no devil that 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.150
 charly is called many of the legends 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.460
 Mexicans have their origin in the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.500
 Mayan and Aztec mythology or from the 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.500
 beliefs that began to circulate in the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.840
 region during the Spanish conquest in 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.480
 Mexican mythology abounds with names 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.120
 gods like of the tezcatlipoca 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.920
 they come from Nahuatl these were gods 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.380
 mainly related to 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.050
 natural phenomena the existence of a 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.940
 underworld or the creators of the world with 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.070
 the arrival of the Spaniards was born a 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.660
 religious syncretism that now nurtures the 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.640
 most of the beliefs of the 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.740
 Mexicans it is possible that for the public 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.810
 Anglo-Saxon the fact that this 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.700
 Mysterious game will relate to the 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.709
 Mexican culture would give that touch 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.480
 exotic that viralized it from the same 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.519
 way that the Ouija board game 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.930
 has its origins in an intelligent 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.420
 marketing strategy of a 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.570
 American 19th century instead of 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.460
 Egypt as many can think of me 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.040
 opinion this game is one of the most 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.169
 many diabolical games that exist 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.659
 I would recommend you not to play as it is 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.819
 invoking a spirit that you do not know if 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:40.740
 it's a bad or good people but so 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.900
 what has happened to many people who 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.909
 played this game I deduce that it's a 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.580
 spirit with not very good intentions 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.800
 There is also the possibility that not only 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.569
 you are invoking a being if you can not 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.729
 be invoking a very demon 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.740
 mighty called charlie or maybe it's 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.569
 the same satan good there are many 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.639
 theories about this as I told you 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.099
 previously I would recommend you not 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.819
 play but good you are he who takes 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.650
 the last decision is only a council
