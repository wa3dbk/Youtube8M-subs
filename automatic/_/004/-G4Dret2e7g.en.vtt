00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 invisible planes do not exist anymore because 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.569
 even fighters and stealth bombers 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.030
 they do not represent a great difficulty for 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.759
 the Russian radars how they get 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.530
 detect them the experts do not use the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.360
 invisible word when they refer to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.460
 the stealth technology known in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.109
 english as stealth technology because 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.090
 make an airplane invisible to a rocket with 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.619
 modern technologies is impossible 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.250
 explains the russian newspaper rossiyskaya 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.050
 gazeta according to the newspaper the only thing that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.240
 you can do is reduce your visibility 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.250
 but only in the field of vision of 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.410
 radar what represents the first heel 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.120
 of Achilles from a sneak plane as they are 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.370
 visible to the naked eye for an operator 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.050
 of the portable air defense system 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.079
 short range and for your type rocket 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.890
 shoot and forget however warns the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.570
 daily 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.070
 it is always better to shoot down the planes 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.680
 of the long-distance enemy and not 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 when they fly over your head to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.760
 same time for long detection 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.309
 distance there radio locator is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.770
 a common radar can spot a plane to 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.809
 a distance of 300 kilometers while 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.090
 that furtive technologies allow 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.369
 shorten this distance although to a high 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.100
 cost in order to disperse the beam of 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.840
 Radar 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.290
 aircraft manufacturers make them a 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.400
 little angular and whenever possible 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.710
 they replace metal with materials 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.840
 reinforced with carbon fiber or when 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.330
 this is not possible by radio materials 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.520
 absorbers to hide the radar 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.170
 compressors of the engines one of the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.390
 metal parts more visible to the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.640
 radar place before them diffusers 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.920
 specials capable of drowning the signal of 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.539
 radar the plane nozzles of an airplane 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.390
 they make it less visible in the infrared 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.920
 for a better masking they add to 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.470
 cold air propulsion jet 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.819
 coming from the intake valves 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.530
 The traditional tail of the plane is 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.270
 replaced in the poachers by another in 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.539
 Uve shape the call with the butterfly 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.920
 less visible to the radar even the 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.869
 Pilots seats are made 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.060
 conjugates to dissipate the radiation of 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.979
 radar in an attempt to make them 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.509
 invisible are planes with 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.700
 very combat features 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.740
 weakened since they can not carry a 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.690
 a lot of weapons everything is 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.549
 hidden in the fuselage and its speed 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.080
 and flight range is limited and 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.479
 you can use your radar only with a lot 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.239
 caution since it makes it very visible to 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.100
 another radar the newspaper highlights a flaw 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.230
 plus the shortage of fugitive aircraft 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.480
 for example the American bomber 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.030
 b 2 spirit is the most expensive plane in the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.520
 history whose cost exceeds 15 million 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.940
 of dollars in spite of which they can 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.940
 shoot down
