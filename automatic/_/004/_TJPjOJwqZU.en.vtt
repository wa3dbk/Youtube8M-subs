he was hey there like that I haven't

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
typed it like that just so so I swipe it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.310 
typed it like that just so so I swipe it
with<00:01:26.280> my<00:01:26.400> finger<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.600> pretty<00:01:27.810> cool<00:01:28.020> how

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
with my finger I was pretty cool how

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.499 
with my finger I was pretty cool how
this<00:01:28.619> works<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.610> might<00:01:29.729> be<00:01:29.850> wondering<00:01:30.060> how

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this works so we might be wondering how

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.240 
this works so we might be wondering how
does<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> hurt<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.680> things<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.979> came

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
does it hurt you do the things that came

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.359 
does it hurt you do the things that came
low<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:33.000> there's<00:01:33.540> two<00:01:33.780> elves<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.250> you

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
low where there's two elves like do you

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.090 
low where there's two elves like do you
go<00:01:35.520> back<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.880> forth<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
go back and forth for what so what it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.819 
go back and forth for what so what it
does<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.250> basically<00:01:38.579> uses<00:01:39.000> prediction<00:01:39.479> so

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
does is basically uses prediction so

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.569 
does is basically uses prediction so
technically<00:01:40.829> I'm<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.280> writing<00:01:42.200> h-e-l-l-o

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
technically I'm just writing h-e-l-l-o

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.990 
technically I'm just writing h-e-l-l-o
but<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.450> prediction<00:01:46.009> fixes<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> CL<00:01:47.970> oh

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
but the prediction fixes it to a CL oh

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.560 
but the prediction fixes it to a CL oh
so<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.380> basically<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.490> Dutch<00:01:51.119> song

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
so that's what basically a Dutch song

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.300 
so that's what basically a Dutch song
for<00:01:52.079> instance<00:01:52.290> favorite<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.079> nose

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
for instance favorite and the nose

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.240 
for instance favorite and the nose
pretty<00:01:56.310> well<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.729> works<00:01:56.880> pretty<00:01:57.060> well<00:01:57.180> and

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
pretty well it works pretty well and

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.700 
pretty well it works pretty well and
SwiftKey<00:01:59.250> basically<00:01:59.820> put<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.210> up<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:01.140> Santa

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
SwiftKey basically put this up not Santa

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.010 
SwiftKey basically put this up not Santa
made<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.009> even<00:02:02.250> better<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.909> first<00:02:03.540> inside<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
made it even better so first inside you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.389 
made it even better so first inside you
don't<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.380> actually<00:02:04.469> let<00:02:04.799> go<00:02:04.890> my<00:02:05.070> finger

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
don't have to actually let go my finger

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.819 
don't have to actually let go my finger
while<00:02:05.969> I'm<00:02:06.090> swiping<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.780> right<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:07.530> i'm<00:02:07.710> going

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
while I'm swiping so right now i'm going

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.950 
while I'm swiping so right now i'm going
to<00:02:07.890> give<00:02:07.979> example<00:02:08.720> hello<00:02:09.890> there

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:21.110 

all<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:14.780> life<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.900> works<00:02:19.250> now<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.910> not

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
all this life and it works now it's not

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.810 
all this life and it works now it's not
as<00:02:21.390> accurate<00:02:21.600> as<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.110> can<00:02:22.290> see<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:22.800> but<00:02:23.130> that

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
as accurate as you can see here but that

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.730 
as accurate as you can see here but that
works<00:02:24.000> for<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.240> most<00:02:24.420> part<00:02:24.630> okay<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.380> first

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
works for the most part okay so first

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.950 
works for the most part okay so first
key<00:02:26.040> force<00:02:26.370> one<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.700> my<00:02:26.880> favorite<00:02:27.420> keyboards

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
key force one of my favorite keyboards

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.860 
key force one of my favorite keyboards
and<00:02:28.880> partly<00:02:29.880> because<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.360> prediction

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
and partly because it's the prediction

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.680 
and partly because it's the prediction
the<00:02:31.230> flow<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.760> keyboard<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.330> actually<00:02:33.660> a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the flow just the keyboard is actually a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.050 
the flow just the keyboard is actually a
very<00:02:34.170> easy<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.590> type<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.250> space<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.790> long

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
very easy to type the space is long

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.400 
very easy to type the space is long
enough<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:37.460> not<00:02:38.630> mistake<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:40.020> comma<00:02:40.260> or

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
enough to not mistake it for a comma or

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.550 
enough to not mistake it for a comma or
period<00:02:40.590> here<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:42.510> looks<00:02:42.570> great<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
period here and it looks great for the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.390 
period here and it looks great for the
most<00:02:43.590> part<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.420> costs<00:02:45.930> are<00:02:46.170> 199<00:02:47.070> right

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
most part so this costs are 199 right

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.700 
most part so this costs are 199 right
now<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:48.330> i<00:02:48.360> highly<00:02:48.660> recommend<00:02:49.170> getting<00:02:49.320> at<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
now so i highly recommend getting at the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.520 
now so i highly recommend getting at the
Play<00:02:49.860> Store<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.370> also<00:02:50.970> normally<00:02:51.930> called<00:02:52.110> 399

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
Play Store I also normally called 399

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.960 
Play Store I also normally called 399
which<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.950> still<00:02:53.160> worth<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:53.580> my<00:02:53.610> opinion

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
which is still worth it in my opinion

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.460 
which is still worth it in my opinion
but<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.510> should<00:02:54.660> really<00:02:54.840> get<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.230> right<00:02:55.350> now

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
but you should really get it right now

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.330 
but you should really get it right now
versus<00:02:55.920> 199<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.870> that's<00:02:58.740> pretty<00:02:58.980> much<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.160> for

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
versus 199 so that's pretty much it for

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.710 
versus 199 so that's pretty much it for
