which is what i promised you the next
part<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.930> series<00:01:18.990> would<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.470> about<00:01:19.830> water

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
part of this series would be about water

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
part of this series would be about water
filtration<00:01:21.000> there's<00:01:21.900> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.110> this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
filtration there's going to be this

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.830 
filtration there's going to be this
video<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> next

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
video and then it's going to be the next

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.170 
video and then it's going to be the next
video<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.530> water<00:01:26.220> filtration<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.939> there<00:01:27.030> may

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
video on water filtration and there may

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.580 
video on water filtration and there may
actually<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.630> third<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.229> water

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
actually be a third one on water

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.969 
actually be a third one on water
filtration<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.500> it<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> very

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
filtration and it's because it is a very

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 
filtration and it's because it is a very
misunderstood<00:01:32.759> subject<00:01:33.270> sometimes<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
misunderstood subject sometimes and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.780 
misunderstood subject sometimes and
people<00:01:34.560> don't<00:01:34.650> really<00:01:34.829> properly<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
people don't really properly think it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.160 
people don't really properly think it
through<00:01:36.030> they'll<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.360> about<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.869> part<00:01:37.140> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
through they'll think about one part of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.109 
through they'll think about one part of
the<00:01:37.290> problem<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:38.340> think<00:01:38.610> they<00:01:38.729> bought<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the problem they think they bought a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.819 
the problem they think they bought a
filter<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.110> filters<00:01:40.500> got<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
filter and now that filters got it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.980 
filter and now that filters got it
handled<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.400> know<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> previous

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
handled I know that in the previous

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.719 
handled I know that in the previous
episode<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.590> mentioned<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> gentleman<00:01:44.640> who

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.940 
episode I mentioned a gentleman who
thought<00:01:44.909> he<00:01:45.090> bought<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.570> good<00:01:46.200> water<00:01:46.530> filter

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
thought he bought a good water filter

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
problems that you have with water I'm

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.800 
problems that you have with water I'm
going<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.580> organize<00:02:36.880> into<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.510> few<00:02:37.720> different

going to organize into a few different

categories and I realize that some of

categories and I realize that some of

you out there that are really sticklers

you out there that are really sticklers
you're<00:02:41.230> going<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.440> say<00:02:41.620> well<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.130> shouldn't

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
you're going to say well that shouldn't

go in that category that should go in

go in that category that should go in
that<00:02:44.170> category<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.920> am<00:02:45.670> deliberately

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
that category I am deliberately

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.300 
that category I am deliberately
oversimplifying<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.709> that's<00:02:48.130> because

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
oversimplifying this and that's because

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.800 
oversimplifying this and that's because
I<00:02:48.459> don't<00:02:48.640> think<00:02:48.819> it's<00:02:48.940> terribly<00:02:49.299> interesting

I don't think it's terribly interesting

I don't think it's terribly interesting
for<00:02:49.989> people<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:51.250> me<00:02:51.519> go<00:02:51.730> into<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.180> great

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.030 
basic problem is called turbidity now
turbidity<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.150> just<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.480> ten-cent<00:03:32.049> 25-cent<00:03:32.739> 50

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
turbidity is just a ten-cent 25-cent 50

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.610 
turbidity is just a ten-cent 25-cent 50
cent<00:03:33.250> word<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:34.000> means<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.989> water<00:03:35.170> is<00:03:35.319> cloudy

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
cent word that means the water is cloudy

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.860 
cent word that means the water is cloudy
it's<00:03:36.069> dirty<00:03:36.459> their<00:03:36.850> stuff<00:03:37.120> floating<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.660> we

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
pick it up and we look at it and it it

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.640 
pick it up and we look at it and it it
doesn't<00:03:40.120> look<00:03:40.329> like<00:03:40.389> the<00:03:40.660> nice<00:03:40.840> clear<00:03:41.260> bottled

we<00:04:01.959> can<00:04:02.109> take<00:04:02.319> a<00:04:02.350> look<00:04:02.500> at<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:02.920> see<00:04:03.069> that

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
we can take a look at it and see that

basic turbidity now that isn't because
water<00:04:15.850> that's<00:04:16.180> brown<00:04:16.450> is<00:04:16.780> always<00:04:17.079> bad<00:04:17.380> if<00:04:17.709> you

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
water that's brown is always bad if you

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580

stuff okay so that's all the biological
and<00:05:30.700> viral<00:05:31.150> stuff<00:05:31.419> we<00:05:31.600> need<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.840> worry<00:05:32.020> about

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
and viral stuff we need to worry about

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.840

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.040 
and that's another category it's
important<00:05:34.210> that<00:05:34.330> we<00:05:34.360> worry<00:05:34.630> about<00:05:34.870> that

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
important that we worry about that

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.629 
important that we worry about that
because<00:05:35.200> sometimes<00:05:35.800> there<00:05:36.010> are<00:05:36.130> filters<00:05:36.340> that

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
because sometimes there are filters that

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:37.860 
because sometimes there are filters that
they'll<00:05:36.820> handle<00:05:37.090> one<00:05:37.270> thing<00:05:37.510> and<00:05:37.660> they<00:05:37.720> won't

they'll handle one thing and they won't

they'll handle one thing and they won't
handle<00:05:38.139> another<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:38.590> we<00:05:38.650> need<00:05:38.800> to<00:05:38.889> know<00:05:39.010> how
