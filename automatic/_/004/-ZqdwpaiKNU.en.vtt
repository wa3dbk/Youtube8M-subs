here<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.439> helps<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.860> neutralize<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.610> negative

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

recently added nucleotide this makes it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.360 
recently added nucleotide this makes it
more<00:01:22.790> nucleophilic<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.200> it's<00:01:24.350> more<00:01:24.650> likely<00:01:25.010> to

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
more nucleophilic so it's more likely to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.690

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
that there's no oxygen makes it fit

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.350 
that there's no oxygen makes it fit
perfectly<00:01:42.470> within<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:43.040> hydrophobic<00:01:43.820> pocket

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
and helps us to maintain DNA fidelity

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.750 
and helps us to maintain DNA fidelity
our<00:04:26.270> DNA<00:04:27.080> repair<00:04:27.530> mechanisms<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.580> we'll

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
our DNA repair mechanisms that we'll

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.980 
our DNA repair mechanisms that we'll
examine<00:04:29.120> in<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.539> later<00:04:29.720> lesson

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
examine in the later lesson

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.980 
examine in the later lesson
in<00:04:31.289> our<00:04:31.979> next<00:04:32.190> video<00:04:32.490> lesson<00:04:32.940> we<00:04:33.389> want<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.780> see

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
in our next video lesson we want to see

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.800 
in our next video lesson we want to see
how<00:04:34.229> we<00:04:34.289> remove<00:04:34.770> those<00:04:35.009> RNA<00:04:35.490> primers<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.330> then

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
how we remove those RNA primers and then

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.870 
how we remove those RNA primers and then
how<00:04:37.050> we<00:04:37.110> join<00:04:37.530> those<00:04:37.740> pieces<00:04:38.250> together<00:04:38.460> to

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
how we join those pieces together to

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.560 
how we join those pieces together to
form<00:04:39.240> an<00:04:39.449> impact<00:04:40.050> strand
