00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
then on this side you've got a ceramic

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.539 
then on this side you've got a ceramic
rod<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.120> can<00:03:15.360> actually<00:03:15.600> hone<00:03:16.080> your<00:03:16.320> knife

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
and just slide that loop through drop

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.680 
and just slide that loop through drop

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
the knife on the ground you can skip

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.430 
the knife on the ground you can skip
that<00:06:04.900> part

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
that part

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.050 
that part
skip<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:06.070> drop<00:06:06.310> in<00:06:06.490> your<00:06:06.580> knife<00:06:06.760> on<00:06:06.940> the

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.080 

then<00:06:13.240> you've<00:06:13.419> got<00:06:13.599> this<00:06:13.810> right<00:06:14.050> here<00:06:14.560> so<00:06:15.460> belt

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
then you've got this right here so belt

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.540 
then you've got this right here so belt
goes<00:06:16.360> through<00:06:16.689> here<00:06:17.050> then<00:06:17.860> it<00:06:18.009> goes<00:06:18.219> through

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
goes through here then it goes through

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.760 
goes through here then it goes through
your<00:06:18.759> belt<00:06:18.999> loop<00:06:19.270> then<00:06:20.080> it<00:06:20.229> goes<00:06:20.409> through<00:06:20.439> the

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
your belt loop then it goes through the

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.649 
your belt loop then it goes through the
other<00:06:20.949> loops<00:06:21.219> now<00:06:21.580> it's<00:06:21.819> going<00:06:22.120> through<00:06:22.270> three

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
other loops now it's going through three

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.080 
other loops now it's going through three
loops<00:06:22.960> and<00:06:23.529> it's<00:06:24.069> actually<00:06:24.490> dropping<00:06:24.999> the

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
loops and it's actually dropping the

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.179 
loops and it's actually dropping the
sheath<00:06:25.360> a<00:06:25.599> little<00:06:25.930> bit<00:06:26.080> lower<00:06:26.349> on<00:06:26.650> your<00:06:26.680> side

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:27.189 
sheath a little bit lower on your side

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:31.649 
sheath a little bit lower on your side
and<00:06:28.110> making<00:06:29.110> it<00:06:29.340> essentially<00:06:30.340> a<00:06:30.370> dangler<00:06:30.879> so

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:31.659 
and making it essentially a dangler so

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:33.510 
and making it essentially a dangler so
you<00:06:31.779> can<00:06:32.050> kind<00:06:32.439> of<00:06:32.469> twist<00:06:32.800> it<00:06:32.949> a<00:06:33.039> little<00:06:33.189> bit<00:06:33.370> to

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
you can kind of twist it a little bit to

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.360 
you can kind of twist it a little bit to
the<00:06:33.610> side<00:06:33.849> to<00:06:34.060> help<00:06:34.180> you<00:06:34.360> draw<00:06:34.599> the<00:06:34.659> knife<00:06:34.930> a

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
the side to help you draw the knife a

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.489 
the side to help you draw the knife a
little<00:06:36.370> bit<00:06:36.490> easier<00:06:36.900> sometimes<00:06:37.900> I<00:06:38.229> do<00:06:38.289> that

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:38.499 
little bit easier sometimes I do that

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.379 
little bit easier sometimes I do that
sometimes<00:06:38.770> I<00:06:39.099> don't<00:06:39.129> it<00:06:39.639> just<00:06:39.669> depends<00:06:40.360> on

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:40.389 
sometimes I don't it just depends on

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.480 
sometimes I don't it just depends on
what<00:06:41.110> pants<00:06:41.529> I'm<00:06:41.620> wearing<00:06:41.919> whether<00:06:42.069> or<00:06:42.219> not<00:06:42.310> I
