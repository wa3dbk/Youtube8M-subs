I've<00:02:42.599> got<00:02:42.750> Jim<00:02:42.989> rerunning<00:02:43.349> here<00:02:43.650> decoder<00:02:44.250> Pro

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
I've got Jim rerunning here decoder Pro

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.649 
I've got Jim rerunning here decoder Pro
so<00:02:46.079> if<00:02:46.139> we<00:02:46.200> click<00:02:46.409> on<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:47.879> debug<00:02:48.209> let's

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
so if we click on that the debug let's

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.000 
so if we click on that the debug let's
go<00:02:48.780> ahead<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.049> open<00:02:49.109> up<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.439> throttle<00:02:49.650> first

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
go ahead and open up the throttle first

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.460 
go ahead and open up the throttle first
we're<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.609> need<00:02:50.760> one<00:02:51.109> so<00:02:52.109> we'll<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.349> our

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
we're going to need one so we'll get our

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.229 
we're going to need one so we'll get our
throttle<00:02:52.680> going<00:02:53.099> down<00:02:53.700> here<00:02:53.939> in<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.060> corner

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
throttle going down here in the corner

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.159 
throttle going down here in the corner
give<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.930> an<00:02:55.019> address<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:56.030> can<00:02:57.030> now<00:02:57.180> control<00:02:58.049> a

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
give it an address I can now control a

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.640 
give it an address I can now control a
locomotive<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:59.010> my<00:02:59.219> layout<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.900> also<00:03:01.349> works

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
locomotive on my layout this also works

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.830 
locomotive on my layout this also works
with<00:03:01.829> Hardware<00:03:02.219> rattles<00:03:02.669> so<00:03:03.450> if<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.659> have

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
with Hardware rattles so if you have

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.039 
with Hardware rattles so if you have
digitrax<00:03:04.379> nce<00:03:04.919> any<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.939> those<00:03:06.060> hooked<00:03:06.359> up<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
digitrax nce any of those hooked up and

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.869 
digitrax nce any of those hooked up and

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
layout the hardware throttle will also

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.170 
layout the hardware throttle will also
cause<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.969> same<00:03:12.030> effects<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.750> happen<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:15.030> in

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
cause the same effects to happen so in

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.330 
cause the same effects to happen so in

there I hope we're going to set the
address<00:04:55.640> to<00:04:56.090> match<00:04:56.300> our<00:04:56.870> throttle<00:04:57.170> five<00:04:57.620> to

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830

address to match our throttle five to
seven<00:04:58.190> eight<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:58.640> now<00:04:59.600> our<00:04:59.990> virtual<00:05:00.680> decoder

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
seven eight and now our virtual decoder

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.740 
seven eight and now our virtual decoder
is<00:05:01.370> listening<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:01.940> throttle<00:05:02.180> just<00:05:02.510> like

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
is listening to the throttle just like

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.600 
is listening to the throttle just like
our<00:05:02.990> locomotive<00:05:03.380> decoder<00:05:03.800> on<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.100> layout<00:05:04.430> is

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
our locomotive decoder on the layout is

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.920 
our locomotive decoder on the layout is
it's<00:05:04.910> going<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.150> respond<00:05:05.480> to<00:05:05.570> all<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:05.750> the

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
it's going to respond to all of the

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.800 
it's going to respond to all of the
button<00:05:06.200> presses<00:05:06.790> with<00:05:07.790> a<00:05:07.820> few<00:05:08.030> differences<00:05:08.450> so

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
button presses with a few differences so

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.500 
button presses with a few differences so
right<00:05:09.020> away<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:10.670> I'll<00:05:10.790> admit<00:05:10.940> I<00:05:11.090> have<00:05:11.240> a<00:05:11.270> bug

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
right away and I'll admit I have a bug

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.960

go<00:07:17.110> notice<00:07:18.110> on<00:07:18.230> just<00:07:18.500> like<00:07:18.650> on<00:07:18.800> the<00:07:18.890> real<00:07:19.040> thing

go notice on just like on the real thing

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.420 
go notice on just like on the real thing
I<00:07:19.340> could<00:07:19.490> still<00:07:19.730> ring<00:07:19.910> the<00:07:20.030> bell<00:07:20.180> so<00:07:21.250> this<00:07:22.250> is

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 
I could still ring the bell so this is

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.700 
I could still ring the bell so this is
the<00:07:22.520> basic<00:07:22.850> idea<00:07:23.000> how<00:07:23.450> this<00:07:23.630> works<00:07:23.870> there's<00:07:24.650> a

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 
the basic idea how this works there's a

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.140 
the basic idea how this works there's a
