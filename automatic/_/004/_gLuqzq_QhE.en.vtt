now we do there are four or five types
of<00:00:56.309> snow<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.030> impossible<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:58.140> any

snowmobiles and even reindeer get stuck
that<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.619> why<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.979> used<00:01:05.189> ultra<00:01:05.760> low<00:01:05.970> pressure

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that is why we used ultra low pressure

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.020 
that is why we used ultra low pressure
tires<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:07.049> our<00:01:07.290> vehicle<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.010> enable<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
traverse this kind of snow we can also

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.760 
traverse this kind of snow we can also

then move forward pushing away through

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.380 
then move forward pushing away through

the lower the pressure the larger the

the Vikings extremely low center of

the Vikings extremely low center of
gravity<00:01:38.549> also<00:01:39.390> makes<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> difficult<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.290> roll

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
gravity also makes it difficult to roll

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.090 
gravity also makes it difficult to roll
