00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.950
 then it is nothing but to transform a 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.430
 file wi fi an audio in a range of places 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.020
 that you enter transfer ours 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.650
 ryu transmitter does Russian we have 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.580
 recovered an old remote control 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.460
 there is a volume based alfano wave I said 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.500
 I downloaded it located in the computer 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:52.590
 here is a little bit of a brief 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.270
 noise that will be transferred as a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.950
 train of impulses as I said before on the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.280
 Our Brochure Transmitter 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.229
 cable done as we have seen before 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.390
 we don't do anything else I know anything about 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.940
 excavation we are going to put the plug of the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.489
 from three and a half from the headphone output of the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:14.760
 computer monitors which are outputs such as 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:17.130
 the warning of the same thing within itself 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.670
 media player this when I want to see 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.560
 the square 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.910
 raise the volume of the phone or 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.350
 of the computer 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.540
 here is this point I'm ready for 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.400
 being able to try to be lived by 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.570
 this TV lg this with the model 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.670
 very old lg lg television a lot 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.680
 very old and a half digital must 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.440
 be incorporated so it is 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.959
 modern reasons is already on this we can 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.000
 that now works to pin up 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:53.579
 play point the infrared transmitter 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.090
 on a TV receiver and test 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.160
 to see if it goes into service we see a 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.150
 moment 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.299
 here's a first impulse is gone 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.450
 entered into service mode and therefore rich 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.180
 again it comes out click of enter then 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.000
 we can see that they continue on a 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.829
 first television including any ng 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.360
 I have tried on several TVs 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.100
 on almost all TVs 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.620
 lg is a new generation 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.420
 where some action is convenient because on 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.090
 different appliances does not work the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.880
 system suggested by the house ie 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.650
 press menu and menu or ok ok from 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.590
 then remote control and from the keyboard 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.830
 very important to create this case 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.660
 we find it on another device now 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.270
 then I took a 40-inch by a little 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.250
 newer kind of first and a TV 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.050
 another digital built-in one 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.610
 largest model first but not really 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.430
 last generation though because here 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.930
 we can show that it works then 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.530
 we bet and smooth considered the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.940
 transmitter in the direction area 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.740
 r of the TV 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:10.280
 remo play does not see you only two hands I have to 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.280
 do it all at night here is qua factor 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.490
 then what is important when you are a 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.380
 service or exit directly like that 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.720
 of before or it can exit a screen 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.150
 of the kind one must do in the south are not 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.560
 all the same passwords, some of them 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.570
 spent some 000 are as usual 34 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.200
 many others are on the back said 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:36.360
 chord is always 0 0 0 0 so it is not 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:39.950
 difficult here is here service monet with 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.910
 if then there are the various options that 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.360
 that of the first friends and exits 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.150
 directly here are other other steps 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.100
 I said that he owes the subsidy lg or 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.650
 on any site that talks about mestre 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.150
 this services a very important thing 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.710
 which meant I was waiting for him as we are 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.230
 in this menu what you don't mess around with 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.480
 there is this less here practically serves to 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.310
 make various parameter settings 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.960
 of the eco mode panel 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.760
 so if you put it we will get to 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.550
 play without knowing what we do 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.190
 look if we move this parameters 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.080
 menu we basically put off 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.890
 combat of such lived therefore not 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.270
 learns the fact that is what 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.250
 you have to do or better not to joke 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.550
 don't start playing with inter am 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.830
 you risk making all the cash out of 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.510
 fix something you do well on 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.160
 TV this is a video of 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:34.110
 portfolio those where the sector 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:36.090
 so beware eye and then lg of 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.870
 last generation led itself 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.540
 procedure you service fair way 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.760
 simplest procedure plus series with 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:51.240
 more complete 0041 3 0 4 13 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.420
 here it is in service mode or 16 seconds a 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.360
 disposition more instead ascribes and of 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.740
 memory then then the others are all 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.740
 hello to all the elect
