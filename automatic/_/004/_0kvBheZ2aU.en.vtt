 10 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:28.640
 what would be the figure of electro 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.640

 good the place number 9 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.730
 for me it was granted to the figure of 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:57.500
 mystery this fantastic figure of this 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.580
 very good character figure and yes no doubt 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.400
 pretty loyal to what comics is 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:08.700
 pretty good figure 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:14.009
 the figure with the place 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.850
 number 8 would be the figure of Kim Ping the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.630
 king of crime 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.840
 here you can see it is a fantastic 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.540
 figure and good has has the image of 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.509
 comic book and then what else can you 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.070
 ask for this figure this is the version 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.000
 normal remember that there is a version 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.750
 variant and well let's 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.710
 here to put them equal accommodating 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.860
 the figure in the number 7 place is a 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.840
 very very good figure I think it 's from 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.299
 the best 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:55.479
 is the scorpion in its normal version 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:59.300
 markariÃ¡n here you can see it in this 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.420
 classic spider-man costume 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.300
 let's put the figure here and 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.690
 direction to make the camera a bit to 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.870
 you can see it better be good 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.850
 then figure number in place number 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.420
 6 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.870
 it would be the figure of green goblin 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.599
 a figure just like the comic 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.130
 practically extracted he is a figure 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.130
 pretty pretty good 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.100
 because there is the figure that would occupy 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.270
 fifth place 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.260
 the figure 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.390
 from the doctor octopus the doc ok or the doctor 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.600
 octopus as I put you to name you 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:51.030

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.030
 very well done very well made 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.540
 let's put it here 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.950
 I put it with its base because that's the only way 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.940
 quite difficult to position it 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.810
 good 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.160
 Figure number 4 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.980
 is this figure of schattmann 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.980
 or the sandbox or the sand man like 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.840

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.240
 an excellent figure is from schattmann 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.340
 very well 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:44.230
 Figure number 3 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.260
 kingdom would figure this figure 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.230
 the truth 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.110
 because it is the best figure there is of rhino 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.610

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.610
 this character as we go with him 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.810

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.310
 number 2 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.540

 comic we are going to put it here 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.720
 which for me occupies the number one place 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:30.510
 and well no, it's not since I repeat it's my 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.510
 personal appreciation would be the figure 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:38.830
