that's where they're going to be
spawning<00:01:45.720> from<00:01:46.080> right<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:46.860> jump

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
spawning from right there so just jump

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.480 
spawning from right there so just jump
up<00:01:47.580> so<00:01:48.300> they'll<00:01:48.450> spawn<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.310> they<00:01:50.310> should

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
up so they'll spawn and they should

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.660 
up so they'll spawn and they should
spawn<00:01:50.729> right<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.119> there<00:01:51.330> as<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:51.990> see
