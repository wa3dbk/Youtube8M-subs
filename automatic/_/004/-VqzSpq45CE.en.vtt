their protein protein was like up what
is<00:01:26.610> amino<00:01:26.970> acids<00:01:27.360> yeah<00:01:27.689> there's<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.080> many

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
is amino acids yeah there's so many

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.740 
is amino acids yeah there's so many
tested<00:01:28.799> oil<00:01:29.189> isn't<00:01:29.520> cheap<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.909> many<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.479> like

taurine yeah right so they saying it's
25<00:01:34.590> grams<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.040> protein<00:01:35.400> per<00:01:35.430> scoop<00:01:35.700> right<00:01:36.030> but

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
25 grams of protein per scoop right but

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
25 grams of protein per scoop right but
it's<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.750> four<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.229> five<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.650> six<00:01:37.680> grams
