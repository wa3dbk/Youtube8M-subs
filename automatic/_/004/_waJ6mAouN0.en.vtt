00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
(intro music)

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.560
Hello everybody!

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.100
Today, let's take care of essential Korean cooking ingredient.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.200
What could it be?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.480
Sesame seeds~

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.060
(laughs)

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.540
I'm going to show you how to toast Korean sesame seeds.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.700
I always toast my own sesame seeds at home.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.800
If you are busy,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.560
you can buy already pre-made toasted sesame seeds at Korean grocery store.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.860
But you never know when was it toasted,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.240
that's important.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.500
I'm kind of picky about my sesame seeds.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.940
Whenever I travel for long period,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.320
I have to cook my Korean food.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.120
I toast my sesame seeds.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.860
Sprinkling my sesame seeds

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.960
make all the dish, Korean especially, some vegetable side dish delicious.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.260
We have to choose raw, dried sesame seeds.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.380
One cup.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.700
Cold water.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.900
I'm going to wash more.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.340
Use your hand like this.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.960
Looks cleaner than before.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.800
And lift.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.980
Look at that!

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.640
You see, this dust sank to the bottom.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.240
I'll show you this.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.780
So we are going to drain this and toast!

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.120
Look at this, guys.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.040
I burnt this tip,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.200
I always use for my sesame seeds because this is a harsh job.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.340
I have several wooden spoons,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.320
but this guy always I'm using whenever I toast my sesame seeds.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.020
Soldiers medal. (laughs)

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.760
Let's turn on the stove.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.200
Over medium high heat.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.440
Stirring on and off occasionally, you don't have to keep stirring

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.160
for around ten minutes,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.700
until all the sesame seeds dried.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.340
And then, you will hear the sound, like a popping sound.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.700
A lot of steam is coming up, right?

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.880
All our sesame seeds are so clean.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.760
My sesame seeds are getting plump and plump!

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.460
So, even sound is different.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.960
Can you see this?

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.100
Some sesame seeds are jumping.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.500
Okay, it's time to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.840
lower the heat,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.700
medium heat.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.420
Wowow, big jump.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.840
It's a popping sound, sesame popping sound.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.060
Try to crush this.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.020
Crush this with your finger.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.460
Yeah, but we need more.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.120
Right, so easily it has to be really crispy.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.780
Color is a little darkened, right?

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.720
Than before.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.860
This is toasted enough or not,

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.360
just you can taste a little bit.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.340
Mmm.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.800
Done.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.100
Really nutty, so let's turn off.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.040
So we toasted sesame seeds,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.200
let this cool down.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.580
This is raw dried sesame seeds,

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.000
and toasted sesame seeds, what it look like.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.440
So this is toasted,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.600
this is untoasted, raw.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.740
Crush.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.160
Great smell.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.960
See?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.980
This guy,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.000
let's try.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.920
See, you cannot do that, right?

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.940
These guys are going to be used
for all my Korean side dishes

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.540
Just a sprinkling here and there.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.080
Sesame seeds~

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.260
I usually put it in the airtight jar.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.460
And then,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.380
lid this.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.280
Today, we made toasted sesame seeds!

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.120
So, one cup of toasted sesame seeds.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.820
In Korea, we tease newlywed couple,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.580
you know the newlywed couple is they all get along well, they have each other, they love each other.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.740
When we meet the newlywed couple,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.680
"Oh, I know that you guys' real life is
like full of sesame seeds these days."

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.980
Sesame seeds.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.080
The sesame seeds means toasted sesame seeds.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.820
Right?

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.700
Oh, I forgot to tell you, I have another reason why I show you how to toast sesame seeds.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.300
In my next video, I'm going to show you how to make Korean sesame candy.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.500
Enjoy my recipe.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.960

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.480
Bye~!
