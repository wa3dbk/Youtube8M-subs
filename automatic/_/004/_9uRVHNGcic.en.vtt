 Hello, friends, how are you? I'm Fernando

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.049
 you of something super important vital 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.629
 for our physical processes more if 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.299
 you're looking to lose body fat and 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.220
 of course mark this famous abdomen 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.509
 famous six park we are always 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.789
 looking for it to be the exercise 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.339
 cardiovascular because we are going to talk 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.359
 a little about that I want to solve 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.609
 some doubts that have been 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.619
 asking very often how much time 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.980
 I do my defining stages how much 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.450
 I do it in my volume stages 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.910
 volume stages usually I do 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.370
 only three times a week 30 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.460
 minutes when we finish weights routine in 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.130
 my definition programs like what 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.590
 I'm starting now I do much more 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.620
 load the diary the cardio not a single 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.330
 day I rest it and I do 50 minutes of 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.210
 same way when finishing the routine of 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.700
 you weigh that until it reached an 8 by 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.230
 percent of body fat already after 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.880
 that reached 8 the body starts to 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.550
 be a little magnesium because you try 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.460
 protect that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.440
 to not stay in your line then yes 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.680
 is already recommended in that percentage maybe 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.200
 put the card and some or add a support 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.240
 with supplementation in my case I do 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.300
 all the time after training and 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.070
 when I'm in 8% enter the 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.640
 fasting cardio which is already a pre 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.220
 more specific competition ok then 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.780
 that's right and a counsel not saints sometimes 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.670
 we are a little lazy with cardio 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.560
 we think that the pieces that will change 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.630
 they are going to change but really 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.750
 dams only a stimulus are we 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.399
 looking to lose weight if you're thinking 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.740
 have your body fat percentage 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.560
 lower because you already know what is the key 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.450
 This is my best friend when they 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.979
 they have definition processes so 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.110
 which I recommend that you also 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.810
 learn to see well worth 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.810
