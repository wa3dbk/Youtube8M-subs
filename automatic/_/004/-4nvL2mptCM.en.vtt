00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
side right here about this much and then

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.080 
side right here about this much and then
before<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:47.950> start<00:01:48.250> braiding<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.729> want<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:48.970> just

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
before I start braiding you want to just

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.350 
before I start braiding you want to just
pull<00:01:49.330> out<00:01:49.710> very<00:01:50.710> thin<00:01:51.100> strands<00:01:51.550> of<00:01:51.759> hair<00:01:52.060> which

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.350 
pull out very thin strands of hair which
looks<00:01:52.630> like<00:01:52.890> start<00:01:53.890> at<00:01:54.100> about<00:01:54.190> right<00:01:54.670> here<00:01:55.060> so

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
looks like start at about right here so

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.200 
looks like start at about right here so
you<00:01:55.420> want<00:01:55.660> to<00:01:55.750> just<00:01:55.810> kind<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.080> pull<00:01:56.320> them<00:01:56.500> out

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you want to just kind of pull them out

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.680 
you want to just kind of pull them out
and<00:01:59.280> separate<00:02:00.280> those<00:02:00.550> pieces<00:02:00.970> because<00:02:01.479> those

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
and separate those pieces because those

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.139 
and separate those pieces because those
are<00:02:01.840> going<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.080> kind<00:02:02.289> of<00:02:02.380> stay<00:02:02.770> out<00:02:03.039> of<00:02:03.520> the

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
are going to kind of stay out of the

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.389 
are going to kind of stay out of the
braid<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.170> once<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.530> have<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.950> sections

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
braid so once you have the sections

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.310 
braid so once you have the sections
pulled<00:02:06.700> out<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.210> then<00:02:07.899> you<00:02:08.019> have<00:02:08.200> your

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
pulled out and then you have your

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.650 
pulled out and then you have your
section<00:02:08.739> ready<00:02:09.009> all<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.729> want<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.000> do<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.330> just

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
section ready all you want to do is just

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.259 
section ready all you want to do is just
start<00:02:11.110> braiding<00:02:11.500> this<00:02:11.950> section<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:13.090> looks

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
start braiding this section and it looks

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.810 
start braiding this section and it looks
like<00:02:13.360> uhm<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:14.650> starts<00:02:15.400> off<00:02:15.600> sort<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.780> loose<00:02:17.410> and

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
like uhm it starts off sort of loose and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.699 
like uhm it starts off sort of loose and
then<00:02:18.820> Anning<00:02:19.630> gets<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.049> little<00:02:20.200> tighter<00:02:20.590> so

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
then Anning gets a little tighter so

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.860 
then Anning gets a little tighter so
that's<00:02:21.519> what<00:02:21.730> we're<00:02:21.850> gonna<00:02:21.970> do<00:02:22.209> as<00:02:22.360> well<00:02:22.600> we're

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.229 
that's what we're gonna do as well we're
going<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.049> start<00:02:23.440> braiding<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:24.549> hair<00:02:24.579> loosely

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
in place what you're going to do is just

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.670 
in place what you're going to do is just
pick<00:03:28.600> up<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:28.840> section<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.710> just<00:03:31.680> hand

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.060 
pick up that section that you just hand
and<00:03:33.130> then<00:03:33.340> we<00:03:33.490> want<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.820> do<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.890> separate<00:03:35.890> that

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
and then we want to do is separate that

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.560 
and then we want to do is separate that
from<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.340> rest<00:03:36.610> of<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.880> hair<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.300> then

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
from the rest of the hair and then

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.380 
from the rest of the hair and then
you're<00:03:37.750> going<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.990> start<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.710> twist<00:03:39.670> there<00:03:39.940> and

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
you're going to start to twist there and

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.550 
you're going to start to twist there and
just<00:03:41.490> create<00:03:42.490> a<00:03:42.700> bun<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:44.020> what<00:03:44.170> you're<00:03:44.290> doing

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
just create a bun so what you're doing

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.070 
just create a bun so what you're doing
is<00:03:44.680> just<00:03:44.710> basically<00:03:45.510> twisting<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.630> hair<00:03:46.870> and

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
is just basically twisting the hair and

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.400 
is just basically twisting the hair and
then<00:03:47.290> just<00:03:47.590> wrapping<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.250> around<00:03:48.310> itself<00:03:49.410> just

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
then just wrapping it around itself just

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.810 
then just wrapping it around itself just
like<00:03:50.470> this<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:50.950> then<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.130> want<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.340> tuck<00:03:51.610> in

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
like this and then you want to tuck in

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.160 
like this and then you want to tuck in
the<00:03:51.940> ends<00:03:52.920> here's<00:03:53.920> what<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.250> can<00:03:54.459> use<00:03:54.670> the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
the ends here's what you can use the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.630 
the ends here's what you can use the
hairpins

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
hairpins

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.680 
hairpins
so<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:57.700> just<00:03:57.940> want<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.240> pin<00:03:59.110> as<00:03:59.970> many<00:04:00.970> times<00:04:01.390> as

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
so you just want to pin as many times as

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.690 
so you just want to pin as many times as
you<00:04:01.990> feel<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.410> need<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.130> you're<00:04:03.280> picking<00:04:03.610> up

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
you feel you need so you're picking up

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
in place which was the top portion what

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.650 
in place which was the top portion what
you<00:04:12.040> want<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.280> do<00:04:12.370> is<00:04:12.580> basically<00:04:12.790> do<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.630> same

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
you want to do is basically do the same

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.330 
you want to do is basically do the same
thing<00:04:13.900> with<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.410> remaining<00:04:14.709> hair<00:04:14.890> but<00:04:15.220> we're

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
thing with the remaining hair but we're

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.920 
thing with the remaining hair but we're
going<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.520> divide<00:04:15.850> that<00:04:15.910> into<00:04:16.299> two<00:04:16.660> sections

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
going to divide that into two sections

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.170 
going to divide that into two sections
and<00:04:17.549> then<00:04:18.660> what<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.780> want<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.109> do<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.590> start<00:04:20.980> to

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
and then what you want to do is start to

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.240

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
twist the hair going on basically

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.340 
twist the hair going on basically
inwards<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:27.550> this<00:04:28.330> would<00:04:28.510> be<00:04:28.630> going<00:04:28.840> outwards

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
inwards so this would be going outwards

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.680 
inwards so this would be going outwards
but<00:04:29.770> we're<00:04:29.980> going<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.160> twist<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.610> here<00:04:30.850> going

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690
