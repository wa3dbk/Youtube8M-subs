this is pretty unique and Jim tell us a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.080 
this is pretty unique and Jim tell us a
little<00:00:14.969> bit<00:00:15.089> about<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.540> okay<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.090> form

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
little bit about it okay this is a form

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.540 
little bit about it okay this is a form
of<00:00:18.210> arable<00:00:18.539> geometry<00:00:18.930> turbocharger<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.340> only

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
of arable geometry turbocharger the only

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.759 
of arable geometry turbocharger the only
difference<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.660> got<00:00:21.840> one<00:00:22.230> additional

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
difference is is it's got one additional

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.609 
difference is is it's got one additional
moving<00:00:23.100> part<00:00:23.699> compared<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.330> conventional

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
moving part compared to a conventional

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.320 
moving part compared to a conventional
turbocharger<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.789> ones<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.150> are<00:00:27.240> on

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
turbocharger and the ones that are on

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.720 
turbocharger and the ones that are on
the<00:00:27.420> market<00:00:27.750> now<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:28.289> between<00:00:28.800> 40<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.310> 50

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the market now have between 40 and 50

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.669 
the market now have between 40 and 50
extra<00:00:29.970> moving<00:00:30.300> parts<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.779> lot<00:00:30.929> more<00:00:31.170> complex

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
extra moving parts a lot more complex

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.040 
extra moving parts a lot more complex
and<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.669> believe<00:00:32.910> ours<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.300> more<00:00:33.480> durable<00:00:33.780> than

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and we believe ours is more durable than

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.110 
and we believe ours is more durable than
IRS's<00:00:34.620> now<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.550> made<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.059> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
IRS's now this one here is made for a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.540 
IRS's now this one here is made for a
five<00:00:36.450> nine<00:00:36.690> Cummins<00:00:37.200> turbo<00:00:37.260> diesel<00:00:37.530> now<00:00:38.340> this

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
five nine Cummins turbo diesel now this

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.240 
five nine Cummins turbo diesel now this
is<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> stock<00:00:39.180> turbocharger<00:00:40.140> housing<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
is the stock turbocharger housing and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.299 
is the stock turbocharger housing and
you<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.820> real<00:00:42.300> small<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.829> course<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
you can see real small and of course it

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.950 
you can see real small and of course it
has<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> waist<00:00:44.789> gate<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.149> Wester<00:00:45.660> with<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
has a waist gate in Wester with the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.900 
has a waist gate in Wester with the
purpose<00:00:46.260> having<00:00:46.469> such<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> small<00:00:46.980> turbocharger

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
purpose having such a small turbocharger

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.760 
purpose having such a small turbocharger
in<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> way<00:00:48.149> stay<00:00:48.390> well<00:00:48.690> they<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.110> use<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> small

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
in a way stay well they they use a small

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.650 
in a way stay well they they use a small
one<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:49.950> it'll<00:00:50.280> speed<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> spool<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.329> quicker

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
one so it'll speed a spool up quicker

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.110 
one so it'll speed a spool up quicker
and<00:00:52.070> therefore<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.129> won't<00:00:53.190> put<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:54.059> much

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and therefore it won't put out as much

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.170 
and therefore it won't put out as much
exhaust<00:00:55.079> emissions<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.000> put

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
exhaust emissions then and then they put

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
exhaust emissions then and then they put
the<00:00:57.270> wastegate<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:58.289> having<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the wastegate on it because having a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.439 
the wastegate on it because having a
small<00:00:59.129> turbine<00:00:59.489> housing<00:00:59.850> creates<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.270> lot<00:01:00.420> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
small turbine housing creates a lot of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.779 
small turbine housing creates a lot of
back<00:01:00.690> pressure<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> engine<00:01:01.760> absolutely

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
back pressure in the engine absolutely

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
back pressure in the engine absolutely
so<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.180> open<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.480> waste<00:01:03.809> gate<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.409> bypass

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
so they open that waste gate to bypass

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.960 
so they open that waste gate to bypass
the<00:01:05.400> turbine<00:01:05.820> wheel<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.610> an<00:01:08.820> apt

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the turbine wheel and you that's an apt

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.370 
the turbine wheel and you that's an apt
term<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.420> know<00:01:09.540> you're<00:01:09.720> wasting<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.200> lot<00:01:10.320> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
term you know you're wasting a lot of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
term you know you're wasting a lot of
energy<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.640> could<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.119> in

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
energy going out there that could be in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.210 
energy going out there that could be in
a<00:01:12.570> larger<00:01:12.990> turbocharger<00:01:13.290> spending<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
a larger turbocharger spending that

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.100 
a larger turbocharger spending that
turbine<00:01:14.580> wheel<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.210> putting<00:01:15.630> out<00:01:15.720> more<00:01:15.900> air

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
turbine wheel and putting out more air

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.510 
turbine wheel and putting out more air
you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.860> there's<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.189> big<00:01:17.340> difference

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you can see there's a big difference

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.090 
you can see there's a big difference
right<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.470> size<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.979> these

there you can see it it's making it the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.210 
there you can see it it's making it the
same<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> smaller<00:01:46.140> turbine<00:01:46.530> housing<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.070> so

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
same as a smaller turbine housing and so

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
same as a smaller turbine housing and so
it's<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.579> spool<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.000> quicker<00:01:48.329> this

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it's going to spool up quicker this

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.810 
it's going to spool up quicker this
housing<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.649> twice<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.159> large<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> one

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
housing is twice as large as the one

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.030 
housing is twice as large as the one
that<00:01:50.939> comes<00:01:51.119> from<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.509> factory<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> is

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
that comes from the factory but it is

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.100 
that comes from the factory but it is
turbo<00:01:53.369> will<00:01:53.579> spool<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:53.939> quicker<00:01:54.210> than<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.840> will

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
turbo will spool up quicker than it will

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.990 
turbo will spool up quicker than it will
ok<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.219> when<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.369> get<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.640> top<00:01:56.790> end

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
ok so then when you get to the top end

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.730 
ok so then when you get to the top end
you<00:01:57.149> still<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.570> boost<00:01:57.840> yes<00:01:58.409> you're<00:01:58.649> still

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
you still have boost yes you're still

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.620 
you still have boost yes you're still
with<00:01:59.670> these<00:01:59.790> hands<00:02:00.030> once<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.329> open<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
with these hands once you open the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.450 
with these hands once you open the
wastegate<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.500> basically<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> normally

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
wastegate you basically have a normally

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.969 
wastegate you basically have a normally
aspirated<00:02:02.490> engine<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.750> big<00:02:04.020> advantage<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.799> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
aspirated engine the big advantage of it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.490 
aspirated engine the big advantage of it
is<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.340> fact<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:06.509> our<00:02:06.659> turbocharger

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
is the fact that with our turbocharger

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.260 
is the fact that with our turbocharger
you'll<00:02:07.829> actually<00:02:08.069> make<00:02:08.429> more<00:02:08.670> boost<00:02:08.910> than<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
you'll actually make more boost than you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.119 
you'll actually make more boost than you
do<00:02:09.390> back<00:02:09.569> pressure<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.530> what<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> lot<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.979> guys

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
do back pressure so what a lot of guys

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.160 
do back pressure so what a lot of guys
do<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.730> know<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> stock<00:02:12.270> turbocharger<00:02:13.050> it's

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
do you know the stock turbocharger it's

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.580 
do you know the stock turbocharger it's
fine

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
fine

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.050 
fine
it'll<00:02:13.769> give<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.010> good<00:02:14.190> performance<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:14.910> what

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
it'll give you good performance for what

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.430 
it'll give you good performance for what
you're<00:02:15.239> doing<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:15.660> they<00:02:16.019> want<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.260> increase

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
you're doing but they want to increase

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.040 
you're doing but they want to increase
performance<00:02:16.819> don't<00:02:17.819> put<00:02:18.000> on<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> larger<00:02:18.690> turbo

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
performance don't put on a larger turbo

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.300 
performance don't put on a larger turbo
housing<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.530> what<00:02:19.620> we're<00:02:19.769> talked<00:02:19.950> about<00:02:20.160> is

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
housing and what we're talked about is

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.130 
housing and what we're talked about is
this<00:02:20.459> here<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.819> exhaust<00:02:21.269> side<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:21.900> thing

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
this here the exhaust side of this thing

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.949 
this here the exhaust side of this thing
put<00:02:22.769> our<00:02:22.860> larger<00:02:23.280> housing<00:02:23.730> well<00:02:23.910> that'll<00:02:24.840> give

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
put our larger housing well that'll give

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.780 
put our larger housing well that'll give
you<00:02:25.050> more<00:02:25.230> horsepower<00:02:25.739> but<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> got<00:02:26.550> more

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
you more horsepower but you got more

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.130 
you more horsepower but you got more
turbo<00:02:27.150> lag<00:02:27.360> with<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.690> right<00:02:27.780> right<00:02:27.930> exactly

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
turbo lag with it right right exactly

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.350 
turbo lag with it right right exactly
and<00:02:28.800> that's<00:02:29.280> always<00:02:29.519> been<00:02:29.760> an<00:02:29.879> issue<00:02:30.030> with

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
and that's always been an issue with

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.930 
and that's always been an issue with
turbo<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.860> engine<00:02:32.160> manufacturers<00:02:32.760> try

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
turbo and the engine manufacturers try

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.550 
turbo and the engine manufacturers try
to<00:02:33.000> compromise<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.900> ends<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.170> wastegate

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
to compromise the ends to the wastegate

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.080 
to compromise the ends to the wastegate
and<00:02:34.860> smaller<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.340> what<00:02:35.580> you're<00:02:35.790> doing<00:02:35.819> here

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
and smaller so what you're doing here

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.940 
and smaller so what you're doing here
then<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.780> you're<00:02:36.959> making<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.470> large

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
then is you're making a large

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.610 
then is you're making a large
turbocharger<00:02:38.879> look<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> small<00:02:40.049> one<00:02:40.290> for<00:02:40.590> a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
turbocharger look like a small one for a

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.900 
turbocharger look like a small one for a
period<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.069> time<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.519> get<00:02:41.670> really<00:02:41.819> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
period of time so you get really the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.910 
period of time so you get really the
best<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.299> both<00:02:42.450> worlds<00:02:42.870> with<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.110> exactly<00:02:43.440> and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
best of both worlds with it exactly and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
best of both worlds with it exactly and
you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.129> see<00:02:44.250> it's<00:02:44.400> operated<00:02:44.790> by<00:02:44.879> this

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
you can see it's operated by this

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.000 
you can see it's operated by this
actuator<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:46.049> has<00:02:46.200> its<00:02:46.410> own<00:02:46.500> standalone

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
actuator it has its own standalone

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.520 
actuator it has its own standalone
computer<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> self-contained<00:02:49.260> unit

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
computer so it is a self-contained unit

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.259 
computer so it is a self-contained unit
you<00:02:49.799> bolted<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.280> what<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.849> do<00:02:50.940> for<00:02:50.970> fuel

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
you bolted on what to do for fuel

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.289 
you bolted on what to do for fuel
economy<00:02:51.480> well<00:02:52.290> right<00:02:53.010> now<00:02:53.190> we're<00:02:53.370> seeing<00:02:53.579> more

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
economy well right now we're seeing more

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.000 
economy well right now we're seeing more
than<00:02:54.480> 2<00:02:54.630> miles<00:02:54.810> per<00:02:55.079> gallon<00:02:55.410> improvement<00:02:55.530> in

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
than 2 miles per gallon improvement in

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.680 
than 2 miles per gallon improvement in
fuel<00:02:56.160> coming<00:02:56.610> that's<00:02:56.849> awesome<00:02:57.269> that's<00:02:57.390> large

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
fuel coming that's awesome that's large

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.569 
fuel coming that's awesome that's large
this<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.650> know<00:02:58.769> what<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.370> really

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
this and you know what this is really

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.610 
this and you know what this is really
doing<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.150> way<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.480> actually<00:03:00.690> works<00:03:00.959> if<00:03:01.440> you

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
doing the way it actually works if you

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.559 
doing the way it actually works if you
to<00:03:02.129> get<00:03:02.250> an<00:03:02.400> idea<00:03:02.700> about<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.239> know<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:03.450> you

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
to get an idea about it you know if you

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.839 
to get an idea about it you know if you
have<00:03:03.720> been<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.049> out<00:03:04.590> 30<00:03:04.829> yard<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.370> got<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.519> water

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
have been in out 30 yard you got a water

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.309 
have been in out 30 yard you got a water
hose<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.120> you're<00:03:06.390> squirting<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> fan

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
hose and you're squirting it on a fan

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.800 
hose and you're squirting it on a fan
blade<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.819> get<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.120> spinning<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.720> know

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
blade and you get it spinning you know

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.119 
blade and you get it spinning you know
if<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:09.989> get<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.799> sweet<00:03:11.099> spot

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
if you get it just in that sweet spot

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.460 
if you get it just in that sweet spot
it'll<00:03:11.670> really<00:03:12.180> spin<00:03:12.569> up<00:03:12.810> or<00:03:12.959> same<00:03:13.170> thing<00:03:13.200> with

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
it'll really spin up or same thing with

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.770 
it'll really spin up or same thing with
an<00:03:13.530> air<00:03:13.650> hose<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.190> fan<00:03:14.730> well<00:03:15.450> that's<00:03:15.599> exactly

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
an air hose on a fan well that's exactly

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.330 
an air hose on a fan well that's exactly
what<00:03:16.110> we're<00:03:16.379> doing<00:03:16.650> with<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.040> we're

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
what we're doing with this is we're

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.920 
what we're doing with this is we're
finding<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.639> sweet<00:03:17.850> spot<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.359> that<00:03:18.389> turbo

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
finding that sweet spot on that turbo

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.990 
finding that sweet spot on that turbo
wheel<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.410> really<00:03:20.160> making<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.519> spin<00:03:20.819> up

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
wheel and really making a spin up

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.330 
wheel and really making a spin up
exactly<00:03:21.690> yeah<00:03:22.139> so<00:03:22.380> what<00:03:22.620> else<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.859> need<00:03:23.130> with

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
exactly yeah so what else you need with

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.000 
exactly yeah so what else you need with
this<00:03:23.489> Jim<00:03:23.760> well<00:03:24.540> basically<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.560> need<00:03:25.739> any

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
this Jim well basically you need any

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.770 
this Jim well basically you need any
larger<00:03:26.519> exhaust<00:03:26.790> manifold<00:03:27.299> because<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
larger exhaust manifold because the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.750 
larger exhaust manifold because the
stock<00:03:28.019> manifolds<00:03:28.680> are<00:03:28.769> too<00:03:28.920> restrictive<00:03:29.069> for

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
stock manifolds are too restrictive for

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.610 
stock manifolds are too restrictive for
it<00:03:29.880> yep<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.660> can<00:03:30.690> see<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.109> difference<00:03:31.500> in

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
it yep and you can see the difference in

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.830 
it yep and you can see the difference in
the<00:03:31.709> housings<00:03:32.400> here<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.180> it's<00:03:33.690> pretty

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
the housings here and it's pretty

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.629 
the housings here and it's pretty
obvious<00:03:33.959> why<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.500> need<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.190> most<00:03:35.609> of

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
obvious why you need that and most of

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.680 
obvious why you need that and most of
these<00:03:35.730> guys<00:03:35.940> are<00:03:36.090> putting<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.299> performance

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
these guys are putting a performance

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.120 
these guys are putting a performance
manifolds<00:03:37.170> on<00:03:37.260> anyway<00:03:37.560> because<00:03:37.799> they're<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
manifolds on anyway because they're the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.759 
manifolds on anyway because they're the
factory<00:03:38.519> ones<00:03:38.670> crack<00:03:38.910> right<00:03:39.299> exactly<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.380> so

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
factory ones crack right exactly and so

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.920 
factory ones crack right exactly and so
they<00:03:41.010> get<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.220> better<00:03:41.400> manifold<00:03:42.299> on<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.599> and

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
they get a better manifold on it and

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.629 
they get a better manifold on it and
well<00:03:43.169> this<00:03:43.470> thing<00:03:43.680> will<00:03:43.829> perform<00:03:44.099> much<00:03:44.340> better

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
well this thing will perform much better

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.690 
well this thing will perform much better
and<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.000> got<00:03:45.359> all<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.530> software<00:03:47.370> and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
and you got all the the software and

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.979 
and you got all the the software and
everything<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.150> goes<00:03:48.299> with<00:03:48.329> this<00:03:48.720> well

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
everything that goes with this well

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.300 
everything that goes with this well
there's<00:03:49.139> all<00:03:49.230> electronically<00:03:49.919> controlled

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
there's all electronically controlled

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.339 
there's all electronically controlled
right<00:03:50.489> yes<00:03:50.730> this<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:52.019> computer
