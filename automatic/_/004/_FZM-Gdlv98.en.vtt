the development of these products or any
of<00:00:07.750> our<00:00:08.170> products<00:00:08.590> is<00:00:08.910> just<00:00:09.910> like<00:00:10.059> what<00:00:10.330> any

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
of our products is just like what any

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.820 
of our products is just like what any
other<00:00:10.690> customer<00:00:10.900> would<00:00:11.230> do<00:00:11.410> we've<00:00:11.620> got

to<00:00:14.049> the<00:00:14.139> product<00:00:14.469> group<00:00:14.619> so<00:00:14.889> we<00:00:15.129> actually<00:00:15.909> set

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
to the product group so we actually set

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.290 
to the product group so we actually set
shared<00:00:16.510> goals<00:00:16.780> with<00:00:16.960> them<00:00:17.350> if<00:00:18.310> they<00:00:18.610> get

the thing that I liked a lot was the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.740 
the thing that I liked a lot was the
stability<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.430> saw<00:01:56.640> compared<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.139 
previous version of sequel server as we
hit<00:02:00.600> each<00:02:00.750> milestone<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.770> level<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
hit each milestone the the level of the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.359 
hit each milestone the the level of the
quality<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.619> were<00:02:04.740> seeing<00:02:04.950> was<00:02:05.070> just

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
quality that we were seeing was just

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.850 
quality that we were seeing was just
significantly<00:02:06.180> higher<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:07.320> probably<00:02:07.740> my

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
significantly higher but probably my

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.249 
significantly higher but probably my
favorite<00:02:08.250> feature<00:02:08.459> was<00:02:08.849> our<00:02:09.720> ability<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
favorite feature was our ability to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.949 
favorite feature was our ability to
virtualize<00:02:10.950> sequel<00:02:11.310> server<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.840> there's<00:02:12.840> a

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
virtualize sequel server and there's a

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.080 
virtualize sequel server and there's a
governor<00:02:13.410> on<00:02:13.590> individual<00:02:14.250> sequel<00:02:14.610> server<00:02:14.760> so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
governor on individual sequel server so

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.850 
governor on individual sequel server so
that<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:15.300> can<00:02:15.480> put<00:02:15.660> multiple<00:02:16.140> databases<00:02:16.560> on

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
that we can put multiple databases on

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.410 
that we can put multiple databases on
the<00:02:16.980> same<00:02:17.160> server<00:02:17.459> without<00:02:17.640> impacting<00:02:18.120> each

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the same server without impacting each

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.840 
the same server without impacting each
other<00:02:18.599> now

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.420 

with<00:02:23.330> our<00:02:23.450> deployment<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:23.960> Visual<00:02:24.290> Studio

with our deployment of Visual Studio
2008<00:02:25.540> one<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.720> things<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:27.110> we've<00:02:27.410> loved

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
2008 one of the things that we've loved

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.560 
2008 one of the things that we've loved
is<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.280> just<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.790> consolidation

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
is that just the consolidation

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.600 
is that just the consolidation
simplification<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.740> environment<00:02:31.460> rather

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
simplification of the environment rather

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.000 
simplification of the environment rather
than<00:02:31.910> having<00:02:32.290> multiple<00:02:33.290> places<00:02:33.530> where<00:02:33.830> we've

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
than having multiple places where we've

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.670 
than having multiple places where we've
got<00:02:34.250> code<00:02:34.850> repositories<00:02:35.510> I'm<00:02:36.440> sure<00:02:36.650> our

got code repositories I'm sure our

got code repositories I'm sure our
engineering<00:02:37.190> teams<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.760> talk<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.000> lot<00:02:38.300> about

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
engineering teams can talk a lot about

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.660 
engineering teams can talk a lot about
the<00:02:39.040> productivity<00:02:40.040> improvements<00:02:40.490> they've

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
the productivity improvements they've

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.090 
the productivity improvements they've

had on the feature that I love the most
is<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.410> plug-in<00:02:45.770> that<00:02:46.390> we've<00:02:47.390> used<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:47.990> that

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
is a plug-in that we've used so that

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.360 
is a plug-in that we've used so that
