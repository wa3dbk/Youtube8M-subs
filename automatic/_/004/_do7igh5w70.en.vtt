00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.500
 online gt5 video as you are watching 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.299
 we are here a new career with 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.410
 subscribers since this case is only 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.280
 I'm really when the race 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.389
 only really 99 percent of all 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.740
 the entire loads that went up to the channel 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.360
 he has played them with different youtuber and 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.890
 so much so that this channel is here only 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.660
 and all because I wanted to enjoy 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.580
 with many cultores here a little trick 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.930
 so let's really reed 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.570
 is to create much Hungarian I say it about her 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.550
 It is very much a killa since it was not known 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.710
 which will be highlighted by 91 percent 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.939
 impossible that there are many people who 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.590
 says danny because it's a bit mega 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.570
 ramp and 90 percent possible always of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.090
 the same titles because I put the same 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.980
 titles because really inside the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.190
 series of careers me what happens to them that the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.190
 motorcycle 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.590
 it comes in plan conventions I started 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.620
 I want to pass the case already within the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.449
 series of races are different beings 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.949
 like the one of 90 9% and possible those of megas 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.480
 ramps then it's basically that 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.340
 they are like series not so really 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.600
 it always seems that I passed and overbooked 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.600
 the motor booking 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.040
 in the case of the week that passes 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.540
 we integrate 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.310
 second he does not want the thing but let's go 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:37.030
 everyone here talk about here or danger 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.860
 it seems that the wire is caught what 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.890
 I catch at least for the first one the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.030
 first it is I think I go first to see if 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.340
 effectively the first perfect 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.670
 perfect care this gentleman mill that 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.189
 It looks like it's not very friendly to see 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.670
 one passes and destroys us there 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.900
 we're 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.149
 It's really good that I'm good at these 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.869
 Little things but hard enough 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.080
 catch to the point 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.420
 here you have to go down or not, I do not know 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.770
 I'm worth at least around here for 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.340
 if anything to see 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.810
 beware of this means 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.420
 I say it gave me but what to do 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:22.120
 this is all in the middle up 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.040
 neither the first bang that the thing 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.040
 is now 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.180
 it's that easy uncle if there's an animal when 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.420
 we need a little bit to see if here 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.280
 there are others to see mola mola a lot or 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.230
 this handsome is difficult but he is handsome 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.459
 It can not be done at a fast speed 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.769
 have to do it because it is that if not 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.470
 it is the sticking it sticks with the mills 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.599
 wind dislike here we are here 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.700
 very clear that lavat and is the best 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.700
 motorbike without doubt guys the truth 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.140
 they communicate to me by the little penguin that 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.209
 they just put an alley but let's go 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.500
 the gijÃ³n of the eggs mother of mine 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.930
 I knew that I entered inside you or 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.069
 the windmill verbal then what 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.470
 it goes fast after we left a 28 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.840
 It's worth it, yes, it takes about two hours 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.080
 come on let's go let's look if it's a little 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.080
 late 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.760
 perfect perfect 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.380
 if I put the truth here but clear now 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.310
 how he accelerated 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:40.310
 back behind rods we wait for 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.720
 pass and we give you hope new marine 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.250
 I catch the ballistic point of the latter 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.960
 area seems quite quite a trip 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.350
 the most difficult of the map without a doubt the 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.350
 true 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.870
 on the blue list once you're here 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.860
 is turning little by little for and once 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.860
 what happens we give 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.150
 followed without stopping on top of the thing 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:12.390
 that city of Lyon accelerated and passed to 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.390
 checkpoint because all 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.860
 ok and this last one is worth it 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.180
 to be very crappy too for once 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.790
 let this happen we have already won 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.870
 The fact is that I have to see what I 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.390
 you can also catch at this point and 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.370
 down 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.560
 or the boy does not ride the bike and over 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.310
 I'm scared 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.310
 is happening 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:49.430
 two 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:52.780
 we take difficult very difficult 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.780
 very short spaces and I play 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:01.350
 has confirmed the best we can do 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.870
 are people who just happened 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.760
 it's not worth I think it 's that half is 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.920
 up, it's worth looking up at me 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.620
 I shit on every kid I think I did not have 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.390
 to give it from the mill it turns out that yes 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.390
 you have to give Uncle worth 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.240
 under the description if you want 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.349
 try as I say this is the body a 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.610
 lots of friends and the room that is 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.020
 people well very much the truth that 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.279
 it does not escape from the peloton of the 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.899
 desk at the end I've got 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.429
 win the race a little bit 

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:37.110
 easy we can say but as you can see the 

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:38.249
 face is quite difficult has been a 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.659
 heller project and favorites and has 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:40.770
 liked in that game just down 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.550
