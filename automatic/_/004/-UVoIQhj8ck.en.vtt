00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.699 
morning and I was wondering how it was
going<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.099> be<00:02:39.220> surfing<00:02:39.640> but<00:02:40.299> you<00:02:41.200> know<00:02:41.319> we're

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
going to be surfing but you know we're

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.619 
going to be surfing but you know we're
here<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.099> surf<00:02:42.310> pipeline<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.180> can't<00:02:43.420> let

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
here to surf pipeline and you can't let

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.210 
here to surf pipeline and you can't let
a<00:02:43.780> previous<00:02:44.260> day<00:02:44.950> wound<00:02:45.310> stop<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:47.040> my<00:02:48.040> last

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
a previous day wound stop you my last

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.599 
a previous day wound stop you my last
wave<00:02:48.489> was<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.329> kind<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.319> first<00:02:50.500> reef<00:02:50.769> wave<00:02:51.400> that

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
wave was a kind of first reef wave that

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.000 
wave was a kind of first reef wave that
backed<00:02:51.790> off<00:02:52.200> which<00:02:53.200> allowed<00:02:53.470> for<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.739> really

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
backed off which allowed for a really

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.250 
backed off which allowed for a really
steep<00:02:54.280> drop<00:02:54.639> and<00:02:54.940> in<00:02:55.359> those<00:02:55.599> moments<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.109> feels

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
steep drop and in those moments it feels

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.349 
steep drop and in those moments it feels
like<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.590> whole<00:02:56.620> ocean<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.670> going<00:02:57.970> against

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
like the whole ocean is going against

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.909 
like the whole ocean is going against
you<00:02:58.480> trying<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.840> pull<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.200> back<00:02:59.319> up<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.709> face

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
you trying to pull you back up the face

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.339 
you trying to pull you back up the face
and<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:00.609> was<00:03:00.790> just<00:03:00.940> hoping<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.389> my<00:03:01.810> fins<00:03:02.169> were

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
and I was just hoping that my fins were

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.990 
and I was just hoping that my fins were
gonna<00:03:02.530> stay<00:03:02.769> in<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.980> water<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.340> my<00:03:03.519> rail<00:03:03.730> and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
gonna stay in the water and my rail and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.490 
gonna stay in the water and my rail and
I<00:03:04.060> was<00:03:04.180> going<00:03:04.329> to<00:03:04.389> be<00:03:04.510> no<00:03:04.540> make<00:03:05.049> it<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.380> end

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
I was going to be no make it to the end

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.319 
I was going to be no make it to the end
of<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.650> wave<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.069> got<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.819> get<00:03:06.940> on<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.180> live

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
of the wave and got to get on to live

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.599 
of the wave and got to get on to live
for<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.540> second<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:07.900> get<00:03:08.079> spit<00:03:08.349> on<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.769> you

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
for a second and get spit on and you

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.170 
for a second and get spit on and you
know<00:03:09.730> that's<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.769> pipeline<00:03:11.769> is<00:03:12.069> so<00:03:12.700> heavy<00:03:13.000> and

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
know that's a pipeline is so heavy and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.699 
know that's a pipeline is so heavy and
dangerous<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.870> always<00:03:14.109> hope<00:03:14.260> for<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.530> best

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
dangerous you always hope for the best

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.259 
dangerous you always hope for the best
but<00:03:14.919> expect<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.400> worst<00:03:15.579> I<00:03:15.760> was<00:03:15.849> glad<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.060> made

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
but expect the worst I was glad I made

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.250 
but expect the worst I was glad I made
that<00:03:16.450> way<00:03:16.599> what<00:03:17.290> we<00:03:17.380> talked

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.640 

we<00:03:21.260> go<00:03:21.380> read<00:03:21.710> to<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.100> grave<00:03:22.400> pulling<00:03:23.360> in<00:03:23.650> deep

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
we go read to the grave pulling in deep

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.450 
we go read to the grave pulling in deep
driving<00:03:25.490> still<00:03:25.820> going

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.860 

they<00:03:32.210> give

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.170 

right
