00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 let's see the positions and statistics 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.859
 end of the closing 2015 ascent mx 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.780
 zelaya was lucky to know that there was no 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.429
 decline but left it in a panorama 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.160
 horrible for the next one we start 14 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:20.039
 zelaya 10 points a lot of little staff 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.380
 soccer and terrible foreign results 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.199
 like the Italian yuri topan he spent 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.080
 the whole tournament kicked out bad reinforcement 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.689
 others who are already in their last 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.790
 tressor moreno and jhon restrepo and many 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.550
 free agents you see that this team 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.120
 has crisis 13 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.190
 zacatepec 21 century 12 points zacatepec 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.719
 with everything and luxury stadium looked for 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.480
 return to what was his first 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.730
 division and they tried to achieve it by ceasing to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 ignacio rodríguez and bringing the brand new 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.149
 runner-up joel sanchez but failed 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.070
 nothing 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.289
 it's not the same prospective team with 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.329
 heart that medium team without wanting to 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.039
 achieve something 12 forward 13 points 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.619
 first he achieved a start of hopeful 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.600
 four consecutive wins we already gave by 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.880
 fact that I could go back 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.710
 but we were wrong from 5 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 all change began to lose and lose 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.549
 so much that gabriel pereyra had to 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.430
 give up for failing the hobby 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.350
 atlantist and the worst to bring back to the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.450
 technician who started sinking in 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.700
 first wilson graniolati but nothing 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.909
 changed and now they ended up antepenultimate 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.619
 a pity the directive is already with the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.950
 rope around the neck 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.200
 11 altamira 14 points 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.960
 this team did not achieve much either 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.539
 rumors of its possible sale we'll see 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.470
 what's up with this team 10 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.569
 irapuato 16 points equal with this team 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.819
 was much to be done so it seems that now 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:52.289
 yes it would be the final retirement of ariel 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:55.110
 gonzález nine miners of zacatecas 18 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.450
 mining points left many two points in 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.990
 the way to end it would recompose 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.960
 but it did not reach them eight hours 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.000
 pick 18 points some losses of 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.130
 key players of the team plus a 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 technician who is just starting as 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.959
 it is camoranesi they did that tepic no 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.860
 achieve another feat of the leader but his 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.990
 season is 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.810
 stable those who managed the group 7 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.360
 alebrijes de oaxaca 20 points alebrijes 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.760
 At the end he put the batteries and started 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.510
 draw points and by beating cobras in the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.959
 last date put them last 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.120
 Roadrunners of the uat 20 points when 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.579
 they took out aguinaga the team had bad 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.560
 course with riccardo interim chain the 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.209
 team straightened up and managed to strain the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.840
 big party 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.000
 5 necaxa 21 points was not his best 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.250
 season but the fact is that it looks 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.829
 another feat like last season and 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.319
 of step ascend directly without other two 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.220
 extra duels is in your hands your 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.590
 back to first as they once did 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.530
 4 merida 22 points 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.810
 Merida achieved great campaign in both cup 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.629
 as in league but they let go the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.420
 opportunity to go straight to the semifinals 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:16.769
 and now they were fourth of the table 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.750
 three buap wolves 22 points ricardo valiño 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.150
 has done an acceptable job with the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.579
 team now look for first division 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.980
 for people imagine if wolves 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:30.239
 ascends and descends puebla there was a thread 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.319
 that is armed two dolars of sinaloa 23 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.329
 points 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.790
 Carlos tastos managed to get golds to have 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.540
 a great campaign and now with his scorer 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.420
 Robert 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.269
 they will look for more and find 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.319

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.530
 Flavio Davino and bring someone from 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.629
 experience as raúl arias paid off and 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.579
 that leadership also made it possible for 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.920
 ten goals of carrillo plus six of vigón 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.549
 that there is consolidating in the ascent 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.769
 they can get the promotion 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.930
