I'm<00:01:42.500> gonna<00:01:42.650> do<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:42.890> two-minute<00:01:43.130> video<00:01:43.520> and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.190 

so<00:01:55.280> in<00:01:55.400> order<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.700> run<00:01:56.000> this<00:01:56.150> with<00:01:56.450> hot<00:01:56.960> plate

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
so in order to run this with hot plate

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.590 
so in order to run this with hot plate
