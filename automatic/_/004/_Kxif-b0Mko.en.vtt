00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.480 
you in front brake pads the next step
we're<00:00:05.640> gonna<00:00:05.759> seat<00:00:06.390> those<00:00:06.600> pads<00:00:07.189> and<00:00:08.189> as<00:00:08.309> I

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
we're gonna seat those pads and as I

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.860 
we're gonna seat those pads and as I
explained<00:00:08.849> earlier<00:00:09.000> we're<00:00:09.360> just<00:00:09.510> gonna<00:00:09.599> pump

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
explained earlier we're just gonna pump

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.879 
explained earlier we're just gonna pump
up<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> brake<00:00:10.349> system<00:00:10.759> and<00:00:11.759> until<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> brake

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
up the brake system and until the brake

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.379 
up the brake system and until the brake
pedal<00:00:13.889> feels<00:00:14.099> good<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.460> solid<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:14.940> means<00:00:15.000> I

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
pedal feels good and solid that means I

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.269 
pedal feels good and solid that means I
know<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.990> I've<00:00:16.080> got<00:00:16.230> those<00:00:16.410> pads<00:00:16.710> contact

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
know that I've got those pads contact

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.130 
know that I've got those pads contact
and<00:00:17.460> rotor<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.420> just<00:00:18.600> gonna<00:00:18.690> give<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
and rotor and I'm just gonna give it a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.230 
and rotor and I'm just gonna give it a
couple<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.619> good<00:00:19.680> stiff<00:00:20.220> pushes<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.850> they're

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
couple of good stiff pushes and they're

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.179 
couple of good stiff pushes and they're
just<00:00:21.420> kind<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.689> flexing<00:00:22.470> them<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.949> seats

and just slowly compress the brake pedal
the<00:00:37.320> first<00:00:37.620> time<00:00:37.860> down<00:00:38.129> you're<00:00:38.610> probably<00:00:38.820> net

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the first time down you're probably net

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.630 
the first time down you're probably net
won't<00:00:39.239> feel<00:00:39.480> any<00:00:39.719> resistance<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.640> I'm

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
won't feel any resistance at all I'm

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.130 
won't feel any resistance at all I'm
starting<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.149> feel<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> little<00:00:42.510> resistance<00:00:43.020> on

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
starting to feel a little resistance on

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.729 
starting to feel a little resistance on
the<00:00:43.230> second<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:49.079> know<00:00:49.140> I'm<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.530> real

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the second you know I'm just going real

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.920 
the second you know I'm just going real
slow<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.039> gradual<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.539> want<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.809> when

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
slow and gradual you don't want to when

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.810 
slow and gradual you don't want to when
you<00:00:51.989> pump<00:00:52.289> brakes<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.100> don't<00:00:53.340> want<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> pump

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
you pump brakes you don't want to pump

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.450 
you pump brakes you don't want to pump
them<00:00:53.969> rapidly<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.469> agitates<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> fluid

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
them rapidly it just agitates the fluid

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.160 
them rapidly it just agitates the fluid
it<00:00:56.610> gives<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> possibility<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.449> air<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.870> into

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it gives the possibility of air get into

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.270 
it gives the possibility of air get into
the<00:00:58.230> system<00:00:59.210> okay<00:01:01.129> about<00:01:02.129> Oh<00:01:03.920> near<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> bottom

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the system okay about Oh near the bottom

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.370 
the system okay about Oh near the bottom
of<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> third<00:01:05.729> push<00:01:06.360> down<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.689> got<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> good

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
of the third push down I got a good

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.460 
of the third push down I got a good
solid<00:01:07.710> resistance<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> next<00:01:10.229> pump

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
solid resistance and now the next pump

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
solid resistance and now the next pump
up<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> fourth<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.909> top

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
up the fourth it's right up at the top

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.899 
up the fourth it's right up at the top
of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> pedal<00:01:13.070> if<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.310> brake<00:01:14.520> systems

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
of the pedal if the brake systems

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.340 
of the pedal if the brake systems
working<00:01:15.150> correctly<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.900> replace<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
working correctly you just replace the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.530 
working correctly you just replace the
pads<00:01:16.560> you'll<00:01:17.159> get<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> minimum<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.000> an<00:01:18.180> inch<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
pads you'll get a minimum of an inch and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.149 
pads you'll get a minimum of an inch and
a<00:01:18.600> half<00:01:18.630> two<00:01:19.020> inches<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.350> travel<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> most

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
a half two inches of travel at the most

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.039 
a half two inches of travel at the most
with<00:01:20.790> your<00:01:20.970> brake<00:01:21.119> pedal<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.810> should

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
with your brake pedal and you should

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.289 
with your brake pedal and you should
come<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> firm<00:01:22.650> position<00:01:22.830> now<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.000> push

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
come to a firm position now if you push

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.649 
come to a firm position now if you push
down<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.750> hold<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:27.000> brake<00:01:27.180> pedal<00:01:27.360> hold

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
down and hold and a brake pedal hold

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.510 
down and hold and a brake pedal hold
firmly<00:01:27.990> that's<00:01:28.650> what<00:01:28.860> you're<00:01:29.040> looking<00:01:29.310> for

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
firmly that's what you're looking for

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
firmly that's what you're looking for
that<00:01:29.939> indicates<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.780> system's<00:01:31.170> holding

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that indicates that the system's holding

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.660 
that indicates that the system's holding
pressure<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> everything<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.340> working

pressure and everything is working

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
pressure and everything is working
correctly<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.240> your<00:01:33.689> foot<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.020> slowly

gradual thing that indicates that you

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
gradual thing that indicates that you
