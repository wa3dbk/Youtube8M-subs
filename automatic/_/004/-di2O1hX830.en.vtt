00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.860
 [Music] 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.410
 Y 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.269
 has concluded entering the end of the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.789
 eighth international competition 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.550
 robotic the most striking event was the 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.890
 of soccer robots because one of the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.949
 objectives of robotics is that for 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.460
 2050 win in a possible competition to 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.460
 the humans 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.270
 since 2008 we are working for the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.000
 construction of robots we have brought to 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.430
 this competition a domestic robot that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 You can clean the house and open the door 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.730
 to the guests an application 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.250
 important of that robot is that it can 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.170
 help in emergency situations by 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.970
 example in the case of fire at home 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.710
 can warn people who are 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.410
 find there and you can call 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.510
 emergency phone irÃ¡n open is the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.670
 most important robotic event in the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.980
 west of Asia and is considered among the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.600
 first of nine robotic competitions 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.600
 that takes place in the world 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.869
 since 2004 we started our work and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.000
 we have presented in this competition a 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.090
 robotic soccer team that is 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.190
 composed by defense and forward all 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.560
 of the types of robots have been 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.259
 present in the competition as the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.050
 humanoids simulation robots between 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.240
 this one and 2d and drones many believe that in 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.970
 the future the robots are proclaimed with 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.480
 artificial intelligence will be able to 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.970
 rallys 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.630
 all the tasks that can be done by 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.630
 human beings 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.190
 we have built a robot with four 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.740
 rotors that can be used for the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.750
 rescue and relief so we have a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.240
 pilot that controls the robot to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.220
 observe the places inaccessible for the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.040
 human being as in the case of the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.920
 natural disasters so that it would help 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.800
 to the rescue robots countries like 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.840
 china italy usa and holland have 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.600
 participated in this three-way competition 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.580
 days the university asad de cannes mine 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.130
 together with the research center 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.080
 Deputy of the University of Tehran in 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.720
 comparison with the robocup committee 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.800
 Iranian national have sponsored this 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.330
 event 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.170
 robock bird is a competition 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.180
 international robotics company founded in 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.210
 1997 competition 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.750
 while rewarding 63 people from 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:34.080
 twenty-one teams chosen from among 390 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.380
 of which 300 in 20 are Iranian and 70 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.220
