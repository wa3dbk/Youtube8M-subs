00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
very very beginning I skip the intro I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.639 
very very beginning I skip the intro I
wasn't<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> bother<00:00:54.149> with<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:55.110> wanted

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
wasn't going to bother with it I wanted

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.709 
wasn't going to bother with it I wanted
to<00:00:55.710> show<00:00:55.890> some<00:00:56.129> real<00:00:56.309> game<00:00:56.579> play<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
to show some real game play with the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.040 
to show some real game play with the
settings<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> let's<00:01:00.600> jump<00:01:00.870> into

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
settings that I have so let's jump into

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.020 
settings that I have so let's jump into
it<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:03.920> figured<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.010> might<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.519> kick<00:01:05.880> around

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
it I figured I might just kick around

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.260 
it I figured I might just kick around
instead<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.689> green<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.909> will<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:08.939> play

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
instead of green you know will be play

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.429 
instead of green you know will be play
the<00:01:09.450> game<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.229> i'm<00:01:10.320> just

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the game because you know i'm just

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560 
the game because you know i'm just
showing<00:01:10.619> off<00:01:10.890> gameplay<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.700> well<00:01:11.970> graphics

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
showing off gameplay here well graphics

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.010 
showing off gameplay here well graphics
really<00:01:14.210> but<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.420> least<00:01:15.450> get<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> good<00:01:15.990> idea

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
really but you at least get a good idea

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.930 
really but you at least get a good idea
of<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> game<00:01:16.830> looks<00:01:16.860> like

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
of what the game looks like

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.690 
of what the game looks like
looks<00:01:19.300> great<00:01:19.510> I<00:01:20.140> think<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.740> model<00:01:21.070> modeling

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
looks great I think the model modeling

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.780 
looks great I think the model modeling
on<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:22.180> trains<00:01:22.480> a<00:01:22.600> bit<00:01:22.780> flat<00:01:23.110> but<00:01:24.100> uh<00:01:24.130> textures

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
on the trains a bit flat but uh textures

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.310 
on the trains a bit flat but uh textures
look<00:01:24.970> great<00:01:25.240> I<00:01:25.480> think<00:01:25.780> then<00:01:25.930> I'm<00:01:26.020> doing<00:01:26.290> a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
look great I think then I'm doing a

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.370 
look great I think then I'm doing a
great<00:01:26.530> job<00:01:26.560> with<00:01:26.980> this<00:01:27.130> game<00:01:27.370> I<00:01:28.180> know<00:01:28.600> that's

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
great job with this game I know that's

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.950 
great job with this game I know that's
one<00:01:29.890> of<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.070> big<00:01:30.880> things<00:01:30.910> of<00:01:31.300> developing<00:01:31.840> this

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
one of the big things of developing this

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.360 
one of the big things of developing this
new<00:01:32.020> engine<00:01:32.550> was<00:01:33.550> was<00:01:34.180> lighting<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:35.370> how

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
new engine was was lighting and how

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.430 
new engine was was lighting and how
light<00:01:36.610> works<00:01:36.970> with<00:01:37.300> materials<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.140> textures

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
light works with materials and textures

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.510 
light works with materials and textures
I<00:01:38.830> think<00:01:39.340> they<00:01:39.430> did<00:01:39.580> a<00:01:39.610> pretty<00:01:39.820> good<00:01:40.000> job<00:01:40.060> here

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.970 

now<00:01:45.520> especially<00:01:45.820> in<00:01:46.390> comparison<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.770> metal

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980

gear solid four this game has a lot of

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.960 
gear solid four this game has a lot of
gameplay<00:01:51.730> options<00:01:52.410> just<00:01:53.410> like<00:01:53.530> mgs4<00:01:54.160> except

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
gameplay options just like mgs4 except

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.420 
gameplay options just like mgs4 except
this<00:01:55.090> is<00:01:55.270> much<00:01:55.450> much<00:01:55.600> more<00:01:55.810> open<00:01:56.040> though<00:01:57.040> mg<00:01:57.370> is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
this is much much more open though mg is

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.580 
this is much much more open though mg is
what<00:01:57.610> was<00:01:57.790> pretty<00:01:58.240> decently<00:01:58.630> open<00:01:58.960> much<00:01:59.350> more

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
what was pretty decently open much more

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
what was pretty decently open much more
than<00:01:59.770> games<00:02:00.520> previous<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.920> it's<00:02:03.070> almost<00:02:03.460> a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
than games previous but it's almost a

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.370 
than games previous but it's almost a
little<00:02:03.670> overwhelming<00:02:04.420> though<00:02:04.810> but<00:02:05.200> it's<00:02:05.320> a

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
little overwhelming though but it's a

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.110 
little overwhelming though but it's a
lot<00:02:05.470> of<00:02:05.530> fun<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:06.400> just<00:02:06.580> seems<00:02:06.729> like<00:02:06.850> it's<00:02:07.060> a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
lot of fun it just seems like it's a

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.359 
lot of fun it just seems like it's a
little<00:02:07.300> too<00:02:07.450> easy<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.900> run<00:02:08.050> around<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:09.040> kill

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
little too easy to run around and kill

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.570 
little too easy to run around and kill
people<00:02:09.610> if<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:09.970> want<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:13.770> I'm<00:02:14.770> earlier<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.280> was

more<00:02:18.040> than<00:02:18.280> mgs<00:02:19.150> really<00:02:19.680> not<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.830> that's<00:02:20.980> not

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
more than mgs really not that that's not

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.900 
more than mgs really not that that's not
fun<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:21.970> not<00:02:22.840> mgs<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.550> guess<00:02:24.730> it's

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
fun it's just not mgs but I guess it's

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.820 
fun it's just not mgs but I guess it's
okay<00:02:25.270> since<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.140> can<00:02:26.320> play<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:26.980> mgs<00:02:28.830> it

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
okay since you can play it like mgs it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.930 
okay since you can play it like mgs it
almost<00:02:29.980> seems<00:02:30.280> like<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.459> little<00:02:30.700> almost

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
almost seems like a little almost

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.690 
almost seems like a little almost
inconsequential<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:32.560> run<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.250> run<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.580> gun

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
inconsequential to run to run and gun

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:43.809 
inconsequential to run to run and gun
kinda<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.510> NGS<00:02:35.200> for<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.620> was<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.890> same<00:02:36.070> way

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.640 

so<00:02:44.629> I'm<00:02:44.689> going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.900> chase<00:02:45.079> this<00:02:45.230> guy<00:02:45.319> down<00:02:45.439> i

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.789 
think i'm going to interrogate him which
was<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.209> lot<00:02:50.389> of<00:02:50.450> fun<00:02:50.629> in<00:02:50.780> mgs3<00:02:51.109> i<00:02:51.379> remember<00:02:51.680> when

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
was a lot of fun in mgs3 i remember when

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.470 
was a lot of fun in mgs3 i remember when
they<00:02:51.889> introduced<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.519> is<00:02:52.700> pretty<00:02:53.209> badass

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
they introduced it is pretty badass

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:16.470 
they introduced it is pretty badass
actually

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.700 

if<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.600> haven't<00:03:17.840> noticed<00:03:17.870> yet<00:03:18.200> I'm<00:03:18.350> not<00:03:18.380> that

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
if you haven't noticed yet I'm not that

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.580 
if you haven't noticed yet I'm not that
efficient<00:03:19.280> with<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.490> controls<00:03:19.910> here<00:03:20.500> maybe<00:03:21.500> I

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
efficient with the controls here maybe I

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.190 
efficient with the controls here maybe I
should<00:03:21.680> use<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.010> gamepad<00:03:22.520> but<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:23.090> prefer<00:03:23.990> to<00:03:24.080> use

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
should use a gamepad but I prefer to use

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.380 
should use a gamepad but I prefer to use
mouse<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.620> keyboard<00:03:24.740> on<00:03:25.069> PC<00:03:25.520> you<00:03:26.270> would

mouse and keyboard on PC you would

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.640 
mouse and keyboard on PC you would
eventually<00:03:26.750> I'll<00:03:26.930> get<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.170> hang<00:03:27.319> of<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.530> I'm

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
eventually I'll get the hang of it I'm

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.420 
eventually I'll get the hang of it I'm
not<00:03:27.770> too<00:03:27.950> worried<00:03:29.830> though<00:03:30.830> kind<00:03:31.100> of<00:03:31.130> what<00:03:31.400> I

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
being a little too run and gun it's very

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.449 
being a little too run and gun it's very
easy<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.470> running<00:03:36.800> gun<00:03:36.950> when<00:03:37.160> you're<00:03:37.280> using

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
easy to running gun when you're using

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.670 
easy to running gun when you're using
the<00:03:37.580> mouse<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.000> keyboard<00:03:38.120> it's<00:03:38.810> just<00:03:38.990> it's<00:03:39.350> so
