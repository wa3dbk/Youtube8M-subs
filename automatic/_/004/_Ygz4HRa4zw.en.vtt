little<00:00:10.139> plants<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.950> I've<00:00:11.099> picked<00:00:11.759> up

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
little plants that I've picked up

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.959 
little plants that I've picked up
actually<00:00:12.420> almost<00:00:12.870> two<00:00:13.290> months<00:00:13.440> ago<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.790> is

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
actually almost two months ago this is

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.930 
actually almost two months ago this is
my<00:00:15.929> first<00:00:16.350> one<00:00:16.619> right<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.460> super

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
my first one right here this is a super

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.769 
my first one right here this is a super
dwarf<00:00:18.300> Cavendish<00:00:19.020> banana<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.699> usually<00:00:21.660> will

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
dwarf Cavendish banana it usually will

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.609 
dwarf Cavendish banana it usually will
only<00:00:21.960> grow<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:22.289> until<00:00:22.859> maybe<00:00:23.490> four<00:00:23.850> feet<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.210> so

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
only grow up until maybe four feet or so

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
only grow up until maybe four feet or so
I<00:00:25.619> actually<00:00:26.130> ended<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.550> ordering<00:00:26.760> two<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.300> them

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
I actually ended up ordering two of them

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.089 
I actually ended up ordering two of them
because<00:00:27.660> they<00:00:27.750> were<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.050> inexpensive<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.859> found

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
because they were so inexpensive I found

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.170 
because they were so inexpensive I found
them<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.429> amazon.com<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:31.730> as<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.149> see

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
them on amazon.com and as you can see

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700 
them on amazon.com and as you can see
they're<00:00:33.540> actually<00:00:33.840> doing<00:00:33.989> pretty<00:00:34.110> well<00:00:34.380> it's

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
they're actually doing pretty well it's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.040 
they're actually doing pretty well it's
starting<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.130> cold<00:00:35.190> now<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.809> they're

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
starting to get cold now so they're

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.150 
starting to get cold now so they're
probably<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.800> much<00:00:37.950> more

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
probably not going to do much more

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.479 
probably not going to do much more
growing<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.820> season<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.070> shortly

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
growing for this season and shortly

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.799 
growing for this season and shortly
after<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.940> actually<00:00:42.149> ended<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.600> picking

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
after that I actually ended up picking

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.959 
after that I actually ended up picking
up<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.440> plant<00:00:43.860> right<00:00:44.100> here<00:00:44.160> which<00:00:44.820> is

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
up this plant right here which is

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.430 
up this plant right here which is
actually<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:46.260> MU<00:00:46.440> sub<00:00:46.680> asked<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
actually the MU sub asked you which is a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.709 
actually the MU sub asked you which is a
regular-sized<00:00:50.010> plant<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:51.149> also<00:00:51.300> banana

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
regular-sized plant it's also banana

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.029 
regular-sized plant it's also banana
plant<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.500> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> grow

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
plant and it's probably going to grow

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.369 
plant and it's probably going to grow
maybe<00:00:53.460> 12<00:00:53.820> feet<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.360> depending<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.840> you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
maybe 12 feet or so depending on you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
maybe 12 feet or so depending on you
know<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:56.219> conditions<00:00:56.760> outside<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.719> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
know the conditions outside but as I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.209 
know the conditions outside but as I
said<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.350> cold<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.070> hasn't

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
said it's really cold now so it hasn't

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.279 
said it's really cold now so it hasn't
really<00:00:59.399> grown<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.820> much<00:00:59.850> when<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:01.050> got

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
really grown that much when I first got

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.119 
really grown that much when I first got
it<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.559> was<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:02.039> damaged<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.989> I<00:01:04.129> was

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it it was actually damaged and I was

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.770 
it it was actually damaged and I was
able<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.430> nurse<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> back<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> life<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.630> can

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
able to nurse it back to life as you can

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.710 
able to nurse it back to life as you can
see<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> middle<00:01:07.350> leaf<00:01:07.530> there<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.720> relatively

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
see the middle leaf there is relatively

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.740 
see the middle leaf there is relatively
new<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.909> it's<00:01:11.909> doing<00:01:12.090> pretty<00:01:12.180> well<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
new and it's doing pretty well but it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.520 
new and it's doing pretty well but it
hasn't<00:01:13.020> grown<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.350> much<00:01:13.490> lately<00:01:15.530> basically

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
hasn't grown that much lately basically

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.710 
hasn't grown that much lately basically
this<00:01:16.650> was<00:01:16.860> due<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.850> shipping<00:01:18.090> conditions

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
this was due to the shipping conditions

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.620 
this was due to the shipping conditions
they<00:01:18.990> had<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.280> kind<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.369> bent<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.390> over<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
they had a kind of bent it all over the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.859 
they had a kind of bent it all over the
place<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.580> actually<00:01:23.580> complained<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.659> had

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
place so I actually complained and I had

actually<00:01:28.439> right<00:01:28.770> over<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.549> as<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:29.939> see

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
actually right over here as you can see

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.569 
actually right over here as you can see
this<00:01:30.390> one<00:01:30.630> right<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:32.220> slightly

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
this one right here is in slightly

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.380 
this one right here is in slightly
better<00:01:32.880> condition<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:36.060> one's<00:01:36.270> actually

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
better condition and this one's actually

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.359 
better condition and this one's actually
doing<00:01:36.720> okay<00:01:36.990> they're<00:01:37.770> both<00:01:37.979> about<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> same

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
doing okay they're both about the same

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.130 
doing okay they're both about the same
size<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.150> see<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.600> leaf<00:01:39.869> right

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
size you can see that this leaf right

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.090 
size you can see that this leaf right
here<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> little<00:01:41.130> bit<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.829> bit<00:01:43.829> Brown

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
here is a little bit a little bit Brown

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.499 
here is a little bit a little bit Brown
I<00:01:44.399> don't<00:01:44.610> know<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.119> well<00:01:45.390> or

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
up getting this little fig tree here

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.350 
up getting this little fig tree here
which<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.070> really<00:01:53.250> small<00:01:53.610> hasn't<00:01:54.149> really

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
which is really small hasn't really

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.410 
which is really small hasn't really
grown<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.960> much<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:56.009> hardy<00:01:56.909> Chicago

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
grown all that much it's a hardy Chicago
