00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
hacker that you can lay the jammer has

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.510 
hacker that you can lay the jammer has
more<00:00:48.030> distance<00:00:48.660> than<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.559> sensor<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.309> lay<00:00:50.489> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
more distance than the sensor so lay it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.660 
more distance than the sensor so lay it
as<00:00:51.329> soon<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.840> jammer<00:00:52.289> laid<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.399> are

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
as soon as you see jammer laid out are

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.610 
as soon as you see jammer laid out are
soon<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> sensor<00:00:54.660> lay<00:00:55.320> down<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
soon to see the sensor lay down the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.459 
soon to see the sensor lay down the
jammer<00:00:56.000> that's<00:00:57.000> that's<00:00:57.690> automatic<00:00:58.320> right

it still it just doesn't get the bounce
it<00:01:21.630> doesn't<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> bounce<00:01:22.790> where<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it doesn't get the bounce where you

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.580 
it doesn't get the bounce where you
think<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.240> would<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> angle<00:01:24.810> word<00:01:25.200> come

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
there now i'm running the mp5 with rapid

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.859 
there now i'm running the mp5 with rapid
fire<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:49.970> like<00:01:50.970> i<00:01:51.090> said<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.600> map

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
fire and it is a like i said this map

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.840 
fire and it is a like i said this map
you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.229> run<00:01:52.439> any<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.250> either<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.670> could

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you can run any you can either you could

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.109 
you can run any you can either you could
basically<00:01:54.090> run<00:01:54.720> any<00:01:54.899> combination<00:01:55.939> this<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
basically run any combination this is a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.789 
basically run any combination this is a
good<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.810> good<00:01:57.990> map<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.439> run<00:01:58.649> those

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
good this is a good map to run those

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.959 
good this is a good map to run those
combinations<00:01:59.189> on<00:02:00.500> whereas<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.369> it's

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
combinations on whereas you know it it's

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.570 
combinations on whereas you know it it's
a<00:02:03.030> little<00:02:03.270> bit<00:02:03.360> harder<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.689> run

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
a little bit harder to run

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.980 
a little bit harder to run
the<00:02:04.730> easy<00:02:05.150> on<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.230> other<00:02:06.350> maps<00:02:06.650> I<00:02:07.690> mean<00:02:08.690> not

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
the easy on the other maps I mean not

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.350 
the easy on the other maps I mean not
