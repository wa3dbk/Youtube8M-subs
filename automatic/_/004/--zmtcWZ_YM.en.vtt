there's<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.200> lot<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.559> say<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
there's not a lot to say about it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.240 
there's not a lot to say about it
the<00:00:47.700> point<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.539> went<00:00:49.020> into<00:00:49.200> 23<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.039> I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the point was that I went into 23 and I

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.880 
the point was that I went into 23 and I
really<00:00:50.700> struggled<00:00:51.120> out<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.590> lot<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
really struggled out there with a lot of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.479 
really struggled out there with a lot of
oversteer<00:00:53.309> problems<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.800> by<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:56.100> into<00:00:56.250> two

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
oversteer problems and by going into two

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
oversteer problems and by going into two
and<00:00:56.640> three<00:00:56.879> over<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.480> bump<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.079> lost<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and three over the bump I just lost the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.860 
and three over the bump I just lost the
car<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> moment<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.460> catched<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.969> back<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
car for a moment and catched it back and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
car for a moment and catched it back and
then<00:01:01.079> had<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.260> go<00:01:01.379> wide<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.340> white<00:01:02.520> line

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
then had to go wide and the white line

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.729 
then had to go wide and the white line
went<00:01:03.090> over<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> grass<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.500> touched

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
went over the grass and I just touched

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.550 
went over the grass and I just touched
the<00:01:04.949> barrier<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.729> well<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.470> then<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the barrier as well and then the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.289 
the barrier as well and then the
steering<00:01:07.830> wasn't<00:01:08.400> working<00:01:08.670> any<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:08.880> proper

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
steering wasn't working any more proper

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.600 
steering wasn't working any more proper
and<00:01:09.630> when<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.290> saw<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:10.950> went<00:01:11.280> into

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and when I saw it when I then went into

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.310 
and when I saw it when I then went into
turn<00:01:11.760> four<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.420> car<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.780> pulled<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.200> pulled

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
turn four the car just pulled it pulled

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.590 
turn four the car just pulled it pulled
over<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.460> looked<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.790> suddenly<00:01:15.270> Damon

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
over and then I looked in suddenly Damon

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.899 
over and then I looked in suddenly Damon
was<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.020> well<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.130> drove<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:17.580> each

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
was there as well and we drove over each

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.300 
was there as well and we drove over each
other<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.240> drove<00:01:18.600> over<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.900> front<00:01:19.170> wheel<00:01:19.439> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
other I drove over this front wheel and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219 
other I drove over this front wheel and
I<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.060> air<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.390> was<00:01:21.509> thinking

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
I was up in the air and I was thinking

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.240 
I was up in the air and I was thinking
for<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.439> moment<00:01:22.830> I'd<00:01:22.920> make<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.180> turn<00:01:24.180> over<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
for a moment I'd make a turn over and

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.560 
for a moment I'd make a turn over and
then<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> found<00:01:26.520> myself<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> tire<00:01:27.330> barrier

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
then I found myself in the tire barrier

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.980 
then I found myself in the tire barrier
which<00:01:28.820> wasn't<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> nice<00:01:30.119> experience<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
which wasn't the nice experience I

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.260 
which wasn't the nice experience I
didn't<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.950> what's<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.579> after<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.060> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
didn't know what's going on after this I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.300 
didn't know what's going on after this I
didn't<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.689> whether<00:01:33.900> there<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.009> something

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
didn't know whether there is something

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.859 
didn't know whether there is something
going<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:35.790> Damon<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.299> saw<00:01:36.479> him<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
going on with Damon I saw him for a

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.050 
going on with Damon I saw him for a
moment<00:01:37.049> not<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:37.890> accelerating<00:01:38.579> as<00:01:38.700> quick

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
moment not really accelerating as quick

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.420 
moment not really accelerating as quick
as<00:01:39.210> usually<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> wasn't<00:01:40.860> sure<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
as usually so I wasn't sure and then I

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
as usually so I wasn't sure and then I
had<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.240> stay<00:01:42.390> there<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.810> was<00:01:42.960> waiting

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
had to just stay there and I was waiting

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.590 
had to just stay there and I was waiting
and<00:01:43.590> I'm<00:01:43.680> looking<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.280> Nigel<00:01:44.640> passing<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and I'm looking for Nigel passing the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.510 
and I'm looking for Nigel passing the
first<00:01:45.780> time<00:01:46.110> second<00:01:46.829> time<00:01:46.890> third<00:01:47.040> time

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
first time second time third time

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.960 
first time second time third time
without<00:01:48.060> seeing<00:01:48.409> Dame<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:49.860> my<00:01:50.759> first

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
without seeing Dame and then my first

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.020 
without seeing Dame and then my first
hopes<00:01:51.299> came<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.740> still<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.700> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
hopes came up that it still is going to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.870 
hopes came up that it still is going to
happen<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.560> heard<00:01:56.100> over<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> speaker

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
happen and then I heard over the speaker

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.550 
happen and then I heard over the speaker
that<00:01:57.659> it's

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that it's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.080
