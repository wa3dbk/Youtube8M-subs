00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.290
 maybe you were the dream or maybe what 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.120
 you have mostly women this say 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.620
 Oh, I want to sell clothes, I want to put a 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.440
 entrepreneurship that has to do with 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.389
 clothing with clothes design but with the 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.580
 impulse we do not do anything you have to know what 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.949
 what are we going to do and and this is very 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.599
 recurrent are desired to all I have to 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.419
 remember most women design it 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.660
 that's why I put all of them tell me that 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.660
 the clothes 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.280
 exactly what we are going to do is 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:37.719
 teach our loved ones 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.719
 viewers how to put together a business 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.989
 anyone regardless of sex 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.430
 four common error tips that 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.510
 you do not have to eat also to see what 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.640
 we do not have to do to do well 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.379
 please first huge advice 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.359
 difference between being a designer or a 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.190
 entrepreneur to a lot of that of what 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.140
 global to the local the world exists there 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.750
 to understand where and how I sell it to 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.940
 we make many mistakes and the aftermarket and 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.769
 responsibility a fundamental issue 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.420
 of which I am going to speak point 1 I can 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.610
 have very good taste to design but 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.520
 have no idea how to undertake a thing 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.590
 is to be a good designer is to win good 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.930
 taste and another thing is to be an entrepreneur 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.940
 and to undertake is to put together a business plan 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.100
 understand your consumer understand your 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.650
 market understanding and process 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.630
 manufacture and in general the majority of 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.910
 those who mistakenly enter the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.300
 business of selling clothes come in from me 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.490
 love to design you have to understand that there 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.780
 that train to be trained look for partners 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.660
 that complement each other in what you lack 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.280
 to move from a good idea to a 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.870
 business that are two different things to 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.060
 Sometimes we say I have a good idea but 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.920
 that does not do business business is when 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.020
 you know how to implement it better than others 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.450
 so train yourself to train or look for a 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.130
 partner that gives you what you do not have that is 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.750
 from the global to the local what do you want 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.460
 to say with this with this what I want 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.990
 to say is that the second mistake is that the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.850
 most fall in love with what you wear 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.979
 it is then to tell you this I want 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.540
 offer the world what I do and 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.190
 that's fine but you have to understand that 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.380
 most of the trends in the world 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.390
 of clothes go through what we see in the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.729
 magazines of the heart that we see the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.160
 famous that she put on such clothes for the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.410
 delivery of the oscars and that little by little goes 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.660
 to the trend of clothing in general is 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.970
 that the world defines the trend and 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.710
 then it goes landing locally in the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.450
 argentina in buenos aires for example 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.700
 well be understanding what happens in the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.980
 world is fundamental and a big mistake of 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.450
 the designers is that they think what 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.070
 what I like is what the world 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.570
 wants to buy and not necessarily that 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.760
 seat is to understand the trends of 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.290
 world if you can travel know towards 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.690
 where is it going and then apply it 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.000
 locally where and how I sell it rented 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.860
 a place of entry and I put everything like that 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.390
 Big mistake every time I ask 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.430
 someone who tells me I put a local 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.710
 clothes and I fused I tell you insurance rent 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.450
 a local and he tells me if I tell you more 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.310
 sure rent this a place in a place 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.530
 where another person had previously rented 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.120
 a place to sell clothes there as you know 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.640
 I tell you because in general the big mistake 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.100
 they commit is to rent a place and 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.050
 renting a place is almost the stage very 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.180
 advanced of my project I have to 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.640
 Start selling in groups of friends from 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.590
 moms from the club school after 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.180
 will start to see if I can start 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.710
 offer my products in places that already 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.810
 have others that are products 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.000
 multibrand see if I can sell them for 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.900
 internet and only when you have 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.420
 an important volume so that 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.970
 let's start with the local big mistake 220 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.370
 responsibility the most important thing and that 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.740
 is a point that little is understood is the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.750
 best potential client is the one that 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.330
 bought last week or last month 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.640
 then many sell and they are not 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.410
 focused on continuing and having the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.600
 responsibility to follow the client to 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.550
 over time because they are my 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.260
 major sellers to third parties when 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.990
 one is very happy with a product not 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.550
 there is better sold truth than winning that 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.930
 where are you going to buy it look at what you buy 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.570
 in this place then you have to understand 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.010
 that more and more the after-sales what happens 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.720
 after he takes me the product is 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.850
 much more important than the single fact 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.620
 delivery this bag and with that I'm 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.540
 happy so I understand that the 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.430
 future clients are probably the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.050
 current clients and their friends and their 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.180
 close people we learned schÃ¼mann so 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.860
 this morning with 12 hopefully yes so 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.630
 you can learn but you have to do it 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.000
 using your head and experience 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.410
 thanks and as always in class 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.410
 of huge we keep doing
