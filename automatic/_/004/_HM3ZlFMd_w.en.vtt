00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
count the 39 to V count and this is how

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.850 
count the 39 to V count and this is how
you<00:00:36.540> will<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.840> set<00:00:37.110> up<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.469> your<00:00:37.590> sphere

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
you will be set up on to your sphere

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.520 
you will be set up on to your sphere
here<00:00:38.070> passive<00:00:39.000> feel<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.540> got<00:00:39.570> randomized<00:00:40.140> I

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
here passive feel we got randomized I

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.840 
here passive feel we got randomized I
like<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.250> equalized

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
like that I got it I got equalized

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.060 
like that I got it I got equalized
because<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.239> could<00:00:42.480> equal<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.410> dynamic<00:00:43.920> which

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
because I could equal that dynamic which

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.860 
because I could equal that dynamic which
keeps<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> static<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.510> more<00:00:45.719> or

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
keeps going and the static is more or

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.979 
keeps going and the static is more or
still<00:00:46.399> got<00:00:47.399> point<00:00:47.700> per<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.450> got<00:00:48.600> length<00:00:48.840> I

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
still got point per here we got length I

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.479 
still got point per here we got length I
like<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.190> we're<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
like it like that so we're going to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.110 
like it like that so we're going to
create<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.140> let<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.469> its<00:00:52.710> calculations

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.270 

yep<00:00:57.120> BAM<00:00:57.899> look<00:00:58.230> at<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.620> got<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> nice<00:00:59.010> punk

gonna<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> 3d<00:01:46.350> situation<00:01:47.340> which

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
gonna have to do a 3d situation which

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.719 
gonna have to do a 3d situation which
will<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.450> know<00:01:48.570> sphere<00:01:48.960> or<00:01:49.460> plane<00:01:50.460> or

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
will be you know sphere or plane or

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.670 
will be you know sphere or plane or
something<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.390> could<00:01:51.509> attach<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
something that it could attach to you

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.280 
something that it could attach to you
know<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:53.670> I'm<00:01:54.540> sure<00:01:54.600> there's<00:01:54.899> other<00:01:54.960> ways<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
know now I'm sure there's other ways of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.480 
know now I'm sure there's other ways of
doing<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.710> mean<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.009> actually<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.460> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
doing it but I mean to actually do it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.800 
doing it but I mean to actually do it
where<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.240> blowing<00:01:57.450> upon

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
where it's going to be blowing upon

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.959 
where it's going to be blowing upon
something<00:01:58.110> where<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.490> word<00:01:59.490> has<00:01:59.670> more

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
something where it's word has more

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.539 
something where it's word has more
interaction<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.110> its<00:02:01.350> surroundings<00:02:02.040> it's

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
interaction to its surroundings it's

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.550 
interaction to its surroundings it's
better<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.090> attached<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.560> situation

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
better to have it attached to situation

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.850 
better to have it attached to situation
like<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.829> go<00:02:04.920> always<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.860> hide

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
like there you go always you know hide

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.499 
like there you go always you know hide
it<00:02:08.099> after<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.090> get<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.360> going

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
it after that but just to get it going

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.479 
it after that but just to get it going
to<00:02:09.750> get<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> home<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.590> get<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
to get it home to get it in the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.890 
to get it home to get it in the
direction<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.940> might<00:02:12.150> want<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.629> you're

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
direction you might want it in you're

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.190 
direction you might want it in you're
going<00:02:13.020> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
going to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.640 
going to
to<00:02:13.819> be<00:02:14.819> best<00:02:15.060> off<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.750> know<00:02:15.900> doing<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.590> this

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
to be best off you know doing it this

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.259 
to be best off you know doing it this
way<00:02:18.620> because<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.769> don't<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.519> just<00:02:21.120> so

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
way because you don't have to just so

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.610 
way because you don't have to just so
many<00:02:21.420> different<00:02:21.569> ways<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:21.840> mind<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.500> can

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
many different ways in mind that you can

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.030 
many different ways in mind that you can
do<00:02:22.739> something<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:24.000> know<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.860> guess<00:02:25.860> it's

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
do something but you know I guess it's

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.520 
do something but you know I guess it's
just<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.220> way<00:02:26.400> I've<00:02:26.900> come<00:02:27.900> across<00:02:27.989> doing<00:02:28.410> it

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
just the way I've come across doing it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.250 
just the way I've come across doing it
and<00:02:28.590> I've<00:02:28.709> had<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.550> know<00:02:29.810> different<00:02:30.810> models

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
and I've had you know different models

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.979 
and I've had you know different models
some<00:02:31.410> gray<00:02:31.590> hair<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.480> almost<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
some gray hair and almost like in the

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.660 
some gray hair and almost like in the
bay<00:02:34.200> wolf<00:02:34.440> howling<00:02:34.680> when<00:02:34.980> he<00:02:35.099> turned<00:02:35.370> his<00:02:35.519> head

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
bay wolf howling when he turned his head

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.880 
bay wolf howling when he turned his head
there's<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.269> little<00:02:36.480> sway<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.769> will

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
there's just a little sway that will

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.490 
there's just a little sway that will
happen<00:02:38.040> right<00:02:38.310> there<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> bottom<00:02:38.849> that

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
happen right there on the bottom that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.589 
happen right there on the bottom that
can<00:02:40.500> be<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.459> part<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.819> those<00:02:41.940> settings<00:02:42.299> that<00:02:42.510> we

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
can be in part of those settings that we

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.320 
can be in part of those settings that we
were<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:42.959> at<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.860> once<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:44.790> click<00:02:44.970> into<00:02:45.180> here

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
were just at and once we click into here

were just at and once we click into here
and<00:02:45.360> get<00:02:45.599> into<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.930> actual<00:02:46.170> settings<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.099> our

in<00:02:48.569> our<00:02:50.420> dialog<00:02:51.420> boxes<00:02:51.840> we<00:02:52.019> can<00:02:52.200> change<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.650> up

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
in our dialog boxes we can change it up

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.430 
in our dialog boxes we can change it up
so<00:02:53.010> much<00:02:53.190> where<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:54.569> just<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:54.989> affected<00:02:55.380> I

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
so much where it's just so affected I

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.539 
so much where it's just so affected I
mean<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.739> look<00:02:55.860> how<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.099> moving<00:02:56.250> right<00:02:56.489> now

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
mean just look how it's moving right now

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.729 
mean just look how it's moving right now
with<00:02:56.880> with<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.299> win<00:02:57.480> with<00:02:58.140> their<00:02:58.349> you<00:02:58.650> know

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
with with the win with their you know

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.500 
with with the win with their you know
this<00:02:58.890> airfield<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.549> actually<00:03:00.090> blowing<00:03:00.269> it

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
this airfield is actually blowing it

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.330 
this airfield is actually blowing it
into<00:03:00.780> X<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:02.989> it's<00:03:03.989> going<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.410> down<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.590> mean<00:03:04.890> and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
into X and it's going it down I mean and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.949 
into X and it's going it down I mean and
that's<00:03:05.640> just<00:03:05.819> kind<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.239> cool<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.599> know<00:03:06.630> we<00:03:06.840> can

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
that's just kind of cool you know we can

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.360 
that's just kind of cool you know we can
actually<00:03:07.079> stick<00:03:07.319> another<00:03:07.500> piece<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.920> air<00:03:08.130> down

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
actually stick another piece of air down

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.759 
actually stick another piece of air down
here<00:03:08.400> or<00:03:08.849> we<00:03:08.940> can<00:03:08.989> move<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.260> little<00:03:10.290> bit<00:03:10.650> to

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
here or we can move it a little bit to

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.500 
here or we can move it a little bit to
where<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.069> whole<00:03:11.280> sphere<00:03:11.519> would<00:03:12.120> move<00:03:12.329> out

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
where this whole sphere would move out

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.569 
where this whole sphere would move out
and<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.560> whole<00:03:13.739> hair<00:03:13.950> will<00:03:14.099> come<00:03:14.280> down<00:03:14.430> this

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
and the whole hair will come down this

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.300 
and the whole hair will come down this
other<00:03:14.790> way<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.000> know<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.329> mean<00:03:15.569> there's<00:03:16.310> lots

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
other way you know I mean there's lots

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.349 
other way you know I mean there's lots
of<00:03:17.400> different<00:03:17.459> ways<00:03:17.819> it<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.120> be<00:03:18.239> done

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
of different ways it can be done

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.420 
of different ways it can be done
actually<00:03:18.959> right<00:03:19.079> now<00:03:19.139> since<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:19.769> colliding

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
actually right now since it's colliding

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.789 
actually right now since it's colliding
into<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:21.720> sphere<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.200> don't<00:03:22.350> really<00:03:22.530> see<00:03:22.709> it

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
into the sphere you don't really see it

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.460 
into the sphere you don't really see it
laying<00:03:23.010> over<00:03:23.220> like<00:03:23.819> like<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.260> example<00:03:25.260> we'll

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
laying over like like this example we'll

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.410 
laying over like like this example we'll
show<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.889> know<00:03:26.370> where<00:03:26.579> you<00:03:26.700> have<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.000> actually

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
show you know where you have it actually

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.979 
show you know where you have it actually
against<00:03:27.959> its<00:03:28.109> colliding<00:03:28.850> mess<00:03:29.850> here<00:03:30.180> actually

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
against its colliding mess here actually

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.620 
against its colliding mess here actually
this<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.470> going<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.519> laced<00:03:32.700> lay<00:03:33.060> out<00:03:33.269> all

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
this is just going to laced lay out all

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.830 
this is just going to laced lay out all
the<00:03:34.319> way<00:03:34.410> across<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:35.209> sphere<00:03:36.209> but<00:03:36.630> if<00:03:36.750> you

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the way across the sphere but if you

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.340 
the way across the sphere but if you
want<00:03:37.079> it<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.319> where<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.709> was<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:38.100> would<00:03:38.280> be

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
want it to where it was it would be

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.930 
want it to where it was it would be
draping<00:03:40.350> over<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.040> would<00:03:41.160> have<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.790> use

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
draping over it you would have to use

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.090 
draping over it you would have to use
another<00:03:42.180> city<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:43.560> that's<00:03:43.739> just<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.980> little

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
another city so that's just a little

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.780 
another city so that's just a little
quick<00:03:44.280> intro<00:03:44.940> into<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:46.170> know<00:03:46.310> basically<00:03:47.310> how

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
quick intro into you know basically how

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.479 
quick intro into you know basically how
to<00:03:47.850> get<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:49.010> how<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.069> get<00:03:50.190> something<00:03:50.400> going

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
to get the how to get something going

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.789 
to get the how to get something going
and<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.120> could<00:03:51.239> also<00:03:51.389> just<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:52.410> know<00:03:52.500> stop<00:03:52.769> a

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
and you could also just you know stop a

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.009 
and you could also just you know stop a
field<00:03:53.100> on<00:03:53.280> another<00:03:53.459> field<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.090> vortex<00:03:54.840> on

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
field on another field of a vortex on

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.379 
field on another field of a vortex on
there<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.350> know<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:56.730> would<00:03:56.849> spin<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.269> up

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
there you know that would spin it up

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.180 
there you know that would spin it up
another<00:03:57.599> way<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.260> won't<00:03:58.410> even<00:03:58.590> kalai<00:03:58.920> that

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
another way and it won't even kalai that

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.940 
another way and it won't even kalai that
way<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.459> would<00:03:59.609> actually<00:03:59.760> probably<00:04:00.239> just<00:04:00.950> move

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
way it would actually probably just move

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.589 
way it would actually probably just move
around<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.519> know<00:04:02.639> so<00:04:02.910> there's<00:04:03.120> two<00:04:03.359> different

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
around you know so there's two different

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.470 
around you know so there's two different
ways<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.810> can<00:04:04.049> do<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.440> don't<00:04:04.590> have<00:04:04.650> to

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
ways you can do it you don't have to

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.250 
ways you can do it you don't have to
have<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.630> in<00:04:07.220> setting<00:04:08.220> in<00:04:08.310> here<00:04:08.549> but<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:09.329> as<00:04:09.599> of

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
have it in setting in here but but as of

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.390 
have it in setting in here but but as of
what<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.440> see<00:04:10.620> right<00:04:10.650> now<00:04:10.799> that's<00:04:11.099> what<00:04:11.280> it's

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
what I see right now that's what it's

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.500 
what I see right now that's what it's
going<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.609> do<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:11.880> going<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.239> definitely

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
going to do it's going to definitely

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.770 
going to do it's going to definitely
it's<00:04:13.349> not<00:04:13.470> set<00:04:13.859> as<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.010> collision<00:04:14.459> so<00:04:14.669> it's<00:04:14.910> it's

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
it's not set as a collision so it's it's

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.479 
it's not set as a collision so it's it's
not<00:04:16.970> it's<00:04:17.970> not<00:04:18.090> going<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.359> see<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.510> right<00:04:18.840> now

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
not it's not going to see that right now

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.520 
not it's not going to see that right now
it's<00:04:19.970> going<00:04:20.209> through<00:04:20.389> the<00:04:20.479> geometry<00:04:20.930> but<00:04:21.109> it's

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
it's going through the geometry but it's

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.370 
it's going through the geometry but it's
okay<00:04:21.739> because<00:04:21.940> that's<00:04:22.940> not<00:04:23.090> what<00:04:23.150> we're<00:04:23.479> main

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
okay because that's not what we're main

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.230 
okay because that's not what we're main
focuses<00:04:24.979> on<00:04:25.130> main<00:04:25.370> focus<00:04:25.669> is<00:04:25.849> on<00:04:25.970> getting<00:04:26.000> the

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
focuses on main focus is on getting the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.999 
focuses on main focus is on getting the
hair<00:04:26.389> to<00:04:26.539> relax<00:04:26.870> because<00:04:27.440> once<00:04:27.740> this<00:04:27.830> hair

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
hair to relax because once this hair

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.710 
hair to relax because once this hair
does<00:04:28.190> relax<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:28.819> this<00:04:28.910> solution<00:04:29.210> is<00:04:29.419> is

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
does relax and this solution is is

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.740 
does relax and this solution is is
complete<00:04:30.590> here<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:32.060> know<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.449> might<00:04:32.599> have<00:04:32.690> a

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
complete here you know you might have a

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.809 
complete here you know you might have a
to<00:04:32.810> see<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.110> with<00:04:33.470> this<00:04:33.560> frame<00:04:33.770> rate<00:04:33.919> but<00:04:34.190> it

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
to see it with this frame rate but it

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.020 
to see it with this frame rate but it
will<00:04:35.000> actually<00:04:35.180> sway<00:04:36.050> you<00:04:36.979> know<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.910> will

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
will actually sway you know and it will

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.890 
will actually sway you know and it will
and<00:04:38.210> yes<00:04:38.509> you<00:04:38.720> turns<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.500> head<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:41.419> hair<00:04:41.780> will

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
and yes you turns the head the hair will

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.070 
and yes you turns the head the hair will
turn<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.530> know<00:04:42.639> and<00:04:43.639> you<00:04:44.330> can<00:04:44.479> also<00:04:44.630> move<00:04:44.900> this

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
turn you know and you can also move this

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.170 
turn you know and you can also move this
up<00:04:45.139> you<00:04:45.740> know<00:04:45.860> let's<00:04:46.460> move<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.729> hair<00:04:46.880> up<00:04:47.000> here

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
up you know let's move the hair up here

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.059 
up you know let's move the hair up here
and<00:04:47.360> right<00:04:47.569> now<00:04:47.599> this<00:04:47.780> would<00:04:47.900> be<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.050> bald<00:04:48.830> guy

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
and right now this would be a bald guy

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.189 
and right now this would be a bald guy
you<00:04:49.130> know<00:04:49.430> with<00:04:49.699> long<00:04:50.389> hair<00:04:50.630> just<00:04:50.990> like<00:04:51.139> a
