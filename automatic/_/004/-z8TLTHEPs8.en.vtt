00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.340 
players are the most terrifying things
in<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:04.650> game<00:04:04.920> by<00:04:05.340> far<00:04:05.870> because<00:04:06.870> they're

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
in this game by far because they're

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.620 
in this game by far because they're
completely<00:04:07.740> unpredictable<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.850> if<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.360> run

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
completely unpredictable like if you run

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.740 
completely unpredictable like if you run
into<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.960> pack<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.350> bandits<00:04:11.120> which<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.360> have

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
into a pack of bandits which I have

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.300 
into a pack of bandits which I have
before<00:04:13.520> very<00:04:14.520> sadly<00:04:15.890> they<00:04:16.890> will<00:04:17.070> start

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
before very sadly they will start

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.080 
before very sadly they will start
shooting<00:04:17.790> on<00:04:17.940> site<00:04:18.859> which<00:04:19.859> is<00:04:20.220> really<00:04:20.850> one<00:04:21.060> of

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
shooting on site which is really one of

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.520 
shooting on site which is really one of
the<00:04:21.210> things<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.480> makes<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:21.900> game<00:04:22.109> fun

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
the things that makes this game fun

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.650 
the things that makes this game fun
because<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.490> never<00:04:24.000> know<00:04:24.150> what's<00:04:24.450> going<00:04:24.600> to

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
because you never know what's going to

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.680 
because you never know what's going to
happen<00:04:24.750> if<00:04:25.230> you<00:04:25.470> find<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.830> care<00:04:26.070> if<00:04:26.220> you

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
happen if you find a care if you

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.920 
happen if you find a care if you
