it's anatomically correct and since that
it<00:00:53.519> wraps<00:00:53.699> around<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.840> bump<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.109> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
it wraps around the little bump in the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.150 
it wraps around the little bump in the
back<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.469> our<00:00:55.530> head<00:00:55.679> called<00:00:55.859> the<00:00:55.920> occipital

back of our head called the occipital

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.830 
back of our head called the occipital
lobe<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.120> that's<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.480> nice<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
lobe and that's really nice going to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240 
lobe and that's really nice going to
provides<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.679> nice<00:00:58.829> snug<00:00:59.219> fit

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
provides a really nice snug fit

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.829 
provides a really nice snug fit
especially<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.329> you're<00:01:00.420> running<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> bases

especially when you're running the bases

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.299 
especially when you're running the bases
you<00:01:01.050> won't<00:01:01.199> find<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.679> helmet<00:01:02.190> is

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
you won't find that the helmet is

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.040 
you won't find that the helmet is
tipping<00:01:02.820> down<00:01:02.940> into<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.420> eyesight

tipping down into your eyesight
we<00:01:04.410> also<00:01:04.560> lowered<00:01:04.980> the<00:01:05.070> back<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.430> shell

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
we also lowered the back of the shell

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
we also lowered the back of the shell
compared<00:01:06.120> to<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:06.330> past<00:01:06.480> models<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.170> that's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
compared to some past models and that's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.590 
compared to some past models and that's
really<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.070> safety<00:01:08.400> because<00:01:08.910> the<00:01:09.180> brain<00:01:09.390> stem

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
really for safety because the brain stem

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.720 
really for safety because the brain stem
is<00:01:09.930> very<00:01:10.290> very<00:01:10.500> sensitive<00:01:10.860> part<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.580> back
