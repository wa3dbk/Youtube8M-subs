00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.070 

one<00:00:13.250> approach<00:00:13.490> that<00:00:13.910> is<00:00:14.210> helpful<00:00:14.570> to<00:00:14.600> me<00:00:14.870> is

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
one approach that is helpful to me is

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.160 
one approach that is helpful to me is
that<00:00:15.230> I<00:00:15.290> think<00:00:15.380> Paul<00:00:15.830> certainly<00:00:16.250> assumed<00:00:17.210> that

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
that I think Paul certainly assumed that

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.400 
that I think Paul certainly assumed that
Adam<00:00:18.770> was<00:00:18.980> a<00:00:19.130> person<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.510> progenitor

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
Adam was a person and the progenitor

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.790 
Adam was a person and the progenitor
let's<00:00:21.950> say<00:00:22.160> of<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:22.490> human<00:00:22.760> race<00:00:23.170> and<00:00:24.170> I<00:00:24.650> would

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
let's say of the human race and I would

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.830 
let's say of the human race and I would
expect<00:00:25.250> nothing<00:00:25.370> less<00:00:25.580> from<00:00:25.760> Paul<00:00:26.180> being<00:00:26.690> a

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
expect nothing less from Paul being a

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.880 
expect nothing less from Paul being a
first<00:00:27.080> century<00:00:27.289> man<00:00:27.970> and<00:00:28.970> again<00:00:29.260> God<00:00:30.260> speaks

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
first century man and again God speaks

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.190 
first century man and again God speaks
in<00:00:31.190> ways<00:00:31.400> and<00:00:31.670> uses<00:00:32.210> categories<00:00:32.960> that<00:00:33.140> are

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
in ways and uses categories that are

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.740 
in ways and uses categories that are
available<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:34.310> human<00:00:34.579> beings<00:00:34.850> at<00:00:35.090> that<00:00:35.270> time<00:00:35.540> I

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
available to human beings at that time I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.020 
available to human beings at that time I
don't<00:00:35.930> expect<00:00:36.200> Paul<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:37.550> have<00:00:37.730> had<00:00:38.000> a

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
don't expect Paul to have had a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.790 
don't expect Paul to have had a
conversation<00:00:38.270> with<00:00:38.810> Francis<00:00:39.260> Collins<00:00:39.649> about

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
conversation with Francis Collins about

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.889 
conversation with Francis Collins about
the<00:00:40.040> genome<00:00:40.370> project<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:41.180> how<00:00:41.480> common

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
the genome project and how common

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.569 
the genome project and how common
descent<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:42.620> essentially<00:00:43.220> assured

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
descent is essentially assured

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.069 
descent is essentially assured
scientifically<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:44.420> didn't<00:00:44.600> expect<00:00:44.930> him<00:00:45.050> to

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
scientifically I didn't expect him to

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.549 
scientifically I didn't expect him to
understand<00:00:45.590> that<00:00:46.270> does<00:00:47.270> that<00:00:47.480> then<00:00:48.050> sort<00:00:48.410> of

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
understand that does that then sort of

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.799 
understand that does that then sort of
violate<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.220> theological<00:00:49.940> point<00:00:50.180> that<00:00:50.570> Paul

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
violate the theological point that Paul

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.280 
violate the theological point that Paul
is<00:00:50.989> making<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.559> connecting<00:00:52.280> Adam<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:52.790> Jesus

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
is making of connecting Adam and Jesus

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.240 
is making of connecting Adam and Jesus
and<00:00:54.399> more<00:00:55.399> importantly<00:00:55.910> does<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:57.100> let's<00:00:58.100> say

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
and more importantly does the let's say

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.299 
and more importantly does the let's say
the<00:00:58.399> non-literal<00:00:59.000> nests<00:00:59.329> of<00:00:59.510> Adam<00:00:59.920> affect<00:01:00.920> the

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
the non-literal nests of Adam affect the

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.880 
the non-literal nests of Adam affect the
non-literal<00:01:02.000> list<00:01:02.329> of<00:01:02.480> Jesus<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.170> there<00:01:03.860> I

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
non-literal list of Jesus and there I

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.010 
non-literal list of Jesus and there I
think<00:01:04.249> you<00:01:04.459> know<00:01:04.630> Christians<00:01:05.630> would<00:01:05.780> pretty

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
think you know Christians would pretty

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.109 
think you know Christians would pretty
much<00:01:06.109> come<00:01:06.499> down<00:01:06.709> say<00:01:07.009> well<00:01:07.219> absolutely<00:01:07.819> not

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
much come down say well absolutely not

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.959 
much come down say well absolutely not
the<00:01:08.359> two<00:01:08.569> are<00:01:08.810> not<00:01:09.020> connected<00:01:09.679> in<00:01:09.829> that<00:01:09.889> way<00:01:10.189> in

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
the two are not connected in that way in

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.709 
the two are not connected in that way in
Paul's<00:01:11.780> mind<00:01:12.609> there<00:01:13.609> may<00:01:13.639> be<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:14.060> more<00:01:14.299> organic

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
Paul's mind there may be a more organic

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:20.349 
Paul's mind there may be a more organic
connection<00:01:15.639> but<00:01:17.709> talking<00:01:18.709> about<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.459> listen

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
connection but talking about the listen

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.109 
connection but talking about the listen
I<00:01:20.509> mean<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:21.409> use<00:01:21.529> common<00:01:22.249> terms<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.880> non

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
I mean to use common terms the non

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.739 
I mean to use common terms the non
historicity<00:01:23.600> of<00:01:23.869> Adam<00:01:24.289> a<00:01:25.630> person<00:01:26.630> of

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:26.749 
historicity of Adam a person of

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.109 
historicity of Adam a person of
antiquity<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.409> story<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.100> antiquity<00:01:28.639> that<00:01:28.849> even
