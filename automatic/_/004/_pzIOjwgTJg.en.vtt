00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
while like you just went on the ground

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.610 
while like you just went on the ground
like<00:01:03.150> a<00:01:03.240> regular<00:01:03.450> fry<00:01:03.870> grenade<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.290> blew<00:01:04.440> up

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.680 
recovering and here we go here we go we
see<00:02:14.370> shocking<00:02:14.819> with<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.060> red<00:02:15.270> dot<00:02:15.480> which

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
see shocking with the red dot which

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.390 
see shocking with the red dot which
looks<00:02:15.900> pretty<00:02:16.260> nice<00:02:16.440> looks<00:02:16.709> like<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> model

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
looks pretty nice looks like the model

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.180 
looks pretty nice looks like the model
and<00:02:17.550> as<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.540> see<00:02:18.690> again<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.650> can't<00:02:20.040> see

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
and as you see again you can't see

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.990 
and as you see again you can't see
people<00:02:20.520> outlined<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.360> red<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:23.400> there<00:02:23.850> we<00:02:23.940> go

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
people outlined in red and there we go

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.160 
people outlined in red and there we go
when<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.240> threw<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.390> grenade<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.870> saw<00:02:25.050> that

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
when you threw that grenade you saw that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.350 
when you threw that grenade you saw that
streak<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.590> white<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.940> can<00:02:27.060> actually<00:02:27.090> see

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
streak of white so you can actually see

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.990 
streak of white so you can actually see
where<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.930> throw<00:02:28.140> your<00:02:28.260> name<00:02:28.500> which<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.709> nice

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
where you throw your name which is nice

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.190 
where you throw your name which is nice

and what I also wanted to show you guys

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.190 
and what I also wanted to show you guys
was<00:02:32.069> two<00:02:32.280> things<00:02:32.520> here<00:02:32.640> one<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.959> guy's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
was two things here one this guy's

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.480 
was two things here one this guy's
online<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> read<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.920> course<00:02:35.130> but<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.340> guy

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
online to read of course but this guy

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.580 
online to read of course but this guy
isn't<00:02:35.730> now<00:02:36.300> because<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:36.900> probably<00:02:37.230> has<00:02:37.410> that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
isn't now because this probably has that

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.650 
isn't now because this probably has that
assess<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.100> kind<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.280> hurt<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.209> it's<00:02:39.450> ke

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
assess and kind of hurt to it so it's ke

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.630 
assess and kind of hurt to it so it's ke
he<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.200> counter<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.860> then<00:02:41.160> over<00:02:41.310> here<00:02:41.340> this

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
he can counter and then over here this

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.280 
he can counter and then over here this
is<00:02:41.819> probably<00:02:42.060> EMP<00:02:42.600> grenade<00:02:42.900> i'm<00:02:43.020> not<00:02:43.140> sure

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
is probably EMP grenade i'm not sure

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.690 
is probably EMP grenade i'm not sure
what<00:02:43.350> else<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.620> could<00:02:43.709> be<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.340> does<00:02:44.580> look

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
what else it could be but this does look

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.220 
what else it could be but this does look
like<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.000> EMP<00:02:45.390> grenade<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.840> could<00:02:45.990> shock

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
like the EMP grenade and it could shock

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.520 
like the EMP grenade and it could shock
you<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.709> um<00:02:47.550> damn<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.840> big<00:02:49.080> shock<00:02:49.349> right

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
you can die if you fall off here but it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.800 
you can die if you fall off here but it

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
looks pretty nice how it's that kind of

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.080 
looks pretty nice how it's that kind of
a<00:03:45.980> building<00:03:46.980> tops<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.459> know<00:03:47.579> just<00:03:47.790> like<00:03:47.849> kind

a building tops you know just like kind

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.240 
a building tops you know just like kind
of<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.239> map<00:03:48.420> like<00:03:48.659> kurachi<00:03:49.290> like<00:03:49.620> from<00:03:49.829> 14<00:03:50.220> to

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250
