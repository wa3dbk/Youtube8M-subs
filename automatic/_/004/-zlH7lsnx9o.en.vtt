 tissue of space giving beginning to a 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.860

 based on the forgotten kingdoms campaign

 of dragons and dungeons neverwinter is 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.410
 one of the few mills that have 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.520
 something to offer to all kinds of 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.460
 players 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.610
 pvp missions dungeons manufacturing 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.460
 exploration as we said something to 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.740
 all one thing that has neverwinter and 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.500
 that most others are half rpg 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.870
 they do not have is the forge where you can create 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.790
 your own missions you can build the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.580
 map using thousands of constructions and 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.460
 objects choose the reward place 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.890
 each penis and how to even configure 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.810
 dialogs then you can share your 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.440
 creations with the community so that what 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.310
 enjoy 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.310
 it's something epic 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.710
 is the eternal battle between good and 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.650
 evil light against darkness 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.230
 SSM or that equips you with your own pair of 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.330
 wings without teaching you to fly and then you 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.310
 sends to start a path in search of 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.520
 adventure and potentially your own 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.820
 death falling while flying is for 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.040
 course there is a usual of these 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.530
 classifications and that has something that 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.330
 always makes us come back for more and not 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.590
 just because we have not managed to get there 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.590
 to the maximum level yet 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.750
 is that game that has such a title 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.420
 long that even developers what 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.659
 called by its acronym is of course 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.930
 of excite arboreal noise or is altered 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:52.989
 between you and me a world divided by the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.980
 war factions rival gods and a lot 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.989
 more it seems another m / mo rpg but when I 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.360
 proofs immediately you realize that the 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.579
 depth and focus of this rivals 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.010
 with many of his colleagues both new 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:09.060
 as old ones earning therefore a 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.060
 place in this list 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.180
 de lara the world of rif falls apart 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:28.819
 slowly huge astral anomalies 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.520
 appear and from them all kinds of 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:34.940
 magical beasts is an invasion 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.860
 epic scale planetary and who do you think 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.099
 that among all those who are 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.560
 in between is expected to save the world 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:45.020
 that yes as much as guardian or as of fai 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.970
 and you are the one who will save people 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.120
 and kick a few asses 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.550
 astral in the process can rely on 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.979
 you to drive out these dark forces 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.349
 They can trust you to save the 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.349
 world probably not no 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:17.479
 is a bird is a plane does not wait yes yes 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:19.789
 it's an airplane because this is world and air 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.159
 and that plane is probably shrapnel 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.549
 steaming because one of the best things 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.379
 of this game is your system of damages 

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:29.959
 take the sky in airplane fights the 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.909
 Second World War and contemplates how 

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:34.459
 your beloved fighter plane falls 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:37.159
 slowly to pieces thanks to the fire 

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:39.349
 enemy and this great simulator 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.289
 realistic at least that's our 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:45.879
 experience you may be very good 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.879
 in the game and this does not happen to you 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.470
 have you ever lost a game and you 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.240
 you've been wanting another round to 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.420
 try again 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.280
 this always happens on planet side 2 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.500
 this persistent m / mo shooter is a 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.570
 constant exchange of territories in 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.090
 a perpetual battle between the three 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.150
 factions for the domain of the points 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.340
 strategic continents fight 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.350
 as an opponent infantry behind the wheel 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.750
 of a tank or troop transport 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.120
 battleship or even leads to war 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.100
 up to the sky with this pvp combat 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.850
 frantic that allows combat 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.850
 ground-air 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.290
 in star wars the old republic you play 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.410

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.420
