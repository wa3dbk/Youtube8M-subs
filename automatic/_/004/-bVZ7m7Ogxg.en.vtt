00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.660
 hello her dear talk tk more beautiful 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:19.440
 Saturday afternoon is sitting here in Costa 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.449
 rica in front of our house office and wanted 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.800
 today like to talk because it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.140
 again and again the topic brought up 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.690
 is from people who stop me 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.970
 the us look our information 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.820
 differed absorb namely on the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.230
 or against each other over one 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.460
 juxtaposed against each other 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.309
 it is the food of fruits and vegetables 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.210
 moody's and but or even on 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.920
 juicing juices that you can make 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.929
 and as you know or white look is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.809
 but it is so I promoter always 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.969
 very strong the juices and in this video 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.510
 will explain why so why 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.949
 purists among the low cost enthusiastic 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.170
 At the people the enthusiastic of the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.879
 natural health they always say 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.040
 back to me that's baloney it to 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.250
 the together and smoothies especially as it is 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.870
 natural way is the fruit 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.730
 and vegetables our food 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.140
 chew and that the animals are too 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.290
 make or our next relatives 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 in the nature of the apes 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.480
 the 98 percent the same 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.480
 Own genetic material as we do 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.720
 So the gorillas chimpanzees the bonobo 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.370
 monkeys and that's right I have to be there 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.930
 right that 's right it is so that 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.770
 we, of course, that is most natural 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.910
 to sit down to eat everything 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.620
 I'm just from renz 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.650
 realistic practical level here 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.800
 Love that lasts for hours if you 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.980
 really that in the amount of green to 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.530
 example, you would chew every day 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.780
 should be really all nutrients 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.160
 cover you'd like just 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.930
 you would become our agent nature 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.790
 sit there for hours because it should 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.290
 between half kilo by kilo green 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.830
 you should take a day to you 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.900
 yes and who has the time did you say that 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.950
 i do not have the time he says i have 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.569
 there is no time for it 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.430
 five children had business day ran 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.080
 must and many other interests too 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.280
 still on the side but I have no time 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.959
 that 's easy 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.840
 I wonder how realistic it is 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.970
 it all in a natural way 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.310
 to get clean I say it goes 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.840
 and it's probably me too 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.459
 ask also that comes the next whether it 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.750
 really best is the problem that 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.670
 that is it is a big problem 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.540
 anyway, our Western world that we 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.480
 not good enough 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.580
 you should somehow bite everyone 40 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.000
 Chew 50 times really are really one 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.790
 real lead mouth is often barely 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.520
 My children, for example, are also people 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.959
 I also often not good enough and then 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.790
 you can just sex with her or 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.470
 the less you eat the less 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.280
 Can you really get the nutrients from it 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.380
 take up 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.970
 do you understand because you have to plant the plants 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.830
 phase really rub in your mouth 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.390
 around the juice at the plants 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.760
 phases to come where just the nutrients 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.380
 are included and if you live that 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.819
 It shows that when you buy 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.250
 then really must chew so well and 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.310
 It must be easy to do it for a long time 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.670
 this tool of juicing soder on 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.440
 the movie is simply outstanding 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.200
 In short, I would say yes 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.130
 not that we are now somehow 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.799
 mcdonald's or others processed 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.840
 food promoter first but keep in 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.340
 juice juicer or or still easy 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.170
 just a mixer and then you can 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.440
 also by seven with a mosquito net 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.680
 or something diving soja so after 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.720
 in my opinion it is the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.310
 efficient and art really wise to 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.010
 the chance to come to us 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.470
 just need us to be healthy 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.170
 to be happy, you understand 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.329
 That's why I'm the big supporter 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.579
 juices now comes the second 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.349
 Normally I'm lucky and one 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.730
 It is natural to make a dash 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.860
 to chew everything 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.569
 but you have the thoroughness you need 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.360
 Take many hours for you 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.040
 to take the right amounts to you 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.620
 if it's just raw food, above all, yes 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.180
 otherwise you cooked again 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.290
 things or mashed things or then 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.760
 is it again when you really are from 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.109
 natural food then speaks 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.329
 you and the exclusively or 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.569
 most of it hrtels then you have to 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.920
 a long time to book each day 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.229
 to do it right 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.820
 So that's why I say in 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:23.699
 juice and now I tell him why I am 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.560
 find that said that to the smoothies 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.750
 the green juice especially the dark green 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.130
 Vegetable juice is superior to sufis 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.130
 and that's it all over again 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.630
 Efficiency of smoothie is yes per 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.150
 By definition, you just throw everyone 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.250
 vegetables or fruits in a mixer and 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.470
 a bit of water and mixed everything 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.349
 So a thick porridge quasi the dik 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.470
 is very thick and if you juice 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.030
 but then you just take away 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.830
 this plant fiber what that 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.510
 viscous in the bremer the whole 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.370
 plant plant fibers which contain 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.520
 they are coming out and they have anyway 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.440
 no nutrient worth the 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.479
 nutrient value is in is in the 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.120
 contain juice of the plant father 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.800
 is now with all the smoothies around 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.660
 to stimulate yours and it 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.490
 works a bit like one 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.630
 do not brush the intestine clean inside 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.490
 he or she just too 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.440
 just stimulates to work 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.970
 since we are only from us anyway 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.349
 nourishing liquid food or just from 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.630
 smoothies or juices and anyway 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.070
 additionally eat and just the 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.409
 plant phase 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.820
 and since I consider that one anyway 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.919
 the biggest problems with us in the west 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.630
 is it like eating too much food as always 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.220
 it is never too much plant fibers 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.960
 No one is sick or ill 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.370
 too little too fast, yes 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.900
 that's why we do not need you 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.550
 you need the plant fibers in the smoothie 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.630
 not but it really does the juice 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.199
 and the juice that is the 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.040
 Main reason 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.820
 it's just a lot 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.320
 more nutrients on a smaller volume 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.000
 could juice my little Scotch 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.820
 For example, wheatgrass has been drinking 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.170
 has over 100 nutrients and it is 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.130
 easy and I will not get tired of that 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.600
 Promote here the nutrient-rich 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.580
 the world's source of food is the greens 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.860
 the dark green leafy vegetables in the form of 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:07.750
 juices because you're so small in volume 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:10.300
 an incredible amount of nutrients and vitamins 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.160
 hate and that's why I think they are the 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.140
 juices are actually superior to smoothies 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.430
 last but not least I want to lead 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.020
 I also speak as a family man 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.850
 of five children and especially mine 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.990
 second always the very small ones 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.880
 since it is sometimes not so easy 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.800
 to convince them of these juices 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.720
 to drink smoothies and if I then 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.820
 can create as small as possible 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.670
 volume to generate a lot of good 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.490
 nutrients for my children then there is 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.140
 just to emphasize the juice again 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.760
 and because the kids want what you want 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.470
 what you my kids want something me 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.030
 because I'm the role model for her singing 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.700
 I drink gallons of green every day 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.320
 juices because it can both you on 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.540
 most likely to convince a child just as well 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.330
 to drink green and to be healthy 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.280
 and is the best step of my knowledge 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.100
 my opinion as I said the am 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.840
 Entlastung or the juice I over 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.190
 the fashionable but the music is 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.860
 still great if you're totally moody 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.350
 market before running on god then drinks 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.440
 smoothies rudi zins it's time best 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.030
 drink the world's great we talk to 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.350
 very high levels the juices are always 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.330
 I think a bit superior 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.610
 as I said, but it is all my whole 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.650
 personal conception dugard is total 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.570
 Invited to contradict me too 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.040
 or the other will like to see 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.020
 your opinion how do you see that yes 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.490
 Write with the comment that is 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.090
 a comment under the video underneath 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.440
 look forward to it with her and stay 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.540
 with much love here from the beautiful 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.720
 sunny hot costa rica are looking forward 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.710
 soon again 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.300
 we came to the rain now 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.830
 For months only beam in the 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.920
 sunshine great because we each 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.780
 sunburn by the sea but also as beautiful 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.340
 Again, you have to cool in the evening 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:45.850
