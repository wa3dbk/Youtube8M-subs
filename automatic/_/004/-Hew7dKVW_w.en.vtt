00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.060
 welcome to the special depot 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.090
 I'll tell you a little something today 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.090
 over 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:27.330
 for example, london is already in the us 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:31.169
 has been known for some time 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.629
 splitting off a company's scalpels 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:38.170
 produce without teeth the boys of 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:41.199
 hebron thought hey we were taking 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.830
 not such an ultrasound for one way 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.470
 Blade and adapt in one 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:52.030
 pocketknives, for example, for hunting 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.760
 for collecting and and there I have to say 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.920
 So no one on the idea before 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.440
 come on it amazes me so I know 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.460
 now, for example, nothing like that 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.509
 does not mean that's why 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.640
 not there but i can not and 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.789
 I really have to say so the guys 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.580
 have the time really fine solved the 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:17.170
 now have a little mistake here 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:21.910
 made with an ultra sharp blade 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.099
 inside and I have to say it once 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.599
 the sharpest knife ever what i did 

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:28.630
 ever in such a life in my life 

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:30.520
 pocket knife variant have seen the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.630
 blade is of course very thin 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.959
 which is also very flexible so the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.190
 blade is perfect for cutting work to 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.950
 make firewood, etc 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.690
 you can not do it well 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.229
 but use fine 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.380
 So pull cutting work for the ceiling 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.959
 for many hunting tasks or too 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.819
 for the other fishermen, it is one 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:02:00.640
 excellent work back must be real 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:04.360
 say so that's under that 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.560
 sharpest which is accommodated with ag 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.300
 because it is a beautiful a blade and 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.370
 that tried now with your knife 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.050
 So that's awesome 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.030
 that exists in different 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.990
 versions for ยง 20a 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.570
 interested speaks 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.400
 then it is questioning it is 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.500
 so unfortunately it is a one-handed knife 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.930
 that means I can do it without problem 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.870
 open one hand 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.620
 well of course you can because the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.610
 property plead tool and 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.440
 that should not be a socially adequate reason 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.170
 be a problem but look at it 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.600
 best the film of me to Russia 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.600
 specifically give right to the knife 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.780
 yes that's the barracuda now 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.870
 specially made for anglers that's one 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.940
 flexible blade so there could be now 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.480
 also a nice cut out of it 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.400
 So absolutely great and pasta really 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.650
 extremely so if you like this one 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.100
 works and receivers still in between and 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.000
 he pushes neatly so that's it 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.450
 really bad 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.490
 So a scene from thumb it with the 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.560
 really fast by then so 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.230
 You really have to be careful 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:36.540
 that there is real passion for the thing 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:39.240
 yes, there are different sounds 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.450
 variations with different 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:48.400
 handle shells there is really for everyone 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.800
 the ideal blade with it I show it 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.440
 then you in detail as the whole 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.600
 looks like the blade held there 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.540
 when it is no longer sharp 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.820
 Klinger dispose of new blade rhine 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.220
 go on there you can do it right 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.050
 track make the hunter so beautiful 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.560
 his 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.560
 yes i'll show you in detail now 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:22.060
 so it looks in the space for trier 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:27.720
 Replacement blades and the knife and such 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:30.970
 see the replacement green from the zones 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:36.030
 multipack around there are in different 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:40.770
 shapes and designs 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.770
 suitable for the respective handle look 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:57.699
 here 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:05:03.249
 you can lift the blade and pull it off 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:06.939
 then carefully introduce it to you now 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:11.839
 must sit here nicely in the not in there 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:14.080
 and then you can go to the back 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.080
 pull 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.070
 then control yes that suits 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.250
 lift off 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.550
 there 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.660
 Look that they are beautiful in the need 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.660
 is that fits 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.580
 and behind and always looks that yours 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.199
 finger away are cut from that 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.440
 you slip off because here they are 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:54.330
 not pointing in the direction of the cutting edge 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:06:09.960
 Again, you can always get the blade 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:12.419
 Beautifully stand out and pure when you look at them 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:17.360
 want to trade again or use 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:19.560
 want to see that it is precisely what 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.740
 and then to the control 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:27.960
 look here if the blade really 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:30.770

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:59.580

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:10.830
