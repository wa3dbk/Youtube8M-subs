00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
them for others it might be more of a

them for others it might be more of a
struggle<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.769> framework<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.639> there<00:02:49.049> they<00:02:50.049> can

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
struggle the framework is there they can

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.509 
struggle the framework is there they can
pick<00:02:50.439> up<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.829> book<00:02:51.099> and<00:02:53.220> structure<00:02:54.220> their

and so it's helped everyone quickly be

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.030 
and so it's helped everyone quickly be
able<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:03.189> implement<00:03:03.579> it<00:03:03.879> successfully

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
able to implement it successfully

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.819 
able to implement it successfully

consistently school-wide we've been able
to<00:03:09.069> do<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.519> I've<00:03:09.700> noticed<00:03:10.269> the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
to do it and I've noticed the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.179 
to do it and I've noticed the
interactions<00:03:11.200> between<00:03:12.989> students<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.189> also

interactions are more positive I make it

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.349 
interactions are more positive I make it

what you're learning why is this

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.229 
what you're learning why is this
important<00:04:04.620> they<00:04:05.620> need<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.639> know<00:04:06.819> how<00:04:07.209> to

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
important they need to know how to

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.960 
important they need to know how to
articulate<00:04:07.989> their<00:04:08.409> learning<00:04:08.919> so<00:04:09.370> that's<00:04:09.729> one

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
rather than just for us and it's

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.600 
rather than just for us and it's
something<00:05:07.930> that<00:05:08.080> we<00:05:08.560> we<00:05:08.860> have<00:05:09.100> to<00:05:09.250> constantly

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
something that we we have to constantly

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.050 
something that we we have to constantly
work<00:05:10.419> on<00:05:10.660> that<00:05:10.930> we're<00:05:11.110> putting<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.590> lot<00:05:11.800> of

ownership on the students and so that

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
ownership on the students and so that

to take risk and you have the

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.719 
to take risk and you have the
relationships<00:05:37.450> built<00:05:38.140> learning<00:05:39.040> what<00:05:39.460> would

not<00:05:39.910> occur<00:05:40.419> and<00:05:40.660> so<00:05:41.200> I<00:05:41.560> would<00:05:41.740> tell<00:05:42.220> any

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
not occur and so I would tell any

not occur and so I would tell any
principle<00:05:43.330> that<00:05:43.510> that's<00:05:44.020> what<00:05:44.470> will<00:05:45.220> you

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
principle that that's what will you

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.550 
principle that that's what will you
think<00:05:45.370> about<00:05:45.729> trying<00:05:46.450> to<00:05:46.810> raise<00:05:46.990> your<00:05:47.289> test

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
think about trying to raise your test

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.440 
think about trying to raise your test
scores<00:05:47.890> and<00:05:48.039> all<00:05:48.310> the<00:05:48.520> requirements<00:05:48.970> that

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
scores and all the requirements that

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.140 
scores and all the requirements that
won't<00:05:50.050> happen<00:05:50.380> if<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:51.160> students<00:05:51.669> aren't<00:05:51.880> able

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
won't happen if the students aren't able

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.680 
won't happen if the students aren't able
to<00:05:52.390> take<00:05:53.050> risk<00:05:53.500> our<00:05:53.890> students<00:05:54.760> want<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.419> do

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
to take risk our students want to do

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.370
