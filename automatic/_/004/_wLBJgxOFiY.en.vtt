the<00:00:17.609> series<00:00:18.060> tom<00:00:18.920> was<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.010> video<00:00:20.279> editor<00:00:20.460> at

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the series tom was a video editor at

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.880 
the series tom was a video editor at
this<00:00:20.850> time<00:00:21.060> he<00:00:21.270> could<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.680> visuals<00:00:22.680> while

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
this time he could do the visuals while

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.620 
this time he could do the visuals while
handed<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> words<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> rest<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> history

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
handed the words and the rest is history

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.450 
handed the words and the rest is history

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
so that's why the YouTube page is Mike

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700 
so that's why the YouTube page is Mike

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
but i remember recording this and for

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.190 
but i remember recording this and for
some<00:01:11.250> reason<00:01:11.280> i<00:01:11.880> did<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> entire<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:12.689> like

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
some reason i did the entire thing like

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
some reason i did the entire thing like
anyone<00:01:13.619> take<00:01:13.860> even<00:01:14.490> though<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.030> i'm<00:01:15.299> very

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
anyone take even though if it's i'm very

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.240 
anyone take even though if it's i'm very
stilted<00:01:15.840> that's<00:01:16.200> why<00:01:16.380> i<00:01:16.619> think<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
stilted that's why i think what the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.760 
stilted that's why i think what the
content<00:01:17.729> sounds<00:01:18.030> fine<00:01:18.530> because<00:01:19.530> i<00:01:19.560> had<00:01:19.710> this

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
content sounds fine because i had this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.020
