00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
you know so but their success didn't

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.979 
you know so but their success didn't
really<00:03:56.949> start<00:03:57.819> picking<00:03:58.150> up<00:03:58.269> even<00:03:58.569> more<00:03:58.689> steam

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
really start picking up even more steam

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.379 
really start picking up even more steam
until<00:03:59.319> they<00:03:59.469> got<00:03:59.620> jrn<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.579> Iman<00:04:00.969> over<00:04:01.239> there

so<00:04:01.629> I<00:04:01.840> can't<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:02.709> mean<00:04:03.069> I<00:04:03.340> think<00:04:03.729> LeBron<00:04:04.419> is<00:04:04.629> in

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
so I can't I mean I think LeBron is in

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.789 
so I can't I mean I think LeBron is in
the<00:04:04.930> discussion<00:04:05.500> over<00:04:05.889> Westbrook<00:04:06.459> but<00:04:07.060> I

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
the discussion over Westbrook but I

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.110 
the discussion over Westbrook but I
can't<00:04:08.799> say<00:04:09.009> that<00:04:09.039> this<00:04:09.280> should<00:04:09.489> go<00:04:09.609> to<00:04:09.669> Hilson

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120
