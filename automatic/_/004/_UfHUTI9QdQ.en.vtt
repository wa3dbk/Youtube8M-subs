for one hit kills in the head is pretty

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.380 
for one hit kills in the head is pretty
low<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:31.130> 60<00:00:32.130> meters<00:00:32.550> or<00:00:32.820> something<00:00:33.210> as

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
low it's like 60 meters or something as

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.510 
low it's like 60 meters or something as
you<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.809> see<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.290> hit<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.070> guy<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
you can see here I hit this guy in the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.940 
you can see here I hit this guy in the
head<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.450> doesn't<00:00:36.750> matter<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.710> know

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
head but it doesn't matter so you know

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.590 
head but it doesn't matter so you know
there's<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> distance<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.180> where<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.540> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
there's the distance for where this is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.750 
there's the distance for where this is
actually<00:00:40.170> even<00:00:40.379> useful<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.190> pretty<00:00:41.399> much<00:00:41.520> like

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
actually even useful so pretty much like

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.270 
actually even useful so pretty much like
across<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.300> hallway<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:42.840> something<00:00:43.040> but<00:00:44.040> even

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
across the hallway or something but even

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.910 
across the hallway or something but even
then<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.629> not<00:00:45.840> very<00:00:46.200> likely<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
then you know it's not very likely to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.000 
then you know it's not very likely to
kill<00:00:47.129> them<00:00:47.370> um<00:00:48.379> it's<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.649> hard<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> hit

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
kill them um it's really hard to hit

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.279 
kill them um it's really hard to hit
people<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.969> shakes<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.809> kicks<00:00:52.079> back

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
people because it shakes and kicks back

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380 
people because it shakes and kicks back
so<00:00:52.680> much<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:53.850> hard<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> make

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
so much so it's really hard to make

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.319 
so much so it's really hard to make
follow-up<00:00:54.840> shots<00:00:54.949> because<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
follow-up shots because of that and it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.959 
follow-up shots because of that and it
also<00:00:57.600> has<00:00:57.780> kind<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.590> big<00:00:58.800> flash<00:00:59.280> that

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
also has kind of a big flash that

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
also has kind of a big flash that
obscures<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:00.690> you're<00:01:00.840> shooting<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.620> mostly

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
obscures what you're shooting but mostly

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.439 
obscures what you're shooting but mostly
it's<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> giant<00:01:02.489> shaking<00:01:02.910> thing<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.300> makes

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
it's the giant shaking thing that makes

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.520 
it's the giant shaking thing that makes
it<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.719> difficult<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.379> see

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it really difficult for you to see

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.210 
it really difficult for you to see
anything<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:06.299> close<00:01:07.040> pretty<00:01:08.040> much

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
anything so up close pretty much

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.640 
anything so up close pretty much
anything<00:01:08.880> past<00:01:09.330> maybe<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.140> little<00:01:10.290> hallway

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
anything past maybe a little hallway

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.590 
anything past maybe a little hallway
you're<00:01:11.250> gonna<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> shoot<00:01:11.820> people<00:01:11.970> three

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you're gonna have to shoot people three

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
you're gonna have to shoot people three
times<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.400> up<00:01:14.400> close<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.180> too<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:17.640> know

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
times and up close it's too but you know

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.120 
times and up close it's too but you know
it<00:01:17.880> has<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.299> has<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.479> big<00:01:18.810> hit<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it has it has a big hit to it like I

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.850 
it has it has a big hit to it like I
think<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.490> probably<00:01:20.610> 55<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.380> most<00:01:22.710> part

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
think it's probably 55 for the most part

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.039 
think it's probably 55 for the most part
going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.490> get<00:01:23.610> past<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.210> don't<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:24.630> 50

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
going to get past that I don't know 50

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.800 
going to get past that I don't know 50
meters<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.710> 40<00:01:26.100> meters<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:27.000> know<00:01:27.090> hallway

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
meters or so 40 meters you know hallway

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.800 
meters or so 40 meters you know hallway
you're<00:01:28.650> gonna<00:01:28.740> go<00:01:28.950> down<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.579> 35<00:01:30.450> or

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you're gonna go down to like 35 or

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.749 
you're gonna go down to like 35 or
something<00:01:31.140> where<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.579> take<00:01:32.579> three

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
something where it's going to take three

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.149 
something where it's going to take three
hits<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.210> kill<00:01:33.240> someone<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:34.680> hard<00:01:34.979> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
hits to kill someone it's really hard to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.760 
hits to kill someone it's really hard to
use<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.729> run<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.119> gun<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:36.420> all<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.200> really

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
use it run and gun at all so I really

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.289 
use it run and gun at all so I really
don't<00:01:37.860> recommend<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:39.150> this

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
don't recommend that because just this

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.450 
don't recommend that because just this
huge<00:01:39.659> shake<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:40.770> sometimes<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.280> seems

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
huge shake and then sometimes it seems

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.130 
huge shake and then sometimes it seems
like<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> bullets<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:42.090> even<00:01:42.390> hit<00:01:42.630> with

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
like the bullets don't even hit with

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.060 
like the bullets don't even hit with
this<00:01:43.290> gun<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:45.290> honestly<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.619> more<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
this gun and honestly this is more of a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.330 
this gun and honestly this is more of a
sort<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.270> DMR<00:01:49.110> version<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.920> pistol

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
sort of like a DMR version of a pistol

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.539 
sort of like a DMR version of a pistol
where<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.939> want<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.479> kind<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.290> close<00:01:52.680> but

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
where you want to be kind of close but

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.880 
where you want to be kind of close but
not<00:01:53.700> too<00:01:53.759> close<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.140> far<00:01:55.320> away<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.770> not

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
not too close kind of far away but not

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.889 
not too close kind of far away but not
too<00:01:56.130> far<00:01:56.369> away<00:01:56.399> there's<00:01:57.180> kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.600> little

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
too far away there's kind of a little

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.359 
too far away there's kind of a little
middle<00:01:58.560> ground<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.950> you're<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.310> be

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
middle ground that you're going to be

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.940 
middle ground that you're going to be
using<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.729> thing<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.270> since<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> shakes<00:02:01.680> so

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
using this thing and since it shakes so

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.679 
using this thing and since it shakes so
much<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:02.790> difficult<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.509> land

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
much it's really difficult to land

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.649 
much it's really difficult to land
headshots<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.439> anyone<00:02:04.799> ever<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.030> think

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
headshots and anyone ever so I think

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.660 
headshots and anyone ever so I think
when<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.229> comes<00:02:07.439> down<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.160> pistol

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
when it comes down to it this pistol

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.999 
when it comes down to it this pistol
isn't<00:02:08.879> very<00:02:09.209> good<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:09.629> all<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:10.020> normal<00:02:10.410> because

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
isn't very good at all in normal because

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.510 
isn't very good at all in normal because
it's<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:13.379> skill<00:02:13.709> level<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:14.190> pretty

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
it's just it's the skill level is pretty

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.320 
it's just it's the skill level is pretty
much<00:02:14.760> unattainable<00:02:15.360> it's<00:02:16.370> like<00:02:17.370> how<00:02:17.520> often

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
much unattainable it's like how often

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.790 
much unattainable it's like how often
are<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.720> going<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.080> try<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.290> hit<00:02:19.470> people<00:02:19.739> in

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
are you going to try and hit people in

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.250 
are you going to try and hit people in
the<00:02:19.830> head<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:20.819> maybe<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.780> first<00:02:22.020> shot

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
the head and then maybe the first shot

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.110 
the head and then maybe the first shot
your<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.709> can<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:23.099> but<00:02:23.340> any<00:02:23.610> follow-up<00:02:24.060> shots

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
your you can do but any follow-up shots

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.020 
your you can do but any follow-up shots
are<00:02:24.690> just<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.709> little<00:02:25.920> monkey<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.610> like

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
jumping up and down in here your your

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.130 
jumping up and down in here your your
screen<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.280> there's<00:02:29.940> really<00:02:30.060> no<00:02:30.300> hope<00:02:30.599> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
screen and there's really no hope you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.270 
screen and there's really no hope you
know<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.319> might<00:02:31.530> as<00:02:31.620> well<00:02:31.739> close<00:02:31.920> your<00:02:32.160> eyes

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
know you might as well close your eyes

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.540 
know you might as well close your eyes
randomly<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.480> you've<00:02:34.200> never<00:02:34.349> but<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:35.099> good<00:02:35.430> as

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
randomly and you've never but as good as

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.369 
randomly and you've never but as good as
chance<00:02:35.819> is<00:02:36.030> trying<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.390> make<00:02:36.750> multiple<00:02:36.959> shots

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
chance is trying to make multiple shots

chance is trying to make multiple shots
with<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.800> whistle<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.459> pistol<00:02:38.819> isn't<00:02:39.060> that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
with this whistle this pistol isn't that

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.150 
with this whistle this pistol isn't that
great<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:40.019> honestly<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.560> wouldn't<00:02:40.739> use<00:02:41.010> this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
great so honestly I wouldn't use this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.949 
great so honestly I wouldn't use this
pistol<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.700> normal<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.450> mediocre

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
pistol and normal it's just mediocre

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.949 
pistol and normal it's just mediocre
compared<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.879> m9<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.720> other

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
compared to like the m9 and other

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.440 
compared to like the m9 and other
pistols<00:02:46.440> all<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.340> really<00:02:47.519> can<00:02:47.790> do<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.239> finish

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
pistols all it really can do is finish

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
pistols all it really can do is finish
off<00:02:48.690> people<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.140> are<00:02:49.260> injured<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.950> that's

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
off people that are injured and that's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.830 
off people that are injured and that's
the<00:02:50.340> really<00:02:50.610> likely<00:02:50.910> scenario<00:02:51.510> that's<00:02:51.629> going

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
the really likely scenario that's going

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.050 
the really likely scenario that's going
to<00:02:51.900> happen<00:02:52.050> ever<00:02:52.349> I<00:02:52.620> would<00:02:53.069> stay<00:02:53.310> with<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.610> m9

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
to happen ever I would stay with the m9

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.950 
to happen ever I would stay with the m9
