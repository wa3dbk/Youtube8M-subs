00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:49.280

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.900
 redwood because he is he is going to be strong 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.900
 frankly I deserved and it's even 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.420
 worst suffocates under the name so the most 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.140

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.440
 robust number on October 15 the road that 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.440

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.260
 I could go out so obviously I 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.260
 no 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.379
 so I'll have to go see no 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:34.709
 I did not ask their champion whose 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.709
 number of deceased 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.620
 it's kind of squeezed yeah we get it 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.010
 do not ask him to have 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:52.400
 speed of having defense the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:54.360
 speed has very good good ah yes 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.980
 especially not falling on caterpillar 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:04.290
 now because I 'll look con 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:06.650
 which i am here my beautiful arrco but 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.650
 that's not a reason 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:15.180
 so yes I will fight a little but 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:20.970
 excuse me are sunday to do 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.770
 the adventured and you will understand that age 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.900
 advanced so that's why I'm doing 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.900
 not very random meetings 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.690
 and I will not do it I will try 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.630
 to do as little as possible while 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.880
 simply because of 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.830
 because I have no cayrol pot because 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.380
 that frankly I feel good as he 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.400
 must have had a hard time having a 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.690
 cat nor fast enough because me 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.900
 remember that when I struggled with 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.730
 eggs and all that goes after I have one and 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.970
 after jean do not know how much the 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:05.970
 following level 6 super super super and I 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.230
 know he already told me that we end the game 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.070
 I do some started with 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:18.180
 this one is just the exact counterpart 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.180
 we shiny judicial in capturing years 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:37.949
 hop to blah blah blah blah let go with 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:39.719
 the blabla not the schl to slash the happiness 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:43.199
 from the beginning of adventurous yet it's not the 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:45.029
 worst the worst I had was / 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.370
 soul silver makes the video she is 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.719
 sitting fairly easy to do there are 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.150
 a lot a lot of blah just for 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.740
 go in a grass so again 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.659
 we are going to say that it is reasonable 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.520
 and it's not the stones and aims is 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.770
 it's true that what I find 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.379
 stupid in fact is that with this one 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.879
 in fact it is with soul silver gold 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.139
 they did that the pokÃ©mons were 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.389
 visible from the time the bowls so 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.759
 it was absolutely, but I do not know if that 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.740
 lies I passed by a 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:13.439
 tax so fire and to a govou shiny I 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.259
 know nothing at all I think it's 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:17.789
 pity 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:21.620
 So So here I have not done 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.620
 meetings no blah blah blah 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.090
 so suddenly I just offered 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.950
 stopped I do not have to do the fight in 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.150
 whole because it's fighting in 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.150
 general that a long time ago at the beginning 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:54.090
 okay and a chill they're cool 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:55.650
 me no but really too classy for 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.650
 the little stars of tarn and more 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.150
