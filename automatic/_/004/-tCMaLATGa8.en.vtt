to<00:06:46.520> explain<00:06:46.849> because<00:06:47.150> the<00:06:47.419> logic<00:06:47.750> at<00:06:47.840> poles

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
to explain because the logic at poles

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.719 
to explain because the logic at poles
it's<00:06:48.289> somewhere<00:06:48.650> between<00:06:48.710> here<00:06:49.490> and

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:49.729 
it's somewhere between here and

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:51.489 
it's somewhere between here and
seven<00:06:49.909> alternate<00:06:50.270> dimensions<00:06:50.779> I<00:06:50.990> will<00:06:51.319> say

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:51.499 
seven alternate dimensions I will say

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:53.529 
seven alternate dimensions I will say
that<00:06:51.650> I<00:06:51.680> enjoyed<00:06:52.129> no<00:06:52.309> game<00:06:52.550> no<00:06:52.580> life<00:06:52.729> it<00:06:53.300> took<00:06:53.449> a

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
that I enjoyed no game no life it took a

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.269 
that I enjoyed no game no life it took a
couple<00:06:53.659> episodes<00:06:54.139> to<00:06:54.319> hook<00:06:54.499> me<00:06:54.710> but<00:06:54.919> overall<00:06:55.159> I

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:55.279 
couple episodes to hook me but overall I

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:56.709 
couple episodes to hook me but overall I
can't<00:06:55.520> wait<00:06:55.669> to<00:06:55.759> see<00:06:55.909> what<00:06:56.059> they<00:06:56.150> do<00:06:56.210> next

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:56.719 
can't wait to see what they do next

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:58.749 
can't wait to see what they do next
I<00:06:56.749> wager<00:06:57.139> it'll<00:06:57.499> be<00:06:57.559> something<00:06:57.860> simple<00:06:58.159> but<00:06:58.639> it

00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 
I wager it'll be something simple but it

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:00.969 
I wager it'll be something simple but it
will<00:06:58.879> be<00:06:59.059> grand<00:06:59.449> through<00:06:59.960> the<00:07:00.080> nth<00:07:00.259> degree

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
will be grand through the nth degree

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.070 
will be grand through the nth degree
cards<00:07:01.909> are<00:07:02.029> on<00:07:02.120> the<00:07:02.150> table<00:07:02.360> no<00:07:02.659> game<00:07:02.870> no<00:07:02.900> life

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
cards are on the table no game no life

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:23.550 
cards are on the table no game no life
let's<00:07:03.499> see<00:07:03.680> what<00:07:03.800> you<00:07:03.889> can<00:07:04.039> do<00:07:04.159> a<00:07:04.599> Shantae

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560
