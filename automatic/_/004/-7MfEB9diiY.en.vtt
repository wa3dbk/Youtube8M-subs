00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:09.810
 when we have a motorola of kilos 25 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.840
 motorola x 226 x 118 or one percent x 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.510
 worthy of leaving fails when checking h 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.330
 w is because he has a problem with the 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.189
 touch and then we're going to have several 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.730
 options one is to look if you are doing 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.249
 good contact another is that fort humidity 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.230
 contacts have been sulfated and three 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.999
 that in this case it was by a blow the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.310
 touch was damaged and stopped sending the 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.020
 information and when the cell phone turned on 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.240
 the software detects that it is not 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.240
 connected in this case he thinks not 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.440
 is connected that this year the membrane 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.690
 then it will exhaust this error then 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.670
 that mistake when we already know us 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.500
 let's suddenly put this 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.150
 possibility in something else but that we 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.480
 let's concentrate what it has to do 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.820
 with the tows in case this does not come out 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.200
 fail we can replace it and get the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.200
 solution in this case 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:06.239
 to the soft heat 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.239
 for the glue to come off 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.110
 perform 200 temperature and be 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.630
 pending not going to win the the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.630
 plastic covering that is said 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.649
 in this case it is totally damaged but 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.509
 there are many times that it is tactile though 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.939
 this match works then we can 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.819
 take care of it in case it happened to me that 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.740
 some spare parts are defective 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.039
 factory and people want to be it 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.909
 let's leave like he had brought it then 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.469
 let's go here now 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.469
 to install the new touch 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.520
 it has no science 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.810
 and let's see if you can not see the error 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.650
 and there we see that the error is no longer 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.510
 that came out right now and then 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.680
 we would perform the other functions 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.120
 service arauca technical service 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.120
 professional in mobile telephony
