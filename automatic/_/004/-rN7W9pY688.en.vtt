 commercialization 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.910
 how to deploy using the agroecological quintall 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.020
 Let's check 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.949
 the ecological retardation is a space reserved for the lack of the garden 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.950
 what the producer may lack are the fruits 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.090
 is to grab them sometimes 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.610

 increased its 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.700
 why then agroecological 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.700

 part of this capital can be isolated to increase the area of ​​creation of the 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
 chickens 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.620
 on the other hand that the producer can prepare the compost 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.090
 using this contrast in addition each day 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.190
 available on the property 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.150
 everything transformed into fertilizer to be used in the gardens 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.310
 on the other hand what is not used for consultation or commercialization I have 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.640
 used to feed the chickens 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640

 women considered at risk 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.610
 consequently 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.440
 is the least cost 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.480
