00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060 

so<00:00:00.599> what<00:00:00.750> we<00:00:00.870> did<00:00:00.989> was<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.319> neat<00:00:01.560> experiment

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
so what we did was a neat experiment

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.610 
so what we did was a neat experiment
kinda<00:00:02.310> really<00:00:02.629> showcasing<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:04.020> capability

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
kinda really showcasing the capability

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.889 
kinda really showcasing the capability
of<00:00:04.670> using<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:05.879> advanced<00:00:06.270> technology<00:00:06.720> and

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
of using this advanced technology and

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.230 
of using this advanced technology and
the<00:00:07.529> objective<00:00:07.950> here<00:00:08.130> was<00:00:08.370> within<00:00:08.730> like<00:00:09.059> 10

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
the objective here was within like 10

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.970 
the objective here was within like 10
minutes<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.660> wanted<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.050> be<00:00:10.139> able<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.380> drop

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
minutes we wanted to be able to drop

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.100 
minutes we wanted to be able to drop
through<00:00:11.190> robot<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.580> water<00:00:11.790> have<00:00:12.780> it

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
through robot in the water have it

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.320 
through robot in the water have it
figure<00:00:13.740> out<00:00:13.799> where<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.219> relative<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.179> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
figure out where it is relative to the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.470 
figure out where it is relative to the
the<00:00:16.020> map<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.440> had<00:00:17.039> built<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.490> May<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.940> then

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the map that had built in May and then

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.390 
the map that had built in May and then
drive<00:00:18.750> back<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.500> an<00:00:19.800> interesting<00:00:20.250> feature

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
drive back to an interesting feature

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.370 
drive back to an interesting feature
that<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.760> identified<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> hull<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.199> our

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that we identified on the hull from our

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.550 
that we identified on the hull from our
may<00:00:22.769> experience<00:00:23.900> what<00:00:24.900> we're<00:00:25.050> trying<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.320> do

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
may experience what we're trying to do

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.550 
may experience what we're trying to do
is<00:00:25.920> develop<00:00:26.430> robotic<00:00:27.000> systems<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:28.109> able

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
is develop robotic systems that are able

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.880 
is develop robotic systems that are able
to<00:00:29.300> autonomously<00:00:30.300> map<00:00:30.599> ship<00:00:31.289> hulls<00:00:31.500> while

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
to autonomously map ship hulls while

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.549 
to autonomously map ship hulls while
they're<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.399> port<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.210> specific<00:00:34.079> problem

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
they're in port for the specific problem

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.860 
they're in port for the specific problem
of<00:00:34.800> limpet<00:00:35.340> mines<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.600> something<00:00:36.840> that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
of limpet mines this is something that

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.690 
of limpet mines this is something that
traditionally<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.890> would<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.129> by<00:00:38.399> using

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
traditionally you would do by using

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.729 
traditionally you would do by using
human<00:00:38.969> divers<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> dangerous

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
human divers but it can be a dangerous

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.680 
human divers but it can be a dangerous
and<00:00:40.950> complex<00:00:41.219> environment<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.270> our<00:00:42.329> human<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and complex environment for our human to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
and complex environment for our human to
be<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.870> especially<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.350> we're<00:00:43.590> talking<00:00:43.710> within

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
be in especially if we're talking within

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.069 
be in especially if we're talking within
minds<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.850> might<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.180> placed<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> hull

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
minds that might be placed on the hull

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.069 
minds that might be placed on the hull
and<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> idea<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.250> how<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:48.079> remove

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and so the idea is how you can remove

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.389 
and so the idea is how you can remove
the<00:00:50.039> human<00:00:50.700> from<00:00:51.120> being<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:51.809> risk<00:00:52.050> by<00:00:52.440> having<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the human from being at risk by having a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.439 
the human from being at risk by having a
robotic<00:00:53.730> system<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.149> this

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
robotic system do this

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.510 
robotic system do this
so<00:00:54.960> by<00:00:55.289> equipping<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> robot<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.399> these

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
so by equipping the robot with these

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.250 
so by equipping the robot with these
camera<00:00:56.820> systems<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.449> we're<00:00:57.600> able<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.050> is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
camera systems what we're able to do is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.200 
camera systems what we're able to do is
is<00:00:58.469> such<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.710> allow<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> robot<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.430> navigate

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
is such a allow the robot to navigate

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000 
is such a allow the robot to navigate
much<00:01:00.420> more<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.899> or<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> human

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
much more like you or I do as a human

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.170 
much more like you or I do as a human
and<00:01:02.250> since<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.820> use<00:01:02.850> visual

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and since that it can use visual

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.740 
and since that it can use visual
information<00:01:03.949> to<00:01:04.949> recognize<00:01:05.549> places<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
information to recognize places on the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.539 
information to recognize places on the
ship<00:01:07.229> hull<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.560> seen<00:01:07.860> before<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.400> what

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
ship hull that is seen before it so what

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.730 
ship hull that is seen before it so what
we<00:01:08.580> did<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:08.880> deployed<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> robot<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:10.439> May

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
we did is we deployed the robot in May

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.940 
we did is we deployed the robot in May
of<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.310> year<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.600> USS<00:01:12.960> Saratoga<00:01:13.080> which

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
of this year on the USS Saratoga which

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
of this year on the USS Saratoga which
is<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> decommissioned<00:01:14.520> aircraft<00:01:14.820> carrier

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
is a decommissioned aircraft carrier

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.789 
is a decommissioned aircraft carrier
using<00:01:15.930> our<00:01:16.049> algorithms<00:01:16.439> were<00:01:16.530> able<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
using our algorithms were able to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.280 
using our algorithms were able to
basically<00:01:17.009> build<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.790> high<00:01:18.479> fidelity<00:01:18.750> kind

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
basically build this high fidelity kind

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.679 
basically build this high fidelity kind
of<00:01:19.350> three-dimensional<00:01:19.700> map<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:21.090> represents

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
of three-dimensional map that represents

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.060 
of three-dimensional map that represents
kind<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> blow<00:01:22.229> water<00:01:22.380> portion<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
kind of the blow water portion of the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.340 
kind of the blow water portion of the
ship<00:01:23.250> whole<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.509> several<00:01:24.900> months<00:01:25.049> later

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
ship whole and then several months later

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.780 
ship whole and then several months later
in<00:01:25.530> August<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.979> dropped<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> robot<00:01:26.520> back<00:01:26.670> in

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
in August we dropped the robot back in

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.399 
in August we dropped the robot back in
the<00:01:26.850> water<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.450> me<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.810> oh<00:01:27.960> hey<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the water and it me like oh hey I

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
the water and it me like oh hey I
recognize<00:01:28.650> I've<00:01:29.159> been<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.610> whole<00:01:29.759> before

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
recognize I've been on this whole before

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.060 
recognize I've been on this whole before
I<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.360> where<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.659> exactly<00:01:30.930> where<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.259> am<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
I know where I exactly where I am and I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.620 
I know where I exactly where I am and I
was<00:01:32.189> able<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.460> snap<00:01:32.909> itself<00:01:33.210> back<00:01:33.360> into<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
was able to snap itself back into that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
was able to snap itself back into that
map<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.170> immediately<00:01:34.710> drive<00:01:35.070> back<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
map and then immediately drive back to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.620 
map and then immediately drive back to
an<00:01:36.509> interesting<00:01:36.930> feature<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.710> hull

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.970 

one<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.810> kind<00:01:44.050> of<00:01:44.110> cool<00:01:44.290> things<00:01:44.530> about<00:01:44.710> the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
one of the kind of cool things about the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.500 
one of the kind of cool things about the
technology<00:01:45.460> we've<00:01:45.580> been<00:01:45.730> developing<00:01:45.940> is<00:01:46.330> that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
technology we've been developing is that

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.870 
technology we've been developing is that
if<00:01:46.660> you<00:01:46.750> really<00:01:47.020> wanted<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.710> wrap<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.340> holdfast

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
if you really wanted to wrap a holdfast

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.850 
if you really wanted to wrap a holdfast
the<00:01:49.810> way<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:49.990> would<00:01:50.170> do<00:01:50.260> it<00:01:50.290> is<00:01:50.470> not<00:01:50.620> with<00:01:50.830> a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
the way you would do it is not with a

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.590 
the way you would do it is not with a
single<00:01:51.190> robot<00:01:51.340> but<00:01:51.700> with<00:01:51.820> multiple<00:01:52.030> robots

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
single robot but with multiple robots

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.540 
single robot but with multiple robots
all<00:01:52.840> at<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.020> same<00:01:53.140> time<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:54.070> I<00:01:54.520> think

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
all at the same time so I think

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.390 
all at the same time so I think
ultimately<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:56.470> future<00:01:56.620> application<00:01:57.250> of

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
ultimately the future application of

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.250 
ultimately the future application of
this<00:01:57.610> for<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:57.940> Navy<00:01:58.120> would<00:01:58.390> be<00:01:58.540> not<00:01:58.750> just<00:01:58.780> a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
this for the Navy would be not just a

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.800 
this for the Navy would be not just a
single<00:01:59.740> robot<00:02:00.190> that<00:02:00.430> is<00:02:00.490> being<00:02:01.330> used<00:02:01.510> to<00:02:01.630> map<00:02:01.780> a

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
single robot that is being used to map a

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.660 
single robot that is being used to map a
ship<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.260> probably<00:02:02.500> teams<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:03.070> robots<00:02:03.160> all

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
ship of probably teams of robots all

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.550 
ship of probably teams of robots all
working<00:02:04.300> collectively<00:02:04.330> together<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.290> do<00:02:05.410> this

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
working collectively together to do this

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.030 
working collectively together to do this
the<00:02:06.280> real<00:02:06.520> kind<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.790> growth<00:02:06.970> area<00:02:07.330> for<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:07.720> is

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
the real kind of growth area for this is

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.560 
the real kind of growth area for this is
commercial<00:02:09.040> applications<00:02:09.850> of<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.270> how<00:02:10.509> do

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
commercial applications of this how do

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.230 
commercial applications of this how do
we<00:02:10.720> assess<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.830> quality<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.730> hull<00:02:12.940> is

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
we assess the quality of the hull is

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.910 
we assess the quality of the hull is
there<00:02:13.480> any<00:02:13.600> damage<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.230> ship<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.650> there

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
there any damage to the ship is there

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.340 
there any damage to the ship is there
any<00:02:15.070> bile<00:02:15.340> growth<00:02:16.030> on<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.450> ship<00:02:16.660> there's<00:02:17.290> a

any bile growth on the ship there's a

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.170 
any bile growth on the ship there's a
lot<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.709> growth<00:02:17.920> area<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.760> terms<00:02:18.790> of
