as possible but if anything does stand

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.709 
as possible but if anything does stand

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
but mental state and my opinion should

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.470 
but mental state and my opinion should
only<00:01:01.260> go<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:01.859> when<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.789> kill<00:01:03.059> other<00:01:03.239> players

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it should not matter when you kill

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.250 
it should not matter when you kill
pedestrians<00:01:05.430> or<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.420> run<00:01:06.659> into<00:01:06.869> their<00:01:06.990> cars

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
close to it so that definitely needs to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.490 
close to it so that definitely needs to
be<00:01:24.299> changed<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.840> next<00:01:25.080> thing<00:01:25.229> which<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500

pretty simple fix I would like to see
the<00:01:27.990> attack<00:01:28.380> priority<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.310> only<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.970> just

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the attack priority not only on just

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.899 
the attack priority not only on just
friends<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.650> where<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
friends but have it's where I can put it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
friends but have it's where I can put it
low<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.689> crew<00:01:34.500> members<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:34.950> well<00:01:34.979> because

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
low on crew members as well because

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
low on crew members as well because
sometimes<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.390> know<00:01:36.479> crew<00:01:36.720> members<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.110> don't

sometimes you know crew members I don't

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.690 
sometimes you know crew members I don't
have<00:01:37.380> enough<00:01:37.799> spots<00:01:38.070> my<00:01:38.220> friends<00:01:38.549> list

beating<00:01:47.460> people<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.000> accident<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
beating people up on accident and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
beating people up on accident and
killing<00:01:49.200> them<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.470> stuff<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.100> having<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
killing them and stuff so having a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.550 
killing them and stuff so having a
attack<00:01:51.149> priority<00:01:51.689> option<00:01:52.049> four<00:01:52.320> crew<00:01:52.530> members

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
attack priority option four crew members

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.219 
attack priority option four crew members
as<00:01:52.950> well<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.670> would<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.149> cool<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
as well that would be really cool one of

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.209 
as well that would be really cool one of
the<00:01:55.290> big<00:01:55.439> ones<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.740> I've<00:01:55.860> been<00:01:55.979> saying<00:01:56.159> this

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the big ones and I've been saying this

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.850 
the big ones and I've been saying this
for<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> while<00:01:56.670> passive<00:01:57.659> mode<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.110> think<00:01:58.740> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
for a while passive mode I think it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.249 
for a while passive mode I think it
needs<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.310> changed<00:01:59.549> with<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.600> good<00:02:00.869> idea<00:02:01.200> i

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
needs to be changed with a good idea i

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
needs to be changed with a good idea i
saw<00:02:01.649> i<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.920> remember<00:02:02.040> where<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.610> somebody

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
saw i can remember where but somebody

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.510 
saw i can remember where but somebody
mentioned<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.350> they<00:02:04.710> could<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:04.979> passive

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
mentioned that they could do passive

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.869 
mentioned that they could do passive
mode<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:07.020> non-contact<00:02:07.890> races<00:02:08.429> they<00:02:08.729> can

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
mode like the non-contact races they can

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.100 
mode like the non-contact races they can
make<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> where<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.360> were<00:02:09.569> transparent

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
make it to where you were transparent

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.380 
make it to where you were transparent
like<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> nine<00:02:10.860> contact<00:02:11.340> races<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.879> that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
like in the nine contact races and that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.460 
like in the nine contact races and that
would<00:02:12.510> fix<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.900> issue

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
would fix the issue

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.260 
would fix the issue
people<00:02:13.800> running<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.250> over<00:02:14.400> with<00:02:14.640> cars<00:02:14.940> while

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
people running you over with cars while

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.780 
people running you over with cars while
you're<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.480> passive<00:02:15.840> mode<00:02:15.870> now<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.950> personally

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
you're in passive mode now I personally

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.000 
you're in passive mode now I personally
think<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.750> passive<00:02:19.260> mode<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.590> should<00:02:19.860> be

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
think that in passive mode you should be

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.680 
think that in passive mode you should be
able<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.370> use<00:02:20.520> guns<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:21.240> not<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.540> other

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
able to use guns just not on other

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.930 
able to use guns just not on other
players<00:02:21.930> but<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.920> don't<00:02:23.130> know<00:02:23.220> if<00:02:23.520> it's<00:02:23.760> like

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
players but I don't know if it's like

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.080 
players but I don't know if it's like
how<00:02:24.540> easy<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.320> do<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:26.700> i<00:02:26.760> think<00:02:27.000> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
how easy that is to do but i think a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.080 
how easy that is to do but i think a
start<00:02:27.480> would<00:02:27.840> be<00:02:27.870> having<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:29.090> transparent

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
start would be having that transparent

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.420 
start would be having that transparent
non-contact<00:02:30.960> mode<00:02:31.050> for<00:02:31.560> your<00:02:31.680> character<00:02:32.190> in

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
non-contact mode for your character in

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.090 
non-contact mode for your character in
passive<00:02:33.060> mode<00:02:33.090> hopefully<00:02:33.870> rockstar<00:02:34.350> will<00:02:34.680> do

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
passive mode hopefully rockstar will do

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.370 
passive mode hopefully rockstar will do
something<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:35.880> because<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.990> is<00:02:37.110> really

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
something with that because it is really

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.750 
something with that because it is really
annoying<00:02:37.620> when<00:02:37.740> people<00:02:38.040> run<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.370> over<00:02:38.400> and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
annoying when people run you over and

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.030 
annoying when people run you over and
you<00:02:38.790> have<00:02:38.970> no<00:02:39.390> way<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.630> defend<00:02:39.810> yourself<00:02:40.170> going

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you have no way to defend yourself going

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.340 
you have no way to defend yourself going
off<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.280> non-contact<00:02:42.150> races<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.750> would<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:43.260> to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
off of non-contact races I would like to

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.020 
off of non-contact races I would like to
see<00:02:43.590> those<00:02:43.770> races<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.490> little<00:02:44.760> bit<00:02:44.880> more

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
see those races have a little bit more

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.180 
see those races have a little bit more
options<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:45.750> don't<00:02:46.200> know<00:02:46.290> how<00:02:46.470> difficult<00:02:46.740> it

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
options I don't know how difficult it

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.190 
options I don't know how difficult it
would<00:02:47.250> be<00:02:47.430> since<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.150> cars<00:02:48.360> are<00:02:48.600> transparent

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
would be since the cars are transparent

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.500 
would be since the cars are transparent
but<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.470> can't<00:02:49.740> slip<00:02:50.070> stream<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.550> ketchup<00:02:51.150> is

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
but you can't slip stream and ketchup is

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.990 
but you can't slip stream and ketchup is
on<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.140> non-transparent<00:02:52.740> or<00:02:53.100> non-contact

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
on and non-transparent or non-contact

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.420 
on and non-transparent or non-contact
races<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:54.990> can<00:02:55.110> turn<00:02:55.380> those<00:02:55.890> options

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
races so if we can turn those options

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.390 
races so if we can turn those options
off<00:02:56.580> than<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.260> know<00:02:58.290> kid<00:02:58.770> help<00:02:59.010> out<00:02:59.160> some

off than that you know kid help out some

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.190 
off than that you know kid help out some
people<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.880> don't<00:03:00.120> want<00:03:00.209> ketchups<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:01.080> know<00:03:01.170> a

do and some of this other stuff we have

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.020 
do and some of this other stuff we have
to<00:03:55.709> wait<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.220> long<00:03:56.250> just<00:03:56.730> for<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.970> be

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
to wait so long just for it to be

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.460 
to wait so long just for it to be
daytime<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.600> then<00:03:57.720> if<00:03:57.810> it's<00:03:57.930> daytime<00:03:58.260> it

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
daytime and then if it's daytime it

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.630 
daytime and then if it's daytime it
might<00:03:58.590> be<00:03:58.709> raining<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.220> we<00:03:59.280> gotta<00:03:59.430> wait<00:03:59.489> even

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
might be raining so we gotta wait even

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.759 
might be raining so we gotta wait even
longer<00:03:59.730> it<00:04:00.690> would<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:00.900> make<00:04:01.049> life<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:01.709> much

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
longer it would just make life so much

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.190 
longer it would just make life so much
easier<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.970> know<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.360> don't<00:04:03.570> know<00:04:03.780> again

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
easier and you know I don't know again

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.810 
easier and you know I don't know again
how<00:04:04.230> easy<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.100> do<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:05.430> maybe<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.790> your

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
how easy that is to do but maybe in your

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.580 
how easy that is to do but maybe in your
interactions<00:04:06.239> menu<00:04:06.840> they<00:04:06.959> could<00:04:07.140> add<00:04:07.320> just<00:04:07.560> a

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
interactions menu they could add just a

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.229 
interactions menu they could add just a
little<00:04:07.620> switch<00:04:07.980> right<00:04:08.010> there<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:09.000> then<00:04:09.120> these

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
little switch right there and then these

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.390 
little switch right there and then these
last<00:04:09.510> two<00:04:09.660> things<00:04:09.900> or<00:04:10.110> kind<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.560> reaches<00:04:11.220> as

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
last two things or kind of reaches as

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.979 
last two things or kind of reaches as
well<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:12.030> know<00:04:12.120> i'm<00:04:12.239> not<00:04:12.420> expecting<00:04:12.720> these

well you know i'm not expecting these
but<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.380> would<00:04:13.470> be<00:04:13.500> really<00:04:13.680> neat<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.950> add<00:04:14.130> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
but it would be really neat to add the
