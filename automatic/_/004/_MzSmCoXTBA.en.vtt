then we came out of pit road and I knew

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.250 
then we came out of pit road and I knew
we're<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.630> bottom<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.140> bottom

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
we're on the bottom and the bottom

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.320 
we're on the bottom and the bottom
hadn't<00:02:58.590> been<00:02:58.680> doing<00:02:58.800> very<00:02:59.070> good<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.550> we

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
hadn't been doing very good and we

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.360 
hadn't been doing very good and we
surprised<00:03:00.630> got<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.990> lead<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.380> we<00:03:02.280> were

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
surprised got the lead and we were

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.740 
surprised got the lead and we were
really<00:03:02.610> good<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.850> run<00:03:03.000> before<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.420> last<00:03:03.570> one
