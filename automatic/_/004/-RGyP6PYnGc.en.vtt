works I'm going to indicate the device

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250 
works I'm going to indicate the device
I'm<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> machine<00:01:09.840> work<00:01:10.020> drill

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
I'm going to do the machine work drill

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.620 
I'm going to do the machine work drill
the<00:01:10.350> holes<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> rotary<00:01:12.000> table<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the holes and use the rotary table and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
the holes and use the rotary table and
then<00:01:13.020> how<00:01:13.320> we're<00:01:13.500> doing<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.189> operation

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
then how we're doing in this operation

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.850 
then how we're doing in this operation
when<00:01:15.390> we're<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.600> hardly<00:01:15.900> using<00:01:16.290> an<00:01:16.409> indicator

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
when we're all hardly using an indicator

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.640 
when we're all hardly using an indicator
this<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.900> don't<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:19.140> what<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.439> call

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
this is a I don't know what they call

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.020 
this is a I don't know what they call
this<00:01:19.740> indicator<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.430> I've<00:01:20.520> had<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.000> years

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
this indicator but I've had it for years

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
this indicator but I've had it for years
in<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.590> run<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.920> Machine

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
in it it you can run the Machine

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.800 
in it it you can run the Machine
actually<00:01:23.610> run<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> Machine<00:01:24.450> while<00:01:24.659> I'm

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
actually run the Machine while I'm

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
actually run the Machine while I'm
indicating<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.470> center<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.240> rotary

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
indicating the center of the rotary

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.539 
indicating the center of the rotary
table<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.689> know<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.049> exact<00:01:28.439> center<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.400> that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
table so I know the exact center of that

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.840 
table so I know the exact center of that
rotary<00:01:29.939> table<00:01:30.329> once<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.549> readout<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
rotary table once I get the readout to

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.700 
rotary table once I get the readout to
zero

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
zero

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:51.130 
zero
so<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.040> I'm<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.460> now

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.350 

okay<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.830> now<00:01:52.980> what<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.610> at

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
okay there it is so now what I do is at

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.150 
okay there it is so now what I do is at
x0<00:01:54.980> y0<00:01:55.980> and<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.540> 0<00:01:57.870> 1<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.740> what

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
x0 y0 and then it's a 0 1 here so what

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.550 
x0 y0 and then it's a 0 1 here so what
I'm<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.370> to<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.760> go<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.030> initial<00:02:00.810> that's

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
I'm going to do is go to initial that's

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.210 
I'm going to do is go to initial that's

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
circle is nine hundred thousandths so

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.750 
circle is nine hundred thousandths so
zero<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.820> Center<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.600> want<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.020> go<00:02:58.110> for<00:02:58.410> 50<00:02:58.830> away

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
zero is Center I want to go for 50 away

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.220 
zero is Center I want to go for 50 away
from<00:03:00.060> Center<00:03:00.390> that's<00:03:00.780> where<00:03:00.990> I'm<00:03:01.080> at<00:03:01.170> right

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
from Center that's where I'm at right

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.340 
from Center that's where I'm at right
now<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.950> see<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.550> X<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.209> Machine<00:03:03.660> this

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
now you see the X of the Machine this

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.699 
now you see the X of the Machine this
way<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.890> four<00:03:05.489> hundred<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.850> fifty<00:03:06.150> thousands

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
way is four hundred and fifty thousands

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.880 
way is four hundred and fifty thousands
why<00:03:07.709> we're<00:03:08.310> going<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.550> keep<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:09.410> locked<00:03:10.410> here

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
why we're going to keep that locked here

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.530 
why we're going to keep that locked here
so<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.340> doesn't<00:03:11.610> move<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.940> way<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.150> I'm<00:03:12.390> right

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
so it doesn't move this way so I'm right

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.330 
so it doesn't move this way so I'm right
in<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.660> middle<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.140> rotary<00:03:13.530> table<00:03:13.830> so

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
in the middle of that rotary table so

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.470 
in the middle of that rotary table so
what<00:03:14.459> I'm<00:03:14.550> going<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.700> do<00:03:14.820> now<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.150> turn<00:03:15.270> on<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
what I'm going to do now is turn on the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.780 
what I'm going to do now is turn on the
Machine<00:03:15.810> I'm<00:03:15.959> going<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.400> touch<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.430> off

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
Machine I'm going to just touch that off

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.940
