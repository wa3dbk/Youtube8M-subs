 go live in cities where to live 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.430
 it is necessary to have large amounts of 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.140
 money at least earn from 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.010
 one thousand five hundred euros every month

 number 10 we have gin in switzerland 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.989
 let's say that 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:45.160

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:48.559
 little cup of coffee in this city is worth 657 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.260
 dollars a fast food at the mcdonald 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.100
 would be worth $ 13 or practically 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.430
 twice as much as in any country 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.930
 at number 9 we have caracas 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.460

 people from venezuela that are 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.330
 seeing therefore that the inflation of 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.470
 venezuela de caracas has made it so 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.210
 that in just a few months venezuela is 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.510

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.220
 most important economic 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.140

 the cost of living has fallen 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.760

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:01.840
 places is 7 thousand and 15 thousand dollars at 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.760

 seven thousand or 15 thousand dollars a month is a 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.010
 You have to be a millionaire 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.970

 half a thousand two hundred dollars 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.160
 It is also one of the areas where 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.080
 there is lower crime and its density 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.980

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.900
 sample of the magnificent nature 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.230
 although in what you accommodate the city 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.110
 You should have a good saving 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.360

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.930
 your basic needs in a month 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.270

 osaka osaka kobe in japan occupies one of 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.070
 the first places because to be able

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.500
 two thousand six hundred and forty dollars to 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.950
 month 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.170

 It can cost perfectly between 40 and 50 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.860
 dollars so you have to have big 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.370
 amounts of money to go live 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.000

 an amazing wealth and first of all 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.250
 we have switzerland 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.800
 specifically zurich this would be one of 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.680
 the most expensive areas of the world but that 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.479
 better quality of life offers for a 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.979
 student in the cost of living in this 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:35.219

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.950
 face and with greater purchasing power of the 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.840
 world 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.640
 after having talked about the cities 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.560
 more faces of the world than surely 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.380
 you will want to visit if you have the 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.020
 opportunity to say that only 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.510
 can live here those people like 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.520
 I already said before that they have a lot of money or 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.920
 that the parents have to guarantee them the 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.500
 Studies that have enough money 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.020

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:16.950
 talking about areas where to live 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.950
 it is necessary to have a lot of money
