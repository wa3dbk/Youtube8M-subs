magnetizing<00:00:34.370> hope<00:00:34.610> that<00:00:34.820> made<00:00:35.000> sense<00:00:35.270> guys

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
magnetizing hope that made sense guys

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.630 
magnetizing hope that made sense guys
I<00:00:37.410> stopped<00:00:38.410> talking<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.890> lot<00:00:39.039> throughout<00:00:39.399> that

so that that's 1 i've already

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.939 
so that that's 1 i've already
drilled<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.110> hole<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.559> once<00:00:58.770> i<00:00:58.920> think

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
drilled the hole for this once i think

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.670 
drilled the hole for this once i think
i'm<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> stop<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.850> come<00:01:00.510> back<00:01:00.719> once<00:01:01.530> i

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
i'm going to stop and come back once i

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.119 
i'm going to stop and come back once i
get<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> magnet<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.460> one

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.360 

just<00:01:05.729> gonna

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
just gonna

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.160 
just gonna
and<00:01:07.940> I<00:01:08.030> said<00:01:08.210> I'd<00:01:08.330> put<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.600> magnet<00:01:08.810> in<00:01:09.020> and

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
and I said I'd put the magnet in and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.510 
and I said I'd put the magnet in and
come<00:01:09.290> back<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.740> figure<00:01:09.980> what's<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.280> point

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
come back but I figure what's the point

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.010 
come back but I figure what's the point
of<00:01:10.580> doing<00:01:10.640> this<00:01:10.850> forget<00:01:11.300> don't<00:01:11.570> get<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:11.750> see<00:01:11.900> me

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
of doing this forget don't get to see me

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:32.399 
of doing this forget don't get to see me
do<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:12.290> right<00:01:13.960> anyway

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:44.320 

alright

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.610 

alright<00:01:45.050> so

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
alright so

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.910 
alright so
now<00:01:47.160> got<00:01:47.400> them<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:48.570> magnet<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.260> basically

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
now got them the magnet just basically

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.530 
now got them the magnet just basically
stuck<00:01:50.190> to<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> back<00:01:50.580> of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> marine<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
stuck to the back of the marine here and

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.770 
stuck to the back of the marine here and
then<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.980> hole<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:53.970> sufficiently

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
then the hole is I think sufficiently

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.190 
then the hole is I think sufficiently
wide<00:01:55.650> enough<00:01:55.980> and<00:01:56.850> now<00:01:57.660> what<00:01:57.840> I'm<00:01:57.900> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.080> do

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
wide enough and now what I'm going to do

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.480 
wide enough and now what I'm going to do
is<00:01:58.380> again<00:01:58.800> test<00:01:59.490> fit<00:01:59.700> it

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.480 

it<00:02:05.150> looks<00:02:05.329> like<00:02:05.390> it'll<00:02:05.659> go<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.619> then<00:02:07.310> what

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
it looks like it'll go in and then what

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.790 
it looks like it'll go in and then what
I'll<00:02:07.579> do<00:02:07.759> it's<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.179> little<00:02:08.390> off-kilter<00:02:08.649> so<00:02:09.649> what

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
I'll do it's a little off-kilter so what

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.440 
I'll do it's a little off-kilter so what
I'll<00:02:09.890> do<00:02:10.039> is<00:02:10.069> literally<00:02:10.459> just<00:02:10.759> press<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.180> in

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
I'll do is literally just press it in

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.390 
I'll do is literally just press it in
put<00:02:12.410> some<00:02:12.560> glue<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:12.860> our<00:02:13.010> first<00:02:13.280> though<00:02:13.660> so

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
put some glue in our first though so

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.140 
put some glue in our first though so
take<00:02:16.400> my<00:02:16.640> trusty<00:02:18.160> exact<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.340> just<00:02:19.730> pop<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.060> out

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
take my trusty exact to just pop it out

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.910 
take my trusty exact to just pop it out
they<00:02:20.959> don't<00:02:21.050> always<00:02:21.260> come<00:02:21.500> out<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.739> easily

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
they don't always come out that easily

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.620 
they don't always come out that easily
sometimes<00:02:22.370> if<00:02:22.819> they're<00:02:22.970> really<00:02:23.090> shoehorned

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
sometimes if they're really shoehorned

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.470 
sometimes if they're really shoehorned

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
destroying the plastic surrounding the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.460 
destroying the plastic surrounding the
magnet<00:02:31.599> especially<00:02:32.599> if<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.780> goof<00:02:33.019> up<00:02:33.230> on<00:02:33.380> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
magnet especially if you goof up on the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.809 
magnet especially if you goof up on the
polarity<00:02:33.920> that's<00:02:34.790> no<00:02:35.030> fun

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
the body away before the glue dries take

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.050 
the body away before the glue dries take
like<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.879> back<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.090> my<00:03:01.269> file

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.510

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
and I made it off kilter a bit on

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.760 
and I made it off kilter a bit on
purpose<00:03:30.770> of<00:03:30.920> course<00:03:31.160> because<00:03:32.410> my<00:03:33.410> original

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
purpose of course because my original

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.900 
purpose of course because my original
hole<00:03:33.920> in<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.100> back<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.430> marine<00:03:34.610> was<00:03:34.790> off

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
hole in the back of the marine was off

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.090 
hole in the back of the marine was off
kilter<00:03:35.270> so<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.510> wanted<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.900> try<00:03:36.020> to<00:03:36.200> match<00:03:37.070> that

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
kilter so I wanted to try to match that

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.850 
kilter so I wanted to try to match that
up

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.720 

so

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:55.300 

looks<00:03:44.269> like<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.540> marries<00:03:44.780> up<00:03:44.930> pretty<00:03:45.200> well

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.800 

not<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.030> you're<00:03:56.180> going<00:03:56.270> to<00:03:56.330> be<00:03:56.390> shaking<00:03:56.750> your

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
not that you're going to be shaking your

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.540 
not that you're going to be shaking your
marine<00:03:57.050> life<00:03:57.200> out<00:03:57.380> of<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.590> game<00:03:57.800> but<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.190> know

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.710 

we'll<00:04:03.550> talk<00:04:03.670> pretty<00:04:03.910> well<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.480> there<00:04:04.630> you

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
we'll talk pretty well and there you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.760 
we'll talk pretty well and there you
have<00:04:04.780> it

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
have it

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.150
