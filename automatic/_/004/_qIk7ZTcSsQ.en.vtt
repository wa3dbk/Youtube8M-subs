00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.840 
it's a 5 liter supercharged v8 because
it's<00:01:54.920> supercharged<00:01:55.429> that<00:01:55.609> means<00:01:55.759> the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's supercharged that means the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.550 
it's supercharged that means the
throttle<00:01:56.179> response<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.689> instantaneous

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
throttle response is instantaneous

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.129 
throttle response is instantaneous
off-the-line<00:01:58.369> acceleration<00:01:58.429> is<00:01:59.210> brutal<00:01:59.630> but

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
off-the-line acceleration is brutal but

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:01.959 
off-the-line acceleration is brutal but
really<00:02:00.439> it's<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:00.889> in<00:02:01.069> gear<00:02:01.310> acceleration

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
really it's the in gear acceleration

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.039 
really it's the in gear acceleration
when<00:02:02.240> you're<00:02:02.359> accelerating<00:02:02.600> down<00:02:02.960> that

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
when you're accelerating down that

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.539 
when you're accelerating down that
straightaway<00:02:03.229> in<00:02:03.499> the<00:02:03.560> racetrack<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:04.249> know

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
straightaway in the racetrack you know

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.160 
straightaway in the racetrack you know
going<00:02:04.700> through<00:02:04.789> thirds<00:02:05.149> you<00:02:05.479> know<00:02:05.659> fourth

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
going through thirds you know fourth

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.440 
going through thirds you know fourth
gear<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.950> acceleration<00:02:07.459> just<00:02:07.549> never<00:02:07.969> stops

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
gear the acceleration just never stops

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.910 
gear the acceleration just never stops
I've<00:02:08.929> had<00:02:09.140> an<00:02:09.259> RS<00:02:09.530> up<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.740> hundred

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
I've had an RS up to a hundred

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.470 
I've had an RS up to a hundred
seventy-five<00:02:10.340> miles<00:02:10.610> an<00:02:10.819> hour<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.300> feel

unbelievable engine hey what about

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.710 
unbelievable engine hey what about
adjustability<00:02:16.100> suspensions<00:02:16.940> knitting's<00:02:17.330> can

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
adjustability suspensions knitting's can

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.480 
adjustability suspensions knitting's can
you<00:02:17.810> lift<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.140> front<00:02:18.440> yeah<00:02:19.069> so<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> car

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
you lift the front yeah so the car

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.370 
you lift the front yeah so the car
actually<00:02:19.760> features<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.060> twin<00:02:20.360> spring<00:02:20.690> racing

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
actually features a twin spring racing

little bit but if you can spend all your
time<00:02:28.790> on<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> racetrack<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.540> can<00:02:29.660> just<00:02:29.780> drop

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
time on the racetrack you can just drop

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.119 
time on the racetrack you can just drop
it<00:02:30.110> down<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.470> ground<00:02:30.650> for<00:02:30.950> better

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
it down to the ground for better

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.770 
it down to the ground for better
handling<00:02:31.310> more<00:02:31.790> grip<00:02:32.120> better<00:02:32.540> airflow

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
handling more grip better airflow

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.440 
handling more grip better airflow
underneath<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.349> car<00:02:33.530> and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
underneath the car and

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.030 
underneath the car and
can<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:34.930> do<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.050> on-the-go<00:02:35.560> where<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.950> have

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
to stop and get us up and do it yeah but

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.559 
to stop and get us up and do it yeah but
it's<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:39.099> a<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.640> have<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.879> just<00:02:40.180> pull<00:02:40.420> out<00:02:40.510> a

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
it's it's a you have to just pull out a

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.630 
it's it's a you have to just pull out a
wrench<00:02:40.810> make<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.050> couple<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.379> adjustments<00:02:41.640> but

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
wrench make a couple of adjustments but

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.040 
wrench make a couple of adjustments but
yeah<00:02:43.150> one<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.480> great<00:02:43.629> things<00:02:43.780> about<00:02:43.840> this

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
yeah one of the great things about this

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.080 
yeah one of the great things about this
car<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.530> when<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.129> want<00:02:45.340> custom<00:02:45.580> purchases<00:02:46.000> in

how to do it in a safe manner but it

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.589 
how to do it in a safe manner but it
really<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:21.519> helps<00:03:21.760> them<00:03:21.819> enjoy<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.239> carving

of<00:03:51.400> grip<00:03:51.700> really<00:03:52.150> just<00:03:52.420> helps<00:03:52.569> to<00:03:52.630> kind<00:03:52.750> of

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
of grip really just helps to kind of

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.360 
of grip really just helps to kind of
keep<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.049> car<00:03:53.230> stuck<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.799> road<00:03:53.950> great
