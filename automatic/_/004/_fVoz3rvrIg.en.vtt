with everybody else the most important

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.139 
with everybody else the most important
thing<00:02:06.770> about<00:02:06.890> big<00:02:07.159> way<00:02:07.280> formations<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.030> the

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
thing about big way formations is the

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.170 
thing about big way formations is the
base<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:09.289> is<00:02:09.440> critical<00:02:10.039> that<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.519> base<00:02:10.789> is

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
base it is critical that that base is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.690 
base it is critical that that base is
rock<00:02:11.540> solid<00:02:11.780> because<00:02:12.590> everybody<00:02:13.220> else<00:02:13.310> is

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
rock solid because everybody else is

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.309 
rock solid because everybody else is
relying<00:02:14.120> on<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> base<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.959> center<00:02:15.230> of

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
relying on it the base is the center of

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.170 
relying on it the base is the center of
the<00:02:15.440> formation<00:02:15.950> it's<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.190> heart<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.060> if

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
the formation it's the heart and if

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.420 
the formation it's the heart and if
that's<00:02:17.630> not<00:02:17.780> flying<00:02:18.079> right<00:02:18.410> then<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.280> whole

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
that's not flying right then the whole

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.970 
that's not flying right then the whole

we're the first people in Australia to
jump<00:03:07.030> with<00:03:07.180> oxygen<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:07.780> it's<00:03:08.140> been<00:03:08.260> really

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
jump with oxygen so it's been really

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.850 
jump with oxygen so it's been really
stressful<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.510> feel<00:03:10.510> like<00:03:10.630> I've<00:03:10.870> had<00:03:11.170> the

stressful that I feel like I've had the

been<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.490> head<00:03:15.910> basically<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.720> guess<00:03:17.440> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
been a head basically I guess the

been a head basically I guess the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.270 
day three and then she just started
going<00:03:25.510> wrong<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:26.650> I'm<00:03:26.710> there<00:03:26.860> on<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.100> lead

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
going wrong so I'm there on the lead

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.700 
going wrong so I'm there on the lead
plane<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.570> looked<00:03:28.870> out<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.080> left<00:03:29.350> window

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
plane and I looked out the left window

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.710 
plane and I looked out the left window
and<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:29.950> couldn't<00:03:30.250> see<00:03:30.460> him<00:03:30.670> we're<00:03:31.420> all<00:03:31.450> on

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
and I couldn't see him we're all on

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.990 
and I couldn't see him we're all on
oxygen<00:03:32.020> we've<00:03:32.350> got<00:03:32.470> limited<00:03:32.890> supplies<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.820> I

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
oxygen we've got limited supplies and I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.850 
oxygen we've got limited supplies and I
hear<00:03:34.210> over<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.540> radio<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:35.020> one<00:03:35.710> of<00:03:35.800> the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
hear over the radio that one of the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.400 
hear over the radio that one of the
planes<00:03:36.130> had<00:03:36.370> stalled<00:03:36.840> too<00:03:37.840> many<00:03:38.020> people<00:03:38.290> had

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
planes had stalled too many people had

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.110 
planes had stalled too many people had
climbed<00:03:38.680> out<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.370> plane<00:03:39.610> couldn't<00:03:40.000> keep

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
climbed out and the plane couldn't keep

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.880 
climbed out and the plane couldn't keep
that<00:03:40.180> speed<00:03:40.660> through<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.960> turn<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> actually

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
that speed through a turn so it actually

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.400 
that speed through a turn so it actually
dropped<00:03:42.130> out<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.430> sky<00:03:42.610> 2,000<00:03:43.390> feet<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.780> we

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
dropped out of the sky 2,000 feet and we

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.010 
dropped out of the sky 2,000 feet and we
watched<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.830> drop<00:03:45.070> away<00:03:45.390> did<00:03:46.390> anyone<00:03:46.630> see<00:03:46.840> that

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
watched it drop away did anyone see that

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.040 
watched it drop away did anyone see that
it's<00:03:47.770> falling<00:03:47.980> on<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.250> sky<00:03:48.600> no<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:49.630> really<00:03:49.840> knew

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
it's falling on the sky no I really knew

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.840 
it's falling on the sky no I really knew
what<00:03:50.230> was<00:03:50.350> going<00:03:50.710> on<00:03:50.830> planes<00:03:51.250> were<00:03:51.430> circling

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850

around trying to get back in formation
and<00:03:55.060> people<00:03:55.690> were<00:03:55.780> starting<00:03:56.080> to<00:03:56.200> freak<00:03:56.470> out<00:03:56.590> a

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650
