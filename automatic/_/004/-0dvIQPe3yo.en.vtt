00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.959
 today we will be close to 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:15.299
 Amsterdam with the new Skoda Octavia 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.520
 gag gag that means this car will 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.890
 quite normal with gasoline and natural gas 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.400
 under the hood, the 1.2 liter works 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.230
 tsi engine with 110 ps if you put it on it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.790
 you arrive over 1300 kilometers 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.280
 far with the car and the co2 emissions 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.910
 like just 97 grams on 100 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.860
 kilometers 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.669
 how that happens in everyday life then 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.669
 Let's take a look now 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.220
 It was only a matter of time that 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.340
 Skoda also his best horse in the stall 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.740
 would buy a natural gas drive-by 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.030
 The Citigo Check is the Octavia das 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.920
 second model with this 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.170
 most environmentally friendly though 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.200
 pronounced economic drive 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.910
 in times makes sporty gas prices 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.130
 It makes sense to buy a new one 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.060
 cars about such an alternative 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.040
 thinking 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.710
 especially if they are the same 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.750
 is built and doing it one 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.370
 The Czechs are extremely difficult 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.590
 to deny reason 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.580
 because the entry with the limousine 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.710
 starts at 21 1850 euro the combo 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.410
 costs around 600 euros more 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.900
 the change from natural gas to petrol operation 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.860
 happens very inconspicuous and 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.440
 comfortable 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.180
 the skoda octavia I detected 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.770
 normal gasoline from natural gas 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.660
 Drive from here absolutely nothing 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.229
 and when you turn down you can 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.660
 you notice or compass around eleven 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.250
 seconds it goes on tempo 100 and that 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.229
 only detail what you notice that you 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.240
 sitting in the natural gas car are the two 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.670
 Show here namely a fuel gauge 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.370
 for the normal gasoline tank and 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.960
 one for the airbus tanker 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.060
 unlike commonly thought 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000
 have been slower in this 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.920
 octavia, for example, for his 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.159
 not only the lush range provided 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.540
 bivalent drive of the getec attacks 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.360
 systems like start and stop 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.280
 brake energy recovery back that 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.170
 the tank stops slowing down 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.530
 after all, is the octavia am 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.500
 Natural gas mode at 100 kilometers with only 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.760
 35 kilos of natural gas and one kilo you get 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.760
 for around 1 euro approx 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.370
 Let's take a look at it like that with the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.900
 refueling works up is the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.450
 mandatory ice force for consumption 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.790
 with not here are two filler necks 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.270
 once for normal gasoline once 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.959
 for natural gas so entrepreneur the trunk 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.900
 stuck on it once crack 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.700
 now everything is fixed sport here in 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.760
 pressure on 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.760
 now the state would be proud 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.480
 so around 8 euro 50 450 kilometer we 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:00.040
 Driving around is okay 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:05.250
 actually really easy stuff 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.250
 again pay more and go on 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.300
 that tapped at the gas station 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.340
 Natural gas will also be used in future 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.380
 vegetable or animal residues 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.459
 have the plant waste or manure 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.150
 can no longer be a dream of the future 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.430
 keyword biogas 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.170
 this allows the metal-containing gas 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.610
 not just for the electricity or heat 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.650
 use but at 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.439
 appropriate preparation also into 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.060
 Feed in the natural gas grid 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:35.840
 it ends up on this path in the end 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.299
 even in autotank already four cows 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.400
 suffice to get out of their liquid manure via biogas 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.200
 a four-person household with electricity too 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.170
 experts have already been supplying 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.569
 just calculations about how 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.989
 Far a natural gas car with the help of a cow 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.389
 drives should already be hired 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.139
 even if it sounds strange, here it goes 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.609
 for fuel from renewable energies 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:01.459
 so that was our test drive in the new 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.019
 skoda octavia the day of the natural gas drive 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.709
 has proven to be very suitable for everyday use 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.099
 proven 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.900
 Cost-wise, it's worth it 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.970
 and on the subject of age betrayed the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.310
 trunk space is still 130 liters smaller 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.090
 as that of the conventional skoda octavia 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.560
 but still big enough 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.560
 we say hello bye nationwide
