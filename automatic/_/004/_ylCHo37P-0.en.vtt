signature<00:00:05.190> enforcement<00:00:05.759> on<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.940> tablet<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
signature enforcement on a tablet so the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.680 
signature enforcement on a tablet so the
problem<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:07.919> we're<00:00:08.220> on<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> tablet<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.150> our

so<00:00:15.599> we're<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.170> show<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.379> how<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.770> fix

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
so we're going to show you how to fix

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.870 
so we're going to show you how to fix
that<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.699> tablet<00:00:18.690> you'll<00:00:18.900> need<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.880> USB

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that on a tablet you'll need a USB

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.590 
that on a tablet you'll need a USB
keyboard<00:00:21.859> to<00:00:22.859> plug<00:00:23.189> into<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.820> tablet<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.570> have

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
keyboard to plug into the tablet we have

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.170 
keyboard to plug into the tablet we have
one<00:00:25.050> right<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.699> what<00:00:26.849> we're<00:00:27.029> going

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
one right here and so what we're going

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.439 
one right here and so what we're going
to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.510> first<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.490> restart<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> computer<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
enter the BIOS now on this tablet this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.889 
enter the BIOS now on this tablet this
is<00:00:33.960> an<00:00:34.170> Acer<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.489> enter<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> BIOS<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.600> just

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
is an Acer to enter the BIOS you just

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.680 
is an Acer to enter the BIOS you just
simply<00:00:37.200> restart<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> computer<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:39.360> hold

the volume up button and you press the
power<00:00:43.500> button<00:00:43.680> repeatedly<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.270> just

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
power button repeatedly so we just

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.479 
power button repeatedly so we just
restarted<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.930> computer<00:00:46.020> will<00:00:46.379> hold<00:00:46.649> volume

button and that will kick it into the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.380 
button and that will kick it into the
BIOS<00:00:54.440> now<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.649> may<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.890> different<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:57.059> your

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
BIOS now this may be different on your

BIOS now this may be different on your
tablet<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.050> suggest<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.649> googling<00:00:59.309> how<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
tablet I suggest just googling how to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.750 
tablet I suggest just googling how to
enter<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.000> BIOS<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.719> your<00:01:00.930> tablet<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:02.550> is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
enter the BIOS on your tablet this is

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.979 
enter the BIOS on your tablet this is
how<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
how we have to do it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.380 
how we have to do it
okay<00:01:04.409> once<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.129> into<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> BIOS<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:06.240> we

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
okay once you get into the BIOS what we

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210 
okay once you get into the BIOS what we
want<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> change<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
want to do is we want to change the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.480 
want to do is we want to change the
order<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.479> machine<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.439> booting<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
order that the machine is booting so you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.880 
order that the machine is booting so you
can<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.360> go<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> boot<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> boot

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
can see here we go to boot we go to boot

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.120 
can see here we go to boot we go to boot
priority<00:01:14.130> order<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.090> want<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.600> USB<00:01:16.409> ports

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
priority order and we want the USB ports

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.690 
priority order and we want the USB ports
to<00:01:17.369> boot<00:01:17.610> first<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.750> we've<00:01:19.200> moved<00:01:19.500> both<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
to boot first so we've moved both of the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
to boot first so we've moved both of the
USBs<00:01:21.979> boot<00:01:22.979> priority<00:01:23.189> order<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> top<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
USBs boot priority order to the top and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.370 
USBs boot priority order to the top and
we'll<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.890> exit<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.960> we'll<00:01:27.960> save<00:01:28.200> those

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
we'll just exit and we'll save those

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.230 
we'll just exit and we'll save those
changes<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.210> we

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
changes so as you can see here now we

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
changes so as you can see here now we
have<00:01:30.479> our<00:01:30.600> keyboard<00:01:31.259> we'll<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.950> plug<00:01:32.189> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
have our keyboard we'll just plug that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.039 
have our keyboard we'll just plug that
in<00:01:32.640> using<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.450> USB

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.260 

we've<00:01:39.649> restarted<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.399> computer<00:01:40.490> holding<00:01:41.149> the
