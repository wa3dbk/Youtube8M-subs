okay<00:00:01.949> in<00:00:02.850> this<00:00:03.000> video<00:00:03.360> we're<00:00:03.750> gonna<00:00:03.810> do<00:00:03.990> a

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
okay in this video we're gonna do a

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.320 
okay in this video we're gonna do a
little<00:00:04.200> bit<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.380> work<00:00:04.620> on<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:04.980> cylinder<00:00:05.330> just

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
little bit of work on this cylinder just

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.740 
little bit of work on this cylinder just
to<00:00:06.540> make<00:00:06.690> sure<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.319> it's<00:00:07.470> got<00:00:07.649> enough

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
to make sure that it's got enough

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.589 
to make sure that it's got enough
vertices<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.200> faces<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:11.179> work<00:00:12.179> with<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.480> we

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
vertices and faces to work with so we

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.970 
vertices and faces to work with so we
can<00:00:12.750> create<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.110> shape<00:00:13.349> out<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
can create this shape out of the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.829 
can create this shape out of the
airplane<00:00:14.250> first<00:00:15.150> thing<00:00:15.269> I'm<00:00:15.330> gonna<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.599> though

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
airplane first thing I'm gonna do though

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.490 
airplane first thing I'm gonna do though
is<00:00:16.109> I'm<00:00:16.500> gonna<00:00:16.590> rename<00:00:16.980> my<00:00:17.160> shape<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:18.230> can<00:00:19.230> spell

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
is I'm gonna rename my shape I can spell

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.429 
is I'm gonna rename my shape I can spell
it<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.830> can't<00:00:20.130> say<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.630> plane<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.960> body<00:00:22.170> is

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
it I just can't say it plane the body is

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.310 
it I just can't say it plane the body is
what<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.740> says

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
what that says

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.480 
what that says
so<00:00:25.320> that's<00:00:25.470> job<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:26.310> we're<00:00:26.400> gonna

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
so that's job one now what we're gonna

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.730 
so that's job one now what we're gonna
do<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.970> work<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.449> sort<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.869> how<00:00:28.080> many<00:00:28.289> faces

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
do is work out sort of how many faces

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.220 
do is work out sort of how many faces
this<00:00:28.890> needs<00:00:29.130> now<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:30.960> need<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.140> go

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
this needs now to do that we need to go

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.870 
this needs now to do that we need to go
into<00:00:31.380> imports<00:00:31.710> click<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.070> poly<00:00:32.309> cylinder<00:00:32.759> 1

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
into imports click on poly cylinder 1

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.090 
into imports click on poly cylinder 1
making<00:00:33.120> sure<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.660> channel<00:00:33.780> box<00:00:34.100> but

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
making sure you on your channel box but

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.770 
making sure you on your channel box but
there<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.120> go<00:00:36.210> now<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.540> see<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
there we go now you can see the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.799 
there we go now you can see the
subdivisions<00:00:37.380> axis<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.950> set<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> 20<00:00:38.809> which

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
subdivisions axis is set to 20 which

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.450 
subdivisions axis is set to 20 which
means<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.200> are<00:00:40.230> 20<00:00:40.710> faces<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.219> around

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
means there are 20 faces going around

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.040 
means there are 20 faces going around
this<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> think<00:00:42.120> that's<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:42.510> bit<00:00:42.719> too

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
this now I think that's a little bit too

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.959 
this now I think that's a little bit too
many<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> complexity<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> ship

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
many for the complexity of the ship

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.069 
many for the complexity of the ship
we're<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.840> difficult

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
we're going for it's not that difficult

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.799 
we're going for it's not that difficult
of<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.440> shade<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.829> around<00:00:47.300> so<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.360> think<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:48.719> we

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
of a shade going around so I think if we

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.470 
of a shade going around so I think if we
just<00:00:48.840> change<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> 12<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.360> see

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
just change that to 12 and you can see

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.170 
just change that to 12 and you can see
that<00:00:51.629> simplifies<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> shape<00:00:52.530> somewhat<00:00:53.180> next

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
that simplifies the shape somewhat next

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.420 
that simplifies the shape somewhat next
thing<00:00:54.270> we're<00:00:54.360> gonna<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.719> we're<00:00:55.110> gonna

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.279 
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna
divide<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.699> shape<00:00:57.000> down<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.809> drop<00:00:58.140> in

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
divide this shape down here like drop in

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.200 
divide this shape down here like drop in
a<00:00:58.379> sausage<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.530> though<00:01:01.940> takes<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
a sausage to do that though takes a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.509 
a sausage to do that though takes a
little<00:01:03.750> bit<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.140> forward<00:01:04.890> planning<00:01:05.129> now

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
little bit of forward planning now

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.250 
little bit of forward planning now
because<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> extrude<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.080> wings

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
because we're going to extrude the wings

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380 
because we're going to extrude the wings
out<00:01:07.439> later<00:01:07.710> we've<00:01:08.610> got<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.880> take<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.180> into

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
out later we've got to take that into

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.320 
out later we've got to take that into
account<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.680> we're<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> sort<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.369> slice

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
account so we're going to sort of slice

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.450 
account so we're going to sort of slice
this<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.750> kind<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.530> mentally<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.100> work<00:01:14.250> out

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
this up kind of mentally and work out

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.950 
this up kind of mentally and work out
where<00:01:14.670> they<00:01:14.820> need<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:15.479> how<00:01:15.659> many<00:01:15.720> bit

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
where they need to be or how many bit

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.350 
where they need to be or how many bit
need<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> obviously<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.210> one

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
need to be so this is obviously that one

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.670 
need to be so this is obviously that one
there<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.810> need<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> count<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.439> so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
there so we don't need to count that so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.010 
there so we don't need to count that so
we<00:01:19.770> need<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.670> least<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> start

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
we need at least one there for the start

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.850 
we need at least one there for the start
of<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.170> intake<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:24.720> 2<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> beginning<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
of this intake to 2 for the beginning of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.060 
of this intake to 2 for the beginning of
the<00:01:25.920> wing<00:01:26.689> don't<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.750> say<00:01:27.900> 3<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> edge<00:01:28.920> of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the wing don't we say 3 for the edge of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.580 
the wing don't we say 3 for the edge of
the<00:01:29.189> intake<00:01:29.780> for<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.110> beginning<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the intake for for the beginning of the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.779 
the intake for for the beginning of the
cockpit

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
cockpit

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.069 
cockpit
five<00:01:33.789> for<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.359> back<00:01:34.509> of<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.780> wing<00:01:36.119> six<00:01:37.119> here

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
five for the back of the wing six here

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.320 
five for the back of the wing six here
for<00:01:38.350> where<00:01:38.469> the<00:01:38.590> cockpit<00:01:38.950> kind<00:01:39.159> of<00:01:39.250> ends

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.210 

and<00:01:43.810> then<00:01:44.050> we<00:01:44.260> really<00:01:44.470> need<00:01:44.620> one<00:01:44.860> next<00:01:45.100> one

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
and then we really need one next one

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.190 
and then we really need one next one
down<00:01:45.400> here<00:01:45.760> I<00:01:45.790> think<00:01:46.150> which<00:01:46.390> would<00:01:46.540> be<00:01:46.630> seven

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
down here I think which would be seven

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.470 
down here I think which would be seven
and<00:01:48.190> then<00:01:48.370> one<00:01:48.550> for<00:01:48.730> the<00:01:48.760> front<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.150> this<00:01:49.240> back

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
and then one for the front of this back

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.890 
and then one for the front of this back
wing<00:01:49.690> eight<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.880> for<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.090> back<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.540> back

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
wing eight one for the back the back

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.870 
wing eight one for the back the back
wing<00:01:53.170> nine<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:57.130> then<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.400> get<00:01:57.520> this<00:01:57.610> curve

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
wing nine and then to get this curve

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.630 
wing nine and then to get this curve
here<00:01:58.090> you'd<00:01:58.300> say<00:01:58.600> maybe<00:01:58.870> 10<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:03.100> maybe<00:02:03.370> 10<00:02:03.580> of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
here you'd say maybe 10 so maybe 10 of

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.730 
here you'd say maybe 10 so maybe 10 of
us<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.060> we'll<00:02:04.150> start<00:02:04.390> with<00:02:04.540> 10<00:02:04.810> on<00:02:05.230> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
us so we'll start with 10 on the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.790 
us so we'll start with 10 on the
subdivisions<00:02:06.580> higher<00:02:06.820> then<00:02:07.530> let's<00:02:08.530> see<00:02:08.680> what

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
subdivisions higher then let's see what

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.980 
subdivisions higher then let's see what
that<00:02:08.830> looks<00:02:08.950> like<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.640> there<00:02:10.630> we<00:02:10.750> go<00:02:10.810> that's

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
that looks like so there we go that's

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.230 
that looks like so there we go that's
now<00:02:11.230> subdivided<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.070> shape<00:02:12.340> up<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:12.880> we<00:02:13.000> should

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
now subdivided the shape up so we should

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.590 
now subdivided the shape up so we should
now<00:02:13.420> have<00:02:13.980> enough<00:02:14.980> vertices<00:02:15.880> in<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.360> shape

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
now have enough vertices in this shape

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.750 
now have enough vertices in this shape
to<00:02:16.780> work<00:02:16.960> with<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:20.290> create<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.620> planar<00:02:20.860> one<00:02:21.100> in

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
to work with to create the planar one in

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.700 
to work with to create the planar one in
the<00:02:22.330> next<00:02:22.660> step<00:02:22.870> though<00:02:23.020> before<00:02:23.230> we<00:02:23.440> get<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.680> to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
the next step though before we get on to

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.560 
the next step though before we get on to
that<00:02:23.950> we're<00:02:24.100> going<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.310> look<00:02:24.460> at<00:02:24.670> cutting<00:02:25.360> the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
that we're going to look at cutting the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.930 
that we're going to look at cutting the
shape<00:02:25.810> in<00:02:25.990> half<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.190> only<00:02:27.340> need<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.670> model

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
shape in half so we only need to model

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.690 
shape in half so we only need to model
half<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.540> plane<00:02:29.070> as<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:30.280> symmetrical

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
half of the plane as it's symmetrical

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.830 
half of the plane as it's symmetrical
shape<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.090> we<00:02:31.150> only<00:02:31.270> need<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.480> do<00:02:31.570> half<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
shape so we only need to do half the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.100 
shape so we only need to do half the
work

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
work

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.210 
work
so<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.280> I'll<00:02:33.400> be<00:02:33.520> in<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.880> next<00:02:34.030> video
