00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.219
 Hello, welcome to the picture today, let's talk. 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:14.780
 on three very important concepts 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:17.630
 which are the endemic epidemic and pandemic 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.110
 You know the difference between them is good. 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.619
 In this class we will talk about each one. 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.320
 Let's start by talking about the 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.140
 endemic and for this I already draw here 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.290
 map and from that map 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.600
 We'll understand what endemia is. 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.329
 so come on good first is important 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.030
 know that these three counties are 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.760
 concepts and epidemiology they are 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.630
 related to the number of cases of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.410
 certain diseases for example still 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.440
 happens when a particular disease 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.800
 reaches a specific region in that 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.930
 region, the high number of cases 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.000
 of a particular disease 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.000
 please note that this disease is a 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.970
 localized disease it becomes that in a 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.119
 limited space and does not spread to 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.880
 other regions and what example can we 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.910
 endemic is a good example of 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.539
 endemia is yellow fever fever 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.840
 personal yellow fever is a viral disease that is 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.729
 endemic to the Amazon region 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.050
 we can also say that besides 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.940
 mika from the tropical region of Africa 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.530
 central america 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.130
 then notice that yellow fever 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.259
 occurs mainly in these regions 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.929
 and that is why we have classified this 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.060
 disease as an endemic 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.599
 we'll see more about yellow fever 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.959
 Our specific lesson is just the 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:54.170
 class on endemic epidemic concepts 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:56.720
 and beyond this pandemic and kill want 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.739
 show you also a graphic 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.470
 endemic 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:03.050
 How do you think this graphic is good? 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.560
 already draws the graph and we will 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.979
 represent in the y axis the number of 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.939
 cases of certain disease 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.420
 in relation to time and as I already said 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.880
 an endemic disease has duration 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.880
 with 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.860
 China or the high number of cases in 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.200
 certain region 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.600
 So, folks, we can imagine the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.990
 the endemic graphic as if it were a 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.420
 straight more or less constant much 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.490
 attention that this type of chart also 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.560
 Usually falls in the tests. 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.970
 Now let's talk about the second 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.280
 concept that is the concept of epidemic 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.750
 How do you think it 's a disease? 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.510
 epidemic 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.960
 good epidemic happens when 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.620
 infectious disease spreads 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.300
 rapidly across several regions and why 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.570
 that the epidemic can happen 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.910
 usually an epidemic occurs when 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.460
 there is an ecological imbalance of 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.710
 disease-transmitting agent 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.710
 or it can happen by the appearance 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.200
 of a new infectious agent and 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.900
 example we can give of epidemic 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.630
 a good example of an epidemic is the flu 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.240
 to avian influenza which is also 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.630
 known as chicken flu is a 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.490
 disease that emerged as an outbreak 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.330
 mainly in the european region and 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.610
 Asia 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.050
 and it was spreading through several 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.650
 regions 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.120
 Now we draw the graph of the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.300
 epidemic when you think it is 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.470
 so let's represent here again 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.560
 the number of cases in relation to time 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.740
 in the case of the epidemic in 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.530
 moment there is an increase in the number of 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.450
 cases and often this increase is 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.790
 called an outbreak 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.350
 and there personal a lot of attention with the time 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.630
 an epidemic could end up becoming a 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.300
 endemia and when this will happen 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.540
 good if the number of cases of the disease 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:13.260
 remain high and steady in 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.310
 in this region 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.440
 will be classified as endemic here 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.460
 for example we can talk about the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.740
 dengue is a disease that began as a 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:30.070
 epidemic as an outbreak but is already a 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.340
 endemic in the Brazilian region and lastly 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.040
 talk about the pandemic 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.610
 we can say that the pandemic is a 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.730
 epidemic in large proportions a 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.430
 disease that is classified as a pandemic 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.550
 spread across all continents in 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.770
 many parts of the world you know which 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.540
 are the criteria for classification of 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.420
 a disease like pandemic 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.880
 well in this case personal plus the disease if 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.770
 spread around the world and kill one 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.610
 large number of people 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:07.720
 it should be an infectious disease 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.930
 tuberculosis aids are already diseases 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.020
 classified as pandemics 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.290
 they are infectious diseases 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.190
 are communicable diseases for other 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.610
 people 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.730
 when counting, for example, cancer, cancer 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.340
 can kill several people in several 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.550
 parts of the world but is not considered 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.170
 pandemic because cancer is not a 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.140
 contagious disease 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.060
 is not a communicable disease and there 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.610
 staff paid much attention to an illness 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.350
 which is spreading rapidly 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.600
 mainly here in the region of Africa 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.610
 is causing the death of many people 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.220
 what's the cake 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.540
 many people are saying that ebola 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.490
 have the potential to become a pandemic 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.130
 and we'll talk about it in class 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.010
 Ebola specific 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.190
 We finished here in the next class. 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:06.630
 Let's talk about other concepts too. 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.630
 important and I hope to see you there
