 ties of those of marc carmona is in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.400
 this occasion was renewable rivers the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.439
 rival who was going to get away with it was going 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.420
 to pluck a dot from a field 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.130
 practically impregnable the first 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.470
 occasions were always for the club 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.140
 Igor for that ball on the stick to which 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.060
 molina was not going to arrive but the goal was going to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.130
 end up coming and it's going to end 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.510
 overturning part of renewable rivers in 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.820
 a party that came to put 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.340
 even winning 2-0 this is a good 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.250
 Cristian stop but on the bounce 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.200
 there is perfectly roger for 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.260
 pick it up and score 0-1 with a lot 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.969
 quality with a very subtle touch putting 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.219
 the 0-1 on the score there is the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.440
 repeat the shot that hits the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.420
 Cristian's chest and how it takes the bounce 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.969
 Roger to score the first goal of the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.129
 match and practically leave the side to 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.660
 the palau's fans who met in 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.520
 this first match of the 13th day 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.439
 I followed the game for the same 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 course because he was going to overtake 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.000
 again in minute 33 already in the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 second part again renewable rivers 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.070
 those of duck who took control of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.990
 party at number 14 in a roger towards 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.640
 the second in your particular account and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.439
 put in front of renewable rivers in 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 a very intense match here in this 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.869
 occasion was the defense of rivers the one that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.939
 he knew how to close that advance of 5 of 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.790
 FC Barcelona and Aicardo with their leg 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.460
 left put the 1-2 on the scoreboard and 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.710
 I shortened distances Molina did not see it 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.420
 pass a very strong shot that ended 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.310
 meaning 12 and will do more 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.290
 stops mills always being the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.640
 protagonist of renewable rivers and 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.380
 always being the protagonist for 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.409
 take a point although in this play and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.869
 playing 5 yes he could make the draw 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.939
 to 2 FC Barcelona - a very good move 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.790
 pretty a team move where the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.399
 dribble and especially where it happens there is 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.619
 how does she put her back and how she arrives 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.259
 perfectly link to score the tie 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.450
 to 2 in the 39 on the horn the barÃ§a 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.759

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.060
 seconds but finally tie at 2 in 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.060
