this is the most accurate set apart

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.979 
this is the most accurate set apart
found<00:01:41.299> look<00:01:42.299> at<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.599> looks<00:01:42.840> airbrushed<00:01:47.989> it's

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:48.989 
found look at that looks airbrushed it's

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:53.569 
found look at that looks airbrushed it's
wet<00:01:49.319> sanded<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.039> a<00:01:50.069> silly<00:01:50.429> grit<00:01:50.789> I<00:01:52.399> could<00:01:53.399> buff

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
wet sanded to a silly grit I could buff

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.899 
wet sanded to a silly grit I could buff
it<00:01:53.789> and<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.959> it<00:01:54.989> really<00:01:55.469> really<00:01:55.619> shiny<00:01:56.340> ball<00:01:56.670> I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
it and get it really really shiny ball I

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.520 
it and get it really really shiny ball I
think<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.599> would<00:01:57.689> defeat<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.049> whole<00:01:58.200> object

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
think it would defeat the whole object

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
think it would defeat the whole object
of<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.979> being<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.340> camouflage<00:01:59.849> slingshot<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
of it being a camouflage slingshot I

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.940 
of it being a camouflage slingshot I
love<00:02:00.659> these<00:02:00.840> patterns<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.349> here<00:02:01.530> where<00:02:01.770> it's

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
love these patterns in here where it's

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
love these patterns in here where it's
where<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.879> color<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.209> leached<00:02:03.479> into<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
out I won't be make many of these i will

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.580 
out I won't be make many of these i will
make<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> few<00:02:27.989> but<00:02:28.989> there<00:02:29.139> will<00:02:29.260> be<00:02:29.290> limited

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
make a few but there will be limited

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.970 
make a few but there will be limited
number<00:02:30.189> because<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:31.689> just<00:02:31.870> cripples<00:02:32.469> my<00:02:32.680> wrist

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
number because it just cripples my wrist

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.830

the<00:02:33.519> amount<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.879> time<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.329> takes<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.659> sun<00:02:34.959> them

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
the amount of time it takes to sun them

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:50.730 
the amount of time it takes to sun them
which<00:02:37.840> counter<00:02:38.319> with<00:02:38.469> brown<00:02:38.680> machine

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:03:03.440 

I<00:02:50.800> mean<00:02:51.490> that<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.880> just<00:02:52.380> spot

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.300

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
thinking this can you imagine a matching

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.589 
thinking this can you imagine a matching
knife<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.160> matching<00:03:11.489> set<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.879> skills<00:03:12.300> that

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:30.080 

would<00:03:15.599> be<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.810> combination<00:03:16.200> wouldn't<00:03:16.860> it

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090
