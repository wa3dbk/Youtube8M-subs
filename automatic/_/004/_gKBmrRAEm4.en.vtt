00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
the game every time you move a piece

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.630 
the game every time you move a piece
based<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.650> you<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.860> you<00:01:02.040> move<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
based on what you see you move it you

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.299 
based on what you see you move it you
turn<00:01:03.150> over<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.989> changes<00:01:04.439> your<00:01:04.470> profile<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
turn over that changes your profile and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.500 
turn over that changes your profile and
then<00:01:05.700> allows<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.240> something

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
then allows you to do something

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.820 
then allows you to do something
different<00:01:06.540> neighborhood<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.530> hear

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
different neighborhood then you hear

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.460 
different neighborhood then you hear
they<00:01:08.040> move<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.260> call<00:01:10.409> it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
they move up here and so it we call it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.010 
they move up here and so it we call it
an<00:01:10.590> abstract<00:01:11.159> tactical<00:01:11.970> game<00:01:12.180> because<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
an abstract tactical game because it

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
an abstract tactical game because it
really<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> lot<00:01:13.740> faster<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> board

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
really is a lot faster and you the board

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.450 
really is a lot faster and you the board
can<00:01:15.240> change<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.840> quickly<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:17.070> rules<00:01:17.310> are

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
can change so quickly the rules are

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.429 
can change so quickly the rules are
basically<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.090> your<00:01:18.329> turn<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.170> draw<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
basically on your turn you can draw a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.169 
basically on your turn you can draw a
new<00:01:19.649> piece<00:01:19.829> out<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.130> bag<00:01:20.340> or<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.969> can<00:01:21.060> move

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
new piece out of the bag or you can move

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:22.370 
new piece out of the bag or you can move
a<00:01:21.299> piece<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:21.659> currently<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.109> the<00:01:22.140> board

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
a piece that's currently on the board

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380 
a piece that's currently on the board
and<00:01:22.649> their<00:01:23.280> pieces<00:01:23.579> are<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:23.729> self-contained

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and their pieces are all self-contained

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.779 
and their pieces are all self-contained
so<00:01:24.689> that's<00:01:24.869> once<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> five<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:26.609> six
