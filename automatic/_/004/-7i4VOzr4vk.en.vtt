00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.460
 hello with you sunshine cute 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.560
 boys is good but agree 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.020
 much better when these guys are also 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 good to my like for example blowing to give and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.270
 today we arrived at their concert for 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.760
 again to make sure that the night 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.580
 if you reach the goal and learn their secret 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.670
 Success was a presentation from late April 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.500
 new album duet ducky usually 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.570
 such an event especially 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.580
 exciting for artists and let 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.980
 today's concert is not the first 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.900
 music album is not the last I 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.450
 decided to ask the guys what are they 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.379
 feel today nick and judy lived 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.210
 today yes yes some small and then 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.940
 stressful moments before the concert not 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.850
 always have to be started just lose 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.800
 grasp and like saying mike tyson fear 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.750
 this is also a useful thing they need green 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.180
 the main to know how to manage is here 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.820
 it helps to help prepare 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.430
 a little bit yes somehow cheer up and give out 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.710
 she herself is scared before going on stage 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.860
 but as soon as the song begins 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.950
 flying away courage courage and as yet 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.240
 group give open freedom 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.060
 It is worth noting that on the Russian stage 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.729
 full of beautiful and good singing boys 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.320
 however, the duck Dacian position does not give up and 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.100
 constantly repeats more 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.350
 audience 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.630
 From this it is easy to conclude that 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.799
 guys have something that answers 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.619
 these are other artists 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.350
 and what I think just here 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.600
 some kind of internal component they 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.970
 all probably yes yes yes what happens in 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.380
 your music first of all because 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.479
 many really are somehow just 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.670
 they sing beautifully and look good 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.080
 it is what to do in the future pc 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.569
 some plans they just can't 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.890
 to build because they do not understand therefore 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.560
 not everyone is born for this 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.140
 work to achieve success in music 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.539
 definitely hard you should not just want 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.399
 This sitting on the couch and actively work 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.679
 above yourself and your creativity 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.170
 but still I was sure that you were measuring and 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.660
 Cyril has its secrets to achieve 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.720
 success and they certainly know what is needed 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.430
 sing to conquer listeners in general 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.290
 many most people are still a poet 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.170
 love is itself common 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.049
 a couple of songs but we think and think 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.280
 now we won't 5 we love now 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.900
 watch 5 animals 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.640
 ladies 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.420
 recently went to the zoo new style 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.890
 can you hear but we can see 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:43.859
 eat and something about animals 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:47.240
 let me believe then initially this 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:50.450
 must have been the songs of the fighter we will kill 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.100
 other body mate 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.770
 striving forward here is the most important 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.870
 a recipe for success for good reason say no 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.150
 limit of perfection but unfortunately 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.250
 There are limits to our report and it's time 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.250
 say goodbye to you was the sun yet
