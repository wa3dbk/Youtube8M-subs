00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.520
 the curdle antonio crescenzo conquers 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.019
 the ballot the first sensations of 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.780
 cross 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.150
 satisfaction was a result 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.130
 that for the truth or from the first moment 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.390
 of the election campaign is understood that 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.419
 it was our reach 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.130
 we did it, we're there and start 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.439
 another game like this was 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.390
 election campaign was a campaign 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.210
 electorate hard difficult seven 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.860
 candidates fractionate the electorate though 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.829
 day after day our consent 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.079
 grew up we could explain the 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.809
 our reasons to the citizens have them 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.730
 including and we are here to represent the 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.590
 center-right pole what will you do 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.690
 what will you do from this moment until 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.760
 runoff will talk to all 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.769
 citizens who have been brought to 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.219
 vote for other coalitions in this 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.199
 period 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.079
 we will also talk to the citizens who have 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.129
 voted the left coalition 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.170
 I believe we will go on exactly 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.999
 along the lines of what we have 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.219
 done on the other hand when playing one 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.379
 game if one ends if it starts 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.880
 another one but the team is the one she is 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.820
 waited for the ballot with giuseppe 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.130
 genuinely camphor yes what reason 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.229
 because camphor represents an area 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.030
 compact ideology has put together 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.490
 all the left and then started with 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.869
 one foot forward and I was the same 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.090
 convinced that within the 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.950
 center on which it is useless to do the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.899
 story with if and with but but us 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.049
 we represented the part he received 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.000
 more attention and his team udc 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.200
 strength italy liberal force gave 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.049
 satisfactions 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.990
 absolutely yes look at their slogan 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.810
 she knows it I would like the people to come 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.170
 become proud of sarno i am 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.729
 already with result in hand because I am 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.740
 proud of the team that around 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.869
 she was formed she saw the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.869
 vote percentages what you think 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.860
 that do not deviate from what 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.730
 I imagined it should happen 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.130
 basically i went a lot 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.020
 close in believing everyone how much 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.970
 reached among other things I have to say the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.590
 truths are all the results 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.060
 this is very important 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.240
 testimony that beyond then the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.100
 sometimes harsh comparison sometimes a little 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.230
 softer for everyone has made their own 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.750
 campaign with with enough 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.670
 serenity and has achieved what it is 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.320
 managed to transmit it seems that the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.890
 city ​​has somehow penalized 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.990
 the representatives in the province seem so 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.260
 it seems so the result seems to have 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.350
 a little so passed under tone 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.110
 who had management possibilities e 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.300
 probably gave results where the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.790
 people expected more than I would like 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.920
 tell the outgoing mayor 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.820
 I said goodnight to him yesterday evening 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.820
 I say good morning
