in<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.520> data<00:02:06.700> logger<00:02:07.000> it's<00:02:07.149> got<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.299> stopwatch

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
in the data logger it's got a stopwatch

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.479 
in the data logger it's got a stopwatch
so<00:02:08.289> if<00:02:08.380> you're<00:02:08.500> on<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.649> track<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.039> can<00:02:09.190> get<00:02:09.340> some

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
so if you're on a track you can get some

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.580 
so if you're on a track you can get some
lap<00:02:09.640> times<00:02:09.910> out<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.509> it's<00:02:11.170> also<00:02:11.320> got

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
lap times out of it it's also got

positions<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.950> I'd<00:02:14.950> have<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.310> say<00:02:15.489> it's<00:02:15.670> a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
positions and I'd have to say it's a

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.360

much<00:02:16.060> better<00:02:16.390> much<00:02:17.079> classier<00:02:17.470> looking<00:02:17.950> system

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
much better much classier looking system

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.949

than the missing GTR which has got all
those<00:02:20.200> functions

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
those functions

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.240
