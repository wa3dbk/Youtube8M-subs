hey there folks then do a little

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.519 
hey there folks then do a little
demonstration<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.200> difference<00:00:07.500> between

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
demonstration of the difference between

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.160 
demonstration of the difference between
manual<00:00:08.099> note<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.580> attitude<00:00:09.030> note<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:10.139> your

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
manual note and attitude note on your

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.580 
manual note and attitude note on your
DJI<00:00:10.860> phantom<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.670> have<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.080> set<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.230> up<00:00:13.259> in

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
DJI phantom you have to set that up in

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.529 
DJI phantom you have to set that up in
the<00:00:14.370> calibration<00:00:15.120> or<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.690> software<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.539> in

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
the calibration or the software and in

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.060 
the calibration or the software and in
middle<00:00:18.750> one<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.380> middle<00:00:19.439> studying<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
middle one the middle studying on the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.130 
middle one the middle studying on the
right<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.609> attitude<00:00:20.910> mode<00:00:21.270> up<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.930> hold

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
right is for attitude mode up to hold

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.490 
right is for attitude mode up to hold
you<00:00:23.070> flip<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.400> one<00:00:23.640> down<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.140> manual

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
you flip this one down the in manual

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.689 
you flip this one down the in manual
mode<00:00:25.789> now<00:00:26.789> mode<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.449> very<00:00:28.279> very<00:00:29.279> different

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
mode now mode is very very different

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.890 
mode now mode is very very different
than<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> attitude<00:00:30.240> mode<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> attitude

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
than the attitude mode so the attitude

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.650 
than the attitude mode so the attitude
mode<00:00:31.140> will<00:00:31.320> kind<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.590> that's<00:00:32.430> returning<00:00:33.059> or<00:00:33.540> as

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
mode will kind of that's returning or as

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.310 
mode will kind of that's returning or as
you're<00:00:33.809> kind<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.170> pitching<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.219> level<00:00:35.579> itself

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
you're kind of pitching the level itself

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.080 
you're kind of pitching the level itself
but<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.559> know<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.800> GPS<00:00:37.980> which<00:00:38.640> type<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.910> hold

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
but you know is GPS which type of hold

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.350 
but you know is GPS which type of hold
in<00:00:39.210> position<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> how<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> Moodle<00:00:40.940> it'll<00:00:41.940> keep

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
in position and how to Moodle it'll keep

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.819 
in position and how to Moodle it'll keep
it<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> same<00:00:43.110> direction<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.530> it'll

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it going the same direction but it'll

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.700 
it going the same direction but it'll
level<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> out<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:48.200> show<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> difference

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
level it out so show you the difference

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:58.470 
level it out so show you the difference
I<00:00:50.989> take<00:00:51.989> off<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:53.719> attitude<00:00:54.719> mode

right<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:02.270> think<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.540> left<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> right

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
right now I think from left to right

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.820 
right now I think from left to right
kind<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.730> levels<00:01:06.120> and<00:01:06.210> stuff<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.650> look

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
kind of levels and stuff out you look

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
kind of levels and stuff out you look
forward<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.280> levels<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:08.820> go<00:01:08.910> backwards<00:01:09.420> at

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
forward at levels or go backwards at

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.710 
forward at levels or go backwards at
levels

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.350 

now<00:01:14.170> if<00:01:14.230> I<00:01:14.320> switch<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.620> manual<00:01:15.010> mode<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:17.040> lot

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
now if I switch to manual mode a lot

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.760 
now if I switch to manual mode a lot
just<00:01:19.360> kind<00:01:19.600> of<00:01:19.630> stays<00:01:19.900> in<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.260> position<00:01:20.650> you

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
just kind of stays in the position you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.570 
just kind of stays in the position you
were<00:01:20.890> in<00:01:21.060> until<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.330> compensate<00:01:23.290> for<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.710> on

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
were in until you compensate for it on

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.360 
were in until you compensate for it on
your<00:01:25.030> controller<00:01:26.020> your<00:01:26.440> radio<00:01:27.510> this<00:01:28.510> can<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:30.340> a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
your controller your radio this can be a

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.880 
your controller your radio this can be a
little<00:01:30.700> hairy<00:01:31.030> at<00:01:31.270> times<00:01:32.730> but<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.560> get<00:01:35.710> some

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
little hairy at times but you get some

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.620 
little hairy at times but you get some
smooth<00:01:36.220> shots<00:01:36.580> like<00:01:36.940> right<00:01:37.180> now<00:01:37.330> I'm<00:01:37.510> gonna

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
smooth shots like right now I'm gonna

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.150 
smooth shots like right now I'm gonna
take<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.960> shot<00:01:38.230> is<00:01:38.440> tree<00:01:38.830> in<00:01:39.100> manual<00:01:39.520> mode<00:01:41.160> every

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
take a shot is tree in manual mode every

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.240 
take a shot is tree in manual mode every
little<00:01:42.430> position<00:01:44.880> keeps<00:01:45.880> until<00:01:46.360> I<00:01:47.250> compensate

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
little position keeps until I compensate

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.000 
little position keeps until I compensate
for<00:01:48.700> in<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:48.970> opposite<00:01:49.360> direction<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.920> gonna

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
for in the opposite direction I'm gonna

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.170 
for in the opposite direction I'm gonna
switch<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:52.530> attitude<00:01:53.530> mode<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.700> now<00:01:55.000> that

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
switch to attitude mode and now that

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.270 
switch to attitude mode and now that
little<00:01:55.330> like<00:01:55.540> pop<00:01:55.900> up<00:01:55.930> or<00:01:56.590> pop<00:01:56.830> down<00:01:57.070> ever

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
little like pop up or pop down ever

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.130 
little like pop up or pop down ever
you're<00:01:57.490> doing<00:01:57.880> I<00:01:58.090> don't<00:01:58.630> know<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.840> can<00:01:58.930> look<00:01:59.050> a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
you're doing I don't know it can look a

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.120 
you're doing I don't know it can look a
little<00:01:59.350> jittery<00:01:59.530> in<00:02:00.010> your<00:02:00.430> video<00:02:01.860> now<00:02:02.860> one

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
little jittery in your video now one

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.120 
little jittery in your video now one
thing<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.400> note<00:02:03.520> when<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.300> land

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.460 

and<00:02:07.549> land<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.240> wouldn't<00:02:08.509> recommend<00:02:08.630> landing<00:02:09.350> in

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
and land I wouldn't recommend landing in

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.460 
and land I wouldn't recommend landing in
manual<00:02:09.860> mode<00:02:09.890> because<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:11.420> rotors<00:02:11.780> don't

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
manual mode because the rotors don't

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.260 
manual mode because the rotors don't
shut<00:02:12.800> off<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.250> don't<00:02:13.459> know<00:02:13.520> why<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.240> I

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
shut off I don't know why that is that I

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.550 
shut off I don't know why that is that I
guess<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.780> missed<00:02:14.990> that<00:02:15.080> in<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.380> manual

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
guess I missed that in the manual

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.290 
guess I missed that in the manual
somewhere<00:02:16.450> in<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.569> instructions<00:02:18.430> but<00:02:19.430> they

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
somewhere in the instructions but they

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.150 
somewhere in the instructions but they
don't<00:02:20.480> shut<00:02:20.660> off<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.110> always<00:02:21.470> switch<00:02:21.800> back

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
don't shut off so I always switch back

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.590 
don't shut off so I always switch back
to<00:02:22.190> when<00:02:22.670> I'm<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:22.910> manual<00:02:23.239> mode<00:02:23.270> I'm<00:02:23.420> gonna<00:02:23.540> go

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
to when I'm in manual mode I'm gonna go

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.890 
to when I'm in manual mode I'm gonna go
to<00:02:23.660> manual<00:02:23.959> mode<00:02:23.989> right<00:02:24.260> now<00:02:25.600> very<00:02:26.600> very

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
to manual mode right now very very

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.690 
to manual mode right now very very
subtle<00:02:27.380> moves<00:02:27.590> when<00:02:27.860> I'm<00:02:27.950> in<00:02:28.069> manual<00:02:28.489> mode

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
subtle moves when I'm in manual mode

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.240 
subtle moves when I'm in manual mode
I<00:02:29.060> want<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.780> land<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:32.350> always<00:02:33.350> go<00:02:33.530> back<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.770> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
I want to land I always go back to the
