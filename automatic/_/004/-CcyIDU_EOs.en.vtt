00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.980
 A new oil that I bought completely 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.260
 by chance in the department of indian cosmetics i 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.490
 I tried this oil I put it on 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.920
 fingers she is very soft she to me 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.869
 it seems to be very similar in consistency 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.529
 silicone we use for hair 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.809
 so that the hair did not shine 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.820
 split ends so today I 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.309
 I decided to check this oil I washed 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.460
 hair this oil needs to be applied on 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.969
 wet hair before drying 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.579
 it is also thermally protected 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.579
 drying blown restore split 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.920
 tips if you rub it into the root then she 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.530
 promotes hair growth and since she 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.120
 not very cheap and not very much I 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.920
 I will use it only for 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.649
 tips because tips 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.659
 really dry and have not very 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.150
 beautiful view that's why i will apply it 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.810
 then on dry hair hair dryer will tell you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.270
 Effect 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.229
 the composition of this oil includes fruit 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.020
 extracts vitamins conditioner and some 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.040
 flavoring but it is much cheaper 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.229
 comes out than liquid silicone 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.009
 we put on the hairs strand 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.860
 behind the strand 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:34.009
 Only where Iâ€™m spotted will I apply 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:37.890

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.860
 a little here let's say such inanimate ones that is 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.790
 here I have a root more healthy a 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.290
 these tips are not all bad 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.090

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.520
 a drop of oil it needs at all 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.990
 a little bit and so on the hairs 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.210
 spin by spin 0 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.790
 this oil can also be applied to dry 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.090
 hair for example if you woke up in the morning 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.030

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.080

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:22.030
