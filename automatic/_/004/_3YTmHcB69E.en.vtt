far as I know this is the only unit that

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.279 
far as I know this is the only unit that
uses<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.320> type<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.800> relays<00:00:17.279> I've<00:00:18.090> never<00:00:18.960> seen

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
uses that type of relays I've never seen

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.980 
uses that type of relays I've never seen
another<00:00:19.830> one<00:00:20.160> I'm<00:00:20.939> not<00:00:21.449> saying<00:00:21.779> they're<00:00:21.960> not

another one I'm not saying they're not

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.650 
another one I'm not saying they're not
out<00:00:22.230> there<00:00:22.260> I've<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:23.070> never<00:00:23.189> seen<00:00:23.430> them<00:00:23.660> so

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
out there I've just never seen them so

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.839 
out there I've just never seen them so
we<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.410> full<00:00:25.800> chain<00:00:26.130> drive<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.640> this

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
we have the full chain drive on this

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.790 
we have the full chain drive on this
with<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.449> three<00:00:27.840> piece<00:00:28.109> T<00:00:29.039> rail<00:00:30.560> very<00:00:31.560> nice

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
with the three piece T rail very nice

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.910 
with the three piece T rail very nice
unit<00:00:32.160> Matt<00:00:32.369> showed<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> same<00:00:33.000> unit<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.920> really

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
unit Matt showed the same unit I really

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
unit Matt showed the same unit I really
do<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.489> unit<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.420> open<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:36.989> up

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
do like this unit this I open this up

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.190 
do like this unit this I open this up
cleaned<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.149> actually<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
cleaned it out this here is actually a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.940 
cleaned it out this here is actually a
direct<00:00:40.550> drive<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:42.629> sprocket<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> top<00:00:43.620> is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
direct drive the sprocket on the top is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.880 
direct drive the sprocket on the top is
right<00:00:44.489> off<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> motor<00:00:45.480> must<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> special

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
right off the motor must be a special

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.510 
right off the motor must be a special
slow<00:00:47.579> speed<00:00:48.000> motor<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.989> doesn't<00:00:49.520> you

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
slow speed motor so that it doesn't you

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.740 
slow speed motor so that it doesn't you
know<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.390> took<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> regular

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
know because you just took a regular

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.630 
know because you just took a regular
motor<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.260> put<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.649> chain<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.399> move

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
motor and put it on this chain it move

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.720 
motor and put it on this chain it move
you<00:00:54.329> know<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.480> didn't<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> freaking

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
you know I didn't be a freaking

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.069 
you know I didn't be a freaking
accelerator<00:00:56.730> times<00:00:57.090> three<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.629> mean<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.989> would

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
accelerator times three I mean it would

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
accelerator times three I mean it would
be<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> freakin<00:00:58.530> fast<00:00:58.859> opener<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.480> one

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
be a freakin fast opener so this one

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.650 
be a freakin fast opener so this one
must<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.320> special<00:01:01.969> slowdown<00:01:02.969> motor<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
must have a special slowdown motor in it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.899 
must have a special slowdown motor in it
but<00:01:04.260> that's<00:01:04.439> great<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> mean<00:01:04.890> there's<00:01:05.220> no<00:01:05.549> gears

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
but that's great I mean there's no gears

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.740 
but that's great I mean there's no gears
to<00:01:06.150> fail<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.380> traveler<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.040> metal<00:01:08.750> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
to fail if that traveler was metal you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.880 
to fail if that traveler was metal you
know<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.110> only<00:01:10.229> thing<00:01:10.350> you'll<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> go

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
know the only thing you'll have to go

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.350 
know the only thing you'll have to go
wrong<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.340> unit<00:01:11.640> would<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.760> electrical

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
wrong with this unit would be electrical

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.530 
wrong with this unit would be electrical
this<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.560> has<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> board<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.450> this

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
this one has a board there is and this

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
this one has a board there is and this
is<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.900> magnetic<00:01:16.259> relays<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> board

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
is not magnetic relays this is a board

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.940 
is not magnetic relays this is a board
unit<00:01:19.340> very<00:01:20.340> very<00:01:20.580> nice<00:01:20.759> unit

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
unit very very nice unit

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.649 
unit very very nice unit
very<00:01:22.950> very<00:01:23.100> nice<00:01:23.369> unit<00:01:23.729> indeed<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.060> saw<00:01:24.330> one

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
very very nice unit indeed I saw one

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.020 
very very nice unit indeed I saw one
other<00:01:24.840> unit<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:26.340> didn't<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
other unit like this we didn't get it I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.340 
other unit like this we didn't get it I
think<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> guy<00:01:27.540> must<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.930> put<00:01:28.110> his<00:01:28.259> own

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
think the guy must have put his own

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.719 
think the guy must have put his own
opener<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.350> never<00:01:31.560> never<00:01:32.340> went<00:01:32.610> back

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
opener in and we never never went back

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.429 
opener in and we never never went back
and<00:01:32.909> replaced<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.420> what<00:01:33.570> was<00:01:33.810> wrong<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.259> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and replaced it what was wrong with it

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.010 
and replaced it what was wrong with it
though<00:01:34.619> was<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> traveler<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.840> those<00:01:36.990> two

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
though was the traveler on it those two

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.929 
though was the traveler on it those two
little<00:01:37.470> tabs<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> side<00:01:38.670> where<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
little tabs there on the side where the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.179 
little tabs there on the side where the
pin<00:01:39.210> goes<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.659> through<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.890> were<00:01:40.950> just

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
pin goes up through they were just

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.280 
pin goes up through they were just
cracked<00:01:41.430> right<00:01:41.640> off<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.180> mean<00:01:42.600> there's<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
cracked right off I mean there's you

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.620 
cracked right off I mean there's you
know<00:01:43.350> no<00:01:43.649> way<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.189> traveler<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.329> grab

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
know no way for the traveler to grab

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.569 
know no way for the traveler to grab
onto<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.079> chain<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.920> were<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.189> broken

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
onto the chain they were just broken

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.690 
onto the chain they were just broken
right<00:01:47.790> off<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.560> know<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> said<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.579> know

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
right off so you know I said you know

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.800 
right off so you know I said you know
you're<00:01:50.850> gonna<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.240> replace<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.689> because

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you're gonna have to replace it because

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020 
you're gonna have to replace it because
we<00:01:52.079> can't<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.439> parts<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:52.890> those<00:01:53.070> probably

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
we can't get parts for those probably

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.350 
we can't get parts for those probably
could<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.270> rigged<00:01:54.390> something<00:01:54.710> but<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:57.270> know

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
could have rigged something but you know

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.179 
could have rigged something but you know
it<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.750> isn't<00:01:57.990> worth<00:01:58.229> messing<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.070> so

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
it just isn't worth messing with and so

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.590 
it just isn't worth messing with and so
I<00:01:59.219> think<00:01:59.640> he<00:01:59.790> might<00:01:59.969> went<00:02:00.180> out<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.390> did<00:02:00.479> his

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
I think he might went out and did his

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630 
I think he might went out and did his
old<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.899> old<00:02:00.990> said<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.860> he'd<00:02:02.130> give<00:02:02.310> us<00:02:02.430> call

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
old and old said we he'd give us call

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.550 
old and old said we he'd give us call
but<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> couple<00:02:04.079> months<00:02:04.290> ago<00:02:04.439> I

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.210 

very<00:02:47.390> nice<00:02:47.600> unit<00:02:48.020> though<00:02:48.140> I<00:02:48.470> mean<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.010> thing

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
very nice unit though I mean this thing

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.550 
very nice unit though I mean this thing
is<00:02:49.250> like<00:02:49.490> bulletproof<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:50.390> will<00:02:51.260> go<00:02:51.380> ahead<00:02:51.440> and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
is like bulletproof I will go ahead and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:05.790 
is like bulletproof I will go ahead and
run<00:02:51.800> this<00:02:51.950> down

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.430

light always stays on this one here was

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.320 
light always stays on this one here was
made<00:03:15.470> by<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.740> Alliance<00:03:16.400> manufacturing

company<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.590> then<00:03:19.100> also<00:03:19.280> for<00:03:19.670> radios<00:03:20.150> of

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
company and then also for radios of

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.120 
company and then also for radios of
course<00:03:20.570> this<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:20.930> before<00:03:21.140> building<00:03:21.590> radios

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
course this is before building radios

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.340 
course this is before building radios
this<00:03:22.970> has<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.330> three<00:03:23.510> terminals<00:03:23.960> on<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.110> side

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
this has the three terminals on the side

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.310 
this has the three terminals on the side
to<00:03:24.530> hook<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.770> genie<00:03:25.010> radio<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.490> or<00:03:26.320> actually

to hook the genie radio to or actually

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.140 
to hook the genie radio to or actually
might<00:03:27.530> maybe<00:03:28.310> could<00:03:28.520> hook<00:03:28.700> any<00:03:28.880> three

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
might maybe could hook any three

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.820 
might maybe could hook any three
terminal<00:03:29.510> ready<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.020> I'm<00:03:30.170> not<00:03:30.320> sure<00:03:30.590> I

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
terminal ready to that I'm not sure I

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.620 
terminal ready to that I'm not sure I
would<00:03:31.340> think<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:31.760> don't<00:03:31.790> think<00:03:32.000> genies<00:03:32.420> any

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
would think I don't think genies any

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.780 
would think I don't think genies any
different<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:32.990> anybody<00:03:33.290> else<00:03:33.440> of<00:03:34.400> course<00:03:34.460> they

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
different to anybody else of course they

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.000 
different to anybody else of course they
might<00:03:34.940> be<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.180> as<00:03:35.330> genie<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:36.590> there<00:03:36.770> we<00:03:36.860> have

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
might be it as genie so there we have

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.030 
might be it as genie so there we have
that<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.400> model<00:03:37.820> 200

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
that the model 200

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.730 
that the model 200
nice<00:03:40.610> nice<00:03:41.300> nice<00:03:41.540> unit<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:41.990> do<00:03:42.050> like<00:03:42.350> just<00:03:42.590> one

like you know I think I say that about

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.360 
like you know I think I say that about
pretty<00:03:47.150> much<00:03:47.240> every<00:03:47.570> unit<00:03:47.840> I<00:03:47.930> put<00:03:48.140> up<00:03:48.230> here<00:03:48.410> um
