do<00:00:22.940> work<00:00:23.240> yeah<00:00:23.510> yes<00:00:24.199> it<00:00:24.320> does<00:00:24.500> yeah<00:00:24.859> cause<00:00:25.250> of

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
do work yeah yes it does yeah cause of

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.679 
do work yeah yes it does yeah cause of
us<00:00:25.630> the<00:00:26.630> analytics<00:00:27.109> are<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:27.680> prove<00:00:27.859> that

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
us the analytics are to prove that

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.479 
us the analytics are to prove that
the<00:00:30.689> big<00:00:30.840> advantage<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.439> online<00:00:31.650> marketing<00:00:31.859> is
