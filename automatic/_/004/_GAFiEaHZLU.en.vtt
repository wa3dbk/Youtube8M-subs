00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.639
 Hey everyone, Dave with AmericanMuscle.com I'm here with Stage 3 of Project Grabber 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.520
 Increase, where in the typical model car project, we have changed our performance, I have dealt with 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.980
 Our comment, we added some bolt extras, and we were happy where the car was 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.950
 In, but now is the time to create the stage for some players enter the biggest, our face 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.760
 With GT 14. Before we get there, let's have my team and I give you an idea of ​​how 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 We got to where we are with our 06 GT. In Stage 2 we completed our corrected comment, 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.289
 Starting with an arsenal of parts of Real Performance, and finally we gave the draft hijacker 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.730
 Thanks to the support of some serious stopping forces for the DBA slotted rotors and ceramic plywood pads along 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.929
 With some brake lines from J &amp; M. Now that we have put the basic substrate out, it's time 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.969
 To my teammates I'm going down to some larger adjustment, with a name like Batch Grabber, you're 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.670
 Maybe you have an idea where we're going, Mike, there are a few ways to make others horsepower 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.000
 is not it? Mike: Exactly, I mean one of the ways you can do this is increase the engine to 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.310
 Displacement increase the proportion of pressure, both of which will require us to withdraw 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.140
 Auto out, take the pieces, rebuild it, and put it back on. There are a few other things 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.200
 We did in the engine such as throttle body or cold air intake and several rear axle for later 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.450
 Help him to breathe, but there is still something left, which would be a set of long tube 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.500
 Headers and off-road mid-pipe. Add a comment: This is why we have installed this set of long cook tube 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.180
 Headers, along with off-road X-pipes, and Cook is one of the best brand names in 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.990
 Business, it's not only because they have the quality of the product, and because they have 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.540
 The setting is great too, so you really get what you paid for with these adjustments. 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.940
 Dave: You could give these guys an idea of ​​why they're so important, why they're going to 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.300
 Help our car breathe much better? Add comment: Sure, so the stock heads we've had 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.250
 Here, along with the middle of the stock pipe, to really restrictive, as a result occurs 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.860
 To hang our performance, but adding these long tubes and mid-uncatted tubes will add 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.920
 Power we must see good gains. Dave: Now we have a car ready to throw more air into it 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.260
 Safe to say we are ready for our adder.Before the power we get though we have to make sure 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.810
 Our clutch and train engine can handle more power right? Mike: Sure, what we want 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.420
 To do is go with the Mach Exedy Phase 500 3 clutch, as well as Mach 3 Flywheel. 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.379
 This setting will be great for holding up on the street as well as assaulting us 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.250
 Go give it down the road. We went with the full face design in front of the imp, 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.480
 The imp has her individual teeth on it, which will be really great for a track 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.840
 The environment is not great but for everyday driving, you can get more in and out with Imp. With 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.010
 Full face, it will give us like the stock driveability but hold up to that pwer 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.330
 We're going to add in Stage 4. Dave: Mike, I've done a lot for the car, if you do not 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.170
 Mind, give these guys an idea of ​​what we've got. Mike: Sure for that we want to make 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.209
 Certainly the rest of the line engine will also withstand, so we have stock 2 pieces 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.280
 Drivshavt, it's heavy, it's weak, we want to get rid of it, we went with aluminum 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.290
 One piece is dry-shavt, it will save us 20 pounds of rotating block, which should be saved 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.720
 A few tenths on the track. Dave: That sounds great, and it really is not, there's something else 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.980
 I want to show people. We went forward and installed a short rough throw contest 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.410
 Shifter of Hearst, we took the car to follow in the early stages of the couple, actually 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.410
 Breaking the spikes of our Shifter stock they hold out, so we have to go with something stronger 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.190
 And best, we chose Hurst for short throw spells to limit our time quarter mile 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.819
 That's what we can so we can bang the gears all day long. This was the last part we wanted to 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.840
 Install at this point before we get our car over to Dyno and find out what kind of results 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.840
 We arrive before the confrontation between us and 14 and before the Snake power. Last time we ran the hijacker 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.349
 On Dyno's Phase 1 we put down 292 hp and 307 feet / lb of torque, with the 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.099
 Our 3-phase adjustment we ran only 301 horsepower and 316 ft / lb of torque, this gives us a peak 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.110
 Earn a horsepower of 9 and curve gains of 13 horsepower and 13 ft / lb of torque. The abductor 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.530
 The promotion has made a great power in stage 3 and it's right where we want it, at stage 4 we're going 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.599
 To pull out all the stops this car gives the snake the energy it needs. We're going to get on 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.230
 This car on the track and see how the wolf performs against the project, we will see you again 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.049
