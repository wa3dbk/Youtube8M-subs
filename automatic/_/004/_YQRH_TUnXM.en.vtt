00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.809
 so today we will try to connect our 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.639
 transmission 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.590
 simulator dance version you can not get all 4 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.090
 great simulator version great 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.660
 physics so let's see what we have here 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.480
 first we connect the transmitter used 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.550
 personal computer program via usb and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.890
 cable simulator special and now 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.450
 set it up 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:44.190
 systems selectable control 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:48.600
 here you can choose on this list now 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.739
 which we can have for the disc 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.620
 I am the same p and other things that is 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.359
 for example, I have a spectrum of this dx7 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.440
 buds by choice if you have hardware 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.840
 Arctic Giskara 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.560
 choose and something high-tech infernal 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 feet let four-channel think everything 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.680
 will go though here we have my 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.710
 this is and sky 4-5 but the transmitter is 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.130
 respectively for both the artery and for and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.770
 Russian suit our spectrum 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.580
 click finish after this is necessary 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.240
 calibrate 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.240
 transmitter 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.159
 press its transmitter accordingly 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.740
 here show that we have some 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.049
 channels have calibrated your time you have 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.860
 this will not be a window no fight do not be afraid 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.250
 click the calibrate button is written here 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.960
 that all switches should be put 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:02.330
 closer off state and knobs 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.420
 more precisely the costs in transmitters set 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.039
 one hundred percent desirable so be 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.039
 easier to tune transmitter 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.200
 Exhibit shown in the figure pen 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.710
 control on the transmitter to the center 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.580
 click next 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.240
 so not a mustache on turning in a circle up 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.050
 stop 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.090
 Russian and right turn one another 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.700
 just click next 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.060
 now on asking us to ask for 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.370
 flaps, landing gear and switches 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.120
 I think that this and will not deal with 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.830
 for the reason that it doesn't need anything 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.140
 currently click next 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:56.210
 principle on this we have all of the top 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.210
 see what happens here 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:13.380
 give gas left handle and up mallet 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:16.780
 went like this stop gas down 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.780
 We look as the steering wheel and the left handle works 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.300
 we went left 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.510
 the role of the direction to the left, respectively, 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.900
 to the right 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.850
 Taxi revenue dam right pen 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.670
 take over 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:39.370
 elevator up correctly 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.870
 under itself down or rum and push the handle 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.590
 right right 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.340
 right lyre he rose sharply white 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:52.150
 rose at handles right 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.880
 time you need 500 here it works click 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.880
 gas to failure and force 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:09.420
 Well, as we can see everything is tuned 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:14.870
 great now we take a look 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.870
 we can and land the plane 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.930
 the speed is lost the split would add 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.930
 but not all 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:36.830
 selim that we can still go 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:39.490
 systems and its transmitter did not need all 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.490
 come in 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.449
 who controls maybe you will 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.540
 work your transmitter with inversion 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:55.070
 when we press the edit profile button 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:58.040
 and then you can put a reverse and if u 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.770
 You like working gas rises 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.669
 handle it decreases then accordingly 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:10.300
 it is necessary on the gas channel that is 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:14.870
 andgein this left pen is promoting my 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.290
 for revenue up-down inverter is serious 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.169
 put a tick here in my case it 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:25.750
 you don't have to do it right there 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.750
 Respectively and change the channel numbers and 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.820
 click finish is the only thing that she 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.560
 can say that it is to make a copy 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.289
 profile 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.630
 legs says a little principle on this all 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.630
 completed thanks for attention
