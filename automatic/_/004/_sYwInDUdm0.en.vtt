25 or 30 minutes hi my friend so I

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.750 
25 or 30 minutes hi my friend so I
decided<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:17.030> make<00:03:17.239> some<00:03:18.970> quinoa<00:03:19.970> which<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.959> shot

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.240 
decided to make some quinoa which I shot
but<00:03:22.760> then<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.360> started<00:03:24.170> messing<00:03:24.680> around<00:03:24.769> with

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
but then I started messing around with

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.920 
but then I started messing around with
moving<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.970> camera<00:03:26.330> so<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.170> didn't<00:03:27.890> come<00:03:28.070> out

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
moving the camera so it didn't come out

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.699 
moving the camera so it didn't come out
and<00:03:29.930> now<00:03:30.230> i<00:03:30.260> can<00:03:30.830> get<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:32.080> little<00:03:33.080> mushroom

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
and now i can get the little mushroom

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.790 
and now i can get the little mushroom
bundles<00:03:34.280> out<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:35.120> we'll<00:03:35.780> prepare<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.320> plate<00:03:37.720> of

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
bundles out and we'll prepare a plate of

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.650 
bundles out and we'll prepare a plate of
our<00:03:39.800> mushrooms<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.760> made<00:03:40.970> some<00:03:41.180> clothes<00:03:41.630> on

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
our mushrooms and I made some clothes on

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.630 
our mushrooms and I made some clothes on
another<00:03:42.500> episode<00:03:43.390> we<00:03:44.390> will<00:03:44.630> do<00:03:44.989> how<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.590> make

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.860 

how<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.700> make<00:03:50.290> quinoa

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.640

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.020 
and I think it's going to be perfect for
this<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.849> here<00:03:59.120> is<00:03:59.269> it<00:03:59.510> came<00:03:59.659> out<00:03:59.810> perfectly

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030
