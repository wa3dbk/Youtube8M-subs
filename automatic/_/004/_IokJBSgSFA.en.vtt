00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.790
 Then it is the form of the left hand of chalking 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:12.230
 When I first decided to work for this 3 string 7 fret agency 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:15.500

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.880
 I Tteyuu high finger a little respect to this matter is coming in longer term point because 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.869

 And this index finger middle finger ring finger 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:39.070
 Prepare to come in as small and compact as these three can 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:41.050
 As it spreads like this, the power to raise this more and more is applied, so it is small 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.570
 Please stop 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.539
 And although I try to Econo Ma chalking

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.750
 [musics] 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.930
 Hey-this finger's first joint 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.580
 There is a second joint 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.150
 It is going to try to do well by simply bending and bending, but after all you can buy a tremendous burden on that finger 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.090
 I will 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:16.750
 So this hand will get tired soon so I will never move the joints here 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:20.770
 What is this if you try to go in a state of moving in the air in a state in which the reservoir or say 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.850
 It's just that your wrists rotate like this 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:29.220
 Masu This even enough Cho King Tatei 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.820
 Since it is yes not good to say it would be bent deeply to the customer the finger at Toka this bending and stretching 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.210

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.790

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.340
 Word will continue to chasing it in various places 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.340

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.950
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.950
 r 2 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:06.159
 You have changed little by little what Tteyuu is feeling to increase because there now various sound thickness of the strings 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:09.420
