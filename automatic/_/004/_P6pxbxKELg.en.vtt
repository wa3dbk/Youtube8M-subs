00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
so you're assuming there's going to be a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.719 
so you're assuming there's going to be a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
next time well so I think secrets are an

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.719 
next time well so I think secrets are an
important<00:01:48.210> part<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.510> every<00:01:48.780> relationship

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729
