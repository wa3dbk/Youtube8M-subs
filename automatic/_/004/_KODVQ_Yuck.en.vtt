00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
up my engineering approach I just say

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.460 
up my engineering approach I just say
just<00:01:15.090> throw<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> bunch<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.780> grenades<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.320> this

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
anyways I just ran around the circle

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.100 
anyways I just ran around the circle
right<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:29.700> knife<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> crawlers<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
right here knife in the crawlers and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.980 
right here knife in the crawlers and
stuff<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:32.640> as<00:01:32.909> i<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.630> leave

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
at certain dying so i slowed it down at

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.780 
at certain dying so i slowed it down at
the<00:01:36.720> end<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.079> see<00:01:37.320> how<00:01:38.100> many<00:01:38.310> points<00:01:38.549> i

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the end to see how many points i

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.399 
the end to see how many points i
actually<00:01:39.270> had<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.350> whatnot<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.960> yeah<00:01:43.340> but

that's<00:01:45.979> about<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.369> I<00:01:46.759> really<00:01:47.179> have<00:01:47.299> nothing

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
that's about it I really have nothing

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.800 
that's about it I really have nothing
else<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:47.929> say<00:01:48.189> I<00:01:49.189> will<00:01:49.819> try<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.179> start<00:01:50.479> making

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
else to say I will try to start making
