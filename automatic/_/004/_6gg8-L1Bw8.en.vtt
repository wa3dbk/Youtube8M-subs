00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.330
 at 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.620
 good 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.049
 what was the most closed in English found six for a score 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.019
 years and a little more time 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.859
 the world has talked a lot about the pq we have come to the responsibilities and 1 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.859
 $ 95 opening this line 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.140
 than talent 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.300
 it is true that the rhone was able to clear and a political consensus joined 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.679
 latest 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.870
 to finance the preliminary draft summary 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.750
 of asbestos round back this was a goal is the satellite coverage 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.670
 I take into account in the course 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.380
 the department I feel that this railroad may be a plus more particularly 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.800
 for dinner 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.370
 and the valleys yes provided that this railway does not stop at 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.710
 dinner otherwise I think the interim is ensured thereafter so much and 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.350
 yet it is true that for the opening up of mornings and 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.860
 prefecture city it seems obvious to me that it can be a plus 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.380
 since the study shows 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.700
 that would have started by about 900 travelers a day 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.510
 so with interest and it seems to me obvious push to resume in my 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.250
 as mayor I am a little more mixed because today all the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.939
 urban development 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.870
 it is in the immediate vicinity of the railway 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.440
 and so obviously my friend administered are not thrilled to see 13 9 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.440
 for borat sandra permission 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.580
 I like this project could integrate with respect to sustainable development 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.149
 I'm worth 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.890
 personally I'm not against this project 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.800
 I think that there are improvements to be made effectively at the level of 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.050
 noise but if there are frequent stops in relation to the fate 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.280
 of 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.440
 she was working and two high school girls were corrected we are at stake 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.370
 on tf1 rather favorable 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.580
 accessibility to didier currently as a prefecture city 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.960
 the point with its 12,000 jobs which seems to raise 6,8073 that follow a 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.170
 unworthy training there are deficits and moving 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.400
 in number on the premises 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.079
 the goal against the important mans 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:10.879
 so for 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.659
 it is obvious that one could move by the road is obvious 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.089
 it's the biggest traffic by road 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:21.369
 but the railroad to all armored all his whole interest of the om in a 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:26.879
 first time on an ecological level to avoid standing up the benefits of 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:27.969
 our environment 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.909
 and then if you want my worry your shoulder 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.239
 I think in the years to come 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.239
 the cost of the car on the track 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.979
 and we are unfortunately attending 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.979
 in the other provences were always the country dignois 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.049
 raise a weakness 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.769
 income of the population 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.890
 liquidate it so easier for proof by to play solidarity 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.389
 to subsidize as is currently the case 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.930
 the railway line between nice and worthy 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.930
 more subsidize a jeans line and it's up to the banks 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.249
 at the same time air transport 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.839
 I'll leave mutation it can be a longer time anyway 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.589
 dozen squarely in relation to the road although that from the beginning the 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.659
 bypassing to look like an umpteenth time do it because 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.530
 actually the traffic is more and more important despite all the 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:27.180
 work the study provides 900 passengers a day it will not settle the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.199
 money problem is flowing in shock 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.209
 alpha 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.949
 that does not prevent the other we were told 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.939
 favor this country who say 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.359
 many enemies talk to us about work 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.620
 it is the solutions that we propose to hide 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.319
 road service not 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.859
 the prefect said it to his wishes 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.699
 the president but a project own site me I guide them in these two files 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.389
 Additional 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.559
 the dispute 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.689
 this does not prevent the other and effect worked on both folders good 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.689
 that said that also a pressure that I attended 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.579
 as well as new sessions decreased by 1% 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.439
 it can not be excessively expensive at this reopening lane 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.649
 railway since 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.649
 the regulations are unchanged on level crossings 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.909
 It is necessary here only heavy infrastructure for the passage of the passenger 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.519
 the list of passengers note that it is extremely dangerous 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.990
 which gives directly on the rn1 to four tests 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.569
 with traffic lights so it was an extremely obligatory 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.650
 difficult 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.439
 the second and third cycles 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.529
 the wise men had raised at the first meeting the presentation of 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:38.650
 quote of this file in prefecture 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.240
 we must be careful that the reopening of the railway 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.240
 fading worthy it's not an extra argument 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.020
 abandoning the arkema site 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.069
 because to be able to pass 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.029
 to open this line we cross the peaks 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.260
 for all some of the landscaping 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.310
 colossal particulars of security trips said 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.699
 spheres that contain toxic products 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.319
 so you have to be very, very careful and make sure it's not a 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.770
 additional argument 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.830
 why back the sites of this sale arqana 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.689
 to morges side game thinks it is necessary to fight 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:19.770
 because we are in a period of economic difficulties school 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.330
 as I often say 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.139
 e a company sanÃ© savic it can disappear so it is always necessary 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.919
 search for activity 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.389
 and being served can support the creation of activities 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.330
 new 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.659
 arms 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:36.839
