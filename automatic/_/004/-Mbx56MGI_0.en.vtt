00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.230 
spins on the sunlight reflects on it off
of<00:05:49.590> it<00:05:50.270> onto<00:05:51.270> a<00:05:51.300> district<00:05:51.900> near<00:05:52.550> do<00:05:53.550> that<00:05:53.880> until

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
of it onto a district near do that until

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.000 
of it onto a district near do that until
it<00:05:54.690> hits<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.080> bottom<00:05:55.470> I<00:05:57.440> know<00:05:58.440> it<00:05:58.740> can<00:05:58.860> be<00:05:58.890> a

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
it hits the bottom I know it can be a

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.310 
it hits the bottom I know it can be a
very<00:05:59.430> tricky<00:06:00.420> mission<00:06:00.780> but<00:06:01.110> it's<00:06:01.200> actually

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
very tricky mission but it's actually

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.460 
very tricky mission but it's actually
kind<00:06:01.860> of<00:06:01.950> fun<00:06:02.160> actually<00:06:02.990> kind<00:06:03.990> of<00:06:04.050> a<00:06:04.200> fun

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
kind of fun actually kind of a fun

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.410 
kind of fun actually kind of a fun
mission<00:06:04.860> okay<00:06:05.430> where's<00:06:05.640> less<00:06:05.850> sunlight<00:06:06.120> going

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
mission okay where's less sunlight going

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.110 
mission okay where's less sunlight going
now<00:06:06.800> so<00:06:07.800> yeah<00:06:07.950> like<00:06:08.160> I<00:06:08.280> said<00:06:08.310> you<00:06:08.670> just<00:06:08.700> need<00:06:09.060> to

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
now so yeah like I said you just need to

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.070 
now so yeah like I said you just need to
keep<00:06:09.980> use<00:06:10.980> it<00:06:11.160> if<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.880> Sun<00:06:12.090> again<00:06:12.390> if<00:06:12.840> the

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
keep use it if the Sun again if the

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.900 
keep use it if the Sun again if the
sunlight<00:06:13.470> is<00:06:13.500> hitting<00:06:13.980> a<00:06:14.040> mirror<00:06:14.340> but<00:06:14.730> isn't

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
sunlight is hitting a mirror but isn't

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.300 
sunlight is hitting a mirror but isn't
reflecting<00:06:15.570> off<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:15.780> beer<00:06:16.170> you<00:06:16.800> need<00:06:17.010> to<00:06:17.130> hit

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
reflecting off the beer you need to hit

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.210 
reflecting off the beer you need to hit
them<00:06:17.490> year<00:06:17.870> so<00:06:18.870> it<00:06:19.170> sort<00:06:19.830> of<00:06:19.860> sound<00:06:20.070> like

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
them year so it sort of sound like

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.120 
them year so it sort of sound like
reflects<00:06:20.970> off<00:06:21.240> of<00:06:21.270> it<00:06:21.660> and<00:06:21.870> then<00:06:22.380> it<00:06:22.650> elect

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
reflects off of it and then it elect

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.470 
reflects off of it and then it elect
onto<00:06:23.430> another<00:06:23.580> major<00:06:23.850> then<00:06:24.060> you<00:06:24.150> need<00:06:24.300> to<00:06:24.390> hit

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
onto another major then you need to hit

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.470 
onto another major then you need to hit
that<00:06:24.690> one<00:06:24.900> so<00:06:25.170> the<00:06:25.260> Sun<00:06:25.440> reflects<00:06:25.920> off<00:06:26.130> that<00:06:29.480> it

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
that one so the Sun reflects off that it

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.390 
that one so the Sun reflects off that it
can<00:06:30.720> be<00:06:30.870> a<00:06:30.900> really<00:06:31.320> fun<00:06:31.470> mission<00:06:32.040> if<00:06:32.160> you<00:06:32.190> ask
