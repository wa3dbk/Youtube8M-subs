00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello there maybe a little bit 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.300
 windiness such open space 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.240
 we made a special trip because 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.250
 at home it's impossible to shoot this 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.619
 Nikita behind the scenes he helps me 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.930
 will comment as you go 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.720
 such author replicas embed 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.289
 so today i want to talk about 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.930
 tents specifically different models 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.090
 it will be a week of tents so every 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.770
 working day for five days 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.920
 accordingly we are every day 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.109
 lay out a new review of the tent different 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.039
 naturally therefore 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:43.019
 Ahead you will find an interesting week and 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.969
 now let's get my face started 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.190
 I have covered your back recently 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.530
 so when I'm in the frame I will be like this 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.479
 sometimes a crooked face muzzle will 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.789
 pump it all okay to me 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.559
 just hurt but the shooting was impossible 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.049
 cancel i'm holding on 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.879
 Now we talk about in my opinion 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.519
 the best tent which 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.280
 designed for cycling of those that 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.160
 I have met perhaps there is no better bet 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.190
 but better I have not seen it yet 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.400
 tent normal biker claimed 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.080
 manufacturer weight 3 kilograms 800 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.080
 gram let's check is it 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.540
 well let's go to install 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.670
 polat has antistorm delays i 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.830
 now did not install because it 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.320
 demonstration installation basically in 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.660
 they do not need 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.450
 with white well , I have not met a man 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.170
 who was able to fold this 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.350
 a tent 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.090
 arc anodized aluminum 80 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.400
 millimeters but here are their pudla 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.190
 snow can fold due to features 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.630
 tent designs but how do we see it 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:23.260
 no winter tent as not crawling out 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:29.670
 These are the real spaces. 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:33.310
 remove that is tent two entrances 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.260
 there which holds the vestibule 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.920
 into the outer mesh pocket and this is not 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.070
 very comfortable because alone 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.510
 refuel quite problematic though 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.510
 not impossible 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.790
 there is gum dream from the window 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:57.570
 2 vestibule 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:03.660
 and one from the opposite side is the zipper 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.660
 Entry made package can be unfastened 2 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:17.000
 make one big here 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.000
 use such 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.360
 or even the same 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.340
 her there, too, in a vestibule vestibule 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.920
 less but leave dirty clothes 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:35.010
 quite possibly shoes one more 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.240
 man in principle for a month is another 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.730
 vent window 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.990
 very interesting construction of a tent on 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.030
 each tent has two tails on 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.820
 every corner of the tent happiness will be removed 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.950
 let's say it happened the tray can be set 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:56.910
 mirror completely no matter what 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:04:00.180
 side is big there itself 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.340
 the tent has two entrances both 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.340
 duplicated mosquito net 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.020
 one entrance is big 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:24.300
 and the second is so big further inside 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.300
 tents have ventilation windows here and 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:37.930
 and a shelf for things the heart of the tent itself 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:40.169
 in one in one of the ends there are two 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.169
 pocket 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.960
 pockets in only one zords and here 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.380
 there is a very big drawback and this 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.910
 chambers when you sleep if condensate 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.280
 going because of the peculiarities of geometry 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.320
 he is always going but in any tent 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.660
 2 difficult going on the outer layer 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.750
 in case of careless movement you can shake 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.270
 tent and condensate clearly through the window 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.470
 kapnet on your face 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:12.010
 This is a minus due to the peculiarities of the geometry 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.380
 This tent should be set up from the first 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.050
 times it can be and not need to have 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.020
 some experience though in principle everything 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.830
 most simply and clearly dropped 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.830
 hooks all 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.140
 the main thing is not to forget about double cry speech 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.140
 This design features 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.140
 equipment provided to us by the company 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.560
 holodilnik.ru 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.510
 thanks for some kind of sponsorship very 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.760
 good beelman just great yourself 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.470
 showed to travel reliable lightweight 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.550
 failsafe like automaton collage 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.940
 Well, I was burning Nikita will be replicas 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.940
 insert
