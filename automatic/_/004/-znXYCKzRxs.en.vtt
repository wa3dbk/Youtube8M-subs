all<00:00:05.569> right<00:00:06.849> first<00:00:07.849> let's<00:00:08.059> take<00:00:08.179> a<00:00:08.240> look<00:00:08.450> at<00:00:08.540> the

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
all right first let's take a look at the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.560 
all right first let's take a look at the
definition<00:00:09.050> and<00:00:09.710> I<00:00:10.429> use<00:00:10.610> the<00:00:10.639> term<00:00:10.760> explosive

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
definition and I use the term explosive

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.350 
definition and I use the term explosive
plyometrics<00:00:12.230> like<00:00:13.160> Yosef<00:00:13.580> alluded<00:00:14.030> to<00:00:14.180> this<00:00:14.300> a

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
plyometrics like Yosef alluded to this a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.290 
plyometrics like Yosef alluded to this a
little<00:00:14.510> bit<00:00:15.189> to<00:00:16.189> distinguish<00:00:16.730> it<00:00:16.910> from<00:00:16.939> just

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
little bit to distinguish it from just

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.630 
little bit to distinguish it from just
plyometrics<00:00:18.019> today<00:00:20.680> we<00:00:21.680> hear<00:00:21.890> plyometrics

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
plyometrics today we hear plyometrics

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.290 
plyometrics today we hear plyometrics
being<00:00:23.000> used<00:00:23.240> all<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.750> time<00:00:24.789> you<00:00:25.789> pick<00:00:26.000> up<00:00:26.029> a

tough nights trainer I do plyometrics
sounds<00:00:44.690> good<00:00:45.550> but<00:00:46.550> what<00:00:46.730> does<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:46.850> mean<00:00:48.160> if<00:00:49.160> we

sounds good but what does it mean if we
talk<00:00:49.550> about<00:00:49.670> an<00:00:49.850> explosive<00:00:50.360> plyometrics<00:00:50.989> and

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
talk about an explosive plyometrics and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.340 
talk about an explosive plyometrics and
this<00:00:51.950> is<00:00:52.129> what<00:00:52.309> version<00:00:53.180> ski<00:00:53.420> who<00:00:53.600> we<00:00:53.750> say<00:00:54.200> is

this is what version ski who we say is
the<00:00:54.469> father<00:00:54.710> of<00:00:54.829> plyometrics<00:00:55.579> but<00:00:56.539> really<00:00:56.960> who

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
the father of plyometrics but really who

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.439 
the father of plyometrics but really who
developed<00:01:00.399> no<00:01:01.399> he<00:01:01.579> says<00:01:01.820> what<00:01:02.030> we<00:01:02.180> do<00:01:02.329> in<00:01:02.420> the

father I'm not the father of plyometrics

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:11.499 
father I'm not the father of plyometrics
he's<00:01:07.999> the<00:01:08.179> father<00:01:08.389> of<00:01:08.569> the<00:01:08.840> depth<00:01:09.109> jump<00:01:10.509> that's

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
he's the father of the depth jump that's

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.739 
he's the father of the depth jump that's
what<00:01:11.810> he<00:01:12.020> was<00:01:12.200> going<00:01:12.380> for<00:01:12.529> the<00:01:12.799> shock<00:01:13.069> method

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749 
what he was going for the shock method

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:16.769 
what he was going for the shock method
that's<00:01:14.749> what<00:01:15.020> he<00:01:15.109> considered<00:01:15.590> plyometrics

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:16.779 
that's what he considered plyometrics

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:19.629 
that's what he considered plyometrics
but<00:01:17.779> we<00:01:17.959> have<00:01:18.259> bastardized<00:01:18.889> the<00:01:19.099> term<00:01:19.340> and

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
but we have bastardized the term and

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:23.160 
but we have bastardized the term and
changed<00:01:20.509> it<00:01:20.630> around<00:01:20.749> to<00:01:21.679> every<00:01:21.979> little<00:01:22.219> jump

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
changed it around to every little jump

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.190 
changed it around to every little jump
became<00:01:24.170> plyometrics<00:01:25.299> but<00:01:26.299> for<00:01:26.450> applying<00:01:26.779> for

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
became plyometrics but for applying for

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.190 
became plyometrics but for applying for
an<00:01:27.289> exercise<00:01:27.709> to<00:01:27.889> be<00:01:28.009> plyometric<00:01:28.869> it<00:01:29.869> has<00:01:30.020> to

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
an exercise to be plyometric it has to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.199 
an exercise to be plyometric it has to
be<00:01:30.259> executed<00:01:30.979> between<00:01:32.229> 1500<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:34.219> 2000<00:01:34.969> of<00:01:35.119> a

be executed between 1500 to 2000 of a

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:40.390 
be executed between 1500 to 2000 of a
second<00:01:36.219> it's<00:01:37.219> fast

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.630 

and<00:01:41.410> volitionally<00:01:42.410> we<00:01:42.680> can<00:01:42.860> hardly<00:01:43.190> even<00:01:43.370> come

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
and volitionally we can hardly even come

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.830 
and volitionally we can hardly even come
close<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:44.000> doing<00:01:44.390> this<00:01:44.710> is<00:01:46.270> very<00:01:47.270> hard<00:01:47.480> for<00:01:47.630> us

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
close to doing this is very hard for us

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.900 
close to doing this is very hard for us
to<00:01:47.870> duplicate<00:01:48.530> execute<00:01:49.190> in<00:01:49.340> action<00:01:49.760> this

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
to duplicate execute in action this

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.630 
to duplicate execute in action this
quick<00:01:52.330> so<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.890> where<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.040> this<00:01:55.070> number<00:01:55.400> come

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
quick so and where is this number come

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.460 
quick so and where is this number come
from<00:01:56.650> this<00:01:57.650> is<00:01:57.890> how<00:01:58.070> what<00:01:59.060> we<00:01:59.240> see<00:01:59.480> in<00:01:59.810> many<00:02:00.140> in

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
from this is how what we see in many in

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.860 
from this is how what we see in many in
execution<00:02:01.160> of<00:02:01.220> many<00:02:01.430> sports<00:02:01.790> skills<00:02:02.090> in

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
execution of many sports skills in

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.950 
execution of many sports skills in

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
five hundredths of a second is for the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.770 
five hundredths of a second is for the
touchdown<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.820> less<00:02:25.820> than<00:02:26.090> five<00:02:26.360> hundredths

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
of a second for the push off that's fast

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.220 
of a second for the push off that's fast
but<00:02:33.950> if<00:02:34.040> I'm<00:02:34.190> going<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.430> do<00:02:37.480> am<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.630> duplicating

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
but if I'm going to do am I duplicating

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.300 
but if I'm going to do am I duplicating
that<00:02:39.380> speed<00:02:41.200> I'm<00:02:42.200> slow<00:02:42.500> as<00:02:42.560> molasses<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.250> a

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
that speed I'm slow as molasses on a

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.490 
that speed I'm slow as molasses on a
boom<00:02:43.670> but<00:02:44.120> yeah<00:02:44.330> we<00:02:44.480> call<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:44.810> plan<00:02:45.080> metrics

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
boom but yeah we call this plan metrics

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.509 
boom but yeah we call this plan metrics
a<00:02:48.010> world<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.400> difference<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:52.130> that's<00:02:52.340> why<00:02:52.489> i

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
a world of difference so that's why i

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.840 
a world of difference so that's why i
say<00:02:52.820> explosive<00:02:53.750> plyometrics<00:02:54.580> okay<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.640> worry

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
say explosive plyometrics okay to worry

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.610 
say explosive plyometrics okay to worry
i'm<00:02:56.450> getting<00:02:56.750> away<00:02:56.930> from<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.140> term<00:02:57.410> of

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
i'm getting away from the term of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.280 
i'm getting away from the term of
plyometrics<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.630> whenever<00:02:59.630> i<00:02:59.840> hear<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.110> term

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
plyometrics and whenever i hear the term

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.930 
plyometrics and whenever i hear the term
plyometrics<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.010> want<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.250> use<00:03:01.340> plyometrics

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
plyometrics you want to use plyometrics

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.310 
plyometrics you want to use plyometrics
hate<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.239> good<00:03:02.739> you<00:03:03.739> use<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.070> as<00:03:04.190> preparation

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
hate is good you use it as preparation

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.020 
hate is good you use it as preparation
for<00:03:06.320> explosive<00:03:07.040> plyometrics<00:03:09.370> it's<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.519> prelude

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
for explosive plyometrics it's a prelude

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.750 
for explosive plyometrics it's a prelude
it's<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.540> build-up<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.220> but<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.519> not

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
it's a build-up to it but it is not

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.260 
it's a build-up to it but it is not
plyometrics

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.410 

jump<00:03:19.020> training<00:03:19.640> jump<00:03:20.640> training<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.210> very

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
jump training jump training is very

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.330 
jump training jump training is very
effective<00:03:23.840> this<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:25.020> one<00:03:25.170> thing<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.800> see<00:03:26.310> a

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
effective this is one thing I I see a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.930 
effective this is one thing I I see a
lot<00:03:26.670> especially<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.390> any<00:03:27.690> Russian<00:03:28.380> literature

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
lot especially in any Russian literature

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.000 
lot especially in any Russian literature
they<00:03:29.940> distinguish<00:03:30.600> biometric<00:03:31.260> training<00:03:31.620> jump

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
they distinguish biometric training jump

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.970 
they distinguish biometric training jump
training<00:03:33.230> these<00:03:34.230> are<00:03:34.410> two<00:03:34.590> different

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
training these are two different

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.400 
training these are two different
categories<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.900> they<00:03:36.900> use<00:03:37.140> them<00:03:37.380> for

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
categories and they use them for

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.300 
categories and they use them for
different<00:03:37.770> times<00:03:39.530> for<00:03:40.530> example<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.010> volleyball

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
different times for example a volleyball

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.870 
different times for example a volleyball
player<00:03:41.460> basketball<00:03:42.210> player<00:03:42.650> many<00:03:43.650> times<00:03:43.920> they

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
player basketball player many times they

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.270 
player basketball player many times they
have<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.380> repeated<00:03:46.380> jumps<00:03:47.720> up<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.900> down

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
have to do repeated jumps up and down

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.030 
have to do repeated jumps up and down
they<00:03:50.280> have<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.550> continue<00:03:50.970> them<00:03:51.920> they<00:03:52.920> don't

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
they have to continue them they don't

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.620 
they have to continue them they don't
just<00:03:53.280> do<00:03:53.400> one<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.850> that's<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.180> sometimes

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
just do one and that's it sometimes

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.320 
just do one and that's it sometimes
that's<00:03:54.840> that's<00:03:55.170> all<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.940> so<00:03:56.940> if<00:03:57.180> they're

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
that's that's all it is so if they're

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.470 
that's that's all it is so if they're
going<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.510> be<00:03:57.600> doing<00:03:58.760> that's<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.880> even<00:04:00.270> in<00:04:00.390> the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
going to be doing that's a even in the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.410 
going to be doing that's a even in the
training<00:04:00.950> like<00:04:01.950> when<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:02.550> work<00:04:02.730> with<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:03.000> u.s.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.699 
at a time this was jump training this
was<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.570> develop<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.460> jump<00:04:14.460> endurance<00:04:15.620> if<00:04:16.620> I

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
was to develop the jump endurance if I

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.720 
was to develop the jump endurance if I
can<00:04:16.890> use<00:04:17.010> that<00:04:17.040> terima<00:04:18.950> we<00:04:19.950> did<00:04:20.459> many

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
can use that terima we did many

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.750 
can use that terima we did many

like<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.060> we<00:04:33.390> just<00:04:33.690> doing<00:04:33.900> repetitive<00:04:34.380> jumps

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
like that we just doing repetitive jumps

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.380 
like that we just doing repetitive jumps
where<00:04:36.060> speed<00:04:36.420> is<00:04:36.450> not<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.050> consequence

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
just height when you're trying to

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.070 
just height when you're trying to

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
house ok very Shan ski as I mentioned is

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.380 
house ok very Shan ski as I mentioned is
the<00:04:51.840> originator<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.850> plyometrics<00:04:53.850> as<00:04:54.000> we<00:04:54.150> know

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
the originator of plyometrics as we know

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.170 
the originator of plyometrics as we know
it<00:04:54.650> but<00:04:55.650> as<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.950> said<00:04:56.010> he<00:04:56.520> was<00:04:56.550> more<00:04:57.030> concerned

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
it but as I said he was more concerned

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.440 
it but as I said he was more concerned
with<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:58.110> depth<00:04:58.380> jump<00:04:58.820> this<00:04:59.820> was<00:05:00.090> what<00:05:00.330> he

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
with the depth jump this was what he

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.470 
with the depth jump this was what he
considered<00:05:00.960> plyometrics<00:05:01.669> so<00:05:02.669> when<00:05:03.120> he<00:05:03.330> was

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
considered plyometrics so when he was

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.050 
considered plyometrics so when he was
talking<00:05:03.630> about<00:05:03.810> plyometrics<00:05:04.650> he<00:05:05.550> was<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.730> shock

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
talking about plyometrics he was a shock

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.270 
talking about plyometrics he was a shock
method<00:05:06.510> and<00:05:07.850> in<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:09.000> shock<00:05:09.240> method<00:05:10.100> how<00:05:11.100> many

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
method and in the shock method how many

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.560 
method and in the shock method how many
of<00:05:11.370> you<00:05:11.460> are<00:05:11.490> familiar<00:05:11.610> heard<00:05:12.210> this<00:05:12.360> term

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
well let me kind of you know just go

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.490 
well let me kind of you know just go
over<00:05:18.270> maybe<00:05:18.600> not<00:05:18.840> go<00:05:19.020> into<00:05:19.140> too<00:05:19.350> much<00:05:19.380> detail

over maybe not go into too much detail
the<00:05:22.500> key<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:23.210> plyometrics<00:05:24.210> is<00:05:24.800> from<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.919> jump

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
the key to plyometrics is from a jump

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.150 
the key to plyometrics is from a jump
down<00:05:26.479> let<00:05:27.479> me<00:05:27.570> change<00:05:28.080> that<00:05:28.200> turn<00:05:28.530> not<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:28.830> jump

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
down let me change that turn not a jump

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.050 
down let me change that turn not a jump
down<00:05:29.310> from<00:05:29.370> a<00:05:29.760> drop-down

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
down from a drop-down

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.050 
down from a drop-down
you<00:05:32.060> don't<00:05:32.240> jump<00:05:32.540> down<00:05:33.550> but<00:05:34.550> as<00:05:34.670> you're<00:05:34.850> coming

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
you don't jump down but as you're coming

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.820 
you don't jump down but as you're coming
down<00:05:36.280> when<00:05:37.280> you<00:05:37.430> hit<00:05:38.170> it's<00:05:39.170> a<00:05:39.290> shock<00:05:39.560> to<00:05:39.590> the

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
down when you hit it's a shock to the

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.390 
down when you hit it's a shock to the
body<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:41.650> then<00:05:42.650> the<00:05:42.770> muscles<00:05:43.220> will

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
body and then the muscles will

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.100 
body and then the muscles will
volitionally<00:05:44.360> automatically<00:05:45.200> contract<00:05:47.110> the

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
volitionally automatically contract the

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.500 
volitionally automatically contract the
faster<00:05:48.650> they<00:05:48.770> contract<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:50.360> more

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
faster they contract and the more

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.990 
faster they contract and the more
intensely<00:05:51.080> they<00:05:51.350> contract<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:52.760> less<00:05:52.970> you

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
intensely they contract the less you

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.770 
intensely they contract the less you
going<00:05:53.300> to<00:05:53.390> go<00:05:53.480> down<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:55.520> slower<00:05:55.880> and<00:05:56.210> easier

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
going to go down the slower and easier

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.870 
going to go down the slower and easier
they<00:05:56.990> contract<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:58.220> further<00:05:58.490> you're<00:05:58.760> going

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
they contract the further you're going

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.130 
they contract the further you're going
to<00:05:58.940> go<00:05:59.060> down<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:01.130> further<00:06:01.400> you<00:06:01.520> go<00:06:01.700> down<00:06:02.140> the

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
to go down the further you go down the

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.650 
to go down the further you go down the
more<00:06:03.350> time<00:06:03.650> you're<00:06:03.830> taking<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:05.090> slow<00:06:05.420> of<00:06:05.570> the

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
more time you're taking the slow of the

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.800 
more time you're taking the slow of the
total<00:06:05.990> movement<00:06:07.240> the<00:06:08.240> more<00:06:08.450> you<00:06:08.480> can

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
total movement the more you can

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.700 
total movement the more you can
withstand<00:06:09.670> the<00:06:10.670> forces<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:11.450> have<00:06:12.350> a<00:06:12.380> very

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
withstand the forces and have a very

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.380 
withstand the forces and have a very
powerful<00:06:13.010> contraction<00:06:15.100> eccentric

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
powerful contraction eccentric

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.780 
powerful contraction eccentric
contraction<00:06:18.010> then<00:06:19.010> that's<00:06:19.280> going<00:06:19.490> to<00:06:19.550> stop

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
contraction then that's going to stop

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.450 
contraction then that's going to stop
the<00:06:19.940> down<00:06:20.180> and<00:06:20.560> you're<00:06:21.560> going<00:06:21.710> to<00:06:21.800> create<00:06:22.070> in

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
the down and you're going to create in

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.330 
the down and you're going to create in
this<00:06:22.760> eccentric<00:06:23.210> contraction<00:06:23.900> a<00:06:24.340> tremendous

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
this eccentric contraction a tremendous

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.830 
this eccentric contraction a tremendous
amount<00:06:25.760> of<00:06:25.970> tension<00:06:26.680> built<00:06:27.680> in<00:06:27.950> force<00:06:28.840> that

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
amount of tension built in force that

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.060 
amount of tension built in force that
you<00:06:30.080> can<00:06:30.290> then<00:06:30.500> use<00:06:30.890> on<00:06:31.220> the<00:06:32.060> return<00:06:32.950> but<00:06:33.950> the

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
you can then use on the return but the

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.860 
you can then use on the return but the
more<00:06:34.220> you<00:06:34.280> go<00:06:34.520> down<00:06:34.790> the<00:06:35.090> more<00:06:35.240> you<00:06:35.390> lose<00:06:35.630> it

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
more you go down the more you lose it

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.960 
more you go down the more you lose it
and<00:06:36.130> you're<00:06:37.130> not<00:06:37.160> going<00:06:37.340> to<00:06:37.430> have<00:06:37.580> that<00:06:37.610> power

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
and you're not going to have that power

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.360 
and you're not going to have that power
to<00:06:38.300> return<00:06:39.670> so<00:06:40.670> it's<00:06:40.850> a<00:06:40.940> very<00:06:40.970> forced

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
to return so it's a very forced

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.090 
to return so it's a very forced
volitional<00:06:43.370> contraction<00:06:44.180> and<00:06:44.710> the<00:06:45.710> stronger

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
volitional contraction and the stronger

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.390 
volitional contraction and the stronger
you<00:06:46.430> can<00:06:46.460> get<00:06:46.790> that<00:06:46.970> forced<00:06:47.450> reaction<00:06:48.400> the

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
you can get that forced reaction the

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.020 
you can get that forced reaction the
more<00:06:49.580> powerful<00:06:49.940> will<00:06:50.330> be<00:06:50.480> the<00:06:50.720> return<00:06:51.230> jump<00:06:52.030> so

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
more powerful will be the return jump so

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.380 
more powerful will be the return jump so
this<00:06:53.330> was<00:06:53.570> the<00:06:53.600> shock<00:06:54.880> but<00:06:55.880> you<00:06:56.000> can't<00:06:56.240> go

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
this was the shock but you can't go

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.390 
this was the shock but you can't go
crazy<00:06:56.690> with<00:06:56.960> the<00:06:57.050> height<00:06:57.230> of<00:06:57.260> the<00:06:57.530> of<00:06:57.680> the<00:06:58.130> jump

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
crazy with the height of the of the jump

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.020 
crazy with the height of the of the jump
down<00:06:58.610> or<00:06:59.330> the<00:06:59.540> drop<00:06:59.780> down<00:07:00.610> the<00:07:01.610> heights<00:07:01.820> get

down or the drop down the heights get

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.280 
down or the drop down the heights get
too<00:07:02.270> high<00:07:04.060> psychologically<00:07:05.060> it<00:07:05.570> wears<00:07:05.990> on<00:07:06.230> e

athlete the rushes have found if they

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.230 
athlete the rushes have found if they
had<00:07:08.870> the<00:07:09.020> athletes<00:07:09.440> jumping<00:07:09.860> from<00:07:10.040> nine<00:07:10.880> feet

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
had the athletes jumping from nine feet

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.240 
had the athletes jumping from nine feet
or<00:07:11.390> more<00:07:11.620> they<00:07:12.620> didn't<00:07:12.830> want<00:07:12.980> to<00:07:13.040> do<00:07:13.130> it

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
or more they didn't want to do it

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.879 
or more they didn't want to do it
anymore

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889 
anymore

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:19.619 
anymore
too<00:07:15.759> high<00:07:18.270> psychological<00:07:19.270> you<00:07:19.360> know<00:07:19.449> isn't

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:19.629 
too high psychological you know isn't

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:23.519 
too high psychological you know isn't
that<00:07:19.749> good<00:07:20.759> and<00:07:21.759> then<00:07:22.569> then<00:07:22.870> when<00:07:23.259> the<00:07:23.349> height

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:23.529 
that good and then then when the height

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:28.700 
that good and then then when the height
got<00:07:23.740> too<00:07:23.949> high<00:07:24.180> just<00:07:25.180> drop<00:07:26.110> down<00:07:26.349> and<00:07:26.620> hold

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.710 
got too high just drop down and hold

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.129 
got too high just drop down and hold
that's<00:07:29.710> kind<00:07:30.159> of<00:07:30.219> a<00:07:30.310> unique<00:07:30.430> concept<00:07:31.120> but<00:07:31.960> this

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:32.139 
that's kind of a unique concept but this

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:33.749 
that's kind of a unique concept but this
is<00:07:32.289> another<00:07:32.499> training<00:07:32.889> and<00:07:33.159> we<00:07:33.370> nited<00:07:33.669> states

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 
is another training and we nited states

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:37.170 
is another training and we nited states
we<00:07:34.029> call<00:07:34.300> this<00:07:34.509> the<00:07:34.719> altitude<00:07:35.229> jump<00:07:36.090> where<00:07:37.090> you

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
we call this the altitude jump where you

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.050 
we call this the altitude jump where you
drop<00:07:37.419> down<00:07:37.569> and<00:07:37.779> hold<00:07:38.310> it's<00:07:39.310> a<00:07:39.460> great<00:07:39.729> exercise

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.060 
drop down and hold it's a great exercise

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.570 
drop down and hold it's a great exercise
to<00:07:40.270> develop<00:07:40.840> that<00:07:40.930> eccentric<00:07:41.319> strength<00:07:41.770> to

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 
to develop that eccentric strength to

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.350 
to develop that eccentric strength to
stop<00:07:42.879> you<00:07:43.090> from<00:07:43.120> going<00:07:43.779> all<00:07:44.020> the<00:07:44.110> way<00:07:44.229> down<00:07:45.360> now

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 
stop you from going all the way down now

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.820 
stop you from going all the way down now
this<00:07:46.539> type<00:07:46.779> of<00:07:46.810> strength<00:07:47.199> is<00:07:47.349> also<00:07:47.500> very

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:47.830 
this type of strength is also very

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.100 
this type of strength is also very
important<00:07:48.279> in<00:07:48.370> many<00:07:48.460> sports<00:07:48.870> can<00:07:49.870> you<00:07:49.990> think

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.110 
important in many sports can you think

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.350 
important in many sports can you think
of<00:07:50.259> another<00:07:50.349> example<00:07:50.949> where<00:07:51.279> you<00:07:51.939> would<00:07:52.120> see

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360
