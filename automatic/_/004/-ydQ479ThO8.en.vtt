this just changes it all up again and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.240 
this just changes it all up again and
means<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.320> higher<00:02:22.590> by<00:02:22.800> now<00:02:22.980> means

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
means that the higher by now means

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.620 
means that the higher by now means
you're<00:02:23.370> going<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.580> get<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.790> bigger<00:02:24.210> players

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
where most of the silver cards are

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.150 
where most of the silver cards are
that's<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> maximum<00:03:01.800> you're<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:02.100> to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
that's the maximum you're going to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.890 
that's the maximum you're going to
really<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.430> going<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:03.090> find<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.420> lot<00:03:03.600> of<00:03:03.720> players

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
really be going to find a lot of players

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.530 
really be going to find a lot of players
so<00:03:04.200> anyway<00:03:04.800> guys<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.220> method<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:05.820> mostly

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
so anyway guys this method is mostly

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.310 
so anyway guys this method is mostly
useful<00:03:07.290> when<00:03:07.860> you're<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.690> morning<00:03:10.110> kind

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
high traffic times it's not best and

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.410 
high traffic times it's not best and
worked<00:03:17.370> putting<00:03:17.700> lotion<00:03:17.910> every<00:03:18.150> time<00:03:18.300> that
