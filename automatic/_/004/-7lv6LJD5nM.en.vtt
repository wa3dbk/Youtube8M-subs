ratios like that before so clearly

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.220 
ratios like that before so clearly
something's<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.430> little<00:02:32.459> off<00:02:32.730> there<00:02:33.599> that's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
something's a little off there that's

something's a little off there that's
that's<00:02:34.620> something<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.069> worked<00:02:35.730> out<00:02:35.940> through

from the 15 seconds of wind that you get

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
with killing spree but the only problem

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.960 
with killing spree but the only problem
with<00:02:55.230> killing<00:02:55.410> spree<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.250> useless<00:02:56.640> for

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
with killing spree is it's useless for

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.300 
with killing spree is it's useless for
the<00:02:57.060> other<00:02:57.209> two<00:02:57.750> minutes<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.170> 45<00:02:58.650> seconds<00:02:59.130> I

the other two minutes and 45 seconds I

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.910 
the other two minutes and 45 seconds I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
mean you know apart from CC and whatnot

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.940 
mean you know apart from CC and whatnot
but<00:03:02.130> basically<00:03:02.640> damage<00:03:03.329> output<00:03:03.769> pretty<00:03:04.769> much

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
but basically damage output pretty much

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.520 
but basically damage output pretty much

subtlety is a little better you can put

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.089 
subtlety is a little better you can put

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
decent burst damage out and that's what

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.059 
decent burst damage out and that's what

spree<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.670> only<00:03:26.819> thing<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.209> found<00:03:27.450> that

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.940 
could kill healers subtlety mutilate
mutilate<00:03:32.160> just<00:03:32.459> doesn't<00:03:32.790> have<00:03:32.940> enough<00:03:32.970> burst

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
mutilate just doesn't have enough burst

mutilate just doesn't have enough burst
the<00:03:34.950> sustained<00:03:35.370> dps<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:36.060> not<00:03:36.239> what<00:03:36.569> you<00:03:36.600> need

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079

of bursty you've just like the only way
to<00:03:45.420> win<00:03:46.139> is<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.380> burst<00:03:46.799> if<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.730> heal<00:03:48.269> i<00:03:48.299> can<00:03:48.600> heal

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
the maximum like 30 seconds of just

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
straight CC I mean maybe maybe not quite

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.190 
straight CC I mean maybe maybe not quite
that<00:04:04.920> much<00:04:05.310> depending<00:04:06.030> on<00:04:06.209> your<00:04:06.359> burst<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:07.170> I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
that much depending on your burst but I

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.110 
that much depending on your burst but I

if<00:04:11.790> you're<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:11.970> mage<00:04:12.209> priest<00:04:12.569> team<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.260> can

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
if you're a mage priest team you can

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.589 
if you're a mage priest team you can
have<00:04:13.560> your<00:04:14.190> nap<00:04:14.370> both<00:04:14.900> but<00:04:16.729> anyway<00:04:17.729> what<00:04:18.570> I

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
have your nap both but anyway what I

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.039 
have your nap both but anyway what I
found<00:04:18.810> best<00:04:19.139> is<00:04:19.380> either<00:04:19.590> combat<00:04:20.690> with<00:04:21.690> certain

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
found best is either combat with certain

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.440 
found best is either combat with certain
healers<00:04:22.409> like<00:04:22.950> my<00:04:23.400> shaman<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.030> could<00:04:24.210> kill

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
healers like my shaman I could kill

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.129 
healers like my shaman I could kill
other<00:04:24.630> healers<00:04:25.110> as<00:04:25.289> combat

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
other healers as combat

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.920 
other healers as combat
so<00:04:27.289> combat<00:04:27.860> with<00:04:28.159> certain<00:04:28.759> healers<00:04:29.090> shamans

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
so combat with certain healers shamans

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.749 
so combat with certain healers shamans
priests<00:04:30.560> doesn't<00:04:31.159> seem<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.400> work<00:04:31.490> with<00:04:31.699> a

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
pally subtlety with mages and it worked

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.909 
pally subtlety with mages and it worked
with<00:04:38.479> a<00:04:38.509> boomkin<00:04:38.779> as<00:04:39.080> well<00:04:39.289> but<00:04:39.590> I'd<00:04:39.680> probably
