00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.679 
back together I've tried that before the
problem<00:00:31.070> is<00:00:31.279> it<00:00:31.400> hardens<00:00:31.760> up<00:00:31.939> and<00:00:32.239> it<00:00:32.390> makes

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
problem is it hardens up and it makes

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.219 
problem is it hardens up and it makes
the<00:00:32.840> plastic<00:00:33.260> really<00:00:34.629> friable<00:00:35.629> breakable

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:36.229 
the plastic really friable breakable

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:37.990 
the plastic really friable breakable
doesn't<00:00:36.559> doesn't<00:00:37.100> really<00:00:37.309> work<00:00:37.550> as<00:00:37.699> well<00:00:37.879> as

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
doesn't doesn't really work as well as

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.340 
doesn't doesn't really work as well as
I'd<00:00:38.089> like<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:38.540> I<00:00:38.690> heard<00:00:38.870> good<00:00:39.019> things<00:00:39.080> about

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350

Minda<00:00:39.800> I'm<00:00:39.920> gonna<00:00:40.070> give<00:00:40.250> it<00:00:40.339> a<00:00:40.400> shot<00:00:40.430> today<00:00:40.909> the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
Minda I'm gonna give it a shot today the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.570 
Minda I'm gonna give it a shot today the
idea<00:00:41.900> what<00:00:42.110> is<00:00:42.290> it<00:00:42.500> doesn't<00:00:42.650> just<00:00:42.830> glued

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
idea what is it doesn't just glued

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.920 
idea what is it doesn't just glued
together<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:44.030> actually<00:00:44.239> kind<00:00:44.390> of<00:00:44.420> melts<00:00:44.809> the

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
together it actually kind of melts the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.160 
together it actually kind of melts the
plastic<00:00:44.960> back<00:00:45.500> together<00:00:46.120> this<00:00:47.120> is<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.600> half

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
let's get a little bit of this and we'll

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.970 
let's get a little bit of this and we'll
just<00:01:39.860> apply<00:01:40.040> it<00:01:40.810> right<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.110> center<00:01:42.380> here

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.830 

yeah<00:01:45.980> this<00:01:46.130> plastic<00:01:46.580> just<00:01:46.730> got<00:01:46.910> torn<00:01:47.300> up<00:01:47.570> by

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
yeah this plastic just got torn up by

yeah this plastic just got torn up by
fast<00:01:48.800> hitting<00:01:49.190> it<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.640> by<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.560> big<00:01:53.170> hooks<00:01:54.170> I've

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
fast hitting it and by a big hooks I've

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.040 
fast hitting it and by a big hooks I've
been<00:01:54.560> using<00:01:54.740> on<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.660> think<00:01:56.660> that<00:01:56.720> should<00:01:56.990> be

actually more like 10 minutes let's see
how<00:03:44.060> these<00:03:44.240> did<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:44.780> went<00:03:45.080> ahead<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:45.290> pretty

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
how these did I went ahead and pretty

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.650 
how these did I went ahead and pretty
much<00:03:46.220> used<00:03:46.550> it<00:03:46.700> on<00:03:46.760> all<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.120> different<00:03:47.300> soft

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
LaRue frogs first take a look at this

LaRue frogs first take a look at this
panic<00:03:51.680> minnow<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:52.970> this<00:03:53.120> seam<00:03:53.390> right<00:03:53.600> here<00:03:53.660> was

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
panic minnow so this seam right here was

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.410 
panic minnow so this seam right here was
what<00:03:54.200> was<00:03:54.380> weak<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:57.970> looks<00:03:58.970> like<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.270> actually

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
what was weak so looks like it actually

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.930 
what was weak so looks like it actually
definitely<00:04:00.100> did<00:04:01.100> sort<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.370> melted<00:04:01.820> together

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
definitely did sort of melted together

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.420 
definitely did sort of melted together
it<00:04:02.300> was<00:04:02.390> pretty<00:04:02.630> awkward<00:04:02.810> one<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.380> melt<00:04:03.740> she

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
it was pretty awkward one to melt she

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.030 
it was pretty awkward one to melt she
can<00:04:04.550> tell<00:04:04.730> it's<00:04:04.820> a<00:04:04.850> little<00:04:04.910> off<00:04:05.150> kilter<00:04:05.450> there

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
can tell it's a little off kilter there

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.530 
can tell it's a little off kilter there
I'll<00:04:07.040> give<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.400> that<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:07.790> did<00:04:07.970> do<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.120> little<00:04:08.390> bit

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
I'll give it that it did do a little bit

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.770 
I'll give it that it did do a little bit
of<00:04:08.720> glue<00:04:09.620> action<00:04:10.070> or<00:04:10.190> melting<00:04:10.550> on<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.850> not

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
of glue action or melting on it not

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.480 
of glue action or melting on it not
super<00:04:12.200> impressed<00:04:12.440> but<00:04:12.800> it's<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.130> difficult

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
super impressed but it's a difficult

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.840 
super impressed but it's a difficult
joint<00:04:14.650> so<00:04:15.650> let's<00:04:15.830> check<00:04:16.010> out<00:04:16.190> this<00:04:16.220> frog<00:04:16.670> this

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
joint so let's check out this frog this

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.150 
joint so let's check out this frog this
was<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.120> original<00:04:17.239> froggy<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.080> saw<00:04:18.500> me<00:04:18.710> melt

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
was the original froggy I saw me melt

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.250 
was the original froggy I saw me melt
together<00:04:19.310> I<00:04:19.790> put<00:04:20.480> a<00:04:20.540> lot<00:04:20.780> this<00:04:20.989> front<00:04:21.380> end<00:04:21.530> here

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
together I put a lot this front end here

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.170 
together I put a lot this front end here
and<00:04:24.260> that<00:04:24.380> seems<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.740> be<00:04:24.890> holding<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.520> mean<00:04:26.030> I

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
and that seems to be holding I mean I

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.570 
and that seems to be holding I mean I
could<00:04:26.330> split<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:26.720> all<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:26.990> way<00:04:27.110> open<00:04:27.580> it's

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
could split it all the way open it's

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.670 
could split it all the way open it's
holding<00:04:28.850> pretty<00:04:29.060> well<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.600> it's<00:04:30.050> still<00:04:30.290> nice

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
holding pretty well and it's still nice

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.510 
holding pretty well and it's still nice
and<00:04:30.710> pliable

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
and pliable

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.010 
and pliable
unlike<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.660> results<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.140> got<00:04:33.290> with<00:04:33.500> super<00:04:33.830> glue

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
unlike the results I got with super glue

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.440 
unlike the results I got with super glue
so<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.050> seems<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.440> be<00:04:36.560> pretty<00:04:36.740> good<00:04:37.420> take<00:04:38.420> a
