00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.399
 hello how are you about sexting and in 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.610
 this time I bring you a small video 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.980
 about how to get a shit out of points or 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.219
 do a lot of points on the map of 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.410
 trans and for this they need to be 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.290
 playing cooperatively they need 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.020
 be more than two people since this 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.670
 click works with either three people 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 I 'm not sure if it works with two 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.980
 but with three a month safer and with 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.999
 four since you can already cover them 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.199
 all more than anything this is a click of 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.420
 join everyone and make the zombies 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.089
 do not pass but it's at the power station 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.609
 so first of all survive the 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.570
 first round and I would say then what 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.190
 first thing they have to do is 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.899
 build the turret in case you do not know 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.190
 as signs and monkeys and you know how 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.440
 build the tower and how to get to the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.829
 power station and everything forward in the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.050
 video as far as the annotation says 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.640
 then let's start later but I 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.019
 built in the turret you know the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.170
 plant here in this door for 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.629
 avoid opening the door below and you 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.250
 they get on the bus, I recommend you 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.479
 here in the power station are bought 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.330
 this the ak-47 and that will be very 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.509
 useful since it has a lot of power and good 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.979
 Well, it has a pretty good magazine 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.100
 I recommend that in the consell or in the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.080
 money put where the good box is 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.299
 if the money is bought in the mp5 or is 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.600
 they play it in the box but what's important 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.360
 is that they have two good weapons since they already 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.369
 that they have to do with what to foresee 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.380
 all the possibilities and if you fail them 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.880
 the saying not here the power station 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.560
 well they turn on the power they put their 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.159
 turret that in this door so that it 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.420
 open and have to enter maybe not all 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.429
 at the same time but you have to enter 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.979
 this consecutively or one behind 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.659
 another young here are my companions these 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.159
 these people arming me evidently 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.020
 but if they agree, it is for them 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.170
 easier as well enters one another 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.970
 and they must enter all 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.759
 here I show you from the cinema mode is 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.610
 this little bit of platform this 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.710
 little bit of rock here near 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.299
 where is the lava and in those tambos not 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.800
 can be winnowed or nothing because if not 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.110
 they are going to fall 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.610
 and there is also in that little bridge 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.740
 that little bridge where they are going to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.420
 be left the zombies in the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.340
 part above the zombies are not going to 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.360
 jump to where you are going to 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.460
 pass olympically 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.870
 it's as if as if they brought a shield of 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.959
 force then then 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.610
 they are put here and all are piled up 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.620
 together and obviously have to be 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.760
 if they do this in the middle of a round 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.500
 they have to kill all the zombies 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.209
 then now let's start the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.129
 next round and they will see how they are going to 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.110
 get the zombies and they will stay there 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.090
 awestruck good we kill him 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.230
 as I tell you this is random people but 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.230
 it's people who are talking 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.970
 speaking in the previous one and they taught me 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.770
 the glitch because right now I wanted to 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.140
 play again with them to teach them 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.760
 as how is this topic already know that 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.170
 they have to do it cooperatively and as 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.300
 come there the zombies can not pass 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.730
 it is done as a barrier of force 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.250
 I say it has to be three people if they are 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.599
 four well it's better but what's important 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.959
 is that they do not have to advance more than 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.819
 where is where I am from or is that 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.560
 is the limit if you move a little bit more 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.870
 the zombies are going to be able to break 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.940
 the force barrier and there is nothing more 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.519
 they are piling up until they are 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.350
 enough to kill the 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.900
 disadvantages the only disadvantage is that 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.810
 they can run out of ammunition 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.000
 but then the zombies european things me 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.530
 I recommend that you let all 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.659
 zombies 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.310
 you have to join in a zombie ball and 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.900
 kill them so they have more 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.569
 odds that they release something 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.590
 something good as you see there is the maximum 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.349
 is the most important good the drop more 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.970
 important that they need and then because 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.189
 they have everything just stay here 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.230
 survive a good rounds and do 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.629
 points until copado reach an agreement 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.450
 I would recommend that you first kill one 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.889
 and another to the block more than one and then 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.079
 Consell finish the ammunition in what 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:01.930
 recharge more of the other well in case fire 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.019
 glee they already have are all covered if 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.670
 they need to go somewhere else only 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.190
 leave a million and leave one 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.200
 by one 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.020
 do not leave the four if it does not break 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.300
 the glitch too and then when they come back 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.420
 get on a pure one then that would be 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.650
 I hope everything does not seem so soon 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.850
 because if it is quite useful for sun 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.650
 live a lot of rounds and do 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.110
 enough snow points in this round 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.050
 we get to the round to round 17 but 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.270
 they killed us because the blue guy this one 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.830
 the zombies got into him so 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.830
 you can go to all the senses
