00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
high as I'd like but it's not very

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.210 
high as I'd like but it's not very
comfortable<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.799> pretty<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:44.159> just

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
comfortable and it pretty much just

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.850 
comfortable and it pretty much just
sucks<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:46.430> what<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> did<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:48.420> put<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.619> right

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860

here
for<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:50.700> least<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.060> second<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:53.509> got<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> hold<00:01:54.840> of

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
for at least a second I got a hold of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.070 
for at least a second I got a hold of
that<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.360> gonna<00:01:57.540> focus

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.030
