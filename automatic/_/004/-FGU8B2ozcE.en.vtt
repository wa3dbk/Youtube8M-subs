the the canyon rush for protoss is much

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.810 
the the canyon rush for protoss is much
simpler<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:32.180> there's<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.820> less

bunkers you're gonna have to get

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.510 
bunkers you're gonna have to get
soldiers<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.829> reasonable

bunkers I mean you're gonna need two

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
bunkers I mean you're gonna need two
bunkers<00:00:54.629> or<00:00:54.960> three<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:56.250> these<00:00:56.399> two

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
bunkers or three and in these two

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.860 
bunkers or three and in these two
barracks<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> supply<00:00:57.870> depots<00:00:59.270> all<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.750> all

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
barracks and to supply depots all in all

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.250 
barracks and to supply depots all in all
it<00:01:01.050> costs<00:01:01.410> much<00:01:01.890> more<00:01:01.920> compared<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.260> mine

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
it costs much more compared to the mine

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.130 
it costs much more compared to the mine
cost<00:01:04.619> much<00:01:04.979> more<00:01:05.220> than<00:01:05.299> doing<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.420> cannon<00:01:06.869> set

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
cost much more than doing a cannon set

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.710 
cost much more than doing a cannon set
up<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:11.130> kind<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.850> problematic<00:01:12.360> at

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
up so it was kind of problematic at

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.109 
up so it was kind of problematic at
first<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.140> was<00:01:13.229> trying<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> narrow<00:01:14.460> down<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
first I was trying to narrow down and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.140 
first I was trying to narrow down and
see<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.509> could<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:16.979> way<00:01:17.250> but

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
see if I could get it going my way but

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.179 
see if I could get it going my way but
um<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:19.189> finally<00:01:20.189> managed<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.890> works

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
um I finally managed to do it it works

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.390 
um I finally managed to do it it works
well<00:01:23.460> against<00:01:23.939> protoss<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:25.020> taryn<00:01:25.590> setups<00:01:26.100> or

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
well against protoss and taryn setups or

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.840 
well against protoss and taryn setups or
tear<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.939> terran<00:01:27.270> protoss<00:01:27.659> Protoss<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:29.130> get

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
tear and terran protoss Protoss I get

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.130 
tear and terran protoss Protoss I get
taran<00:01:30.600> taran<00:01:30.810> again<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.780> it's<00:01:33.780> easy<00:01:33.900> enough

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
taran taran again and it's easy enough

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.830 
taran taran again and it's easy enough
to<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.820> what<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.939> need<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.360> build<00:01:36.540> bunk

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to do what you need to do is build bunk

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.950 
to do what you need to do is build bunk
build<00:01:37.770> your<00:01:38.119> barracks<00:01:39.119> or<00:01:39.240> supply<00:01:39.570> depot

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
build your barracks or supply depot

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.770 
build your barracks or supply depot
first<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:41.340> opted<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> build<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> barracks

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
first I opted to build the barracks

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.380 
first I opted to build the barracks
first<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.619> build<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> supply<00:01:44.340> depot

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
first and then build a supply depot

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.109 
first and then build a supply depot
after<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.229> want<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> build<00:01:46.560> bunkers

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
after that you want to build bunkers

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.630 
after that you want to build bunkers
right<00:01:48.119> next<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> mineral<00:01:48.990> line<00:01:49.200> or

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
right next to the mineral line or

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.870 
right next to the mineral line or
somewhere<00:01:50.640> close<00:01:50.670> where<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.890> Marines<00:01:53.430> inside

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
somewhere close where the Marines inside

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.520 
somewhere close where the Marines inside
the<00:01:54.030> bunkers<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.600> range<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:56.299> then<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:58.350> gotta

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the bunkers can range it then you gotta

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.649 
the bunkers can range it then you gotta
let<00:01:58.710> nature<00:01:58.950> take<00:01:59.280> its<00:01:59.460> course<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.880> then<00:02:00.240> just

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
let nature take its course and then just

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.389 
let nature take its course and then just
basically<00:02:01.020> keep<00:02:01.380> churning<00:02:01.829> out<00:02:02.130> those

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
basically keep churning out those

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.780 
basically keep churning out those
Marines<00:02:02.899> hoping<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.770> prog<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
Marines hoping that with the prog the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.529 
Marines hoping that with the prog the
added<00:02:06.149> pressure<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:08.550> AI<00:02:08.970> would<00:02:09.270> surrender

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
added pressure the AI would surrender

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.320 
added pressure the AI would surrender
and<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> does<00:02:10.140> take<00:02:10.440> quite<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.950> bit<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.430> tries<00:02:11.849> to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and it does take quite a bit of tries to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.869 
and it does take quite a bit of tries to
get<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.810> work

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
get this to work

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.869 
get this to work
it's<00:02:14.879> very<00:02:15.299> annoying<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.689> do<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.049> with<00:02:16.260> zerg

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
it's very annoying to do it with zerg

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.509 
it's very annoying to do it with zerg
cause<00:02:17.879> like<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.599> cannon<00:02:18.989> setup<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:20.249> can't

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
cause like the cannon setup you can't

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.069 
cause like the cannon setup you can't
build<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.920> debunkers<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:23.099> creep<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.790> yeah<00:02:24.569> you

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
build the debunkers on creep so yeah you

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.589 
build the debunkers on creep so yeah you
got<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.260> build<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.799> bunkers<00:02:26.519> pretty<00:02:27.060> close<00:02:27.329> to

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
got to build the bunkers pretty close to

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.280 
got to build the bunkers pretty close to
the<00:02:27.629> spawning<00:02:28.079> pool<00:02:28.439> or<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.090> oh<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.870> roach

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the spawning pool or the oh the roach

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.429 
the spawning pool or the oh the roach
then<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:32.239> when<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.329> get<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.719> side<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.109> GG

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
then and when you get one side the GG

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.220 
then and when you get one side the GG
unload<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.370> Marines<00:02:36.000> from<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.450> side<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.109> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
unload the Marines from that side to the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.720 
unload the Marines from that side to the
side<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.560> hasn't<00:02:37.709> surrendered<00:02:38.040> yet<00:02:38.489> and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
side that hasn't surrendered yet and

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.909 
side that hasn't surrendered yet and
they<00:02:39.090> should<00:02:39.329> give<00:02:39.480> up<00:02:41.299> I<00:02:42.379> really<00:02:43.379> hate<00:02:43.560> doing

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
cuz I'm not used to bunker rushing I'm

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.789 
cuz I'm not used to bunker rushing I'm
used<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.150> just<00:02:51.209> 10<00:02:51.750> rushing<00:02:52.230> people<00:02:52.349> because

this really little hassle when you deal
with<00:02:57.599> this<00:02:57.930> because<00:02:58.319> um<00:03:00.290> cannons<00:03:01.290> laughter

destination of where you want to build

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.459 
destination of where you want to build
it<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:08.939> easier<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.359> do<00:03:09.480> however<00:03:09.719> Terran

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
it so it's easier to do however Terran

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.349 
it so it's easier to do however Terran
is<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.709> bit<00:03:11.010> more<00:03:11.159> complicated<00:03:11.639> because<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
is a bit more complicated because of the

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.179 
is a bit more complicated because of the
fact<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.689> you<00:03:13.439> know<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.739> buildings<00:03:14.069> are

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
fact that you know the buildings are

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.969 
fact that you know the buildings are
pretty<00:03:14.340> static<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:17.659> mean<00:03:18.659> by<00:03:18.780> not<00:03:19.409> static<00:03:19.949> but

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
pretty static I mean by not static but

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.399 
pretty static I mean by not static but
basically<00:03:20.879> bunkers<00:03:21.659> are<00:03:21.810> useless<00:03:22.139> that

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
basically bunkers are useless that

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.649 
basically bunkers are useless that
there's<00:03:22.620> nothing<00:03:22.979> in<00:03:23.099> them<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:24.419> gotta

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
there's nothing in them and you gotta

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.270 
there's nothing in them and you gotta
turn<00:03:24.900> out<00:03:25.049> at<00:03:25.139> least<00:03:25.259> four<00:03:25.620> Marines<00:03:25.979> for<00:03:26.189> each

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
turn out at least four Marines for each

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.800 
turn out at least four Marines for each
bunker<00:03:26.759> and<00:03:27.049> it<00:03:28.049> gets<00:03:28.199> really<00:03:28.530> annoying<00:03:28.919> when

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
bunker and it gets really annoying when

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.619 
bunker and it gets really annoying when
you<00:03:30.810> want<00:03:31.169> that<00:03:31.549> them<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.759> come<00:03:32.970> out<00:03:33.090> faster

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
you want that them to come out faster

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.369 
you want that them to come out faster
but<00:03:33.840> they're<00:03:34.229> just<00:03:34.349> not<00:03:34.699> I<00:03:36.049> probably<00:03:37.049> could

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
but they're just not I probably could

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.789 
but they're just not I probably could
have<00:03:37.409> built<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.709> reactor<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:38.699> uh<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:40.590> know<00:03:40.680> it

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
have built a reactor but uh you know it

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.360 
have built a reactor but uh you know it
takes<00:03:40.949> time<00:03:41.189> actually<00:03:41.489> build<00:03:41.909> that<00:03:42.030> refinery

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
takes time actually build that refinery

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.360 
takes time actually build that refinery
and<00:03:44.629> I<00:03:45.629> don't<00:03:46.109> think<00:03:46.319> by<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.829> time<00:03:46.919> you

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
and I don't think by the time you

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.309 
and I don't think by the time you
invested<00:03:47.849> enough<00:03:48.000> vespene<00:03:48.509> gas<00:03:48.509> and<00:03:49.049> got<00:03:49.169> the

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
invested enough vespene gas and got the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.990 
invested enough vespene gas and got the
reactors<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:50.069> don't<00:03:50.489> think<00:03:50.549> there<00:03:50.819> would<00:03:50.970> be

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
reactors I don't think there would be

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.710 
reactors I don't think there would be
enough<00:03:51.829> there<00:03:52.829> wouldn't<00:03:53.069> be<00:03:53.129> any<00:03:53.720> sufficient

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
enough there wouldn't be any sufficient

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.689 
enough there wouldn't be any sufficient
time<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.900> finish<00:03:55.650> this<00:03:55.949> challenge<00:03:56.250> fast

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
time to finish this challenge fast

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.990 
time to finish this challenge fast
enough<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.829> got<00:03:58.829> this<00:03:59.040> challenge<00:03:59.579> that<00:03:59.729> four

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
enough I got this challenge that four

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.869 
enough I got this challenge that four
minutes<00:04:00.449> and<00:04:00.599> 58<00:04:01.169> seconds<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.069> that<00:04:02.639> was

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
minutes and 58 seconds and that was

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.009 
minutes and 58 seconds and that was
really<00:04:03.299> really<00:04:03.810> annoying<00:04:04.759> the<00:04:05.759> longest<00:04:06.629> four

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
really really annoying the longest four

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.610 
really really annoying the longest four
minutes<00:04:07.379> and<00:04:07.469> 58<00:04:07.739> seconds<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.159> my<00:04:08.280> life

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
minutes and 58 seconds of my life

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.289 
minutes and 58 seconds of my life
because<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.919> because<00:04:11.519> bunker<00:04:11.909> rushing

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.990 
because this because bunker rushing
these<00:04:12.569> guys<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:13.199> not<00:04:13.680> foolproof<00:04:13.979> it<00:04:14.729> doesn't

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
these guys is not foolproof it doesn't

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.939 
these guys is not foolproof it doesn't
guarantee<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.389> a<00:04:15.629> surrender<00:04:16.259> their<00:04:16.709> workers

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
guarantee you a surrender their workers

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.740 
guarantee you a surrender their workers
might<00:04:17.370> die<00:04:17.579> but<00:04:17.909> that<00:04:18.180> doesn't<00:04:18.479> mean<00:04:18.599> they're

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
might die but that doesn't mean they're

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.009 
might die but that doesn't mean they're
not

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
not

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.309 
not
having<00:04:19.669> adequate<00:04:20.669> enough<00:04:20.970> resources<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.690> tack

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:22.319 
having adequate enough resources to tack

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:24.379 
having adequate enough resources to tack
up<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.620> something<00:04:22.949> else<00:04:23.069> but<00:04:23.819> the<00:04:23.940> workers<00:04:24.120> are

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
up to something else but the workers are

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.249 
up to something else but the workers are
dying<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.560> know<00:04:25.650> their<00:04:26.340> income<00:04:27.270> is<00:04:27.479> slowly

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
dying so you know their income is slowly

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:34.010 
dying so you know their income is slowly
dwindling<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:32.030> it's<00:04:33.030> about<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.330> be<00:04:33.419> over<00:04:33.449> soon

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
dwindling and it's about to be over soon

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.249 
dwindling and it's about to be over soon
then<00:04:34.789> some<00:04:35.789> reason<00:04:36.120> maybe<00:04:36.419> building<00:04:36.930> at<00:04:37.050> third

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
then some reason maybe building at third

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.809 
then some reason maybe building at third
bunker<00:04:37.620> scared<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.009> crap<00:04:38.220> out<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.460> them<00:04:38.639> I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.100 
that's the that's the gist of it whole
thing<00:04:47.039> is<00:04:47.220> just<00:04:47.340> keep<00:04:47.580> conjuring<00:04:48.449> those<00:04:48.629> the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
thing is just keep conjuring those the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.839 
thing is just keep conjuring those the
contract<00:04:49.680> saying<00:04:50.039> that<00:04:50.220> this<00:04:50.490> is<00:04:50.520> not<00:04:50.639> magic

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
contract saying that this is not magic

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.600 
contract saying that this is not magic
game<00:04:51.680> keep<00:04:52.680> building<00:04:52.979> those<00:04:53.220> Marines

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
game keep building those Marines

game keep building those Marines
training<00:04:54.449> those<00:04:54.569> Marines<00:04:54.870> up<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.259> eventually

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
training those Marines up and eventually

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.370 
training those Marines up and eventually
they'll<00:04:56.130> give<00:04:56.280> up<00:04:56.430> so<00:04:57.150> I<00:04:57.300> see<00:04:57.659> got<00:04:57.900> one<00:04:58.110> side<00:04:58.349> to

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
they'll give up so I see got one side to

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.249 
they'll give up so I see got one side to
quit<00:04:59.000> send<00:05:00.000> my<00:05:00.150> Marines<00:05:00.509> over<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.229> side

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
quit send my Marines over to that side

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.800 
quit send my Marines over to that side
to<00:05:01.979> take<00:05:02.610> care<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:02.940> what's<00:05:03.360> left<00:05:03.449> of<00:05:03.690> the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
to take care of what's left of the

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.850 
to take care of what's left of the
opponent<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:06.419> I<00:05:06.479> said<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:06.960> got<00:05:07.110> four<00:05:07.650> minutes

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
opponent so I said I got four minutes

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.209 
opponent so I said I got four minutes
and<00:05:08.099> 58<00:05:08.610> seconds<00:05:09.090> on<00:05:09.240> this<00:05:09.479> so<00:05:10.219> not

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
and 58 seconds on this so not

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:13.730 
and 58 seconds on this so not
necessarily<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.969> fastest<00:05:12.449> time<00:05:12.659> I<00:05:12.990> were<00:05:13.530> done

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
necessarily the fastest time I were done

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.550 
necessarily the fastest time I were done
with<00:05:14.009> any<00:05:14.219> sort<00:05:14.699> of<00:05:14.819> race<00:05:15.090> because<00:05:15.500> well<00:05:16.500> I've

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
with any sort of race because well I've

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.740 
with any sort of race because well I've
gotten<00:05:16.830> better<00:05:16.860> but<00:05:17.280> for<00:05:18.120> terran<00:05:18.509> it's

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
gotten better but for terran it's

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.180 
gotten better but for terran it's
definitely<00:05:19.259> someone<00:05:19.500> in<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.710> constant

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
definitely someone in the constant

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.279 
definitely someone in the constant
accomplishment<00:05:21.090> since<00:05:21.240> a<00:05:21.449> bunker<00:05:21.780> rush<00:05:21.960> was

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
accomplishment since a bunker rush was

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.809 
accomplishment since a bunker rush was
really<00:05:22.590> designed<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:23.069> just<00:05:23.280> kill<00:05:23.550> one<00:05:23.789> person

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
really designed to just kill one person

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.850 
really designed to just kill one person
and<00:05:24.599> not<00:05:24.750> to<00:05:25.610> because<00:05:26.930> it<00:05:27.930> takes<00:05:28.110> double<00:05:28.740> the

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
and not to because it takes double the

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.760 
and not to because it takes double the
resources<00:05:29.430> just<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.699> follow<00:05:30.599> through<00:05:30.930> so<00:05:31.710> I

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
resources just to follow through so I

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.740 
resources just to follow through so I
named<00:05:32.039> the<00:05:32.159> kick<00:05:32.400> ass<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:32.969> chewing<00:05:33.509> something

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
named the kick ass and chewing something

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.779 
named the kick ass and chewing something
realistic<00:05:34.500> bubble<00:05:35.009> gum<00:05:35.159> but<00:05:35.370> that<00:05:35.490> would<00:05:35.669> be

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
realistic bubble gum but that would be

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.749 
realistic bubble gum but that would be
kind<00:05:36.120> of<00:05:36.270> generic<00:05:36.599> and<00:05:36.990> I'll<00:05:37.650> thank<00:05:38.250> you<00:05:38.400> n<00:05:38.550> GT
