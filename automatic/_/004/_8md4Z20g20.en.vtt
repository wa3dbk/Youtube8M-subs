which is very similar to a melamine
product<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.610> basic<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.900> what<00:02:49.319> do<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.410> think

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
product so basic is it what do you think

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.319 
product so basic is it what do you think
that<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.829> Dave<00:02:50.040> what<00:02:50.489> do<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:50.579> think<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.910> is

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
that is Dave what do you think this is

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.059 
that is Dave what do you think this is
that<00:02:51.599> I'm<00:02:51.690> holding<00:02:51.840> right<00:02:52.140> here<00:02:52.170> that's<00:02:52.829> not<00:02:53.040> a

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
that I'm holding right here that's not a

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.949 
that I'm holding right here that's not a
hat<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.610> although<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.180> does<00:02:54.329> look<00:02:54.510> very<00:02:54.540> much

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
hat so although it does look very much

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.350 
hat so although it does look very much
like<00:02:55.019> some<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.620> your<00:02:55.739> hats<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.610> what<00:02:57.239> is<00:02:57.329> that

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
like some of your hats but what is that

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.870 
like some of your hats but what is that
it's<00:02:58.019> called<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.319> wasps<00:02:58.470> pineda<00:02:58.890> basically

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
it's called the wasps pineda basically

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.360 
it's called the wasps pineda basically
bees<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.660> wasps<00:03:00.870> or<00:03:01.170> territorial<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
bees and wasps or territorial so the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.309 
bees and wasps or territorial so the
idea<00:03:02.459> of<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.180> as<00:03:03.420> you've<00:03:03.599> done<00:03:03.780> yeah<00:03:04.110> you

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
idea of this is as you've done yeah you
