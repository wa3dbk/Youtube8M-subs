yeah<00:00:57.900> this<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.229> pretty<00:00:58.409> easy<00:00:58.619> in<00:00:58.799> terms<00:00:58.979> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
yeah this is pretty easy in terms of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.240 
yeah this is pretty easy in terms of
scraping<00:00:59.339> but<00:01:00.299> what<00:01:01.019> we're<00:01:01.140> gonna<00:01:01.229> do<00:01:01.500> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
scraping but what we're gonna do is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.500 
scraping but what we're gonna do is
we're<00:01:02.400> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.580> talk<00:01:02.699> about<00:01:02.729> these<00:01:03.030> moldings

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
we're going to talk about these moldings

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.030 
we're going to talk about these moldings
so<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:03.960> look<00:01:04.290> there's<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.710> problems

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
so now look there's a lot of problems

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.350 
so now look there's a lot of problems
these<00:01:05.129> moments<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.700> stand<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.240> long

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360

paint and again this one's pretty easy
because<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:38.880> mostly<00:02:39.150> paint<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:40.260> see

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
because it's mostly paint you can see

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.300 
because it's mostly paint you can see
it's<00:02:40.590> it's<00:02:41.310> moving<00:02:41.520> quite<00:02:41.880> well<00:02:42.090> here<00:02:43.310> have

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
it's it's moving quite well here have

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.900 
it's it's moving quite well here have
you<00:02:44.400> got<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> flat<00:02:44.820> pry<00:02:45.060> bar<00:02:48.260> we<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.500> be

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
you got a flat pry bar we have to be

00:02:49.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
you got a flat pry bar we have to be
very<00:02:50.910> very<00:02:51.270> delicate<00:02:51.600> though<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:09.450> you'll<00:03:09.750> get

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
very very delicate though and you'll get

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.600 
very very delicate though and you'll get
a<00:03:09.960> feel<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> sound<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:11.070> these<00:03:11.190> moldings

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
a feel for the sound of these moldings

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.970 
a feel for the sound of these moldings
when<00:03:11.820> they<00:03:11.940> start<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.390> creak<00:03:12.690> back<00:03:13.650> off<00:03:13.950> a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
when they start to creak back off a

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.320 
when they start to creak back off a
little<00:03:14.130> bit<00:03:14.370> on<00:03:14.580> them<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.000> don't<00:03:15.060> want<00:03:15.240> to

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
little bit on them you don't want to

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.890 
little bit on them you don't want to
hear<00:03:15.450> that

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
hear that

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.200 
hear that
splitting<00:03:16.440> sound<00:03:16.860> that's<00:03:17.100> not<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.820> good<00:03:18.000> time

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210

they look like this with lots of little

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.619 
they look like this with lots of little
nails<00:04:35.409> sticking<00:04:35.800> out<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:37.150> what<00:04:37.449> we're<00:04:37.539> going

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
nails sticking out so what we're going

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.209 
nails sticking out so what we're going
to<00:04:37.689> do<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.169> same<00:04:38.439> technique<00:04:38.949> with<00:04:39.099> the

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219 
to do is that same technique with the

vise grips and show you how to pull them
out<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.169> mean<00:04:41.409> most<00:04:41.590> people<00:04:41.680> would<00:04:42.490> take<00:04:42.669> their

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
out I mean most people would take their

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.360 
out I mean most people would take their
hammer<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:43.389> start<00:04:43.680> bashing<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:45.009> way<00:04:45.099> I<00:04:45.129> do

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
hammer and start bashing the way I do

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.189 
hammer and start bashing the way I do
that's<00:04:45.999> the<00:04:46.150> last<00:04:46.330> thing<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.659> want<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.900> do<00:04:47.050> is

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
that's the last thing you want to do is

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.589 
that's the last thing you want to do is
bang<00:04:47.529> a<00:04:47.710> nail<00:04:47.740> through<00:04:48.219> from<00:04:49.029> the<00:04:49.150> back<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.539> the

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
bang a nail through from the back of the

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:56.989 
bang a nail through from the back of the
most<00:04:50.699> set<00:04:51.699> on<00:04:51.819> that<00:04:51.999> on<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.270> probably<00:04:52.569> bar

00:04:56.989 --> 00:04:56.999 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.339 

there<00:04:57.999> you<00:04:58.090> go<00:04:58.210> you've<00:04:58.389> broken<00:04:58.599> away<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:59.020> paint

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
there you go you've broken away to paint

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:00.779 
there you go you've broken away to paint
and<00:04:59.590> you've<00:04:59.680> broken<00:04:59.860> away<00:05:00.189> some<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.610> wood

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
and you've broken away some of the wood

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.570 
and you've broken away some of the wood
so<00:05:01.270> now<00:05:01.360> you've<00:05:01.509> got<00:05:01.689> a<00:05:01.719> putty<00:05:02.469> job<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:02.949> fill<00:05:03.159> so

now<00:05:21.759> let's<00:05:21.909> get<00:05:21.969> back<00:05:22.150> to<00:05:22.270> this<00:05:22.419> door<00:05:24.629> the

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
now let's get back to this door the

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:27.989 
now let's get back to this door the
other<00:05:25.659> way<00:05:25.990> that<00:05:26.259> you<00:05:26.439> could<00:05:26.680> strip<00:05:27.490> this<00:05:27.699> door

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:27.999 
other way that you could strip this door

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.659 
other way that you could strip this door
is<00:05:28.330> to<00:05:28.629> use<00:05:28.810> a<00:05:28.839> heat<00:05:29.050> stripper<00:05:29.409> gun<00:05:29.669> but

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
is to use a heat stripper gun but

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.519 
is to use a heat stripper gun but
because<00:05:30.939> this<00:05:31.120> door<00:05:31.389> is<00:05:31.539> got<00:05:31.779> so<00:05:32.020> little<00:05:32.319> paint

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:32.529 
because this door is got so little paint

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:34.619 
because this door is got so little paint
on<00:05:32.710> it<00:05:32.889> what<00:05:33.430> you'd<00:05:33.580> probably<00:05:33.789> do<00:05:34.120> is<00:05:34.300> just<00:05:34.509> go

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
on it what you'd probably do is just go

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:36.450 
on it what you'd probably do is just go
at<00:05:34.779> it<00:05:34.810> with<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:35.080> scraper<00:05:35.830> just<00:05:36.189> like<00:05:36.310> we've

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
at it with the scraper just like we've

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.909 
at it with the scraper just like we've
been<00:05:36.490> showing<00:05:36.819> you<00:05:37.169> and<00:05:38.169> then<00:05:38.439> once<00:05:38.770> you've

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
been showing you and then once you've

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.230 
been showing you and then once you've
got<00:05:39.039> all<00:05:39.159> the<00:05:39.250> paint<00:05:39.490> stripped<00:05:39.789> off<00:05:42.149> then<00:05:43.149> you

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
got all the paint stripped off then you

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.909 
got all the paint stripped off then you
would<00:05:43.360> take<00:05:43.539> some<00:05:43.810> sandpaper<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.500> you<00:05:44.770> would

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
would take some sandpaper and you would

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:45.990 
would take some sandpaper and you would
sand<00:05:45.159> it<00:05:45.279> all<00:05:45.430> down

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
sand it all down

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.760 
sand it all down
I<00:05:46.029> know<00:05:46.569> only<00:05:46.719> don't<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.139> door<00:05:47.289> we're<00:05:47.589> done

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770

I know only don't the door we're done
for<00:05:48.009> you<00:05:48.279> the<00:05:48.729> striping<00:05:49.180> that's<00:05:49.810> right<00:05:50.050> if<00:05:50.110> you

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
for you the striping that's right if you

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.959 
for you the striping that's right if you
have<00:05:50.349> a<00:05:50.589> number<00:05:50.919> of<00:05:51.039> applications<00:05:51.699> we<00:05:51.819> could

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
have a number of applications we could

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:53.490 
have a number of applications we could
use<00:05:52.089> on<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.270> store<00:05:52.569> because<00:05:53.169> it's<00:05:53.319> already

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
use on the store because it's already

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.619 
use on the store because it's already
been<00:05:53.770> painted<00:05:53.979> the<00:05:54.699> surface<00:05:55.029> is<00:05:55.149> quite<00:05:55.300> smooth

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:55.629 
been painted the surface is quite smooth

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.050 
been painted the surface is quite smooth
so<00:05:56.169> maybe<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.589> light<00:05:56.800> sanding<00:05:57.250> yep<00:05:57.669> and<00:05:57.819> then

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
so maybe a light sanding yep and then

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.540 
so maybe a light sanding yep and then
what<00:05:58.509> are<00:05:58.599> the<00:05:58.689> options<00:05:59.050> well<00:05:59.649> let's<00:06:00.069> see<00:06:00.250> we

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
what are the options well let's see we

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.529 
what are the options well let's see we
got<00:06:00.699> some<00:06:01.500> urethane<00:06:02.909> that<00:06:03.909> you<00:06:04.000> could<00:06:04.180> use<00:06:04.360> on

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
got some urethane that you could use on

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.149 
got some urethane that you could use on
the<00:06:04.599> door<00:06:04.870> and<00:06:05.379> that<00:06:05.620> would<00:06:05.740> give<00:06:05.860> it<00:06:05.919> a<00:06:05.979> nice
