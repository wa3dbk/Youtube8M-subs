hands we'll get onto that a little bit
later<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.650> first<00:00:28.650> things<00:00:28.890> first<00:00:28.949> we're

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
later on so first things first we're

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.040 
later on so first things first we're
obviously<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> want<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.269> take<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.019> old

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050

obviously going to want to take the old
hoods<00:00:31.710> off<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.189> simply<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> case<00:00:32.899> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
hoods off and it's simply a case of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.340 
hoods off and it's simply a case of
rolling<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.530> forward<00:00:35.450> up<00:00:36.450> over<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> brake

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
rolling them forward up over the brake

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.280 
rolling them forward up over the brake
lever<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.329> pulling<00:00:39.329> down<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.719> does<00:00:39.930> take

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
lever and pulling down it does take

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.020 
lever and pulling down it does take
quite<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.190> force

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.750 

right<00:00:49.690> repeat<00:00:50.470> exactly<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:51.010> same<00:00:51.100> thing<00:00:51.520> for

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
right repeat exactly the same thing for

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.580 
right repeat exactly the same thing for
the<00:00:51.820> other<00:00:51.970> lever<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.990> then<00:00:53.140> we're<00:00:53.290> ready<00:00:53.440> to

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
the other lever and then we're ready to

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.770 
the other lever and then we're ready to
put<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.040> new<00:00:54.070> ones<00:00:54.550> on<00:00:54.850> now<00:00:55.150> it's<00:00:55.360> important

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
put the new ones on now it's important

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.210 
put the new ones on now it's important
to<00:00:55.810> remember<00:00:56.050> when<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.380> do<00:00:56.530> put<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.770> new<00:00:57.040> ones

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
to remember when you do put the new ones

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.340 
to remember when you do put the new ones
on<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:57.910> don't<00:00:58.210> need<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.600> be<00:00:58.720> afraid<00:00:58.809> of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
on that you don't need to be afraid of

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.470 
on that you don't need to be afraid of
applying<00:00:59.830> quite<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.400> lot<00:01:00.580> of<00:01:00.700> brute<00:01:00.940> force<00:01:00.970> as

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.740 
you saw when I took them off they take
quite<00:01:03.640> a<00:01:03.820> lot<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.150> pulling<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.720> stretching

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750

and that should be facing away from the
bike<00:01:26.710> these<00:01:26.920> are<00:01:27.040> actually<00:01:27.280> hoods<00:01:27.520> ones

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
bike these are actually hoods ones

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.760
