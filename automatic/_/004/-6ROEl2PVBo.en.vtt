00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.970
 hello my dear anime and manga 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.279
 friends welcome to my first 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.110
 unboxing on this channel or too 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.170
 friedman wrote my first anime 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.820
 boxing on this channel yes earlier with 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.949
 social mainz but made about technology 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.370
 and now we have the anime 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.080
 unvarnished and I would say 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.050
 the kuli in the background tries the 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.250
 super nice box of Amazon once 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.430
 unpack 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.020
 I have now decided that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.329
 number after commenting and not 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.760
 again directly at the recording because 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.160
 that just takes too long and I have 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 Just play a few set the camera 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.829
 Settings changed around you 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.879
 to show a little more than teeth 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.770
 if there are a few people on me 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.030
 accompany facebook or so if you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.810
 me also privately knows only one 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.729
 you know yourself I have at home 0 anm 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.080
 it must ie zero anime figures 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.000
 ulla nobody the new poster etc etc pp 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.590
 So I'm nothing, I'm one 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.150
 i am a noob i have mine 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.439
 hard disk where just a few of him 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480
 on his to look more but also 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.310
 Not 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.560
 so and we say then we catch too 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.320
 already said anja I'll start with 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.300
 Which three is popular is an animated one 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.280
 I looked through it at the beginning 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.900
 and that's why there was one and that 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.390
 high school of the dead we already see 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.440
 I think I buy from everyone 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.630
 the three animes respectively the two manga 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.760
 Bendel of it right at the beginning 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.600
 I just started it means well 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.310
 up to date at mainz and were two and one 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.670
 I think so too of many others 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.330
 told people that the mangas echoes it 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.270
 so the story is relatively strong 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.620
 what's actually normal is shortened 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.760
 and theoretically can be because if you 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.890
 now looks at high scores 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.800
 We have a term of four hours 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.580
 tied in the anime that is now in 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.730
 book format squeeze 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.650
 I believe then we will even over 100 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.220
 maybe you can take your own 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.560
 To describe teeth and so I say 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.750
 So in general I have myself 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.030
 simply said yes you usually buy 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.170
 one you read always see you through times 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.470
 how this is displayed 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.850
 There were high school dx high school of the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.650
 Date night is available in two different 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.900
 versions once every normal 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.910
 black and white edition and once the full 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.530
 I would agree with color edition 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.970
 get a later time only because 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.209
 which is twice as expensive 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.489
 if you wonder how expensive the animes are 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.320
 was the lack of I'm sorry then 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.920
 I have to say actually relatively 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.590
 cheap so between 6 and 9 euro 50 each 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.319
 according to which anime spoken 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.280
 would from which verlag from where it 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.859
 he will be sent or by post etc pp 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.069
 and here already the second anime and 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:06.680
 Although there is always very animal on 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.909
 the yield on how many by how much you 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.239
 Although these letters used 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.700
 Although triple-double by and 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.280
 Although this anime is only tweaked 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.170
 to have in english 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.329
 This anime this man always on anime 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.599
 I am already fully complex this man is 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.919
 only in English 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.780
 yes, it is simply not in germany 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.459
 actually licensed to itself 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.469
 you will not find much yourself 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.639
 German to watch him but if you 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.650
 then look at it 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.959
 I thought so too with mine 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.579
 bring crappy english skills 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.659
 you look again and just look at it 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.669
 time to look maybe would 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.019
 thereby also my English better me 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.939
 just try it once I've 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.739
 Happy that 's you format again gave 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.069
 you have the same times, the first two 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.169
 ordered the same books I thought in the 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.810
 Video I show each one 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.579
 one holds such a few excerpts from the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.709
 book itself 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.560
 then we have high school the umpteenth 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.629
 Here I brought at 13 yes and when 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.180
 as with everyone who knows you 2 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.379
 do not stop buying or buying so often 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.359
 quite rare and I do not have it now 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.189
 said yes I'm going to get amazon now 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.759
 for 20 euro it has now has 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.900
 nothing more pleasurable then as long as that 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.870
 colleague a little less what 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.609
 shows videos the same end with the beautiful 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.440
 if you have those in the background I have mine 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.760
 I thought of a new category 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.000
 but I think that you can do all that 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.160
 decide and I numbers one one 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.610
 manga review if you want or me 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.699
 just do it as it should call it 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.110
 a manga first impressions so just look 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.520
 read through and according to many motto 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.870
 Years, I like years but one 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.610
 maybe i can recommend in two 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.770
 or really do a whole review 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.449
 about a lack of yourself or one 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.840
 a whole lot of series depending on or 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.220
 just two pieces yes that's just 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.080
 not normed then also to you what he 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.030
 likes would see I want to have 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.500
 again another lack of reviews 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.910
 seen from the man for a relatively long time 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.660
 and so maybe you can watch 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.820
 to improve that 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.590
 for say just write in I've got 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.990
 me now 3 13 different manger to 31 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.720
 So bought it with two volumes each 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.430
 will hopefully be more 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.410
 pretty cheap actually have now for 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.110
 all about 15 euro number for six 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.550
 man gas has fit people yet should 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.229
 its actually been that video 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.960
 same end I died again nicely 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.030
 on and I hope the music was too 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.530
 nice in the background and yes what can you 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.700
 say so big to unboxing because you 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.530
 I will not betray 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.630
 I would say people go in it goes 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.630
 the remaining seconds and shield
