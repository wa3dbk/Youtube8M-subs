00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
we can see in the studio see his face

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.139 
we can see in the studio see his face
there<00:00:21.009> then<00:00:22.009> we'll<00:00:22.189> set<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.429> cage<00:00:22.730> up<00:00:22.909> here

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:23.149 
there then we'll set the cage up here

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:25.389 
there then we'll set the cage up here
and<00:00:23.390> we'll<00:00:23.599> take<00:00:23.839> some<00:00:24.529> of<00:00:24.679> these<00:00:24.769> pieces<00:00:25.099> this

00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:25.399 
and we'll take some of these pieces this

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:27.550 
and we'll take some of these pieces this
wall<00:00:25.759> whatever<00:00:26.089> and<00:00:26.509> kind<00:00:27.140> of<00:00:27.229> bring<00:00:27.439> it

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
wall whatever and kind of bring it

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.279 
wall whatever and kind of bring it
around<00:00:27.649> the<00:00:27.949> back<00:00:27.979> of<00:00:28.159> him<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:28.880> then<00:00:29.599> he<00:00:30.140> can

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
around the back of him and then he can

00:00:30.289 --> 00:01:10.750 
around the back of him and then he can
be<00:00:30.439> working<00:00:30.890> and<00:00:31.099> we<00:00:31.220> can<00:00:31.249> be<00:00:31.460> shooting

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.610 

so<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:11.940> we<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.390> we'll<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> studio

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
so what we do is we'll like the studio

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.730 
so what we do is we'll like the studio
completely<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.940> these<00:01:15.660> reflectors<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.680> we

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
completely with these reflectors that we

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710 
completely with these reflectors that we
use<00:01:16.920> daylight<00:01:17.730> so<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.390> when<00:01:18.480> you're<00:01:18.600> working

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
use daylight so that when you're working

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.450 
use daylight so that when you're working
you<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.650> disturbed<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.310> don't

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you don't have to be disturbed you don't

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.330 
you don't have to be disturbed you don't
have<00:01:20.550> flashes<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.270> off<00:01:21.510> over<00:01:22.340> 10,000

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
have flashes going off over 10,000

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.620 
have flashes going off over 10,000
square<00:01:23.520> feet<00:01:23.670> something<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:26.630> there's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
square feet something like that there's

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.790 
square feet something like that there's
one<00:01:27.960> skylight

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
one skylight

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.290 
one skylight
so<00:01:28.950> we're<00:01:29.190> lighting<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.550> entire<00:01:29.970> room

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
so we're lighting the entire room

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.080 
so we're lighting the entire room
basically<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:31.830> balance<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
basically you know balance like the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.360 
basically you know balance like the
pictures<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:33.780> natural<00:01:34.680> don't<00:01:35.040> feel

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
pictures are really natural don't feel

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.810 
pictures are really natural don't feel
it's<00:01:35.910> not<00:01:36.120> strobing<00:01:40.220> also<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> people<00:01:41.580> tend

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it's not strobing also the people tend

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's not strobing also the people tend
to<00:01:41.880> pose<00:01:42.210> less<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:43.050> there's<00:01:43.440> not<00:01:43.590> this

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
to pose less because there's not this

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.790 
to pose less because there's not this
event<00:01:44.160> going<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.330> now<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:46.110> know<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.590> in

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
event going on but now you know going in

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.980 
event going on but now you know going in
there<00:01:46.979> he<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.280> work<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.509> don't<00:01:48.690> have<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
there he can work and we don't have to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.930 
there he can work and we don't have to
say<00:01:49.170> well<00:01:49.320> no<00:01:49.470> no<00:01:49.650> stay<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.310> other<00:01:50.430> side<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
say well no no stay on the other side of

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.490 
say well no no stay on the other side of
the<00:01:51.000> table<00:01:51.240> because<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.050> where<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the table because that's where the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.770 
the table because that's where the
strobe<00:01:53.190> light<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:55.070> it's<00:01:56.070> amazing<00:01:56.520> maybe

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.290 

these<00:02:00.780> lights<00:02:01.170> also<00:02:01.500> give<00:02:02.009> your<00:02:02.610> work<00:02:02.910> looks

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.660 

just<00:03:13.030> in<00:03:13.180> chalk<00:03:13.480> then<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.439> glass<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.980> cut<00:03:15.280> to

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
just in chalk then the glass is cut to

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.300 
just in chalk then the glass is cut to
the<00:03:15.819> drawing<00:03:16.090> that's<00:03:16.780> going<00:03:17.260> downtown<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
the drawing that's going downtown to the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.789 
the drawing that's going downtown to the
temple<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.480> glass<00:03:19.689> is<00:03:19.959> all<00:03:20.140> camera<00:03:22.799> so

temple so this glass is all camera so

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.039 
temple so this glass is all camera so
this<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.099> glass<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.670> not<00:03:24.790> play<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.569> not<00:03:25.659> clash

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
this is glass is not play it's not clash
