up<00:01:55.090> seven<00:01:55.600> points<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.140> six<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.159> second

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
up seven points to six in the second

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.699 
up seven points to six in the second
quarter<00:01:57.819> third<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.539> six<00:01:58.899> and<00:01:59.170> we<00:01:59.560> actually

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
quarter third and six and we actually

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.949 
quarter third and six and we actually
have<00:02:00.069> a<00:02:00.099> chance<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.789> take<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.209> field<00:02:01.689> goal<00:02:01.899> I

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
have a chance to take a field goal I

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.620 
have a chance to take a field goal I
believe<00:02:02.439> or<00:02:02.799> we<00:02:03.189> can<00:02:03.340> do<00:02:03.459> a<00:02:03.490> fake<00:02:03.849> Pat<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.360> go

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
believe or we can do a fake Pat and go

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.510 
believe or we can do a fake Pat and go
for<00:02:04.959> a<00:02:04.990> two-point<00:02:05.530> play<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.099> that<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.340> exactly

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
for a two-point play and that is exactly

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.520 
for a two-point play and that is exactly
what<00:02:07.030> I'm<00:02:07.209> doing<00:02:07.420> we<00:02:07.840> are<00:02:07.959> going<00:02:08.259> with<00:02:08.410> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
what I'm doing we are going with the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.830 
what I'm doing we are going with the
fake<00:02:08.769> Pat<00:02:09.009> pass<00:02:09.310> option<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:10.209> hopefully<00:02:10.690> on

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
fake Pat pass option and hopefully on

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.509 
fake Pat pass option and hopefully on
our<00:02:10.959> very<00:02:11.290> first<00:02:11.380> time<00:02:11.890> out<00:02:12.099> here<00:02:12.130> on<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
our very first time out here on the

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.759 
our very first time out here on the
field<00:02:12.700> we<00:02:13.150> can<00:02:13.330> actually<00:02:13.510> get<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.989> done<00:02:14.290> and

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
field we can actually get it done and

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.309 
field we can actually get it done and
there<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.430> go<00:02:15.640> people<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.900> managed<00:02:17.290> to

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
there we go people we managed to

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.620 
there we go people we managed to
complete<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.099> two-point<00:02:18.640> play<00:02:18.849> I<00:02:19.209> wish<00:02:19.450> it

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
complete the two-point play I wish it

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.930 
complete the two-point play I wish it
were<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> touchdown<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.769> feeling<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.700> still

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
were a touchdown that feeling we still

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.850 
were a touchdown that feeling we still
gotta<00:02:22.120> wait<00:02:22.299> for<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.690> but<00:02:23.230> given<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> fact

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
gotta wait for that but given the fact

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.680 
gotta wait for that but given the fact
that<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.670> first<00:02:24.940> time<00:02:25.239> we're<00:02:25.660> out

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
that this is the first time we're out

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.690 
that this is the first time we're out
there<00:02:26.049> on<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.319> field<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.920> start<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.489> our

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
there on the field the start of our

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.330 
there on the field the start of our
career<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.750> wasn't<00:02:29.200> too<00:02:29.319> bad<00:02:29.350> people<00:02:30.130> it

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
career that wasn't too bad people it

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.699 
career that wasn't too bad people it
certainly<00:02:30.790> wasn't<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:31.840> simulating<00:02:32.440> further

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
certainly wasn't but simulating further

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.220 
certainly wasn't but simulating further
against<00:02:33.400> these<00:02:33.549> Arizona<00:02:34.120> Cardinals<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.049> can

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
against these Arizona Cardinals you can

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.440 
against these Arizona Cardinals you can
now<00:02:35.380> see<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:36.160> Houston<00:02:36.609> Texans<00:02:37.180> are

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
now see that the Houston Texans are

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.750 
now see that the Houston Texans are
starting<00:02:38.019> to<00:02:38.230> struggle<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:39.220> as<00:02:39.400> I'm<00:02:39.579> going

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
starting to struggle and as I'm going

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.300 
starting to struggle and as I'm going
out<00:02:40.000> there<00:02:40.269> back<00:02:40.600> on<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.989> field<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.650> got<00:02:42.069> two

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
out there back on the field I got two

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.879 
out there back on the field I got two
options<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.090> fake<00:02:43.329> a<00:02:43.359> field<00:02:43.780> goal<00:02:44.019> or<00:02:44.290> take<00:02:44.680> the

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
options to fake a field goal or take the

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.220 
options to fake a field goal or take the
field<00:02:45.130> goal<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.090> case<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.690> believe<00:02:47.019> I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
field goal and in this case I believe I

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.280 
field goal and in this case I believe I
made<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.530> huge<00:02:47.920> mistake<00:02:48.299> we<00:02:49.299> are<00:02:49.329> around<00:02:49.870> 40

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
made a huge mistake we are around 40

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.650 
made a huge mistake we are around 40
yards<00:02:50.680> away<00:02:50.769> from<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.220> end<00:02:51.519> zone<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.060> going

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
yards away from the end zone and going

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.620 
yards away from the end zone and going
for<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.049> wasn't<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.040> right<00:02:54.220> position<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.600> I

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
for it wasn't the right position but I

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.870 
for it wasn't the right position but I
guess<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.049> saw<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.590> we<00:02:56.769> were<00:02:56.799> down<00:02:57.160> by<00:02:57.400> 19

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
guess I saw that we were down by 19

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.030 
guess I saw that we were down by 19
points<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.630> just<00:02:58.930> wanted<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.350> go<00:02:59.650> for<00:02:59.889> it

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
points and I just wanted to go for it

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.280 
points and I just wanted to go for it
trying<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.459> get<00:03:00.639> us<00:03:00.790> back<00:03:01.090> into<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:01.660> game

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
trying to get us back into this game

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.590 
trying to get us back into this game
but<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:02.829> being<00:03:03.069> said<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.579> probably<00:03:04.090> wasn't

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
but that being said that probably wasn't

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.809 
but that being said that probably wasn't
the<00:03:04.810> best<00:03:04.900> decision<00:03:05.290> we<00:03:05.889> should<00:03:06.100> have<00:03:06.400> taken<00:03:06.549> a

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
the best decision we should have taken a

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.699 
the best decision we should have taken a
field<00:03:07.090> goal<00:03:07.329> and<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.900> guess<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.500> was<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
field goal and I guess that was the

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.220 
field goal and I guess that was the
first<00:03:09.220> major<00:03:09.609> mistake<00:03:10.269> that<00:03:10.299> I<00:03:10.569> made<00:03:10.660> starting

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
first major mistake that I made starting

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.140 
first major mistake that I made starting
off<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.680> career<00:03:12.100> but<00:03:12.579> let<00:03:12.760> me<00:03:12.880> know<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
off this career but let me know in the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.300 
off this career but let me know in the
comments<00:03:13.569> below<00:03:13.660> if<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:14.230> was<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.650> mistake<00:03:14.859> in

comments below if it was a mistake in

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
sure 100% but once again we are going

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.259

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
to go with the field goal I want to take

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.610 
to go with the field goal I want to take
that<00:03:27.790> two-point<00:03:28.299> play<00:03:28.420> once<00:03:28.720> again

and<00:03:29.709> we<00:03:29.890> are<00:03:30.010> actually<00:03:30.220> running<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.970> very

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
and we are actually running the very

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.750 
and we are actually running the very
same<00:03:31.599> play<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.410> we<00:03:32.560> ran<00:03:32.830> at<00:03:33.129> the<00:03:33.160> beginning

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760
