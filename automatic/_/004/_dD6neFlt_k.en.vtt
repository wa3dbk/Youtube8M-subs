today I will be comparing the original
Tangle<00:00:03.780> Teezer

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
Tangle Teezer

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.240 
Tangle Teezer
with<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.520> dollar<00:00:05.910> 85<00:00:06.779> cent<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.350> Duke<00:00:07.560> that<00:00:08.040> I

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
with the dollar 85 cent and Duke that I

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.580 
with the dollar 85 cent and Duke that I
found<00:00:08.550> from<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.000> site<00:00:09.210> called<00:00:09.590> Aliexpress

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
found from a site called Aliexpress

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.339 
found from a site called Aliexpress
which<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.130> kind<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.910> eBay<00:00:12.330> it's<00:00:12.870> actually

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
which is kind of like eBay it's actually

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.410 
which is kind of like eBay it's actually
where<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.769> think<00:00:13.889> most<00:00:15.080> Chinese<00:00:16.080> or<00:00:16.500> Korean

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
where I think most Chinese or Korean

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.080 
where I think most Chinese or Korean
eBay<00:00:18.420> sellers<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:19.380> their<00:00:19.740> stuff<00:00:20.160> from<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.820> it

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
eBay sellers get their stuff from so it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.340 
eBay sellers get their stuff from so it
tends<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> little<00:00:21.810> bit<00:00:21.930> cheaper<00:00:22.170> than

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
tends to be a little bit cheaper than

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.679 
tends to be a little bit cheaper than
eBay<00:00:23.340> actually<00:00:23.820> very<00:00:24.119> important

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
eBay actually very important

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.689 
eBay actually very important
consideration<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.529> these<00:00:25.710> two<00:00:26.010> items<00:00:26.279> is

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
consideration with these two items is

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.269 
consideration with these two items is
that<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.449> are<00:00:27.570> ordering<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.230> directly<00:00:28.949> from

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
that you are ordering this directly from

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.319 
that you are ordering this directly from
China<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.449> does<00:00:30.960> take<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.500> much<00:00:31.790> longer<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
China so it does take you much longer to

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.639 
China so it does take you much longer to
receive<00:00:34.230> it

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
receive it

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.650 
receive it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790

when<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.330> gonna<00:01:27.450> break<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> bank

when it's not gonna break the bank
either<00:01:28.320> way<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.220> was<00:01:29.430> super<00:01:29.700> curious<00:01:30.329> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
either way but I was super curious to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.260 
either way but I was super curious to
see<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.140> dollar<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.759> eighty-seven<00:01:32.759> was

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
see if the dollar and eighty-seven was

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780 
see if the dollar and eighty-seven was
exactly<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.200> same<00:01:34.229> because<00:01:34.740> by<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> looks<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
exactly the same because by the looks of

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
exactly the same because by the looks of
them<00:01:36.060> they're<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.930> same<00:01:37.110> shape<00:01:37.439> they're<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
them they're the same shape they're the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.969 
them they're the same shape they're the
same<00:01:38.070> size<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:39.390> both<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.170> same<00:01:40.530> type

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
same size they both have this same type

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.870 
same size they both have this same type
of<00:01:41.630> shorter<00:01:42.630> bristles<00:01:42.950> nestled<00:01:43.950> among<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
of shorter bristles nestled among the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.300 
of shorter bristles nestled among the
longer<00:01:45.329> bristles<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.890> wanted<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
longer bristles so I really wanted to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.210 
longer bristles so I really wanted to
see<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.600> were<00:01:48.659> at<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.110> different<00:01:49.439> so

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
see if they were at all different so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
see if they were at all different so
when<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> first<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.299> these<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.899> held<00:01:52.229> them

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
when I first got these and I held them

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.380 
when I first got these and I held them
one<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.100> each<00:01:53.250> hand<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.790> very<00:01:53.820> first<00:01:54.180> time

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
one in each hand for the very first time

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.889 
one in each hand for the very first time
I<00:01:54.810> noticed<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> original<00:01:56.280> tanker<00:01:56.899> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
I noticed that the original tanker the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.600 
I noticed that the original tanker the
original<00:01:58.500> tangle<00:01:58.979> teezer

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
original tangle teezer

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.050 
original tangle teezer
was<00:02:00.420> significantly<00:02:01.229> heavier<00:02:01.530> than<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.610> dupe

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
was significantly heavier than the dupe

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.660 
was significantly heavier than the dupe
so<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.049> actually<00:02:04.320> brought<00:02:04.770> out<00:02:04.979> my<00:02:05.159> handy<00:02:05.640> dandy

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so I actually brought out my handy dandy

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.650 
so I actually brought out my handy dandy
scale<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.689> weighed<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.680> two<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
scale and weighed the two and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.900 
scale and weighed the two and
I did<00:02:08.960> find<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.620> the<00:02:09.890> Tangle<00:02:10.280> Teezer<00:02:10.310> was

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
I did find that the Tangle Teezer was

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.350 
I did find that the Tangle Teezer was
about<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> half<00:02:11.480> an<00:02:11.780> ounce<00:02:11.990> heavier<00:02:12.830> than<00:02:13.730> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
about a half an ounce heavier than the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.570 
about a half an ounce heavier than the
dupe<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.380> that's<00:02:15.560> pretty<00:02:15.830> much<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.160> biggest

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
dupe and that's pretty much the biggest

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.360 
dupe and that's pretty much the biggest
physical<00:02:17.390> difference<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:18.140> could<00:02:18.650> spot<00:02:19.010> with

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
physical difference I could spot with

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.030 
physical difference I could spot with
the<00:02:19.580> naked<00:02:19.850> eye<00:02:20.090> between<00:02:21.080> these<00:02:21.350> two<00:02:21.680> as<00:02:21.980> you

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
the naked eye between these two as you

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.440 
the naked eye between these two as you
see<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:23.000> bristles<00:02:23.240> look<00:02:23.870> almost<00:02:24.140> identical

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
see the bristles look almost identical

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.570 
see the bristles look almost identical
so<00:02:26.450> what<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.080> went<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.620> do<00:02:27.770> in<00:02:27.920> order<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.310> test

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
so what I went on to do in order to test

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.310 
so what I went on to do in order to test
these<00:02:28.820> two<00:02:29.150> guys<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.450> see<00:02:29.840> if<00:02:29.930> there<00:02:30.080> was<00:02:30.170> any

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
these two guys and see if there was any

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.680 
these two guys and see if there was any
difference<00:02:30.710> in<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.070> brush<00:02:31.460> was<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.270> wake<00:02:32.450> up

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
difference in the brush was to wake up

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.840 
difference in the brush was to wake up
first<00:02:33.020> thing<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.440> morning<00:02:33.500> as<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.070> see<00:02:34.490> here

- so why can't I say that so I started

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.660 
- so why can't I say that so I started
with<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.110> dupe<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:49.040> was<00:02:49.190> really<00:02:49.400> happy

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
with the dupe and I was really happy

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.690 
with the dupe and I was really happy
with<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.090> brush<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.630> seemed<00:02:51.200> very<00:02:51.620> gentle<00:02:52.550> on

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
with the brush it seemed very gentle on

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.300 
with the brush it seemed very gentle on
my<00:02:52.730> hair<00:02:53.150> as<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:53.450> was<00:02:53.600> brushing<00:02:54.170> very<00:02:54.950> little

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
my hair as I was brushing very little

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.280 
my hair as I was brushing very little
hair<00:02:55.580> got<00:02:55.910> pulled<00:02:55.940> out<00:02:56.420> which<00:02:56.900> I'm<00:02:57.050> gonna<00:02:57.170> be

really cute and show you here and
overall<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.140> thought<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.770> was<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.160> fine

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
overall I thought this was a fine

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.480 
overall I thought this was a fine
bargain<00:03:02.380> totally<00:03:03.380> neglecting<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.040> original

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
bargain totally neglecting the original

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.850 
bargain totally neglecting the original
either<00:03:04.760> way<00:03:05.030> it's<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.480> fine<00:03:05.720> brush<00:03:06.020> especially

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
either way it's a fine brush especially

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.710 
either way it's a fine brush especially
for<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.130> dollar<00:03:07.490> eighty<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.180> like<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.450> said<00:03:08.510> I

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
for a dollar eighty and like I said I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.110 
for a dollar eighty and like I said I
think<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.230> nicest<00:03:09.890> thing<00:03:10.430> about<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.910> was<00:03:11.090> that

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
think the nicest thing about it was that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.590 
think the nicest thing about it was that
it<00:03:11.540> was<00:03:11.690> gentle<00:03:12.110> on<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.380> hair<00:03:13.090> then<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.390> went

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
it was gentle on the hair then I went

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.370 
it was gentle on the hair then I went
over<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.890> original<00:03:16.670> tangle<00:03:17.630> teezer

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
over to the original tangle teezer

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.890 
over to the original tangle teezer
and<00:03:18.590> started<00:03:19.400> brushing<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:20.000> other<00:03:20.180> side<00:03:20.570> of

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
and started brushing the other side of

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.430 
and started brushing the other side of
my<00:03:21.290> hair<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:21.980> immediately<00:03:22.400> noticed<00:03:23.180> an

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
my hair and I immediately noticed an

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.070 
my hair and I immediately noticed an
actual<00:03:24.440> difference<00:03:25.370> this<00:03:25.970> gave<00:03:26.360> me<00:03:26.600> such<00:03:26.900> a

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
actual difference this gave me such a

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.160 
actual difference this gave me such a
stronger<00:03:27.890> brush<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.640> got<00:03:29.150> much<00:03:29.480> more<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:30.050> the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
stronger brush it got much more of the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.900 
stronger brush it got much more of the
tangles<00:03:30.680> out<00:03:30.860> sooner<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.800> it<00:03:33.800> seems<00:03:34.520> like<00:03:34.730> it

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
tangles out sooner and it seems like it

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.270 
tangles out sooner and it seems like it
would<00:03:35.060> do<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.630> quicker<00:03:36.020> job<00:03:36.380> at<00:03:36.590> brushing<00:03:37.070> my

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
would do a quicker job at brushing my

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.420 
would do a quicker job at brushing my
whole<00:03:37.610> head<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:37.940> hair<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.890> found<00:03:40.280> that

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
whole head of hair so I found that

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.949 
whole head of hair so I found that
really<00:03:40.730> interesting<00:03:40.850> I'm<00:03:41.510> like<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.900> this

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
really interesting I'm like is this

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.600 
really interesting I'm like is this
really<00:03:42.500> happening<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:43.010> there<00:03:43.130> really<00:03:43.310> such<00:03:43.580> a

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
really happening is there really such a

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.760 
really happening is there really such a
difference<00:03:44.060> could<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.300> just<00:03:44.630> be<00:03:44.930> because<00:03:45.620> of

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
difference could it just be because of

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.610 
difference could it just be because of
the<00:03:46.010> weight<00:03:46.340> difference<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.720> then<00:03:48.230> what<00:03:48.590> I

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
the weight difference and then what I

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.860 
the weight difference and then what I
went<00:03:48.980> on<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.220> find<00:03:49.459> after<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:49.970> examine<00:03:50.690> both

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
went on to find after I examine both

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.770 
went on to find after I examine both
brushes<00:03:51.170> after<00:03:52.090> using<00:03:53.090> them<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.390> brush<00:03:53.570> my

whereas<00:04:01.310> all<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.090> bristles<00:04:02.540> on<00:04:02.810> the

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
whereas all of the bristles on the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.800 
whereas all of the bristles on the
Tenniel<00:04:03.770> teaser<00:04:04.220> were<00:04:04.760> still<00:04:05.270> straight<00:04:05.780> and

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
Tenniel teaser were still straight and

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.380 
Tenniel teaser were still straight and
firm<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:06.590> they<00:04:06.770> hadn't<00:04:07.100> been<00:04:07.220> bent<00:04:07.520> by<00:04:08.120> my

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
firm and they hadn't been bent by my

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.120 
firm and they hadn't been bent by my
hair<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.320> that<00:04:09.650> goes<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.220> when<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.430> feel<00:04:10.760> them

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
hair so that goes and when you feel them

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.100 
hair so that goes and when you feel them
you<00:04:13.130> notice<00:04:13.520> that<00:04:13.700> difference<00:04:14.150> as<00:04:14.330> well<00:04:14.630> these

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
you notice that difference as well these

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.099 
you notice that difference as well these
bristles<00:04:15.560> are<00:04:15.980> much<00:04:16.430> more<00:04:16.789> soft<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.720> pliable

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
bristles are much more soft and pliable

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.810 
bristles are much more soft and pliable
these<00:04:19.039> are<00:04:19.400> much<00:04:19.880> more<00:04:20.330> firm<00:04:21.080> so<00:04:21.560> there

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
these are much more firm so there

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.550 
these are much more firm so there
and<00:04:22.000> get<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.270> knots<00:04:22.480> out<00:04:22.690> faster<00:04:23.200> they're<00:04:23.380> not

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
and get the knots out faster they're not

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.440 
and get the knots out faster they're not
gonna<00:04:23.650> have<00:04:23.890> as<00:04:24.040> much<00:04:24.070> give<00:04:24.790> when<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.120> run

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
gonna have as much give when you run

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.190 
gonna have as much give when you run
them<00:04:25.630> through<00:04:25.660> your<00:04:25.930> hair<00:04:26.650> when<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.640> say<00:04:28.200> tangle

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
teezer versus doop this one's a really

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.180 
teezer versus doop this one's a really
tough<00:04:31.990> one<00:04:32.170> because<00:04:32.320> I<00:04:32.500> still<00:04:32.860> think<00:04:33.130> that

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
tough one because I still think that

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.420 
tough one because I still think that
this<00:04:33.430> is<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.610> fine<00:04:34.000> brush<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:34.900> of<00:04:35.860> course<00:04:36.130> it

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
this is a fine brush and of course it

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.460 
this is a fine brush and of course it
looks<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.120> pretty<00:04:37.420> much<00:04:37.630> feels<00:04:37.990> just<00:04:38.410> like

looks and pretty much feels just like
the<00:04:38.590> original<00:04:39.280> but<00:04:40.000> it's<00:04:40.300> much<00:04:40.720> more<00:04:40.750> gentle

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
the original but it's much more gentle

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.230 
the original but it's much more gentle

with long ones and short ones it's just

you know you don't mind spending $8 on a
brush<00:05:05.350> which<00:05:05.590> is<00:05:05.710> not<00:05:05.860> an<00:05:06.010> exorbitant<00:05:06.310> amount

of money go ahead and get the tangle
teezer<00:05:09.550> also<00:05:10.480> because<00:05:10.780> these<00:05:10.990> bristles<00:05:11.260> are

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
teezer also because these bristles are

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.490 
teezer also because these bristles are

know<00:05:16.540> it<00:05:16.660> probably<00:05:16.810> would<00:05:17.380> only<00:05:17.500> be<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.800> couple

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
know it probably would only be a couple

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.820 
know it probably would only be a couple
of<00:05:18.220> months<00:05:18.400> of<00:05:18.640> consistent<00:05:19.240> use<00:05:19.690> or<00:05:19.900> so<00:05:20.140> until

of months of consistent use or so until

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
these got all bent and some probably

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.720 
these got all bent and some probably
broke<00:05:23.200> I<00:05:23.410> think<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.890> tangle<00:05:24.250> teezer<00:05:24.490> would

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
broke I think the tangle teezer would

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.090 
broke I think the tangle teezer would
last<00:05:24.940> you<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.540> longer<00:05:26.050> amount<00:05:26.410> of<00:05:26.470> time<00:05:26.530> because

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
last you a longer amount of time because

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.940 
last you a longer amount of time because
the<00:05:27.280> bristles<00:05:27.640> end<00:05:27.820> up<00:05:27.970> being<00:05:28.210> more<00:05:28.540> dense<00:05:29.140> if

the bristles end up being more dense if

want something super gentle that's gonna

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.550

pull<00:05:36.730> out<00:05:36.910> less<00:05:37.360> hair<00:05:37.750> than<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:38.080> tangle
