everyone that everyone can go inside of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590 
everyone that everyone can go inside of
them<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.189> simply<00:01:11.520> want<00:01:11.700> him<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.299> block

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
them and you simply want him to block

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.440 
them and you simply want him to block
the<00:01:12.900> car<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:14.130> another<00:01:14.729> car<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.180> want<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the car with another car you want to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.999 
the car with another car you want to
block<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> back<00:01:16.020> doors<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.530> four-door

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.609 
block the back doors of that four-door
car<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.460> therefore<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.880> only<00:01:18.030> leaves<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.619> door

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
car so therefore it only leaves one door

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.070 
car so therefore it only leaves one door
available<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.939> other<00:01:21.090> doors<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.780> other<00:01:21.930> two

doors on the side are covered by the
wall<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> other<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.299> covered

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
wall and then the other one is covered

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.810 
wall and then the other one is covered
by<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.229> car<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.860> covering<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.520> then
