00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.340 

now<00:03:07.700> guys<00:03:07.850> if<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.150> buy<00:03:08.300> one<00:03:08.330> do<00:03:08.750> not<00:03:08.960> force<00:03:09.230> it

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
now guys if you buy one do not force it

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.050 
now guys if you buy one do not force it
in<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.770> as<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.400> can<00:03:10.550> see<00:03:10.580> there's<00:03:10.850> a<00:03:10.910> lot<00:03:11.030> of

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
in and as you can see there's a lot of

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.480 
in and as you can see there's a lot of
fingerprints<00:03:11.630> on<00:03:11.720> here<00:03:11.960> because<00:03:12.290> this<00:03:13.220> I

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
fingerprints on here because this I

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.370 
fingerprints on here because this I
guess<00:03:13.670> that's<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.910> way<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.060> made<00:03:16.090> and

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
guess that's the way it's made and

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.850 
guess that's the way it's made and
here's<00:03:18.380> your<00:03:18.560> USB<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.550> go<00:03:19.700> into<00:03:20.000> your<00:03:20.120> computer

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
here's your USB to go into your computer

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.110

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
so let's set this off to the side and

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.270 
so let's set this off to the side and
also<00:03:23.750> whenever<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.350> bought<00:03:24.650> this<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:25.100> also

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
also whenever I bought this I also
