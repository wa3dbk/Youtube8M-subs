00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.850
 snow ice is perfect for 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.440
 feel the car to understand how it is 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.970
 implies based on the commands you 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:16.619
 they are given immediately when yes 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:19.529
 part the effect now inspire you a 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.689
 the departure from firm on the funds a little 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.279
 poor grip like telling us snow need 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.439
 to be very sweet with either 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.720
 the accelerator whether you have the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.519
 automatic transmission with manual transmission col 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.260
 manual gearbox sometimes even 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.520
 how to start in second so that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.690
 wheels with automatic transmission 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.190
 just insert in drive and be a lot 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.700
 very delicate also here with 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.700
 accelerator 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.579
 if I give all gas 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.310
 the car 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.690
 morning dust 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.000
 there is a bit of acceleration but 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.160
 certainly much less grip to the very 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.530
 less grip and a lot of safety in 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.340
 direction that comes right away 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.010
 gently and movement as you have to 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.170
 behave when driving on snow and 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.540
 ice you need to drive a little 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.520
 in advance because the machine mouth 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.800
 directionality, the society remains 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.410
 at 10 meters from the curve you do it maybe a 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.200
 meter before the same as 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.080
 it's also about slowing down sending 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.180
 this slow mode before the curve is 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.360
 certainly something we all miss 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.280
 instead we create a curve in fact 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.320
 it is always advisable to brake before 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.030
 curve once the car is turned 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.310
 inserted in the curve, begin 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.960
 speed up accordingly ti times 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.540
 lead in the trajectory that you 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.040
 perfect wishes or almost the maximum e 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.520
 know the car like yours 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.700
 pockets 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.040
 a strange thing is that many users of the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.590
 street don't know the difference 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.719
 front-wheel drive or 434 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.350
 the matter of rigor consists in the fact 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:00.539
 that the engine and transmission 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.219
 therefore they transmit the power in motion 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.170
 to the front wheels 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.299
 so only to the front wheels that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.530
 make the car move with the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.500
 rear-wheel Drive 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.019
 the engine transmits power and motion 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.540
 to the rear wheels 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.790
 look there is little grip if you sit 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.340
 violently the rear wheels do 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.860
 in halo they slip and then the rear 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.549
 of the most difficult destination cars from 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.510
 to check 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:31.170
 while there is four-wheel drive 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:35.640
 4x4 where the engine transmits power 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.450
 to all four front wheels e 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.209
 rear 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.670
 at the same time it is here but if I have the 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.799
 catona rione tracer machine while 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.420
 to put back on the bike in front you have to 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:50.220
 put the chains where you have the power 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.030
 of the motor on the axis where the power 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.940
 of the rear engine 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.940
 ok lucia now it's your turn 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.860
 that other thing has become 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.860
 automatic and an automatic thing 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.760
 now they aim at everyone 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.880
 well what do you think? 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.710
 now we can put these into practice 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.600
 advice but before we did another 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.520
 video with mickey and lucia and I don't tell myself 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.520
 other click you will see some good ones
