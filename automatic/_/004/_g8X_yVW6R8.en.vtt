sand<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.170> salt<00:00:19.320> water<00:00:19.529> all<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> time<00:00:20.060> is<00:00:21.060> very

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
sand and salt water all the time is very

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.910 
sand and salt water all the time is very
impressive<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:21.990> kind<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.170> new<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.710> set

impressive it's kind of new of you set
this<00:00:23.359> this<00:00:24.359> right<00:00:24.600> here<00:00:24.720> for<00:00:24.750> tension<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.410> it

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
this this right here for tension on it

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.019 
this this right here for tension on it
based<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> camera<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.640> you're<00:00:26.820> using

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
based on the camera that you're using

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.919 
based on the camera that you're using
and<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.720> course<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.380> spin<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.750> always<00:00:30.750> I

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
and of course this is spin it I always I

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.020 
and of course this is spin it I always I
always<00:00:31.050> use<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> spikes<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.460> lot<00:00:32.940> of

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
always use the spikes on this a lot of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.729 
always use the spikes on this a lot of
times<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.390> actually<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> ocean<00:00:34.350> shooting

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
times I'm actually in the ocean shooting

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.310 
times I'm actually in the ocean shooting
and<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.880> believe<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.719> helps<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and I just believe that this helps to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.780 
and I just believe that this helps to
keep<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> camera<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.070> little<00:00:38.160> bit<00:00:38.280> more<00:00:38.520> stable

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
keep the camera a little bit more stable

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.900 
keep the camera a little bit more stable
how<00:00:39.690> has<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:39.960> handled<00:00:40.350> being<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.190> dirt<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
how has it handled being in the dirt and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.660 
how has it handled being in the dirt and
sand<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.420> salt<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:43.280> every<00:00:44.280> once<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.640> while

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
sand and salt my every once in a while

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.040 
sand and salt my every once in a while
you<00:00:44.910> take<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.210> apart<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.570> clean<00:00:45.690> them<00:00:45.960> it's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you take them apart to clean them it's

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319 
you take them apart to clean them it's
really<00:00:46.260> easy<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.610> unscrew<00:00:47.969> this

yourself<00:01:15.659> okay<00:01:16.939> I<00:01:17.960> mean<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> imagine

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
yourself okay I mean you know I imagine

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520 
yourself okay I mean you know I imagine
if<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.100> put<00:01:20.310> brute<00:01:20.580> force<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:22.020> way<00:01:22.259> here

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
if I put brute force on it this way here

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
if I put brute force on it this way here
you<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:23.180> no<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.360> can't<00:01:24.659> push<00:01:24.840> him<00:01:24.930> down

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
you know no I can't push him down

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960 
you know no I can't push him down
because<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.490> stuck<00:01:26.729> down

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
because you have to get it stuck down

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240 
because you have to get it stuck down
into<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> sand<00:01:27.540> pretty<00:01:27.900> good<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.159> it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
into the sand pretty good so that so it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.590 
into the sand pretty good so that so it
doesn't<00:01:29.520> start<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.729> move<00:01:29.850> halfway<00:01:30.270> through

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
doesn't start to move halfway through

mostly use and I'm actually just down to
two<00:01:43.200> sections<00:01:43.710> here<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.060> know<00:01:45.210> if

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
two sections here and as you know if

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.660 
two sections here and as you know if
you've<00:01:45.720> been<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> water<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.619> few<00:01:46.860> waves<00:01:47.340> in

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
you've been in the water a few waves in

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.429 
you've been in the water a few waves in
everything<00:01:48.180> start<00:01:48.450> sinking<00:01:48.869> into<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> sand

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
everything start sinking into the sand

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.580 
everything start sinking into the sand
and<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:51.630> know<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.439> even

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
and you know so it's going to get even

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.300 
and you know so it's going to get even
shorter<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.909> when<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.299> there

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
shorter and so when I'm out there

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.859 
shorter and so when I'm out there
shooting<00:01:56.310> shots<00:01:56.579> I'm<00:01:56.850> typically<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.509> this

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
shooting shots I'm typically like this

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.429 
shooting shots I'm typically like this
and<00:01:58.710> after<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.549> few<00:01:59.969> waves<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.840> sunk<00:02:01.229> down

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
and after a few waves it's it sunk down

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.069 
and after a few waves it's it sunk down
to<00:02:01.710> what<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.890> call<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.490> high-water<00:02:03.360> mark<00:02:03.750> and

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
to what I call the high-water mark and

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.109 
to what I call the high-water mark and
because<00:02:05.040> I'm<00:02:05.189> sometimes<00:02:05.430> leaning<00:02:06.030> over

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
because I'm sometimes leaning over

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.140 
because I'm sometimes leaning over
looking<00:02:06.509> into<00:02:06.719> view

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
looking into view

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.969 
looking into view
I<00:02:07.180> don't<00:02:07.450> see<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.660> race<00:02:07.810> coming<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.320> I<00:02:08.560> feel

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
I don't see the race coming in I feel

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.040 
I don't see the race coming in I feel
the<00:02:09.100> water<00:02:09.310> coming<00:02:09.729> up<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.270> when<00:02:10.630> he<00:02:10.660> hits<00:02:10.899> the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
the water coming up and when he hits the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.020 
the water coming up and when he hits the
high-water<00:02:11.470> mark<00:02:11.830> that's<00:02:12.400> when<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.670> go<00:02:12.850> like

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
high-water mark that's when I go like

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.330 
high-water mark that's when I go like
this<00:02:15.570> but<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.750> swear<00:02:17.140> by<00:02:17.290> these<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.770> swear<00:02:18.190> by

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
this but I swear by these I swear by

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.850 
this but I swear by these I swear by
really<00:02:18.580> right<00:02:18.730> stuff<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:20.500> we<00:02:20.650> want<00:02:20.830> to

really right stuff so so if we want to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.160 
really right stuff so so if we want to
get<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.430> low<00:02:21.610> shots<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.210> I<00:02:22.240> typically

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
get really low shots that I typically

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.810 
get really low shots that I typically
want<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.470> get<00:02:23.620> some<00:02:23.770> really<00:02:23.980> low<00:02:24.130> sounds<00:02:24.580> how

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
want to get some really low sounds how

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.430 
want to get some really low sounds how

tripod I put it right on the ground so
together<00:03:26.140> with<00:03:26.470> something<00:03:26.830> like<00:03:27.010> this<00:03:27.220> you

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
together with something like this you

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.850 
together with something like this you
know<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.700> course<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.060> ball<00:03:28.269> cut<00:03:28.510> uh-huh<00:03:29.260> won't

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
you're still very low to the ground with

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.949 
you're still very low to the ground with
the<00:03:33.220> camranger<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:34.540> got<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.720> winning

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
the camranger you got a winning

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.120 
the camranger you got a winning
combination<00:03:35.230> because<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.739> don't<00:03:35.860> have<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.040> be

tripod I just grabbed both of these at

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.240 
tripod I just grabbed both of these at
the<00:05:06.070> same<00:05:06.100> time<00:05:06.520> spin<00:05:07.120> them<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:09.100> whole

the same time spin them and the whole
leg<00:05:09.400> extends<00:05:09.910> in<00:05:10.000> stuff<00:05:12.720> you<00:05:13.720> like<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.080> two

leg extends in stuff you like the two
section<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:21.040> more<00:05:21.220> ways<00:05:21.430> you<00:05:22.060> know<00:05:22.780> but<00:05:22.930> I<00:05:22.960> do

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
section the more ways you know but I do

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.530 
section the more ways you know but I do
have<00:05:23.350> there<00:05:23.500> for<00:05:23.770> section<00:05:24.280> there<00:05:24.850> big<00:05:25.030> monster

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
have there for section there big monster

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.630 
have there for section there big monster
with<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:25.750> gimbal<00:05:26.140> mount<00:05:26.380> on<00:05:26.560> because<00:05:27.430> if<00:05:27.550> you

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
with a gimbal mount on because if you

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.980 
with a gimbal mount on because if you
want<00:05:27.790> to<00:05:27.850> take<00:05:28.000> pictures<00:05:28.360> of<00:05:28.510> what<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.810> moon

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
want to take pictures of what the moon

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.510 
want to take pictures of what the moon
and<00:05:29.230> stuff

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.799 

okay<00:05:34.249> yeah<00:05:35.249> it's<00:05:35.400> about<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.580> same<00:05:35.849> as<00:05:36.089> mine

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:36.809 
okay yeah it's about the same as mine

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:38.890 
okay yeah it's about the same as mine
and<00:05:37.020> I'm<00:05:37.110> guessing<00:05:37.559> most<00:05:37.680> of<00:05:37.860> that<00:05:37.979> weight<00:05:38.099> is

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
and I'm guessing most of that weight is

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.619 
and I'm guessing most of that weight is
the<00:05:39.900> ball<00:05:40.050> head<00:05:40.319> and<00:05:40.529> obviously<00:05:41.300> steady<00:05:42.300> how

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:42.629 
the ball head and obviously steady how

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:45.320 
the ball head and obviously steady how
is<00:05:42.749> the<00:05:42.839> vibration<00:05:43.349> when<00:05:43.650> you're<00:05:43.770> shooting<00:05:44.330> I

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
is the vibration when you're shooting I

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.540 
is the vibration when you're shooting I
can<00:05:45.900> get<00:05:46.050> rock-solid<00:05:46.439> pitchers<00:05:46.949> if<00:05:47.339> it's

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
can get rock-solid pitchers if it's

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.739 
can get rock-solid pitchers if it's
windy<00:05:47.819> at<00:05:48.029> all<00:05:48.180> of<00:05:48.389> course

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:48.749 
windy at all of course
