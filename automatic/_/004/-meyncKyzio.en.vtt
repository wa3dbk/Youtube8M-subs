00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.029
 huge hello to all dear friends with 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.160
 taking you and today I would like 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.949
 talk about kharkov map specifically 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.900
 show you a nice tactic she 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.359
 relevant until most of the players are still 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.890
 not settled on this map that is I 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.619
 tactics will be relevant approximately 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.809
 two or three weeks maybe a little more I 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.570
 I do not know how it can be obtained in 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.550
 Generally what conclusion did I get on 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.879
 the map kharkov six times seven and observes 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.800
 all the time the same thing is this board 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 no one does anyone here at all 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.750
 does not go if why 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.879
 apparently everyone likes to urinate in the city go 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.520
 Here on this area and there prettier 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.460
 you can shoot in the meantime with 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.859
 This plateau has races in all 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.940
 crossroads of this city you can safely 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.880
 call in and present an unusual surprise 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:11.030
 generally what i want to say use 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.320
 it's like some kind of guide and try 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.880
 of course after the release of this video on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.299
 plateau will start to leave 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.890
 this is understandable but you will be one of the first 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.890
 from maybe something there to shoot in general 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 see that the enemies have a platoon of two pasha 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.060
 we see that they are all frayed in 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.340
 the city on a plateau just but attention force 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.100
 give a brazen at the crossroads there with someone 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.650
 fired well and not at all 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.340
 do n't bite at all i leave put on 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.430
 caterpillar 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.650
 pain attention just 0 even him 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.909
 sovzvodny does not come to help him 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.079
 in fact you are their problems 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.670
 but from this plateau you can very much 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.250
 help the team bend play 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.439
 the platoon t t t t t t will be himself in the city 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.270
 storks here a little bit from this plateau will 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.590
 drive in and look for the waffle rolls 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.719
 a little hurried and she too 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.250
 hurried we missed my friend but 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.020
 by itself passed it is not worth it to leave 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.149
 because here and and the drum is mad that 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.729
 do I charge against him but the bomb 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.170
 she is hiding and it's sad two land mines 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.720
 at all you have to shoot down 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.610
 capture but sometimes navov can we can 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.610
 time 2 tiger still burned essentially the same 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.799
 pain note that everyone is just 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.390
 leaving there its own atmosphere and in general 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.190
 don't care what you can call in with this 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.860
 hand i am figuratively the ultimate payment 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.400
 I call not really pay but me 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.560
 it's easier 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.819
 pretend i keep tiger 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.209
 second to the caterpillars and tread but not 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.340
 tenant simply not tenant son took 40 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.950
 video account that most went here 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.109
 it is here and somewhere closer to the square 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.370
 there still remained 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.069
 54-ka generally do not know what is there 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.900
 rides actually on Kharkov 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.760
 Now people are lost very much map 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.180
 unfamiliar card is new and 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.459
 well, they just get lost just Carpet that they 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.959
 are doing 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.900
 so if you are less in it 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.069
 you will understand very well so 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.829
 influence the outcome of the battle 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.319
 The main thing is to understand that this is how it seemed 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.959
 would result on the square 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.079
 what does she give us then you are on scale 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.639
 skirmishes tyazh and game from the tower but want 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.590
 from this what you need to actively 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.680
 act that is, you are pushing here and 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.769
 then you can come to this large-scale 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.909
 shootout we have a little help there or 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.959
 even a little bit 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.849
 meanwhile there is a battle between at15 our 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.250
 t-50 four and no one knows who else 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.919
 there are also waffles that I'm trying to do 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.079
 went to landmine on 519 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.819
 and planted the mood rose and everything and 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.810
 drove back enough will continue 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:45.019
 152 which should just get lost a 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.219
 well I can tell you that many 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.069
 asking for a video on Kharkov 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:51.049
 but it is too early to record anything 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.719
 from a detailed review to do on the map 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.939
 because I still do not know any store 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.829
 specific directions you put what 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.609
 going on real chaos going on in this 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.340
 Kharkov 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.560
 no one knows where to go they are doing 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.919
 it is not known what about this is how I look 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.569
 this salary is just forgotten and come here 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:11.419
 that time i was just going upstairs 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.189
 at15 frank steam this wall not 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.229
 I know that I found but apparently just 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.780
 cancellation wanted not to play like 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:21.739
 the kitten loves to play with the bird which 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.330
 will catch it does not eat it plays with it 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.250
 have he not even kill he plays with her 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.440
 Here probably I so decided that it is 15 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.470
 play well and honestly no way 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.500
 found just a lie of him 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.290
 you took and the general you get 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.050
 fast enough if you we did not stop 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.070
 from this side we would not take foch 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.290
 who could shoot well there 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.660
 the tiger is still a little goose 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.730
 put our opponents in chaos and hopefully 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.260
 you donâ€™t like this tactic 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.060
 forget to like and subscribe 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.840
 on the channel as well as these are your comments 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.310
 less of this tactic at the end of this 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.750
 video you will have an abstract on the playlist 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.430
