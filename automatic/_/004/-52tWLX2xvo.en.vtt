00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
which is called a floater um these are

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.930 
which is called a floater um these are
pretty<00:01:38.380> easy<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.770> make<00:01:38.980> just<00:01:39.010> some<00:01:39.490> wood<00:01:39.730> and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
pretty easy to make just some wood and

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.540 
pretty easy to make just some wood and
we'll<00:01:40.390> make<00:01:40.930> some<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.740> don't<00:01:41.890> need<00:01:42.070> too<00:01:42.310> many

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
we'll make some you don't need too many

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.120 
we'll make some you don't need too many
because<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.720> just<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.230> more<00:01:44.470> more<00:01:44.860> of<00:01:44.980> these

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
because it's just the more more of these

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.370 
because it's just the more more of these
you<00:01:45.310> have<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.820> better<00:01:46.330> your<00:01:46.570> ship<00:01:46.870> will<00:01:47.080> float

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
you have the better your ship will float

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.550 
you have the better your ship will float
so<00:01:48.010> basically<00:01:48.310> that's<00:01:48.550> how<00:01:48.760> it<00:01:48.880> is<00:01:49.110> um<00:01:50.110> then

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
so basically that's how it is um then

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.920 
this way it works really nicely it kind
of<00:05:26.260> registers<00:05:26.800> it<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:27.100> if<00:05:27.310> we<00:05:27.460> go<00:05:27.730> here<00:05:28.570> we<00:05:28.630> go

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
of registers it and if we go here we go

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:36.950 
of registers it and if we go here we go
we're<00:05:29.560> sailing<00:05:29.950> a<00:05:30.070> ship<00:05:30.120> dock<00:05:31.120> done

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
stop okay so if we had our steam engine

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.760 
stop okay so if we had our steam engine
going<00:05:42.790> it<00:05:43.210> would<00:05:43.420> run<00:05:43.660> a<00:05:43.690> little<00:05:43.990> bit<00:05:44.230> faster

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
going it would run a little bit faster

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.590 
going it would run a little bit faster
but<00:05:45.010> unfortunately<00:05:45.760> somehow<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.210> mods

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
but unfortunately somehow the mods

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.380 
but unfortunately somehow the mods
glitch<00:05:46.990> kind<00:05:47.380> of<00:05:47.560> and<00:05:47.770> it<00:05:48.190> doesn't<00:05:48.580> let<00:05:48.820> me<00:05:48.850> run

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
glitch kind of and it doesn't let me run

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.480 
glitch kind of and it doesn't let me run
it<00:05:49.570> so<00:05:50.200> unfortunately<00:05:50.830> this<00:05:50.980> thing<00:05:51.280> could

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
it so unfortunately this thing could

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.180 
it so unfortunately this thing could
move<00:05:51.790> a<00:05:51.820> lot<00:05:52.210> faster<00:05:52.240> if<00:05:52.930> I<00:05:53.080> had<00:05:53.110> that<00:05:53.500> as<00:05:53.860> you

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
move a lot faster if I had that as you

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.430 
move a lot faster if I had that as you
can<00:05:54.310> see<00:05:54.460> this<00:05:54.640> is<00:05:54.820> working<00:05:55.030> right<00:05:55.480> there<00:05:55.750> with

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
can see this is working right there with

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.650 
can see this is working right there with
my<00:05:56.620> Optifine<00:05:57.190> zoom<00:05:57.460> it<00:05:57.670> shows<00:05:57.910> you<00:05:58.390> the

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
my Optifine zoom it shows you the

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.980 
my Optifine zoom it shows you the
direction<00:05:58.900> with<00:05:59.530> the<00:05:59.620> compass<00:06:00.450> and<00:06:01.450> yeah

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
direction with the compass and yeah

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.360 
direction with the compass and yeah
we're<00:06:02.170> just<00:06:02.200> basically<00:06:02.500> sealing<00:06:03.220> these

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
we're just basically sealing these

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.210 
we're just basically sealing these
waters<00:06:03.940> like<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.180> boss<00:06:04.480> and<00:06:04.810> this<00:06:05.740> is<00:06:05.890> what<00:06:06.070> the

waters like a boss and this is what the

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.220 
waters like a boss and this is what the
Archimedes<00:06:06.790> ships<00:06:07.060> mod<00:06:07.390> does<00:06:07.660> so<00:06:07.870> basically

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
Archimedes ships mod does so basically
