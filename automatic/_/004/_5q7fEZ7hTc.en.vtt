amazing<00:04:19.699> disc<00:04:20.299> now<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.840> think<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.829> if<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:22.490> if

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
amazing disc now I think that if you if

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.649 
amazing disc now I think that if you if
you<00:04:23.330> bought<00:04:23.599> it<00:04:23.780> separately<00:04:25.360> without<00:04:26.360> the

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:26.659 
you bought it separately without the

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.120 
you bought it separately without the
alternate<00:04:26.990> toy<00:04:27.110> box<00:04:27.349> I<00:04:27.530> think<00:04:27.560> it<00:04:27.889> might<00:04:28.099> be

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
alternate toy box I think it might be

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.760 
alternate toy box I think it might be
holographic<00:04:29.000> I'm<00:04:29.570> pretty<00:04:29.900> sure<00:04:30.080> telegraphic

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
holographic I'm pretty sure telegraphic

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.219 
holographic I'm pretty sure telegraphic
it's<00:04:30.889> a<00:04:30.949> bit<00:04:31.159> of<00:04:31.490> a<00:04:31.699> different<00:04:32.030> cover<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.539> bit<00:04:33.110> of

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
it's a bit of a different cover a bit of

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.629 
it's a bit of a different cover a bit of
a<00:04:33.320> different<00:04:33.620> disc<00:04:33.830> but<00:04:34.070> this<00:04:34.159> is<00:04:34.280> some<00:04:34.430> nice

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
a different disc but this is some nice

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.580 
a different disc but this is some nice
really<00:04:34.970> nice<00:04:35.090> discs<00:04:35.449> anyways<00:04:36.229> even<00:04:36.260> though

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
really nice discs anyways even though

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.050 
really nice discs anyways even though
it's<00:04:36.740> not<00:04:36.860> holographic<00:04:37.810> so<00:04:38.949> and<00:04:39.949> then<00:04:40.460> next<00:04:40.729> we

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
it's not holographic so and then next we

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.310 
it's not holographic so and then next we
