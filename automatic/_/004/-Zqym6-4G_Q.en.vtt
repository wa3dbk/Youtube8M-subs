00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.659
 it's in France before departure 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.180

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.850

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.220

 and with regard to services that even satisfy 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960

 then realized that what is happening 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.340
 on videos like that always small things cit p that would allow 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.730
 to illustrate the mother the agreement 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.860
 world 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.350
 for those whom it concerns 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.610
 the transfer of the one who a priori where everything went well 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.680
 the transfer as a whole to finance itself financially 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.160

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.010

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.350

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.170
 but it went well this agreement which we saw you to do from a distance 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.170
