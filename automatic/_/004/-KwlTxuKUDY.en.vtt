2 that is the bay that we installed the
Seagate<00:01:35.459> drive<00:01:35.819> in<00:01:36.349> so<00:01:37.459> what<00:01:38.459> we<00:01:38.580> need<00:01:38.819> to<00:01:39.030> do

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
Seagate drive in so what we need to do

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:48.969 
Seagate drive in so what we need to do
is<00:01:39.899> go<00:01:40.649> into<00:01:40.890> erase<00:01:41.959> and<00:01:43.910> set<00:01:44.910> a<00:01:45.149> race

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
we go in and it's formatting the drive

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.320 
we go in and it's formatting the drive
to<00:01:53.420> racing<00:01:53.900> on<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.110> content<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.070> we<00:01:55.850> are<00:01:56.000> now

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
set if you don't want any partitions

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.590 
set if you don't want any partitions
that's<00:02:00.470> fine<00:02:00.799> you<00:02:01.070> can<00:02:01.220> partition<00:02:01.640> this<00:02:01.970> up<00:02:02.299> so

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
that's fine you can partition this up so

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.020 
that's fine you can partition this up so
you<00:02:02.689> could<00:02:02.810> have<00:02:03.020> like<00:02:03.229> one<00:02:03.470> like<00:02:03.979> two<00:02:04.340> it

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
you could have like one like two it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.300 
you could have like one like two it
would<00:02:05.299> show<00:02:05.509> up<00:02:05.690> as<00:02:05.869> two<00:02:06.710> different<00:02:06.890> drives

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
would show up as two different drives

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.650 
would show up as two different drives
this<00:02:07.640> is<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.789> neat<00:02:08.000> thing<00:02:08.030> about<00:02:08.270> disk

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
this is a neat thing about disk

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.600 
this is a neat thing about disk

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
now we have the partition named untitled

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.390 
now we have the partition named untitled
we<00:02:32.720> can<00:02:32.870> go<00:02:33.019> in<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.290> change<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.310> a
