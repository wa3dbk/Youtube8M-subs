00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
or nourishment it's more just for

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.080 
or nourishment it's more just for
comfort<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.550> get<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.940> bit

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
comfort so that can get a little bit

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.450 
comfort so that can get a little bit
exhausting<00:01:27.630> he's<00:01:27.990> still<00:01:28.320> sleeping<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:29.130> his

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
exhausting he's still sleeping in his

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.910 
exhausting he's still sleeping in his
little<00:01:29.730> co-sleeper<00:01:30.630> right<00:01:30.840> over<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.320> which

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
little co-sleeper right over there which

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.550 
little co-sleeper right over there which
she'll<00:01:32.280> probably<00:01:32.640> stay<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.230> until<00:01:34.230> he's<00:01:34.380> been

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
she'll probably stay in until he's been

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
she'll probably stay in until he's been
six<00:01:34.860> months<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.250> don't<00:01:35.460> plan<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.940> move<00:01:36.150> him<00:01:36.390> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
six months I don't plan to move him to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300 
six months I don't plan to move him to
his<00:01:36.780> own<00:01:36.960> room<00:01:37.200> until<00:01:37.500> he's<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.830> least<00:01:38.040> six

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
his own room until he's at least six

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.520 
his own room until he's at least six
months<00:01:38.430> haven't<00:01:39.120> started<00:01:39.420> doing<00:01:39.690> napkins<00:01:40.200> in

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
months haven't started doing napkins in

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.310 
months haven't started doing napkins in
his<00:01:41.070> bed<00:01:41.310> yet<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.120> think<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.660> probably<00:01:42.900> will

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
his bed yet but I think I probably will

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590 
his bed yet but I think I probably will
have<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:44.070> he's<00:01:44.610> definitely<00:01:44.910> gotten

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
have to because he's definitely gotten

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.390 
have to because he's definitely gotten
to<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.780> stage<00:01:46.020> where<00:01:46.260> he<00:01:46.350> gets<00:01:46.470> distracted<00:01:47.040> by

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
to the stage where he gets distracted by

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.790 
to the stage where he gets distracted by
things<00:01:47.460> now<00:01:47.910> whereas<00:01:48.300> before<00:01:48.330> he<00:01:48.930> wasn't<00:01:49.410> like

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
things now whereas before he wasn't like

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.150 
things now whereas before he wasn't like
for<00:01:50.220> example<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.850> he's<00:01:51.150> feeding<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.160> Amenia

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
for example if he's feeding and Amenia

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.860 
for example if he's feeding and Amenia
makes<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.520> noise<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:54.060> she<00:01:54.240> comes<00:01:54.390> up<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.600> him<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
makes a noise or she comes up to him and

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
from yesterday and he was amazing I did

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.580 
from yesterday and he was amazing I did
not<00:02:44.730> expect<00:02:45.150> him<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.330> recover<00:02:45.960> that<00:02:46.080> well<00:02:46.350> like

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
not expect him to recover that well like

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.800 
not expect him to recover that well like
he<00:02:46.830> hardly<00:02:47.610> cried<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:48.360> he<00:02:48.480> didn't<00:02:48.690> even

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
he hardly cried and then he didn't even

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.270 
he hardly cried and then he didn't even
get<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.960> temperature<00:02:49.290> or<00:02:49.620> anything<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.220> he

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
get a temperature or anything and he

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.590 
get a temperature or anything and he
didn't<00:02:50.820> even<00:02:51.440> feel<00:02:52.440> out<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.460> it<00:02:53.580> or<00:02:53.820> different

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
didn't even feel out of it or different

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.960 
didn't even feel out of it or different
I<00:02:54.720> don't<00:02:54.810> think<00:02:55.320> because<00:02:55.560> he<00:02:56.490> just<00:02:56.640> acted

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
I don't think because he just acted

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.730 
I don't think because he just acted
normal<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.390> whole<00:02:57.540> day<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.750> remember<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:58.650> the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
normal the whole day I remember with the

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.120 
normal the whole day I remember with the
media<00:02:59.040> she<00:02:59.280> slept<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.940> whole<00:02:59.970> day<00:03:00.150> after<00:03:00.690> and

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
media she slept the whole day after and

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.380 
media she slept the whole day after and
it<00:03:02.130> was<00:03:02.340> kind<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.640> weird<00:03:02.880> but<00:03:03.060> she<00:03:03.240> was<00:03:03.360> a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
it was kind of weird but she was a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.480 
it was kind of weird but she was a
little<00:03:03.600> bit<00:03:03.840> smaller<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.710> maybe<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.310> has

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
little bit smaller so maybe that has

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.830 
little bit smaller so maybe that has
something<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.820> do<00:03:06.000> with<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.300> all<00:03:06.420> he<00:03:06.510> wants<00:03:06.750> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
something to do with it all he wants to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.950 
something to do with it all he wants to
do<00:03:06.960> is<00:03:07.140> sit<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.470> stand<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.820> Amelia<00:03:09.390> did<00:03:09.750> not

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
do is sit and stand but Amelia did not

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.260 
do is sit and stand but Amelia did not
want<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.410> stand<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> lot<00:03:11.430> longer<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:11.880> that's

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
want to stand for a lot longer so that's

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.810 
want to stand for a lot longer so that's
a<00:03:12.480> big<00:03:12.989> difference<00:03:13.260> between<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.400> two<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.580> them

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
a big difference between the two of them

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.000 
a big difference between the two of them
she<00:03:15.300> just<00:03:15.480> wanted<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.870> sit<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.380> remember<00:03:16.830> where

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
she just wanted to sit I remember where

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.540 
she just wanted to sit I remember where
as<00:03:17.130> he<00:03:17.430> often<00:03:17.760> wants<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:19.650> stand<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.400> he

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
as he often wants to just stand and he

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.520
