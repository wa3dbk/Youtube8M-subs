00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.460
 the building is beyond the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.490
 Prefect testing it 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.099
 So, how come you have nothing to do now? 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.260
 so I'll try to show something 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.279
 interesting is that perhaps it will help the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.650
 River 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.380
 in the video conversion part has a 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.910
 very good problem 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.300
 his name is in the format fertile 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.610
 google and half on the page with appear 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.890
 dubai sheik download the program 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.920
 excellent converts any format to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.050
 any shape and look that's okay 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.420
 is that you get paid that there are some graduates 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.600
 mainly rvb when it will convert 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.550
 of the cause in the role of many times 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.649
 he converts this one after all he is 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.329
 free 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.879
 who does not know or such a search for a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.699
 program is a great suggestion 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.340
 but in addition to converting it has a 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.170
 very legal function that impute caption 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.290
 when we lose three movies in the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.720
 internet my old age the legend goes 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.180
 separate what happens sometimes people 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.970
 China DVD player or some 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.520
 televisions even connect directly into the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.680
 xbox to watch on television that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.009
 happens these devices does not recognize 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.549
 a separate schedule then using format 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.310
 fertile and we will implode your caption 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.479
 Come on, anyone who already has the program does not have 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.689
 no secret right? 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.600
 you already know about his role of 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.560
 conversion who does not have can download and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.970
 now let's show you how you do it 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.970
 built-in ice 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.290
 by the program here has a format of 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.720
 video may have any 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:59.840
 base video because you fear to lose 4 there would be 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:03.290
 mpb mkv bob and turn paper in case 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.960
 I'll get one that already have come Avai 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.420
 funding very well and I will call you 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.660
 output will fall but could be any 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.210
 another format but enjoy that I do not 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.630
 I saw this movie, it already leaves him 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.250
 defend the tip until the jab in the school 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.180
 and became naturalized 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.140
 Let's convert to see and add. 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:33.410
 file that such a movie file is not 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:42.500
 superman chose the movie settings 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:46.420
 aida in secret to the aki additional caption 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:52.400
 legal system that recognizes other 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.560
 rtss ssa is there are some problems that only 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.900
 a type of energy can be added 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.540
 here you never find vacancies 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.540
 I'm going to add a super messi rt 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.800
 another very important thing 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:14.900
 the audio sting index would be this 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:17.680
 when you spend a video and audio the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.269
 first portuguese audio 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.260
 according to English or may be the reverse 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.180
 also the second Englishman of the rooster 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.730
 happens when we make the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.730
 conversion if we leave default 01 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.560
 he goes in search of the legend in the first 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.450
 audio in this year's case is in English 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:45.500
 It's no excuse neither Portuguese nor 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.860
 any template caption in Portuguese 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.590
 so I went there and selected 12 which is great 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:56.270
 English that interests me 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.400
 click ok settings dizzy that I 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.050
 Already have caption already has my other 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.020
 selected 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.200
 click here 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.870
 caption font customize not 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.550
 you can quit smoking even at 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.750
 pomegranate 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.019
 I let color fountain white edge thing 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.730
 Black understand other things here 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.650
 edge but anything you put 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.930
 daughter had a glow depending on the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:30.380
 device that provides if it is small with 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:32.600
 a cell phone for example is psp can 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.330
 bad because it gets very difficult 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.550
 to arrive this year the source gum is the 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.550
 Excellent black ball color for 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:49.160
 selecting my computer takes on average 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.330
 25 minutes depending on the size of the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.930
 archive also this time can 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.870
 vary 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.820
 the staff has a more fussy computer 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.910
 they say it can be light and less 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.070
 time but here is just wait for the conversion 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.130
 can do something else have to 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.290
 option to turn off the computer 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:14.180
 after conversion and recommend doing this 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.130
 by me lets convert and do and not 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.510
 if you want to convince with 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.180
 another movie have to do this 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.160
 process, one of them can not 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.229
 you do in sequence 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.540
 each beauty then I hope that this 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:33.710
 first video has helped someone know if 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.800
 Someone to talk only because then but if it comes 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.530
 It was of help, I had some questions. 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.950
 can make that I could only help your 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.950
 positions
