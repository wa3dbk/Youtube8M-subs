stops and rear shock mounts spring rate
is<00:00:31.890> increased<00:00:32.340> 10%<00:00:32.660> that's<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
is increased 10% that's because one the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.660 
is increased 10% that's because one the
spring<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.710> fairly<00:00:34.890> stuff<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> ends<00:00:35.550> we

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
spring is fairly stuff on the ends we

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.370 
spring is fairly stuff on the ends we
already<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> other<00:00:36.540> reason<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
already but the other reason is you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.900 
already but the other reason is you
wanted<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> match<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.219> damping<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
wanted to match the damping it's in the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.280 
wanted to match the damping it's in the
car<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> electronic<00:00:39.630> shock<00:00:39.840> absorbers

car in the electronic shock absorbers
since<00:00:40.800> we're<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:40.980> replacing<00:00:41.460> those<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.730> need

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
since we're not replacing those we need

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.160 
since we're not replacing those we need
to<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.030> careful<00:00:42.390> about<00:00:42.450> changing<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> spring

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
to be careful about changing the spring

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.450 
to be careful about changing the spring
rate<00:00:43.379> too<00:00:43.559> much<00:00:44.030> okay<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:46.160> want<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.220> spend<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
rate too much okay I want to spend a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.490 
rate too much okay I want to spend a
little<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.760> time<00:00:48.000> discussing<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.290> bump

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
little bit of time discussing the bump

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.620 
little bit of time discussing the bump
stops<00:00:49.740> and<00:00:49.950> how<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.100> bump<00:00:50.340> stops<00:00:50.579> work<00:00:50.910> okay

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
stops and how the bump stops work okay

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.240 
stops and how the bump stops work okay
this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> original<00:00:52.470> bump<00:00:52.860> stop<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
this is the original bump stop that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.680 
this is the original bump stop that
comes<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> car<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.240> the<00:00:54.329> dining

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
comes in the car and this is the dining

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.210 
comes in the car and this is the dining
one<00:00:54.900> and<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.380> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.650> it's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.950> little<00:00:56.100> bit

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
one and as you can see it's a little bit

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.640 
one and as you can see it's a little bit
shorter<00:00:56.810> this<00:00:57.810> is<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> original<00:00:58.410> spring

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
shorter this is the original spring

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.290 
shorter this is the original spring
perch<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.160> comes<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> car<00:00:59.700> this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
perch that comes in the car this is a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.960 
perch that comes in the car this is a
901<00:01:00.810> it's<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.260> little<00:01:01.440> bit<00:01:01.530> shorter<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.700> reason

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
901 it's a little bit shorter the reason

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.990 
901 it's a little bit shorter the reason
we<00:01:03.060> do<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:04.009> stop<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.339> car<00:01:05.519> Li<00:01:05.670> has<00:01:05.790> three

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
we do this is stop the car Li has three

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.969 
we do this is stop the car Li has three
quarters<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> should<00:01:06.600> travel<00:01:06.840> between<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
quarters of it should travel between the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.690 
quarters of it should travel between the
bump<00:01:08.189> stop<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:10.020> shock<00:01:10.229> body<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.799> most

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
bump stop and the shock body and most

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.160 
bump stop and the shock body and most
Springs<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.299> buy<00:01:12.450> lower<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.899> car<00:01:13.079> in

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
Springs that you buy lower the car in

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.749 
Springs that you buy lower the car in
inch<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> lower<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> car<00:01:14.310> an<00:01:14.399> inch

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
inch so if you lower the car an inch

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.969 
inch so if you lower the car an inch
there's<00:01:15.000> only<00:01:15.060> 3/4<00:01:15.570> inch<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.899> travel<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.829> is

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
there's only 3/4 inch of travel this is

steps out and goes sideways when you
leave<00:01:34.139> that's<00:01:34.439> because<00:01:34.770> you've<00:01:34.920> increased

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
leave that's because you've increased

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.709 
leave that's because you've increased

here<00:01:45.029> is<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:45.569> his<00:01:45.689> first<00:01:45.899> touches<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.409> can

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
here is when his first touches you can

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.230 
here is when his first touches you can
barely<00:01:46.859> feel<00:01:47.039> it<00:01:47.069> and<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.639> compresses<00:01:48.029> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
barely feel it and as it compresses the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.849 
barely feel it and as it compresses the
spring<00:01:48.270> rate<00:01:48.630> goes<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.319> spring<00:01:49.590> goes

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
spring rate goes up but the spring goes

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.489 
spring rate goes up but the spring goes
up<00:01:49.979> fairly<00:01:50.279> rapidly<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.869> what<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.109> do<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.380> we

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:52.499 
up fairly rapidly so what we do is we

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:57.949 
up fairly rapidly so what we do is we
shorten<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.159> device<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.450> shorten<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
shorten this device and we shorten the

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.589 
shorten this device and we shorten the
spring<00:01:58.229> perch<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.679> well<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.849> once<00:02:00.029> the<00:02:00.209> car<00:02:00.450> is

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
spring perch as well so once the car is

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.109 
spring perch as well so once the car is
lowered<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:02.130> still<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.429> the<00:02:02.520> same<00:02:02.729> travel

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
lowered you still have the same travel

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.510 
lowered you still have the same travel
the<00:02:03.179> car<00:02:03.389> headstock<00:02:03.899> okay<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.069> goal<00:02:05.279> here<00:02:05.490> is

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the car headstock okay the goal here is

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.129 
the car headstock okay the goal here is
to<00:02:05.670> maintain<00:02:05.819> a<00:02:06.029> high<00:02:06.240> ride<00:02:06.479> quality<00:02:06.929> as<00:02:07.020> well

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:07.139 
to maintain a high ride quality as well

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:08.809 
to maintain a high ride quality as well
as<00:02:07.200> mechanical<00:02:07.740> grip<00:02:07.979> because<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
as mechanical grip because the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.699 
as mechanical grip because the
suspension<00:02:09.119> isn't<00:02:09.390> bottomed<00:02:09.660> out<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.530> car

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
suspension isn't bottomed out the car

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.620 
suspension isn't bottomed out the car
will<00:02:10.830> turn<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.280> lot<00:02:11.430> better<00:02:11.580> put<00:02:12.240> down<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> lot

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
will turn in a lot better put down a lot

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.510 
will turn in a lot better put down a lot
more<00:02:12.870> power<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.410> ride<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> lot<00:02:14.040> better<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.430> you

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
more power and ride a lot better so you

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.040 
more power and ride a lot better so you
get<00:02:14.640> everything<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.450> takes<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.750> few<00:02:15.780> more

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
get everything it just takes a few more

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.610 
get everything it just takes a few more
pieces<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.770> there<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.050> stacked<00:02:19.380> all<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
pieces to get there so I stacked all the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.020 
pieces to get there so I stacked all the
parts<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:20.040> here<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.459> can<00:02:20.579> see<00:02:20.760> what<00:02:20.909> we're

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
parts up here so you can see what we're

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.149 
parts up here so you can see what we're
talking<00:02:21.060> about<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.810> more<00:02:21.959> detail<00:02:22.379> this<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
talking about in more detail this is a

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.550 
talking about in more detail this is a
stock<00:02:23.489> spring<00:02:23.879> perch<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.299> bump<00:02:24.540> stop<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:25.409> is

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
stock spring perch and bump stop this is

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.000 
stock spring perch and bump stop this is
a<00:02:25.590> Dyna

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
a Dyna

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.619 
a Dyna
spring<00:02:26.220> perch<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.610> bump<00:02:26.819> stop<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.360> front

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
spring perch and bump stop for the front

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.270 
spring perch and bump stop for the front
and<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.290> see<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.650> increased<00:02:28.980> travel

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
and you can see the increased travel

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.910 
and you can see the increased travel
there<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:31.140> rear<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> upper

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
there in the rear this is the upper

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.679 
there in the rear this is the upper
shock<00:02:32.129> mount<00:02:32.159> stock<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.909> is<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.209> Dinan<00:02:33.510> one

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
shock mount stock this is the Dinan one

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.539 
shock mount stock this is the Dinan one
again<00:02:34.049> you<00:02:34.079> can<00:02:34.290> see<00:02:34.439> the<00:02:34.560> increase<00:02:34.829> in<00:02:35.069> travel

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
again you can see the increase in travel

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.569 
again you can see the increase in travel
so<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> lot<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.930> research<00:02:37.319> goes<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.829> we

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
so a lot of research goes to this we

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.490 
so a lot of research goes to this we
spent<00:02:38.879> close<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.360> year<00:02:39.599> driving<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:40.170> car<00:02:40.319> on

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
spent close to a year driving the car on

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.530 
spent close to a year driving the car on
high<00:02:40.680> speed<00:02:40.980> making<00:02:41.310> little<00:02:41.459> adjustments<00:02:41.549> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
high speed making little adjustments to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.110 
high speed making little adjustments to
the<00:02:42.659> travel<00:02:43.079> to<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.799> spring<00:02:44.099> rate<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.940> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
the travel to the spring rate it's the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.490 
the travel to the spring rate it's the
absorption<00:02:45.480> rate<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> bump<00:02:46.079> stop<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:46.440> you

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
absorption rate of the bump stop so you

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.020 
absorption rate of the bump stop so you
give<00:02:46.650> them<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:47.099> right<00:02:47.280> feel<00:02:47.549> for<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.819> car

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
give them the right feel for the car

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.940 
give them the right feel for the car
cars<00:02:48.720> predictable<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.290> has<00:02:49.440> great<00:02:49.739> ride

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
cars predictable and has great ride

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.039 
cars predictable and has great ride
quality<00:02:50.390> now<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.450> other<00:02:51.659> reason<00:02:51.840> these

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
quality now the other reason these

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.420 
quality now the other reason these
things<00:02:52.109> are<00:02:52.409> designed<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.890> way<00:02:52.920> they<00:02:53.129> are<00:02:53.280> is

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
things are designed the way they are is

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.089 
things are designed the way they are is
under<00:02:53.909> slow<00:02:54.269> speed<00:02:54.629> corners<00:02:55.079> we<00:02:55.739> want<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.980> make

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
under slow speed corners we want to make

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.559 
under slow speed corners we want to make
it<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.310> these<00:02:56.430> don't<00:02:56.670> touch<00:02:57.000> when<00:02:57.450> you're

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
it so these don't touch when you're

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.059 
it so these don't touch when you're
driving<00:02:57.900> around<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.290> town<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.829> they<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.040> a

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
driving around in town and they have a

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.920 
driving around in town and they have a
nice<00:02:59.250> ride<00:02:59.579> but<00:03:00.180> also<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.569> really<00:03:00.810> good

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
nice ride but also that really good

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.149 
nice ride but also that really good
mechanical<00:03:01.409> grip<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:01.680> were<00:03:01.799> talking<00:03:02.129> about

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
mechanical grip we were talking about

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.250 
mechanical grip we were talking about
when<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.549> car<00:03:02.760> goes<00:03:02.970> faster<00:03:03.000> an<00:03:03.690> aerodynamic

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
when the car goes faster an aerodynamic

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.170 
when the car goes faster an aerodynamic
pressure<00:03:04.440> pushes<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.069> car<00:03:05.250> down<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:06.060> you

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
pressure pushes the car down and you

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.399 
pressure pushes the car down and you
load<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.389> car<00:03:06.690> for<00:03:06.900> them<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.049> go<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.290> they're

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
load the car for them to go and they're

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.379 
load the car for them to go and they're
harder<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.769> go<00:03:07.920> into<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.129> corner<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:08.760> want<00:03:09.269> us

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
harder to go into a corner and want us

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.550 
harder to go into a corner and want us
to<00:03:09.510> touch<00:03:09.720> down<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.109> add<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> little<00:03:10.440> bit

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
to touch down and add a little bit

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.199 
to touch down and add a little bit
spring<00:03:10.920> break<00:03:11.129> so<00:03:11.519> they<00:03:11.639> spring<00:03:11.909> right<00:03:12.060> to

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209
