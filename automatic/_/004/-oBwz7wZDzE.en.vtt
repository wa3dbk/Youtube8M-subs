00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.530
 when I think back to those guys 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.170
 who jumped out of that plane and that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.029
 arrived on ships then yes why 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.680
 my age even younger and they have 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.470
 just not so much in life 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.699
 before they died 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.949
 And then you might think they are too 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.170
 never been in love or I think so 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.029
 always fierce to think about 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.800
 we have so much choice that we can 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.580
 and so many possibilities and that 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 haven't had them all in the 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.600
 30 candidates receive the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.640
 chance to have the largest military operation 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:49.140
 to experience in history there 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.430
 the idea connected everything do this first 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.590
 must be group of gothic veneer 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.120
 become soldiers during training 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.040
 very quickly becomes clear find physical 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.670
 and able to handle mental pressure and who 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.550
 not 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.450
 el prado women not reasonable as me 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.450
 speak to you 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.990
 the 20 all strongest are selected 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.860
 and divided into two infantrymen 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.590
 and parachutists from fantasists here 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.020
 just like the soldiers from back then 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.220
 to overcome fears 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.940
 See that naturally forces the rest 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.940
 may not have one en route 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.690
 everything she prepares herself for teaching 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.670
 their important mission normandy 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.150
 limits are searched and limits 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.150
 be shifted 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.680
 single t heard but not in the right 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.820
 place 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.820
 not everyone survives 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.970
 place after that harder training in the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.950
 footsteps of the tens of thousands 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.070
 Allied soldiers on June 6 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.480
 1944 landed in france to europe 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.020
 liberate 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.790
 very difficult to imagine that there 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.710
 so many people have snowed 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.000
 its now living for you that is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.050
 difficult to imagine because that happens 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.050
 these days just not anymore 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.840
 the candidates will land on the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.000
 historical grounds of normandy one 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.380
 Group experience of what the soldiers 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.380
 then we have to endure 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.630
 by vultures around your ears hey 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.460
 yes and dakota they always have bullet holes 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.100
 still in when i tell you also the feeling of 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.270
 ok i am already sitting here with nerves 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.830
 You can scream all over my body and you can 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.700
 imagine if you just hit the bullets 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.700
 standard flying 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.360
 good way we write that 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.860
 just them 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.900
 70 years ago the plane here 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.330
 stand out for our freedom that we 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.130
 then just do what they don't 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.370
 know that is their landing 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.500
 not the end is just like 70 years 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.390
 Only then does the fight begin 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.890
 don't fight the Nazis 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.060
 it is the paratroopers against the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.920
 infantrymen 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.140
 every day there is a new mission and in 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.410
 the brutal knockout they make their way 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.620
 to Paris 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.879
 is the 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.470
 I don't know if it's halfway now 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.470
 about it because almost at the end 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.680
 every day in yourself a bit 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.170
 motivate in a humane way anyway 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.580
 weather 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.580
 to walk one 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.829
 all right 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:33.340
 The most striking thing is that they are people 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.900
 those who dare to fight for freedom 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.139
 in per se 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.940
 how intense it has been for all those 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.840
 people lying here and I wonder 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.710
 what went through time to touch 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.610
 me really, really 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:54.259
 then you put the oil intersection 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.259
 they are not all
