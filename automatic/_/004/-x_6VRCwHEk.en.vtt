00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059

people around me and now it's just up to
me

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.630 

he<00:00:38.500> wants<00:00:38.769> to<00:00:38.890> know<00:00:38.980> what<00:00:39.129> he's<00:00:39.219> doing<00:00:39.460> wrong

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
he wants to know what he's doing wrong

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.069 
he wants to know what he's doing wrong
he<00:00:39.820> wants<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:40.210> know<00:00:40.329> what<00:00:40.510> he<00:00:40.600> could<00:00:40.750> do<00:00:40.840> to<00:00:40.870> be

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
he wants to know what he could do to be

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.840 
he wants to know what he could do to be
better<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:41.500> I<00:00:41.829> think<00:00:42.309> that's<00:00:42.489> neat<00:00:42.670> because

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
better and I think that's neat because

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.509 
better and I think that's neat because
he<00:00:43.089> takes<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:44.129> information<00:00:45.129> you<00:00:45.190> give<00:00:45.370> him

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
he takes the information you give him

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.220 
he takes the information you give him
really<00:00:45.789> well<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.180> he<00:00:46.269> puts<00:00:46.510> it<00:00:46.600> to<00:00:46.719> work<00:00:46.899> and

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
really well and he puts it to work and

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.200 
really well and he puts it to work and
he's<00:00:47.649> always<00:00:47.860> looking<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.640> get<00:00:48.789> that<00:00:48.940> feedback

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
he's always looking to get that feedback

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.599 
he's always looking to get that feedback
so<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.739> neat<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.039> work<00:00:51.159> with<00:00:51.339> him<00:00:51.489> in<00:00:51.579> that

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
so it's neat to work with him in that

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.369 
so it's neat to work with him in that
sense<00:00:51.909> a<00:00:52.000> lot<00:00:52.120> of<00:00:52.180> kids<00:00:52.449> aren't<00:00:52.780> really<00:00:53.170> like

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
sense a lot of kids aren't really like

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.530 
sense a lot of kids aren't really like
that<00:00:53.589> they<00:00:53.829> don't<00:00:54.010> have<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.030> maturity<00:00:55.510> that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
that they don't have the maturity that

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.920 
that they don't have the maturity that
he<00:00:55.780> does<00:00:55.989> so<00:00:56.909> again<00:00:57.909> it's<00:00:58.089> just<00:00:58.239> neat<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.629> have

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
he does so again it's just neat to have

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.350 
he does so again it's just neat to have
a<00:00:58.989> kid<00:00:59.229> that's<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.769> that<00:01:00.280> mature<00:01:00.699> that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
a kid that's the that mature that

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.320 
a kid that's the that mature that
talented<00:01:02.019> and<00:01:03.119> receptive<00:01:04.119> to<00:01:04.149> the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
talented and receptive to the

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.210 
talented and receptive to the
