00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello and welcome one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.890
 flexible multimedia audio solution the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.580
 he wants to celebrate with the c2 xd 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.840
 to offer 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.839
 for around 100 euros this is a 2.1 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.270
 speaker system with central 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.490
 control unit yes quite flexible 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 Connection equipment including optical 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.340
 digital input and also one more 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.340
 remote Control 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.649
 what can you find in the big box? 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.879
 safely packed is included 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.769
 including this yes check card size 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.379
 remote control the at least the 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.670
 Basic function offers out of anger 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.789
 Volume control heights and depths 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.100
 regulation and initial selection 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:12.130
 we have two cables included 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.880
 optical digital cable and then here 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.880
 this into the jack cable and of course 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.190
 there is also instruction manual that 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.399
 loudspeaker system itself consists in 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.250
 principle of four sharing the two 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.590
 satellites the subwoofer and the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.100
 central control unit with the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.530
 amplifier in it 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.000
 the speakers will be mdf 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.009
 made look quite robust if we 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.289
 But the size comparison then ask 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.340
 with a yes actually sooner 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:51.459
 then a compact shelf speaker 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.860
 volume is quite limited, we still have to 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:58.179
 look how the then on the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.539
 acoustics has taken effect 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.310
 we will be uncomplicated all year round 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.020
 have back here on the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.729
 control unit the different 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.610
 Connections for the speakers and for 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.660
 the inputs that's all then 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.720
 also nicely marked here 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.030
 speaker the left wise then becomes 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:22.269
 simply color associated with the right 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.310
 satellite then nicely marked with red and 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.150
 then we have the subwoofer down here 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.370
 then all speakers are already 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.209
 Tied up then the different ones 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.170
 inputs sharks and optical 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:41.170
 digital input additional here laterally 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.170
 still a headphone jack and a 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:50.910
 another aux entrance 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:55.370
 and head-on to the controls then 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.140
 still the main switch put in short 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.470
 and then you will light the display 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.520
 on the material control unit 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.010
 made of plastic so nix shaped 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.650
 design with this central control 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.120
 element that you could still have 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.720
 to be a bit higher quality when you go to 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:23.459
 for example, this tricycle looks nice here 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.500
 alu or stainless steel makes something 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.410
 have calm at the plastic 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.720
 Price would be everything else well 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.100
 too much is expected so what can we do now 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.830
 Of course, we have control in the 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.870
 In the middle of the big volume control we 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.220
 can regulate the heights and depths here 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.590
 what is then controlled becomes easy 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.380
 by the color now not quite like that 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.810
 matching green leds indicated that applies 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:54.720
 then also for the initial display here 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.390
 right and with that we have 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.310
 the controls presented what 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.579
 now, of course, are missing sounds 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.760
 Impressions for this we will the c2 xd 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:10.140
 now both with music and with 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.570
 various games and film rehearsals 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.750
 our sound impressions of our 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.970
 assessment to the celebration multimedia 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.739
 loudspeaker system which then exists in 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.700
 usual form in detail 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.700
