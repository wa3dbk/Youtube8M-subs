00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.899
 well i want to take romance ka 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.210
 It's a little photographer Timur 's 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.490
 man is already man enough 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.549
 worked closely with this model and wanted 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.570
 would know his opinion as a professional 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.449
 good camera justifies mine 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.990
 expectations very user-friendly interface very 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.590
 convenient device everything turns out a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.310
 very handy setup manual study in 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.279
 manual mode 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.230
 that help you good pictures that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.720
 guessing about the Quaker did not seem a little 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.190
 gasoline imbalance accounts constantly 2 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.770
 rear and second hand 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.170
 Well, so I always keep it second 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.850
 hand would it be professional and uncle 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.519
 with your big hands you even need to take 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.949
 at 10,000 well hands you can well 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.879
 fix it and take pictures i got it 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:54.870
 another question about the matrix we did not look at 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.370
 the account is quiet what feelings about and without 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.049
 this has not yet come across 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.510
 or see see the water is not removed 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:03.000
 arson or not is not removed in the side 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.010
 need most likely a pressing question for 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.420
 amateur photographers are not for professionals from 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.040
 for those who hit shoot for example 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.440
 for example, wicked objects of children 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.240
 for example how about hybrid 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.369
 whether autofocus well showed 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.950
 does it even make sense to amateur 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.220
 memory channels set so fast 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.470
 systems 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.780
 Basically yes he's proved itself very good 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.820
 shows itself very well when 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.810
 there is not enough light to our child 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.150
 that's when there is overcast and something and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.190
 cloudy weather and Lenochka times jars 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.080
 Well, in this still for the order, then you did not take off 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.700
 good lighting shot normal for 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.950
 manor you have not yet encountered and if 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.750
 who misses me . 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.720
 especially when it comes to something 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.630
 moving romania that he is not quite 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.520
 I don’t know for sure but I’m pretty 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.260
 handy thing where do you click on that 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.840
 place he focuses here thanks to the fact 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.850
 that he touch screen is very comfortable he 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.200
 pressed a finger he immediately caught the focus on 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.640
 this place is clear to you 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.290
 rate of fire when turn on 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.810
 serial shoot there are seven or eight 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.030
 frames for always very high not even 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.780
 have time pressed them to us on what business 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.420
 then long there 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.520
 this bumps not much not 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.830
 strongly there is a little processing up 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.470
 information but not like the last model 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.140
 and it works more quickly even shot 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.630
 the panorama is very good everything seemed 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.630
 Well, thank you very much thank you
