00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
the moment you figure it stops charging

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.330 
the moment you figure it stops charging

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
you can find replace with some other way

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.780 
you can find replace with some other way
it<00:04:10.340> doesn't<00:04:10.610> work

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.520 

okay<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:14.940> actually<00:04:15.330> working<00:04:15.510> in<00:04:16.200> one<00:04:16.320> of<00:04:16.350> the

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
okay it's actually working in one of the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.460 
okay it's actually working in one of the
sideways<00:04:16.950> so<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:18.329> does<00:04:18.450> not<00:04:18.600> matter<00:04:18.900> probably

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
sideways so it does not matter probably

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.520 
sideways so it does not matter probably
the<00:04:19.650> way<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:19.860> have<00:04:20.130> placed<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.549> phone<00:04:20.790> it's

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
the way you have placed the phone it's

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.400 
the way you have placed the phone it's
mainly<00:04:22.530> depends<00:04:23.010> on<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:27.210> connecting<00:04:27.810> options

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
mainly depends on the connecting options

where in the receiver on the phone

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.420 
where in the receiver on the phone
should<00:04:32.070> be<00:04:32.100> at<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.460> right<00:04:32.640> place<00:04:32.700> so<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:34.430> can

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
should be at the right place so you can

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.130 
should be at the right place so you can
generally<00:04:35.880> use<00:04:36.060> your<00:04:36.270> phone<00:04:36.510> for<00:04:36.540> a<00:04:36.840> video

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
calling purpose and still the phone

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.150 
calling purpose and still the phone
would<00:04:39.030> be<00:04:39.210> charging<00:04:39.780> at<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.080> same<00:04:40.290> time<00:04:40.500> so

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
would be charging at the same time so

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.770 
would be charging at the same time so
that<00:04:41.400> would<00:04:41.610> be<00:04:41.640> added<00:04:42.060> advantage<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.750> can

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
that would be added advantage you can

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.750 
that would be added advantage you can
also<00:04:42.990> start<00:04:43.290> watching<00:04:43.770> movies<00:04:44.100> on<00:04:44.130> this<00:04:44.460> phone

or<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.900> any<00:04:46.200> other<00:04:46.290> stuff<00:04:47.040> while<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.760> phone<00:04:48.030> is

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
or to any other stuff while the phone is

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.260 
or to any other stuff while the phone is
conducive<00:04:49.170> charging<00:04:49.710> in<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.890> background<00:04:50.270> so

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
conducive charging in the background so

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.820 
conducive charging in the background so
that<00:04:51.300> would<00:04:51.630> be<00:04:51.660> one<00:04:51.990> very<00:04:52.020> good<00:04:52.320> reason<00:04:52.440> of

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
that would be one very good reason of

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.430 
that would be one very good reason of
using<00:04:53.280> this<00:04:53.460> wireless<00:04:54.030> charger<00:04:54.390> as<00:04:55.230> you<00:04:55.380> can

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
see it's right glove still charging the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.120 
see it's right glove still charging the
device<00:04:59.630> so<00:05:00.630> that's<00:05:00.870> pretty<00:05:01.020> good<00:05:01.200> now<00:05:01.680> what<00:05:01.950> we

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
device so that's pretty good now what we

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.730 
device so that's pretty good now what we
will<00:05:02.220> do<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.520> in<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:02.970> next<00:05:03.210> week<00:05:03.390> we<00:05:04.140> already

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
set up for the LG Nexus 4 we would

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.070 
set up for the LG Nexus 4 we would
actually<00:05:11.580> compare<00:05:12.030> both<00:05:12.570> of<00:05:12.720> these<00:05:12.870> at<00:05:13.050> the

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
actually compare both of these at the

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.130 
actually compare both of these at the
same<00:05:13.350> time<00:05:13.530> by<00:05:13.710> charging<00:05:14.070> two<00:05:14.550> units<00:05:15.300> of<00:05:15.540> Nexus

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
same time by charging two units of Nexus

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.010 
same time by charging two units of Nexus
4<00:05:16.350> with<00:05:17.010> completely<00:05:17.970> discharged<00:05:18.419> battery<00:05:18.660> and

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
4 with completely discharged battery and

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.780 
4 with completely discharged battery and
see<00:05:19.230> how<00:05:19.410> long<00:05:19.620> does<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.800> take<00:05:20.100> for<00:05:20.310> both<00:05:20.669> of

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
see how long does it take for both of

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.520 
see how long does it take for both of
these<00:05:20.940> two<00:05:21.180> actually<00:05:21.419> charged<00:05:21.930> that<00:05:22.380> would

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
these two actually charged that would

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.500 
these two actually charged that would
use<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.740> better<00:05:22.980> comparison<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:23.730> then<00:05:24.330> we

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
use a better comparison and then we

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.409 
use a better comparison and then we
would<00:05:24.630> know<00:05:24.660> if<00:05:25.020> this<00:05:25.580> dollar<00:05:26.580> price<00:05:26.940> wireless

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
would know if this dollar price wireless

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:28.700 
would know if this dollar price wireless
charger<00:05:27.690> is<00:05:27.870> actually<00:05:28.169> both<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.470> money<00:05:28.620> on

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
charger is actually both the money on
