00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 in this world there are mysteries rumors 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.629
 and things that we can not 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.760
 explain for the same reason people 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.340
 he decides to ignore them and not worry much 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.170
 in them on one side that's wrong because 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.910
 we are ignored we will never know the truth 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.730
 behind all those unexplained things 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.800
 but the curiosity is there although to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.840
 Sometimes that same curiosity can 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.789
 cause death hello and welcome a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.039
 once again the macabre dimension I am my 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.660
 copina and today I bring you the review of 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.660
 anna see so let's start 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.290
 to swim is a series of horror mystery 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.180
 and quite a goal is pretty easy to 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.400
 continue since it only has 12 chapters 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.310
 which were shown on January 10 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.050
 until March 27, 2012 is based on 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.900
 a novel of the same name which was 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.580
 published on October 29 of 2009 this 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.440
 series was produced by Pia and works 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.330
 who in the past have worked in 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.100
 series like ennio beat and brett of air 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.320
 grow this anime contains two 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.540
 protagonists and a teenager who 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.670
 just moved out of town since 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.500
 suffers from a heart disease this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.479
 character is a bit interesting though 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.940
 not from my favorites and then we have to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.410
 misaki una chava which all seem 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.510
 ignore in this new school that 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.970
 just moved tucci this character me 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.250
 He liked it a lot and although it 's a bit dry 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.380
 that adds to the mystery that is in it and 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.570
 He also has a patch on his eye and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.060
 tell me who does not like a character 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.920
 with an eye patch and for those who 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.960
 you already saw this series I know there are more 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.490
 characters but I feel that these two 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.380
 They were the ones who contributed most to the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.690
 story the other characters are 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.610
 quite disposable and when they see the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.810
 series will understand why I tell them this 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.549
 The story is based around 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.490
 and who has just moved to a new 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.740
 secondary in specific class 3 of 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.810
 grade 9 when he gets there he starts to 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.640
 feel a very strange atmosphere in that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.590
 lounge what caught his attention is that 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.360
 apparently everyone ignored a girl 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.369
 called misaki who always gets the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.770
 I went alone and had a patch on my eye 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.259
 everyone in this room ignored her as if 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.390
 was not alive as if it were just a 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.909
 ghost what kubica did not know is that 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.039
 26 years ago in that same room there was 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.200
 a girl named misaki she was a 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.970
 exemplary student was good both in 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.069
 school like in sports too 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.930
 it was quite popular with the students at 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.209
 just as with the teachers one day of 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.500
 Suddenly Misaki died his companions and 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.720
 teachers after the news 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.910
 they decided to live together as if she still 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.190
 I was alive until they reserved a 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.440
 chair at graduation what they do not 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.510
 they knew is that they had just started what 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.549
 it would be known as the curse of the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.290
 class 3 this story is pretty 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.880
 good and personally I liked it 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.190
 very much has a story that you 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.230
 catch chapter after chapter believe me not 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.299
 I could stop watching this anime every 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.280
 chapter ends leaving you wanting to 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.690
 more although this series is pretty good 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.230
 it does not mean that you do not have your 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.730
 problems 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.709
 for example they leave enough holes 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.569
 throughout the story and really not 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.459
 they explain them very well but this series 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.620
 have more positive things than negative 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.110
 the animation is where it really is 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.909
 shining series the animation is excellent and 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.290
 the truth I can not find any reason 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.000
 why you may not like it 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.069
 especially the scenes that go from the 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.379
 chapter 3 onwards the music is 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.120
 pretty good especially the music of 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.620
 opening this opening made me 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.750
 prepare for what was to follow 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.579
 chapter after chapter in truth never 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.650
 I got bored of this opening and I could not 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.360
 stop listening to it good I to this 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.190
 anime I give a nine of ten has 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.140
 quite horror and mystery as to 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.209
 keep interested all 12 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.190
 chapters although sometimes this makes it a 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.379
 little hard to follow but the truth 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.209
 this does not take away much experience 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.280
 although I must warn you that this 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.379
 anime contains quite a few strong scenes 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.450
 they are fan- like scenes of this nation 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.549
 so if you're sensitive to this kind of 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.049
 material I recommend you not see it good 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.549
 I hope you liked this review and 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.549
 See you next week
