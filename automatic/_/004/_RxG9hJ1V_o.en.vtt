was<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.970> took<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.329> piece<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.840> card<00:01:34.290> stock

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
was I just took a piece of card stock

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.600 
was I just took a piece of card stock
and<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.950> made<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.400> scale<00:01:37.009> from<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.340> scale

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and I made one scale from that one scale

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.719 
and I made one scale from that one scale
I<00:01:38.759> took<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.450> foam<00:01:39.750> sheet<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.950> traced<00:01:41.310> every

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
I took one foam sheet and I traced every

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.389 
I took one foam sheet and I traced every
single<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.689> pen<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.350> pencil<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.369> i

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
single one with a pen or a pencil but i

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.539 
single one with a pen or a pencil but i
found<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.909> pen<00:01:45.210> works<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.049> lot<00:01:46.170> smoother<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
found a pen works a lot smoother on the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.999 
found a pen works a lot smoother on the
phone<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.409> just<00:01:49.409> hope<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.680> don't<00:01:49.740> mess<00:01:49.979> up

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
phone and just hope you don't mess up

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.179 
phone and just hope you don't mess up
and<00:01:51.649> at<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> end<00:01:52.829> result<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:55.740> comes<00:01:56.009> out

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
and at the end result it comes out

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.859 
and at the end result it comes out
something<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.909> this

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.359 

now<00:02:02.869> this<00:02:03.110> obviously<00:02:03.710> won't<00:02:03.920> get<00:02:04.130> spray

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
now this obviously won't get spray

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.559 
now this obviously won't get spray
foamed<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:06.220> what<00:02:07.220> I'll<00:02:07.340> probably<00:02:07.369> do<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.270> get

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
foamed and what I'll probably do is get

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.809 
foamed and what I'll probably do is get
some<00:02:08.720> acrylic<00:02:09.140> paint<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.560> paint<00:02:10.490> over<00:02:10.789> it

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
some acrylic paint and paint over it

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.500 
some acrylic paint and paint over it
with<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.300> foam<00:02:11.569> brush<00:02:15.640> other<00:02:16.640> things<00:02:16.970> completed

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
with a foam brush other things completed

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:27.160 
with a foam brush other things completed
our<00:02:17.750> knee<00:02:18.470> pads<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.940> part<00:02:26.420> under<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
our knee pads the part under the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:38.880 
our knee pads the part under the
shoulder<00:02:27.770> pad

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.630 

and<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:42.140> emblem<00:02:42.530> which<00:02:42.769> I<00:02:43.040> do<00:02:43.129> not<00:02:43.370> know<00:02:43.519> what

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
and this emblem which I do not know what

and this emblem which I do not know what
to<00:02:43.790> call<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:47.090> that's<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.690> for<00:02:47.720> part<00:02:47.930> one<00:02:48.379> of<00:02:48.410> the
