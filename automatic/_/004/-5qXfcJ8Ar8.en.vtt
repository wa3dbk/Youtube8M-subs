doesn't matter so moving forward I'm
just<00:00:59.719> going<00:00:59.839> to<00:00:59.870> keep<00:00:59.989> that<00:01:00.109> aside<00:01:00.699> let's<00:01:01.699> see

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
just going to keep that aside let's see

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.430 
just going to keep that aside let's see
what<00:01:01.969> we<00:01:02.089> have<00:01:02.120> inside<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:02.660> box<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.109> we<00:01:03.140> have

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
what we have inside the box so we have

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.410 
what we have inside the box so we have
the<00:01:03.710> Quick<00:01:03.890> Start<00:01:04.070> Guide<00:01:04.190> obviously<00:01:04.909> it's<00:01:05.180> got

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
the Quick Start Guide obviously it's got

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.760 
the Quick Start Guide obviously it's got
the<00:01:05.510> same<00:01:05.710> paper<00:01:06.710> feel<00:01:07.490> that<00:01:07.790> we<00:01:08.060> saw<00:01:08.270> with<00:01:08.450> the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
the same paper feel that we saw with the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.740 
the same paper feel that we saw with the
s4<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:10.940> know<00:01:11.240> nothing<00:01:11.630> new<00:01:11.750> there<00:01:13.750> let's

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
s4 so you know nothing new there let's

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.890 
s4 so you know nothing new there let's
go<00:01:15.190> see<00:01:16.190> what<00:01:16.370> what<00:01:16.550> else<00:01:16.670> it's<00:01:16.850> Scott<00:01:17.090> so

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
go see what what else it's Scott so

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.270 
go see what what else it's Scott so
you've<00:01:18.050> got<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.230> slightly<00:01:18.530> different<00:01:18.860> USB

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
you've got a slightly different USB

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.590 
you've got a slightly different USB
cable<00:01:19.700> this<00:01:19.850> time<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.810> think<00:01:21.200> it's<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.440> USB<00:01:21.830> 3.0

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
cable this time I think it's a USB 3.0

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.510 
cable this time I think it's a USB 3.0
data<00:01:23.600> syncing<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.260> charging<00:01:26.260> cable<00:01:27.400> it's<00:01:28.400> got

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
data syncing and charging cable it's got

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.700 
data syncing and charging cable it's got
a<00:01:28.550> USB<00:01:28.730> be<00:01:29.060> tight<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.990> blue<00:01:30.170> indicates

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
a USB be tight and the blue indicates

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.130 
a USB be tight and the blue indicates
USB<00:01:31.070> 3.0<00:01:31.520> which<00:01:32.180> basically<00:01:32.570> means<00:01:32.840> you'll<00:01:33.080> be

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
USB 3.0 which basically means you'll be

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.560 
USB 3.0 which basically means you'll be
able<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.470> transfer<00:01:33.860> files<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.370> lot<00:01:34.730> faster<00:01:35.060> than

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
able to transfer files a lot faster than

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.200 
able to transfer files a lot faster than
the<00:01:35.720> usual<00:01:36.230> traditional<00:01:37.220> USB<00:01:37.610> 2.0<00:01:38.530> cable<00:01:39.530> and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
the usual traditional USB 2.0 cable and

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.030 
the usual traditional USB 2.0 cable and
it<00:01:41.210> also<00:01:41.360> means<00:01:41.630> faster<00:01:41.990> charging<00:01:42.170> anyway

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
it also means faster charging anyway

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.440 
it also means faster charging anyway
let's<00:01:43.220> keep<00:01:43.370> that<00:01:43.460> aside<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.000> see<00:01:44.150> what<00:01:44.360> else

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
let's keep that aside and see what else

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.880 
let's keep that aside and see what else
