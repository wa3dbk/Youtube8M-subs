00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.450
 It was cool, the beauty that was AndrÃ©. 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.610
 saints not for you here another video 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.490
 of rap davis in some screenshots 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.590
 on roller repair and with the other was 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.719
 win and spend time to be able to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.250
 connect a little more information and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.539
 when you have a slightly cooler video 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.880
 it's full 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.600
 I think there were not many at the end of the day. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.519
 she 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.260
 the namco bandai for those who do not know the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.840
 creator of pacman and some 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.710
 famous frank lion ball z as touch 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.660
 of cash and 3 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.300
 the company will market the game in the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.579
 Europe and Australia and it's good, because 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.860
 if she is doing this trade there 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.360
 If it works out, it will not come to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.070
 here are americas too 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.870
 so it can be something that is really cool 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.760
 then let's hope there she come here 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.710
 and that it's too cool to know that this 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.739
 game has quite a support company then 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.360
 fell there is growing more and more and I 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.289
 I hope this game is a very fun game. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.989
 good 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.210
 I hope the documentary 52 loads on 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.940
 even because, for those who do not know the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.180
 club sayers that was that guy who did 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.909
 the various simulation games for the team at last 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.250
 He abandoned the project. He leaves the roller. 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.990
 coaster 3 was released because when the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.720
 a released concentration it was 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.270
 released with the taag had already bought the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 he divided his games and even had 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 promised some things to him and not 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.409
 had given nothing entered justice against 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.479
 attack and he ended up losing and he 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.630
 make a game he does not play anymore 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.729
 games and he is out of the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.070
 production of this roller coaster gives me a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.110
 little fear because the creator of the series 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.780
 original is not participating this time 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.420
 Let's also be a new day care center for 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.759
 game does not even remember the one of that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 restaurant I told in the last video 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.009
 well as it was implemented in the game and 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.740
 Look, it's very beautiful, very well. 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.869
 but I admit that this was a 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.009
 shock I'm afraid something is 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.049
 stop on the floor 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.689
 so I was expecting a show one 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.960
 little more well-done smart-ass well with 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.270
 grams that they exclusive appearing 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.369
 You know a gram but what it is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.429
 appearing there that he just pick up and paint 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.979
 a floor knows how to catch even paint a 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.150
 I'm afraid of this because I 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.830
 I was expecting something much more. 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.230
 worked 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.750
 not yet developed by the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.330
 that it seems they are using India and 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.550
 of roller coaster 3 is very similar 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.960
 in many ways the magician that he does not 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.300
 stay that way because I was 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.130
 Expecting something much better, but I also 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.260
 I do not have what to complain about in the chart. 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.060
 graphic is very good and I hope 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.820
 I also do not know if I will or will not be 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.040
 3 because it sure rolled it simulated the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.710
 following the shadow and the ancient shadow 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.800
 between quotation marks and getting clearer and 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.760
 coming up a new shadow was this way 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.160
 same 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.830
 so hopefully in this game he has a 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.440
 Cycle anyway anyway people, like I said 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.000
 There were not many tickets but I'm just 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.200
 bringing this video here for 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.840
 tell you that I'm from 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.440
 new microphone take shame in the face and 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.420
 I bought a lx 3,000 and I did not 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.000
 I do not regret anything to anyone 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.870
 buy I will not do merchan also 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.580
 but there is an ikea store at 106 as well 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.500
 Then whoever has money and 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.350
 I want a late christmas present 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.470
 You can ask for this, I wanted to thank you too. 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.600
 very much for the thousand inscribed people 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.430
 Thank you, really sorry I did not do it. 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.410
 No special video yet 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.450
 prepare a special video and may make 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.540

 You too, a happy 2015, a happy year. 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.670
 this year was not so cool, that was 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.320
 type a chart of a company that 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.730
 It's not cool, I'm connected, he's got it. 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.720
 okay so here is a fucking one 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.280
 roller coaster 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.160
