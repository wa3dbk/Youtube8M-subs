wall kind of yeah it's like four sticks
put<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.880> roughly<00:00:12.000> outlines<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:13.670> garage<00:00:14.670> doors

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
put it roughly outlines the garage doors

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.910 
put it roughly outlines the garage doors
and<00:00:15.150> then<00:00:16.340> what<00:00:17.990> so<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.230> put<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:21.800> Ione<00:00:22.800> Lee

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and then what so I put that in Ione Lee

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.920 
and then what so I put that in Ione Lee
put<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.250> King<00:00:23.460> studs<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.029> left<00:00:24.689> out<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
put in the King studs I left out the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.240 
put in the King studs I left out the
jack<00:00:25.289> studs<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.269> the<00:00:27.269> headers<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
jack studs and the headers and the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.669 
jack studs and the headers and the
reason<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.550> did<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.470> do

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
reason I did that is so that I can do

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.560 
reason I did that is so that I can do
them<00:00:31.800> later<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.880> because<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.450> put

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
them later not because I like to put

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.700 
them later not because I like to put
stuff<00:00:33.750> off<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:36.110> quite<00:00:37.110> sure<00:00:37.440> what

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
stuff off but because quite sure what

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
stuff off but because quite sure what
doors<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> use<00:00:38.550> or<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.090> size<00:00:39.329> they're

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
doors I want to use or what size they're

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.380 
doors I want to use or what size they're
going<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> be<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.489> don't<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.059> want

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
going to be and and I don't really want

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.660 
going to be and and I don't really want
to<00:00:42.510> take<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> time<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.770> research<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.550> right

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to take the time to research it right

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.959 
to take the time to research it right
now

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969

and to find it enter and I didn't

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.569 
and to find it enter and I didn't
actually<00:00:48.289> include<00:00:49.289> those<00:00:49.920> garage<00:00:50.309> door

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so I will be narrating in a slightly

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.350 
so I will be narrating in a slightly

doors resume I needed to do this so that

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.219 
doors resume I needed to do this so that
I<00:01:14.340> could<00:01:14.610> support<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:16.140> rim<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.790> floor

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
I could support the rim for the floor

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.929 
I could support the rim for the floor

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
through the walls in fact here I'm

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.670 
through the walls in fact here I'm
adding<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.880> double<00:01:45.329> top<00:01:45.720> plate<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
adding a double top plate I know I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.030 
adding a double top plate I know I
originally<00:01:47.520> said<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.060> wouldn't<00:01:48.710> build<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
originally said that I wouldn't build a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.460 
originally said that I wouldn't build a
double<00:01:50.670> top<00:01:50.939> plate<00:01:51.000> because<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.049> could<00:01:52.229> save

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
double top plate because I could save

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.310 
double top plate because I could save
lumber<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> end<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.270> realized<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:55.049> in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
lumber but in the end I realized that in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.090 
lumber but in the end I realized that in
fact<00:01:55.860> having<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> double<00:01:57.000> top<00:01:57.180> plate<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.659> only

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
fact having a double top plate is only

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.859 
fact having a double top plate is only
ten<00:01:59.100> board<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.149> that's<00:02:00.299> really<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.689> that

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
ten board and that's really not that

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.670 
ten board and that's really not that
much<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:02.009> also<00:02:02.159> adds<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.579> lot<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.820> strength

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
much and it also adds a lot of strength

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.649 
much and it also adds a lot of strength
especially<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.890> walls<00:02:05.280> where<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> built

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
especially in walls where I built

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.900 
especially in walls where I built
windows<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:07.469> two<00:02:07.740> by<00:02:07.920> eight<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.610> are<00:02:08.670> 80

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
windows with two by eight that are 80

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.330 
windows with two by eight that are 80
inches<00:02:09.209> long<00:02:09.420> which<00:02:10.289> i<00:02:10.470> think<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.860> grossly

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
inches long which i think is grossly

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.520 
inches long which i think is grossly
inadequate<00:02:11.760> now<00:02:12.540> thinking<00:02:13.110> about

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
inadequate now thinking about

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.910 
inadequate now thinking about
after<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.770> fact<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.050> believe<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.650> double

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
after the fact so I believe the double

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.250 
after the fact so I believe the double
top<00:02:17.010> plate<00:02:17.280> will<00:02:17.459> add<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.780> little<00:02:18.810> bit<00:02:19.080> of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
top plate will add just a little bit of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.290 
top plate will add just a little bit of
