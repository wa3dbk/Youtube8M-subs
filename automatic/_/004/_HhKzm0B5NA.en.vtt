00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 all right 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.469
 welcome today we will draw a figure 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.820
 child in view of three quarters before 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.160
 we have seen many figures seen in 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.780
 three quarters can use any of 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.880
 them to better understand the figure that 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.770
 we will do today to draw the figure 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.500
 childish we must remember two principles 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.779
 basic these are to draw the head 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.360
 big and the second principle draw 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.550
 the shorter legs the more 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.090
 clear are these principles shorter 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.219
 it will be the age of the character that we draw 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.740
 observe this we draw a head 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.600
 looking for child features 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.790
 size of the head we multiply it by 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.000
 5 this means that the height of 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.440
 this girl will be her head x 5 and that 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.690
 in turn it means that you have the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.329
 very large head as an adult measures the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.190
 height of his head multiplied by 6 7 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.810
 and up to 8 times 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.320
 on the other side you can see that the 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.730
 legs will tell me size 4 and 5 this 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.880
 it means that the legs are more 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.860
 short than body size 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.870
 defined if these measures begin to 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.730
 draw and you can see that the pure 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.100
 made of drawing the big head and the 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.620
 legs shorter than usual so that 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.450
 our drawing looks childish if a 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.420
 character has a very large head 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.100
 you will see more childlike as in this case in 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.840
 where the head is more than the rest 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.119
 of the body 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.000
 well now let's draw a girl with more 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.250
 patience and with a little older and 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.289
 we look for a proportion line the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.600
 division below is shorter than that of 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.310
 up for a bit this so that the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.869
 bottom division that is the legs 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.060
 look shorter than the rest of the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.040
 body 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.649
 the top part is divided into three 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.299
 so that the head looks great and the 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.250
 part of the bottom we divide it into two 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.159
 parts to correctly locate the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.500
 knees with this line we define the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.350
 proportions in the first division 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.080
 we draw the shape of the head which 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.840
 we will explain later under the tip 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.759
 of the chin we draw the neck part 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.460
 of the body will be thrown forward 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.170
 as indicated by the arrow while the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.200
 area of the pelvis will be thrown back 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.729
 as indicated by this other date this side 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.640
 of the body follows the direction of the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.650
 arrow in the body as you can see 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.140
 on the other side of the body is also 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.790
 follow this direction but in the part of 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.910
 the pelvis is following the direction of the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.160
 pelvic arrow 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.410
 we trace the trapeze slightly 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.040
 inclined and likewise the clavicles under 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.989
 the neck slightly inclined 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.730
 remember that this half of the body is 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.730
 more bulky than the other half 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.120
 right in the middle of the pelvis like what 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.880
 mark the date we draw a straight line 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.630
 at the point of the knee we draw a 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.880
 inclined line 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.070
 we trace the leg by becoming thin 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.660
 towards the knee heading towards this 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.760
 inclined line 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.040
 from this point the leg is made 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.040
 a little wider and then again 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.350
 thin as it goes to the ankle 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.330
 on the other side we do the same thing a line 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.460
 that part of the arrow from the center of the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.520
 pelvis this line is very slightly 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.920
 curve we draw the inclined line in the 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.660
 knee and we draw the other side of the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.990
 leg in the same way as before 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.600
 we did 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.940
 we draw the feet this one that has a 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.590
 direction opposite to that of the leg and 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.440
 this one that follows the shape of the leg 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.850
 as indicated by the small arrows 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.370
 dolls reach the height where 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.410
 begin the legs and draw the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.020
 slightly curved arms from 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.570
 the ends of the body in this way 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.890
 the general form is already defined 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.080
 notice the shape of a child figure 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.640
 we remark the shape of the shoulders and 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.670
 we draw the chest that could be 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.220
 indistinct for a boy or a girl 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.530
 we draw the form of an inverted u and 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.780
 then a letter to complete the 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.209
 form of the ellipse that is the area 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.950
 abdominal these two small lines are 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.920
 the iliac crests of which we have 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.500
 spoken on several occasions we draw 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.120
 other details a few lines for 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.239
 give a more defined form to 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.100
 arms and we emphasize the legs in the 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.560
 part of the knee we draw a small 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.180
 curved line so that it is better understood and 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.040
 this inner line of the pimples the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.160
 we draw with a curved line so that 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.080
 have a more real shape 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.080
 let's explain the face aside 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.540
 We draw a circle as a basis for 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.390
 head this green line points the point 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.060
 of the chin is like a third of the 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.640
 diameter of the circle we draw a line 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.130
 next to the circle until this point is 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.410
 will break the line of the other's face 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.170
 side we draw a curved line to the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.760
 point of the chin from the point that 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.820
 before we marked we took a line 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.080
 inclined that will go to the chin 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.750
 look at the curvature of the circle that 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.460
 is rotating with this dotted line at 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.310
 draw a central line for the face 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.110
 this touches the point of the chin so that 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.350
 look like a child face the head 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.610
 It should look great and the face small 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.490
 we look for more or less half the size 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.460
 total of the head at this point will be 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.900
 the eyebrow slightly down we mark two 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.990
 lines that will be the limits for 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.820
 draw both eyes 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.860
 more or less in the height of the part 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.200
 down the circle we mark a line to 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.840
 the limit of the nose 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.060
 now we can draw the face we draw 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.790
 the shape of the eyes respecting the line 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.800
 vertical central of the face we draw 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.480
 both eyebrows remember that before we have 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.980
 seen with more patience the way 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.200
 draw the face in view of three 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.710
 rooms as it appears on the screen and on the 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.450
 description 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.400
 we trace the nose to the height that 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.250
 we had marked and the mouth slightly 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.800
 down the nose we draw some 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.100
 final details like the ear collar 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.080
 cup ' and the eyelids and hair this is what 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.590
 principal you need to know about the 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.590
 child face 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.120
 and we return to the drawing of the figure 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.910
 complete we add some lines for the 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.600
 clothes and shoes are very few lines 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.520
 that we add we started to color what 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.590
 We do it quite carelessly 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.750
 just looking for the colors to combine 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.280
 our taste as to the dresses that 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.740
 we look for the colors that we carry 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.660
 more or less agree 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.520
 little by little we began to carve and 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.169
 correct small aspects so that it 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.909
 see our drawing as best as possible 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.639
 since the sketch is of our degree 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:24.610
 we clean it apart and we detail a lot 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.680
 the color that work can take from a 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.300
 up to four hours depending on the 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.910
 the colorist's skill and the detail that 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.740
 want to give 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.240
 we wait as always for this class 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.280
 help complete your understanding of 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.930
 drawing of the figure do not stop 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.120
 share this class to those who like it 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.940
 the drawing looks like if you liked it and 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.450
 subscribe then of great help until 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.450
 the next
