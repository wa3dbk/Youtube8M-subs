you're going to put on the track alright

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.200 
you're going to put on the track alright
and<00:00:52.860> let's<00:00:52.980> say<00:00:53.130> that<00:00:53.310> I<00:00:53.370> maybe<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.880> is<00:00:54.030> some

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and let's say that I maybe this is some

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.520 
and let's say that I maybe this is some
this<00:00:54.630> of<00:00:54.780> course<00:00:54.810> is<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.320> positioned

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this of course is going to be positioned

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.960 
this of course is going to be positioned
some<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.220> layout<00:00:56.400> where<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> can't<00:00:56.790> really

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
some on the layout where I can't really

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.790 
some on the layout where I can't really
move<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.270> around<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:58.140> let's<00:00:58.320> say<00:00:58.470> I<00:00:58.500> want<00:00:58.740> to

move it around but let's say I want to
do<00:00:58.920> something<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.400> walk<00:00:59.610> around<00:00:59.940> what

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
do something with walk around what

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.510 
do something with walk around what
opportunities<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:02.010> actually<00:01:02.220> does

opportunities do I have it actually does
have<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.360> optical<00:01:03.690> walk<00:01:03.930> around<00:01:04.199> available

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
have an optical walk around available

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
have an optical walk around available
with<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> optional<00:01:05.700> walk<00:01:05.909> around<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
with the optional walk around it

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.700 
with the optional walk around it
actually<00:01:06.659> gives<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.929> the<00:01:07.020> ability<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.380> run<00:01:07.590> up

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
actually gives you the ability to run up

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.639 
alright now let's say I need a little
bit<00:01:11.640> more<00:01:11.789> power<00:01:12.090> well<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:13.020> also<00:01:13.170> just

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
bit more power well we also just

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.249 
bit more power well we also just
recently<00:01:13.979> came<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> 6<00:01:14.700> amp<00:01:14.909> unit

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
recently came out with the 6 amp unit

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.190 
recently came out with the 6 amp unit
those<00:01:16.259> colors<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> 6<00:01:16.950> amp<00:01:17.159> power<00:01:17.759> supply

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
those colors the 6 amp power supply

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.779 
those colors the 6 amp power supply
comes<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.380> those<00:01:19.499> walk<00:01:20.100> around<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.429> standard

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
comes with those walk around a standard

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.319 
comes with those walk around a standard
so<00:01:21.710> then<00:01:22.710> again<00:01:22.920> same<00:01:23.340> features<00:01:23.789> run<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.240> the

so then again same features run to the

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.840 
so then again same features run to the
DC<00:01:24.929> or<00:01:25.139> DC<00:01:25.530> c<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:25.920> c<00:01:26.009> @<00:01:26.100> equipped<00:01:26.369> locomotives
