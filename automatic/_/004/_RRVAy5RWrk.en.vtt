I<00:00:06.380> think<00:00:07.380> a<00:00:07.470> difficult

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:08.830 
I think a difficult

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.470 
I think a difficult
our<00:00:08.890> cities<00:00:09.190> face<00:00:09.460> today<00:00:09.700> that<00:00:10.059> they<00:00:10.180> didn't

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
our cities face today that they didn't

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.010 
our cities face today that they didn't
so<00:00:11.410> much<00:00:11.440> 40<00:00:12.100> years<00:00:12.309> ago<00:00:12.550> is<00:00:12.760> that<00:00:13.330> they're

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.020 
so much 40 years ago is that they're

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.010 
so much 40 years ago is that they're
trying<00:00:14.799> to<00:00:14.860> do<00:00:15.070> very<00:00:15.430> many<00:00:15.639> things<00:00:16.059> most<00:00:16.900> of

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
trying to do very many things most of

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.560 
trying to do very many things most of
which<00:00:17.080> are<00:00:17.380> good<00:00:17.890> social<00:00:18.340> contributions<00:00:19.060> but

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
which are good social contributions but

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.790 
which are good social contributions but
they<00:00:19.689> defuse<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.230> energy<00:00:20.560> of<00:00:20.680> the

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
they defuse the energy of the

they defuse the energy of the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
on undergraduate education is lost so

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.009

of the time so I've seen this expansion
of<00:00:50.140> roles<00:00:50.409> really<00:00:51.339> detract<00:00:51.850> from<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.780> quality

interacting with experts in their fields
and<00:00:59.350> I<00:00:59.890> don't<00:01:00.159> think<00:01:00.549> that<00:01:00.820> technology<00:01:01.600> can

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
and I don't think that technology can

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.649 
and I don't think that technology can
replace<00:01:02.680> that<00:01:03.280> human<00:01:04.000> interaction<00:01:04.570> that

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
replace that human interaction that

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.600 
replace that human interaction that
takes<00:01:04.720> place<00:01:05.049> around<00:01:05.290> a<00:01:05.560> small<00:01:05.799> table<00:01:06.040> with<00:01:06.580> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.370 

well<00:01:12.970> I<00:01:13.000> wouldn't<00:01:13.570> want<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.780> presume<00:01:14.080> to

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
well I wouldn't want to presume to

specify how Dartmouth spend its next 250

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.649 
specify how Dartmouth spend its next 250
years<00:01:17.439> but<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.549> believe<00:01:18.909> this<00:01:19.150> strategic

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
years but I believe this strategic

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.350 
years but I believe this strategic
planning<00:01:19.960> process<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.790> needs<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.210> look

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
planning process really needs to look

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.660

you<00:01:25.600> are<00:01:26.009> modest<00:01:27.009> size<00:01:27.340> research<00:01:27.909> university

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
you are modest size research university

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.510 
you are modest size research university

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
but you're primarily dartmouth college

but you're primarily dartmouth college
and<00:01:30.759> I<00:01:31.750> think<00:01:32.080> there<00:01:32.380> are<00:01:32.409> people<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.070> I<00:01:33.130> know

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
and I think there are people and I know

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.060 
and I think there are people and I know
some<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.640> them<00:01:33.820> on<00:01:34.000> your<00:01:34.030> faculty<00:01:34.630> who<00:01:35.380> managed

some of them on your faculty who managed

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.300 
some of them on your faculty who managed

to balance beautifully the deep

and scholarly research keeping that

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.559 
and scholarly research keeping that
balance<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:44.920> critical<00:01:45.159> if<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:46.090> push<00:01:46.330> too<00:01:46.539> far

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
balance is critical if you push too far

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.389 
balance is critical if you push too far
in<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.110> direction<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.590> research<00:01:47.979> you're

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
in the direction of research you're

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.210 
in the direction of research you're

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
going to lose what's unique here and so

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.550 
going to lose what's unique here and so
I<00:01:51.250> would<00:01:51.610> like<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:51.880> see<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.060> real<00:01:52.270> focus<00:01:52.780> on<00:01:53.020> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
as an integrated whole I think it's very

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.460 
as an integrated whole I think it's very
important<00:02:29.580> first<00:02:30.480> for<00:02:30.750> scholars<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.110> remain

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
important first for scholars to remain

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.800 
important first for scholars to remain
intellectually<00:02:32.069> alive<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.640> secondly<00:02:33.480> for

intellectually alive and secondly for

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.660 
intellectually alive and secondly for
them<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.080> give<00:02:34.319> their<00:02:34.800> undergraduates<00:02:35.310> a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
them to give their undergraduates a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.390 
them to give their undergraduates a
window<00:02:36.030> into<00:02:36.330> what<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.690> means<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.350> work<00:02:38.069> hard

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
window into what it means to work hard

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.309 
window into what it means to work hard
on<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.550> problem<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.540> which<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.840> don't<00:02:39.959> know<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
on a problem to which you don't know the

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.559 
on a problem to which you don't know the
answer<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.489> think<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:42.000> critical<00:02:42.540> that

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
answer so I think it's critical that

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.500 
answer so I think it's critical that
faculty<00:02:42.959> remain<00:02:43.560> involved<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.340> research<00:02:44.700> but

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
faculty remain involved in research but

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.820 
faculty remain involved in research but
it<00:02:45.600> should<00:02:45.720> be<00:02:45.750> involved<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.260> research<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.769> a

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
it should be involved in research in a

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.860 
it should be involved in research in a
way<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.430> draw<00:02:47.670> undergraduates<00:02:48.180> into<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
way that can draw undergraduates into it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.390 
way that can draw undergraduates into it
rather<00:02:49.350> than<00:02:49.500> push<00:02:49.860> them<00:02:50.040> away<00:02:50.100> because

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
rather than push them away because

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.000 
rather than push them away because
they're<00:02:50.670> too<00:02:50.819> busy
