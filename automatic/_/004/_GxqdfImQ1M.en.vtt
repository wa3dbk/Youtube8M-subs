turn signal I'm checking the ground side
what<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.309> test<00:00:41.550> light<00:00:41.610> hook<00:00:41.850> up

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
what I do is have my test light hook up

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.369 
what I do is have my test light hook up
to<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> positive<00:00:42.329> part<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.840> battery<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to the positive part of the battery and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.290 
to the positive part of the battery and
I'm<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.100> check<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> wires<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.210> if

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
I'm going to check the wires and see if

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.869 
I'm going to check the wires and see if
my<00:00:45.420> ground<00:00:45.690> circuit<00:00:45.960> has<00:00:46.289> its<00:00:46.500> integrity<00:00:46.879> this

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
my ground circuit has its integrity this

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.850 
my ground circuit has its integrity this
is<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> ground<00:00:48.300> circuit<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.739> you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
is the ground circuit here and as you

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.709 
is the ground circuit here and as you
can<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.250> lights<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.300> means<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
can see it lights up that means all of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.110 
can see it lights up that means all of
the<00:00:51.840> wiring<00:00:52.140> from<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:53.100> all<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> way<00:00:53.879> through

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the wiring from here all the way through

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.459 
the wiring from here all the way through
the<00:00:54.239> switching<00:00:54.600> back<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> battery<00:00:55.260> is

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the switching back to the battery is

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.020 
the switching back to the battery is
good<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> go<00:00:57.570> ahead<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.050> switch<00:00:58.500> my

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
good I'm going to go ahead and switch my

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.520 
good I'm going to go ahead and switch my
test<00:01:00.030> light<00:01:00.239> from<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> positive<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
test light from the positive to the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.889 
test light from the positive to the
negative<00:01:01.559> side<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.539> we're<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> check

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
negative side and we're going to check

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.469 
negative side and we're going to check
the<00:01:04.110> positive<00:01:04.710> side<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.790> circuitry<00:01:06.299> so

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the positive side of the circuitry so

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.130 
the positive side of the circuitry so
where<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> power<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.260> sent<00:01:08.689> as<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:09.990> see

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
where the power is sent as you can see

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
where the power is sent as you can see
my<00:01:10.290> light<00:01:10.530> lights<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.909> does<00:01:12.150> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
my light lights up what that does is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.480 
my light lights up what that does is
indicates<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.680> same<00:01:14.130> thing<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
indicates that the same thing is the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.920 
indicates that the same thing is the
ground<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.909> from<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.360> all<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> way

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
ground that from here all the way

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.330 
ground that from here all the way
through<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> switch<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.799> back<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.250> the

flasher all the integrity is there you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.060 
flasher all the integrity is there you
can<00:01:22.740> also<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.790> known<00:01:24.479> good<00:01:24.869> ball<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.650> you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
can also use a known good ball if you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.590 
can also use a known good ball if you
