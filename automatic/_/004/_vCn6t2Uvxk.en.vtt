00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
close if you would move your camera a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.339 
close if you would move your camera a
little<00:02:08.879> bit<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.810> right

little bit to the right

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.589 
little bit to the right
and<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.979> then<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.489> directly<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.450> back

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
and you then you directly have the back

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.229 
and you then you directly have the back
in<00:02:13.109> the<00:02:13.439> frame<00:02:13.739> now<00:02:14.189> would<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.519> directly<00:02:14.969> see

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
in the frame now would you directly see

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.420 
in the frame now would you directly see
the<00:02:15.299> glowing<00:02:15.629> back<00:02:15.959> but<00:02:16.469> in<00:02:16.889> general<00:02:17.310> you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
the glowing back but in general you

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.599 
the glowing back but in general you
don't<00:02:17.459> do<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.909> you<00:02:18.030> focus<00:02:18.389> on<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.689> model<00:02:18.989> and

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
don't do that you focus on the model and

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.759 
don't do that you focus on the model and
the<00:02:20.609> speed<00:02:20.849> light<00:02:20.999> inside<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.569> back<00:02:21.870> will

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
the speed light inside the back will

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.050 
the speed light inside the back will
light<00:02:23.670> her

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
light her

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.479

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
yeah it's set to 1/16 of a power like a

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.000 
yeah it's set to 1/16 of a power like a
set<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.969> zoom<00:02:27.209> back<00:02:27.599> it<00:02:27.780> zoom<00:02:27.930> back<00:02:28.139> to<00:02:28.200> 24

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
set it zoom back it zoom back to 24

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.280 
set it zoom back it zoom back to 24
millimeters<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.269> camera<00:02:30.569> on<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:30.780> other<00:02:30.810> hand

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
millimeters the camera on the other hand

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.159 
millimeters the camera on the other hand
is<00:02:31.469> set<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.340> f<00:02:33.230> 2.8<00:02:34.230> that's<00:02:34.980> important<00:02:35.489> and

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:36.169 
is set to f 2.8 that's important and

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:40.520 
is set to f 2.8 that's important and
iso100<00:02:37.200> now<00:02:37.980> if<00:02:38.569> your<00:02:39.569> lens<00:02:39.930> doesn't<00:02:40.349> allow

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
iso100 now if your lens doesn't allow

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.970 
iso100 now if your lens doesn't allow
you<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.769> use<00:02:41.129> f<00:02:41.370> 2.8<00:02:41.909> and<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:42.299> use<00:02:42.480> f4<00:02:43.349> but

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
you to use f 2.8 and just use f4 but

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.539 
you to use f 2.8 and just use f4 but
then<00:02:44.159> that<00:02:45.060> means<00:02:45.299> your<00:02:45.840> f-stop<00:02:46.169> is<00:02:46.379> 1<00:02:47.159> f-stop

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
then that means your f-stop is 1 f-stop

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.610 
then that means your f-stop is 1 f-stop
smaller<00:02:47.849> so<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.150> lose<00:02:48.540> one<00:02:48.840> f-stop<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.260> light

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
smaller so you lose one f-stop of light

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.800 
smaller so you lose one f-stop of light
what<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:50.669> do<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.939> is<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.449> other<00:02:51.599> hand

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
what you do that is on the other hand

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.479 
what you do that is on the other hand
you<00:02:51.930> increase<00:02:52.469> the<00:02:52.650> power<00:02:52.829> of<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.219> speed

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
you increase the power of your speed

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.599 
you increase the power of your speed
light<00:02:53.699> to<00:02:53.879> 1/8<00:02:54.359> now<00:02:55.109> this<00:02:55.620> way<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.859> win<00:02:56.219> one

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
light to 1/8 now this way you win one

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.500 
light to 1/8 now this way you win one
f-stop<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.030> light

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
f-stop of light

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.780 
f-stop of light
anyway<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.290> will<00:02:58.469> have<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.799> check<00:02:59.099> just<00:02:59.609> make

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
anyway you will have to check just make

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.300 
anyway you will have to check just make
make<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> test<00:03:00.510> shot<00:03:00.689> appoint<00:03:01.169> a<00:03:01.290> check<00:03:01.620> that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
make a test shot appoint a check that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.550 
make a test shot appoint a check that
your<00:03:02.609> bed<00:03:02.909> is<00:03:03.090> completely<00:03:03.329> illuminated<00:03:04.079> you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
your bed is completely illuminated you

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.470 
your bed is completely illuminated you
have<00:03:04.650> just<00:03:04.859> shoot<00:03:05.069> your<00:03:05.250> back<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.669> see<00:03:05.849> is<00:03:06.030> it

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
have just shoot your back and see is it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.569 
have just shoot your back and see is it
really<00:03:06.719> white<00:03:07.019> glowing<00:03:07.409> if<00:03:07.680> not<00:03:08.040> then<00:03:08.489> you

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
really white glowing if not then you

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.099 
really white glowing if not then you
have<00:03:08.609> to<00:03:08.819> adjust<00:03:08.909> it<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.449> power<00:03:09.750> up<00:03:09.930> your

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
have to adjust it you power up your

power of the speed light a bit it's that
easy<00:03:28.579> the<00:03:29.579> one<00:03:29.729> thing<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.120> should<00:03:30.150> really

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
easy the one thing you should really

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.050 
easy the one thing you should really
care<00:03:30.870> before<00:03:31.259> the<00:03:31.409> shoot<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.859> that<00:03:32.699> the<00:03:32.849> back

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
care before the shoot is that the back

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.240 
care before the shoot is that the back
is<00:03:33.090> standing<00:03:33.720> very<00:03:33.989> close<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.859> model<00:03:35.159> this

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
is standing very close to the model this

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.219 
is standing very close to the model this
is<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.519> number<00:03:35.790> one<00:03:35.970> thing<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.509> you<00:03:36.870> care

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
is the number one thing that you care

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.920 
is the number one thing that you care
before<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:38.129> start<00:03:38.430> during<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.269> shoot<00:03:39.629> that's

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
before you start during the shoot that's

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.990 
before you start during the shoot that's
also<00:03:40.290> one<00:03:40.590> thing<00:03:40.889> you<00:03:41.099> really<00:03:41.400> care<00:03:41.669> about<00:03:41.699> and

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
also one thing you really care about and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.179 
also one thing you really care about and
that<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.479> your<00:03:42.750> histogram<00:03:43.259> now<00:03:43.709> set<00:03:43.979> up<00:03:44.099> your

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
that is your histogram now set up your

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.679 
that is your histogram now set up your
camera<00:03:44.430> so<00:03:44.729> that<00:03:44.759> you<00:03:44.909> see<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.329> histogram

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
camera so that you see you a histogram

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.259 
camera so that you see you a histogram
what<00:03:46.349> you<00:03:46.439> then<00:03:46.650> want<00:03:46.859> to<00:03:47.009> do<00:03:47.189> is<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.939> want<00:03:48.180> to

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
what you then want to do is you want to

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.990 
what you then want to do is you want to
check<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.599> at<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.319> very<00:03:49.590> right<00:03:50.250> edge<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:50.609> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
check that at the very right edge of the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.689 
check that at the very right edge of the
histogram<00:03:51.449> where<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.169> highlights<00:03:52.739> are<00:03:52.889> that

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
histogram where the highlights are that

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.969 
histogram where the highlights are that
there<00:03:53.939> are<00:03:54.120> pretty<00:03:54.359> much<00:03:54.449> no<00:03:54.629> values<00:03:55.439> so<00:03:55.859> that

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
there are pretty much no values so that

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.039 
there are pretty much no values so that
you<00:03:56.099> don't<00:03:56.400> have<00:03:56.609> any<00:03:56.879> blown<00:03:57.389> out<00:03:57.659> highlights

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
you don't have any blown out highlights

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.649 
you don't have any blown out highlights
now<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:58.859> want<00:03:59.159> to<00:03:59.250> specifically<00:04:00.120> check<00:04:00.509> in

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
now you want to specifically check in

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.229 
now you want to specifically check in
this<00:04:00.780> lighting<00:04:01.049> setup<00:04:01.169> for<00:04:02.129> blown<00:04:03.000> out

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
this lighting setup for blown out

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.939 
this lighting setup for blown out
highlights<00:04:03.449> where<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.139> light<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.469> just<00:04:04.500> too

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
highlights where the light is just too

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.709 
highlights where the light is just too
bright<00:04:05.159> you<00:04:05.310> don't<00:04:05.489> want<00:04:05.669> to<00:04:05.729> have<00:04:05.819> that<00:04:05.969> some

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:06.719 
bright you don't want to have that some

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.599 
bright you don't want to have that some
parts<00:04:06.989> can<00:04:07.139> sink<00:04:07.409> into<00:04:07.560> black<00:04:07.859> that<00:04:08.129> is<00:04:08.340> fine

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
parts can sink into black that is fine

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.229 
parts can sink into black that is fine
but<00:04:08.879> nothing<00:04:09.569> should<00:04:10.109> be<00:04:10.259> so<00:04:10.530> glowing<00:04:10.799> that<00:04:11.430> it

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
but nothing should be so glowing that it

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.949 
but nothing should be so glowing that it
makes<00:04:12.989> values<00:04:13.349> over<00:04:13.590> here<00:04:13.769> in<00:04:14.219> the<00:04:14.639> very<00:04:15.629> right

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
makes values over here in the very right

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.379 
makes values over here in the very right
edge<00:04:16.199> of<00:04:16.229> your<00:04:16.590> histogram<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.549> in<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.239> end

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
edge of your histogram and in the end

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.390 
edge of your histogram and in the end
it's<00:04:18.779> so<00:04:18.989> bright<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.289> your<00:04:19.859> image<00:04:20.159> is<00:04:20.370> just

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
it's so bright that your image is just

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.050 
it's so bright that your image is just
yeah<00:04:21.090> not<00:04:21.599> usable<00:04:22.049> or<00:04:22.260> technically<00:04:22.650> really

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
yeah not usable or technically really

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.590 
yeah not usable or technically really
not<00:04:24.300> correctly<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.860> keep<00:04:26.340> an<00:04:26.460> eye<00:04:26.580> on<00:04:26.610> on<00:04:27.120> this

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
not correctly so keep an eye on on this

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.430 
not correctly so keep an eye on on this
point<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.590> then<00:04:29.220> just<00:04:29.600> try<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.660> out<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:31.260> can

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
point and then just try it out you can

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.710 
point and then just try it out you can
you<00:04:31.800> can<00:04:31.980> first<00:04:32.190> practice<00:04:32.790> it<00:04:32.970> just<00:04:33.180> place<00:04:33.570> an

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
you can first practice it just place an

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.240 
you can first practice it just place an
object<00:04:34.169> in<00:04:34.320> front<00:04:34.500> of<00:04:34.650> your<00:04:34.800> back<00:04:34.950> yeah<00:04:35.160> you

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
object in front of your back yeah you

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.220 
object in front of your back yeah you
don't<00:04:35.370> need<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.610> model<00:04:35.970> just<00:04:36.389> place<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.870> still

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
don't need a model just place a still

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.650 
don't need a model just place a still
object<00:04:37.410> there<00:04:37.950> like<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.400> vase<00:04:38.700> or<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.150> pair<00:04:39.630> of

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
object there like a vase or a pair of

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.210 
object there like a vase or a pair of
shoes<00:04:39.750> or<00:04:40.200> whatever<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:40.680> want<00:04:40.889> to<00:04:40.950> shoot

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
practice a bit and then make it with

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.190 
practice a bit and then make it with
