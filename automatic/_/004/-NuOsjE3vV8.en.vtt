00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.910
 here is the third new generation 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.350
 from nissan x trail 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.970
 she comes the next time to succeed the 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.280
 previous generation of the fighter x 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.360
 trail of course but also qashqai +2 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.770
 since she can ship this 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.900
 optional person contrary to the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.640
 new qashqai the new x trail 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.900
 is moving away in world design and four 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.850
 boxes to get closer to that of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.760
 suv but it remains available in two or 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.199
 four-wheel drive inside 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.640
 big revolution since we go from one 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.230
 date dashboard is unflattering 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.270
 on old x trail to a copy of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.829
 that of the new qashqai much more 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.560
 modern with higher plastic 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.340
 range and well assembled as a whole 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.390
 the equipment of our top version of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.280
 range includes a complete panoply 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.230
 safety equipment including a 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.730
 automatic emergency braking the only 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.370
 engine available for now and the 1 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.780
 6 dci original renault general troops 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.040
 it allows to animate without problem the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.170
 car including on the road 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.340
 chassis side we find roughly the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.260
 new qashqai and cars 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.700
 sharing the same platform but the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.770
 x-trail higher and heavier 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.180
 less dynamic watch or comfort is 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.299
 on the other hand preserve despite our wheels 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.070
 19-inch rear passengers 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.549
 place a split bench and 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.570
 font in longitudinal mans over 26 cm 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.070
 back seat back the space to the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.460
 legs is very generous including 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.440
 the big ones 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.180
 the rear passengers will be the best 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.950
 placed to take advantage of this large roof 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.810
 glazed in series on our test model 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.100
 that chaplains are present 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170
 but the door bins are too 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.490
 small 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.930
 the trunk can optionally accommodate a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.290
 third row of seats for 800 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.760
 euros 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.560
 but it's the jump seat 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.119
 uncomfortable who claims to become 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.860
 usable to much advance the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.110
 central banquette to the point of making it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.970
 almost unusable the third row 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.619
 even retracted decreases in addition 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.180
 chest capacity of 100 of six meters 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.790
 cubes compared to the 5-seater version 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.130
 it goes from 550 to 445 cubic decimetres 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.240
 only 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.250
 the new x trail is in net rupture 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.570
 with his predecessor at least on the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.159
 exterior style and presentation 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.990
 much more flattering interior 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.210
 he keeps the same ground clearance at 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.259
 know 21 cm but the two versions 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.299
 drive wheels like ours are 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.590
 necessarily limited off track these 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.360
 versions however allow the x trail 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.630
 to escape the ecological malus but two 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.630
 peoples
