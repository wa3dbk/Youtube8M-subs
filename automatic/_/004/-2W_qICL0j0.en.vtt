second

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.179 

the<00:01:26.890> automatic<00:01:27.460> start<00:01:27.939> doesn't<00:01:28.570> work<00:01:28.719> if<00:01:29.189> you

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
the automatic start doesn't work if you

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.209 
the automatic start doesn't work if you
have<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.570> head<00:01:31.570> open<00:01:31.899> so<00:01:32.289> that's<00:01:33.070> why<00:01:33.189> I

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
have the head open so that's why I

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.779 
have the head open so that's why I
turned<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.579> off<00:01:35.250> what<00:01:36.250> I<00:01:36.280> had<00:01:36.429> to<00:01:36.460> do<00:01:36.670> to

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
turned it off what I had to do to

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.179 
turned it off what I had to do to
install<00:01:36.909> this<00:01:37.329> I<00:01:37.479> had<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.750> take<00:01:38.020> off<00:01:38.229> all<00:01:38.740> these

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
install this I had to take off all these

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.100 
install this I had to take off all these
little<00:01:39.369> screws<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:40.630> clips<00:01:41.819> and<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.869> had<00:01:43.959> to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
little screws and clips and I had to

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.149 
little screws and clips and I had to
reach<00:01:44.560> in<00:01:44.740> here<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:45.009> get<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.899> bowtie<00:01:46.899> out<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
reach in here to get the bowtie out and

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.429 
reach in here to get the bowtie out and
then<00:01:48.429> what<00:01:48.549> I<00:01:48.579> did<00:01:48.850> as<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.179> ran<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.689> wires<00:01:49.990> these

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
then what I did as I ran the wires these

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.770 
then what I did as I ran the wires these
are<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.649> wires<00:01:50.799> right<00:01:50.950> here<00:01:51.069> as<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.399> can<00:01:51.520> tell

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
are the wires right here as you can tell

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.559 
are the wires right here as you can tell
if<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.869> can<00:01:53.020> see<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:54.000> ran<00:01:55.000> into<00:01:55.030> my<00:01:55.360> side

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
if you can see that I ran into my side

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.199 
if you can see that I ran into my side
markers<00:01:56.020> because<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.670> easier<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.939> get<00:01:58.090> into

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
markers because it's easier to get into

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.910 
markers because it's easier to get into
them<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.720> get<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:59.020> headlights<00:01:59.380> too<00:01:59.739> many

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
them to get to the headlights too many

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.550 
them to get to the headlights too many
wires<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.439> basically<00:02:02.860> what<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.159> did<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:04.560> turned

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
wires so basically what I did I turned

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.319 
wires so basically what I did I turned
my<00:02:05.950> wheel<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.520> side<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:07.000> then<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.179> just

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
my wheel to the side and then I just

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.759 
my wheel to the side and then I just
took<00:02:07.569> out<00:02:07.689> these<00:02:07.869> four<00:02:08.140> little<00:02:08.380> bolts<00:02:08.649> that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
took out these four little bolts that

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:09.389 
took out these four little bolts that
are<00:02:08.890> right<00:02:09.009> here

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
are right here

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.610 
are right here
and<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.390> gives<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:10.660> easy<00:02:11.019> access<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.500> your

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
and it gives you easy access to your

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.030 
and it gives you easy access to your
side<00:02:12.489> marker<00:02:12.910> cables<00:02:13.329> and<00:02:14.319> just<00:02:14.590> hooked<00:02:14.799> it<00:02:14.950> up

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
side marker cables and just hooked it up

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.300 
side marker cables and just hooked it up
and<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.610> pretty<00:02:15.849> much<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:17.069> clipped<00:02:18.069> on<00:02:18.220> the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
and just pretty much it clipped on the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.530 
and just pretty much it clipped on the
