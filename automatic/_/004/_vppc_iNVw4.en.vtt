00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.380
 good kids, well, a little bit of 

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.599
 Sunday teacher the truth is that today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.870
 you should or may well be watching 

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:12.300
 hartline but since we went up yesterday to 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.490
 me a couple of days ago for you 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.990
 battlefield 4 as I said hey let's go to 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.330
 complete the week let's make ourselves 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.220
 here the trio 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 and we're going to complete a week that's going to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.340
 have hartline battlefield 4 and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.650
 battlefield 3 I do not know what else you can ask 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.610
 You can ask me for more colleagues 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.800
 better that is a little more hardcore 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.940
 but good the truth is that I think that 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.649
 it's pretty bad 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.879
 I started quite well too, not me 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.879
 like lage 17 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.090
 the effect 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.310
 we are obviously over but I have 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.050
 looked good I searched as if 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.520
 you could search for a server 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.370
 masterfully true 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.930
 I have found rather a server 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.600
 with rotations different from normal what 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.690
 which then hey I am pleased please me 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.000
 extreme and more seeing that is I think that 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.720
 I 've never tried it and see that I played 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.670
 of hours to this mode but I think that 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.520
 I have not approved and we just rotations 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.650
 the other day the developer that leaked 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.020
 all the images of the in 94 of the of the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.850
 86 and all that also has a 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.909
 information about the master mode 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.740
 grouper in battlefield 4 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.920
 and is that now the administrators 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.100
 they could choose instead of choosing between 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.350
 a list of haste that is to say of 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.049
 rotations has made them dais 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.859
 I guess obviously followed then 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.810
 could they directly choose the 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.200
 weapons or the rotation that they 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.930
 fancy which is very good 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 but it is also very bad because 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.110
 I guess that will sound like that to everyone who 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.540
 you see my channel of great power entails 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.120
 a great responsibility and the truth is 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.310
 to do a rotation of master gunsmith 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.370
 and more in more than fill 4 entails 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.740
 forgiveness carries a great responsibility 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.170
 because you can a mind what 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.570
 sufficiently evil can do 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.060
 until a rotation of explosives in 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.650
 battlefield 4 and a rotation of 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.540
 explosives do not know about you but I 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.280
 It's pretty scary 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.079
 because it is also very viable 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.079
 keeping in mind that battlefield 4 is 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.629
 a very explosive game if you understand me 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.920
 Well for thanks for staying there 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.170
 stabbing the partner I do not know why 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.909
 the people blade so much in truth 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.700
 thanks for staying tohá and thanks for 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:37.030
 put your head in, they are already 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.520
 doing favors here we go to tutiplén 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.850
 we want to win because but good another 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.840
 head 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.970
 my mother if you get to give this the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.500
 head too 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.800
 I do not know what it would have been, it seems that 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.960
 we have given a rotation 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.000
 and now we will go to the Franks to the 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.940
 francs excuse me fuck what bank I am 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.860
 speaking also lock francs yes 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.400
 take it now 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.400
 do not 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.180
 towel lock francs 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.920
 and this is where I move where 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.480
 less before I moved well because I 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.950
 quite without playing the franc not even 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.980
 in hard line I'm playing too much with 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.090
 I am not too pleased by the franc 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.879
 hard line targets and those of 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.840
 battlefield 4 but good the festival of 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:26.400
 the heads here or what is this 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.250
 web so he took him to hunt 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.330
 but to you if I bump you web 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.290
 my mom we're dating today look 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.290
 - where do I go to all 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.730
 I'm obviously having enough 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.890
 luck too i'm not doing 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.360
 jean-marc is where I should to the best 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.190
 make them 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.500
 but I'm also chaining some 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.500
 pretty pretty pimps 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.670
 do not 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.610
 take it now 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.650
 there is no flip a by me flipa today paid 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.510
 is to freak me because I could have 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.590
 done calmly but that's how I am 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.239
 things start to come out a little bit 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.239
 well and there are people in the kitchen 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.820
 it's not a skin market 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.320
 That's what we want to see the crossbow 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.320
 pity that it was suppressed 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.289
 but well this is going to be a teacher to 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.810
 mere teacher dominguero pardon enough 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.220
 faster than I thought not to be 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.050
 that now begins to chain deaths 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.250
 mine which is quite possible because 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.620
 I am a specialist in loading my 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.790
 games and could do tutorials and 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.940
 all 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.360
 not for what fool I am for god if it is 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.350
 to me you love the most is to is that 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.350
 it's there but I do not want to throw 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.890
 Hello 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.900
 that is two casualties with the crossbow 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.900
 I thought that it would only be a 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.840
 okay with those 72 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.980
 and see what we can do if I do not 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.360
 they are waiting there maybe I can 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.360
 cross over here to the kitchen 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.340
 do not go man 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.990
 they have to kill the only one with a bolt 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.050
 that yes that follows us is the one that follows us 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.320
 by far he is shy but follow us 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.320
 follow 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.880
 to see how we do this 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.600
 How can we do this 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.160
 taking advantage of that they are all with the sight 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.050
 it is very easy to come by 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.370
 behind and just kill them people 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.290
 she stays very still with these weapons and not 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.060
 it has to stay so still in the end 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.650
 truth is that the game hears I'm 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.500
 happy has this stuck me a rush of 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.090
 pretty cool moral 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.950
 You are playing a game because you soled 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.780
 moral I do not know I like very much fourth a 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.580
 franco hey, I'm pointing this server 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.250
 because my mother just because of this rotation 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.110
 I wait for all of them but in the end the truth is 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.220
 very well very well the departure of 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.220
 mocho has been this one
