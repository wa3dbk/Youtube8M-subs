I'm using it right now and in dayz and
it<00:00:21.480> works<00:00:21.689> quite<00:00:21.990> fine

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
it helped me acquire a lot my frames per

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660 
it helped me acquire a lot my frames per
second<00:00:24.779> used<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.260> 22<00:00:25.859> frames<00:00:26.099> per<00:00:26.279> second

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
second used to be 22 frames per second

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.009
