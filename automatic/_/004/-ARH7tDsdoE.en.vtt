00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
out where Ben's hardness is that so then

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.130 
out where Ben's hardness is that so then
that<00:00:23.090> leaves<00:00:23.360> only<00:00:23.810> Tara<00:00:25.090> right<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:26.390> we've

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
that leaves only Tara right and we've

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.680
