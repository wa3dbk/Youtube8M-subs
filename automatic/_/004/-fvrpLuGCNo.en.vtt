00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.100
 sgp 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.930
 over an hour ago they agreed 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.190
 on budget adjustments 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.170
 next year 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.359
 now all five groups still have to say yes 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.620
 but the negotiators dare 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.060
 relieved so I continue to talk to 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.740
 dominique van der heyde 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.450

 say you already know what is in the agreement 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.119
 state 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.470
 yes it is of course an hour because we 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.470
 come at the end of that churn 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.090
 just come back from italy 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.980
 messages that there is another boat with 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.129
 refugees in difficulty is this 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.329
 times close to malta and about 100 km from 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.489
 lampedusa 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.649
 the ship would have been capsized by 200 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.239
 People aboard the phone costs 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.389
 moment angelo van schaik 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.429
 What else you know what by 

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:50.409
 fortuyn volkert van der graaf is not allowed 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.719
 on probation it would be too much 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.100
 Social unrest causes that 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.210
 thinks State Secretary teeven of 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.679
 justice 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.139
 He also thinks it's for the count 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.690
 itself too dangerous is that public 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:03.940
 order can be seriously compromised with this 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.740
 decision goes against the council for a moment 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.659
 criminal law application 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.420
 who advised two weeks ago on from 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.979
 the count to game with kaat van volkert 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.810
 van der Graaf does not yet know whether he is opposed 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.670
 the decision to appeal is against 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.439
 he first wants the precise text 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.810
 and discuss it with his client 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.759
 talk and then hear or from the graves 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.530
 again trying to get trial leave 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.719
 to get 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.219
 is the association of criminal lawyers 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.679
 totally disagree with the decision 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.460
 of the State Secretary and thinks so 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.219
 someone else 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.380
 the trial leave have been granted in this way 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.450
 association calls it a political game 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.640
 p in the kickboxer badr trial 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.950
 Hari Hari boats are victims 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.869
 apology was and his younger brother 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.070

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.840

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.820
 the farmer had to testify about one 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.439
 fight two years ago from where 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.719
 the prosecution says that badr 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.030
 hari was involved 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.859
 it didn't become the 16-year-old malala 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.299
 Pakistani girl who is committed to 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.289
 the right of girls to go to school 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.969

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.530
 the Nobel Peace Prize went to 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.479
 an organization does the update 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.820
 haag organization supervises the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.289
 destruction of chemical weapons and 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.660
 try to avoid new ones 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.150
 few people were before 21 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.130

 the capital of syria 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.980
 count the organization as in the end years 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.870
 ninety exists and therefore oversees the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.520
 destruction of chemical weapons 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.319
 history has enormous amounts 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.090
 victims through the use of chemical 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.950
 sometimes with mustard gas in the first 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.200
 world war was used there soldiers 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.180
 sick country b in the second world war 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.370
 the Nazis used it to people 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.510
 gasification or put the late eighties 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.980
 Saddam Hussein 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.800
 nerve gas against the Kurdish 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.540
 population in northern Iraq only came after that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.820
 a worldwide treaty against 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.080
 all chemical weapons and based 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.260
 the OPC was established in 1997 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.510
 the organization settled in the hague 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.440
 189 countries are now members of the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.620
 opcw 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.560
 4 states that are not yet egypt angola 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.450
 South Sudan and North Korea 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.620
 requires a stock of chemical weapons 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.810
 to give up 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.940
 the inspectors of the OPC keep everywhere 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.690
 in the world the production storage and it 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.459
 use of chemical weapons 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.630
 and before that became the organization is now 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.120
 so it is 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.100
 OPCW inspectors are now active in 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.150
 syria but that conflict is hard to 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.430
 survey 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.750
 many parties are involved 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.299
 parties who often do not care 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.860
 whatever war law is sometimes possible 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.480
 it take months for that clear 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.060
 is what happens on the battlefield 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.030
 such as the attack on village in the vicinity of 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.680
 barbuda rebels she wanted in early August 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.079

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.340

 municipality and fire brigade have it 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.510
 derelict building closed due to the 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.610
 fire safety

 they went in with a straight leg 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.350
 supermarket in the price war 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.280
 price reductions of course but also 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.320
 advertising campaigns and throwing mud 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.720
 to each other what does it have to 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.270
 supermarkets delivered so far 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.950
 very little research shows 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.300
 he doesn't call it a failed action 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.870

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.760

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.800
 the living conditions for the builders 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.410
 of the football stadiums in Qatar 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.850
 Indeed, degrading people says that

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.640
 that the circumstances improve 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.620
 if that does not happen , the world cup must go to 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.360
 finding another country is just 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.890

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.560
 places in europe 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.000
 that leads immediately to 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.370
 problems in the german and austrian 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.410
