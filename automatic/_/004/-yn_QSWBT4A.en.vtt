live up to that song I felt like that

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.010 
live up to that song I felt like that
song<00:02:24.180> was<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.790> powerful<00:02:26.790> anyway<00:02:27.540> Gavin's

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
song was so powerful anyway Gavin's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.640 
song was so powerful anyway Gavin's
version<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.220> was<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.270> love<00:02:31.110> with<00:02:31.440> it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
version of it and I was in love with it

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.080 
version of it and I was in love with it
and<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.459> just<00:02:32.700> thought<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.060> was<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.480> sad<00:02:33.990> and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
and I just thought it was so sad and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.150 
and I just thought it was so sad and
dramatic<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.870> knew<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.470> could<00:02:37.709> sing<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.070> I

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
dramatic I knew that I could sing it I

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.780 
dramatic I knew that I could sing it I
knew<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.670> could<00:02:38.940> make<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.240> my<00:02:39.959> own<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.790> so

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
knew that I could make it my own and so

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.760 
knew that I could make it my own and so
we<00:02:41.910> go<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.570> we<00:02:42.990> changed<00:02:43.590> some<00:02:43.740> things

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
we go in and we changed some things

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.160 
we go in and we changed some things
around<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.550> we're<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.450> really<00:02:45.989> really

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
around and we're like really really

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.680 
around and we're like really really
happy<00:02:46.440> with<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.980> then<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.570> were<00:02:48.570> like

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
happy with it and then we were like

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.030 
happy with it and then we were like
wouldn't<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.290> cool<00:02:49.410> if<00:02:49.560> Gavin<00:02:49.890> would

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
wouldn't that be cool if Gavin would

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.250 
wouldn't that be cool if Gavin would
come<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.459> sing<00:02:50.820> harmony<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.600> then

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
come in and sing harmony on it and then

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.530 
come in and sing harmony on it and then
what<00:02:52.410> he<00:02:52.620> did<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.030> took<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.510> a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
what he did to it just took it to a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.320 
what he did to it just took it to a
whole<00:02:54.630> another<00:02:54.780> level<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.560> mean<00:02:55.709> like<00:02:55.890> he<00:02:56.330> it's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
almost like he was more emotional about

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.970 
almost like he was more emotional about
my<00:02:59.190> version<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.850> then<00:03:00.090> his<00:03:00.300> own<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:00.980> you
