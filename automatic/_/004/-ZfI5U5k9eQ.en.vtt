00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.610 

go<00:00:05.069> again<00:00:06.069> let's<00:00:07.029> not<00:00:07.240> know<00:00:07.479> about<00:00:07.779> the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
go again let's not know about the

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.699 
go again let's not know about the
interaction<00:00:09.070> between<00:00:09.370> light<00:00:10.330> and<00:00:10.360> matter<00:00:10.900> so

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:11.709 
interaction between light and matter so

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.240 
interaction between light and matter so
light<00:00:12.639> is<00:00:13.299> made<00:00:13.539> of<00:00:13.750> photo<00:00:13.990> 5<00:00:14.500> articles<00:00:14.799> that

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
light is made of photo 5 articles that

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.609 
light is made of photo 5 articles that
have<00:00:15.390> energy<00:00:16.390> associated<00:00:16.810> with<00:00:17.170> them<00:00:17.289> and<00:00:17.529> we

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
have energy associated with them and we

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.130 
have energy associated with them and we
talked<00:00:17.860> about<00:00:18.039> how<00:00:18.430> blue<00:00:19.240> line<00:00:19.510> is<00:00:19.810> more

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
talked about how blue line is more

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.350 
talked about how blue line is more
energetic<00:00:20.890> photons<00:00:21.400> that<00:00:21.580> are<00:00:21.790> blue<00:00:22.090> have

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
energetic photons that are blue have

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.500 
energetic photons that are blue have
more<00:00:22.570> energy<00:00:22.750> than<00:00:23.440> photos<00:00:23.920> that<00:00:24.100> are<00:00:24.280> red<00:00:24.510> now

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
more energy than photos that are red now

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.180 
more energy than photos that are red now
if<00:00:25.960> you<00:00:26.080> think<00:00:26.289> about<00:00:26.350> the<00:00:26.560> matter<00:00:26.800> let's

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
if you think about the matter let's

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.520 
if you think about the matter let's
think<00:00:27.730> about<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.420> simplest<00:00:28.930> atom<00:00:29.080> there<00:00:29.410> is

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
think about the simplest atom there is

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.069 
think about the simplest atom there is
an<00:00:29.770> atom<00:00:30.100> of<00:00:30.190> hydrogen<00:00:30.700> is<00:00:31.180> simply<00:00:31.510> a<00:00:31.539> proton

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
an atom of hydrogen is simply a proton

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.490 
an atom of hydrogen is simply a proton
and<00:00:32.259> an<00:00:32.649> electron<00:00:32.910> orbiting<00:00:33.910> that<00:00:34.480> protein<00:00:34.989> so

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
and an electron orbiting that protein so

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.370 
and an electron orbiting that protein so
I'm<00:00:36.070> going<00:00:36.130> to<00:00:36.420> pretend<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:37.870> I'm<00:00:38.140> going<00:00:38.290> to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
I'm going to pretend that I'm going to

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.010 
I'm going to pretend that I'm going to
lecture<00:00:38.590> on<00:00:39.180> leaving<00:00:40.180> in<00:00:40.390> an<00:00:40.510> atom<00:00:40.690> of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
lecture on leaving in an atom of

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.470 
lecture on leaving in an atom of
hydrogen<00:00:41.260> so<00:00:41.680> I<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:41.829> only<00:00:41.970> electron<00:00:42.970> in<00:00:43.210> there

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
hydrogen so I the only electron in there

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.130 
hydrogen so I the only electron in there
so<00:00:43.840> under<00:00:44.230> election<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:44.970> there<00:00:45.970> is<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.140> proton

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
so under election and there is a proton

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.860 
so under election and there is a proton
in<00:00:47.590> there<00:00:48.130> that<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.399> can<00:00:48.640> see<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.149> at<00:00:49.720> this

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
in there that you can see and at this

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.250 
in there that you can see and at this
moment<00:00:50.170> here<00:00:51.100> I'm<00:00:51.579> in<00:00:51.820> wrong<00:00:52.090> state<00:00:52.450> I<00:00:52.720> have

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
moment here I'm in wrong state I have

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.530 
moment here I'm in wrong state I have
which<00:00:54.070> means<00:00:54.340> that<00:00:54.430> i<00:00:54.579> have<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.969> least<00:00:55.300> amount

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
which means that i have the least amount

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.590 
which means that i have the least amount
of<00:00:55.960> energy<00:00:56.230> that<00:00:56.559> i<00:00:56.800> can<00:00:56.980> possibly<00:00:57.250> have<00:00:57.820> so

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
of energy that i can possibly have so

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.870 
of energy that i can possibly have so
that's<00:00:58.780> that<00:00:59.050> minimum<00:00:59.579> amount<00:01:00.579> of<00:01:00.730> energy

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
that's that minimum amount of energy

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.569 
that's that minimum amount of energy
this<00:01:01.690> here<00:01:01.960> is<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.050> ground<00:01:02.320> state<00:01:02.710> now

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.649 

electrons<00:01:06.579> are<00:01:07.000> not<00:01:07.450> allowed<00:01:08.049> and<00:01:08.469> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
electrons are not allowed and to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.090 
electrons are not allowed and to
transition<00:01:11.069> into<00:01:12.749> higher<00:01:13.749> energy<00:01:14.409> levels<00:01:14.889> as

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
transition into higher energy levels as

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.699 
transition into higher energy levels as
they<00:01:15.880> wish<00:01:16.119> there<00:01:17.020> are<00:01:17.109> only<00:01:17.259> certain

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
they wish there are only certain

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.190 
they wish there are only certain
transition<00:01:18.639> levels<00:01:19.090> in<00:01:19.209> our<00:01:19.329> lab<00:01:19.600> that's<00:01:19.959> what

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
transition levels in our lab that's what

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.910 
transition levels in our lab that's what
we<00:01:20.350> want<00:01:20.529> to<00:01:20.619> demonstrate<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.630> I<00:01:22.990> can't<00:01:23.590> go

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
we want to demonstrate so I can't go

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.919 
we want to demonstrate so I can't go
from<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:25.079> ground<00:01:26.079> state<00:01:26.789> here<00:01:27.789> to<00:01:28.479> here<00:01:28.630> I

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
from this ground state here to here I

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.160 
from this ground state here to here I
need<00:01:29.409> to<00:01:29.619> go<00:01:29.770> into<00:01:29.979> certain<00:01:30.609> very<00:01:31.029> specific

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
need to go into certain very specific

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.599 
need to go into certain very specific
energy<00:01:32.170> level<00:01:32.469> so<00:01:32.619> you<00:01:32.770> know<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:33.099> am<00:01:33.369> on<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
energy level so you know I am on the

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.779 
energy level so you know I am on the
left<00:01:33.819> turn<00:01:33.969> at<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.359> ground<00:01:34.599> state<00:01:34.899> or<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:36.189> am<00:01:36.639> in

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
left turn at the ground state or I am in

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.449 
left turn at the ground state or I am in
landrum<00:01:37.329> here<00:01:37.659> at<00:01:37.929> this<00:01:38.229> state<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.859> at<00:01:39.340> this

point<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.270> right<00:01:40.719> now<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.899> have<00:01:41.170> this<00:01:41.649> amount

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
point and right now I have this amount

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.679 
point and right now I have this amount
of<00:01:42.130> energy<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.700> know<00:01:42.819> I<00:01:42.939> need<00:01:43.149> to<00:01:43.179> have<00:01:43.479> more

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
of energy you know I need to have more

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.929 
of energy you know I need to have more
energy<00:01:43.959> to<00:01:44.229> be<00:01:44.349> here<00:01:44.649> while<00:01:45.399> as<00:01:45.579> you<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.819> I

have there so equivalent
or<00:01:50.560> up<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.010> end<00:01:51.340> of<00:01:51.460> gloom<00:01:51.610> but<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.210> can't<00:01:52.420> be<00:01:52.540> in

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
or up the end of gloom but I can't be in

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.040 
or up the end of gloom but I can't be in
between<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.200> let's<00:01:53.410> this<00:01:54.070> let's<00:01:54.490> do<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.270> Here

i'll<00:02:19.720> just<00:02:20.020> get<00:02:20.830> rid<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.220> i<00:02:21.430> mean<00:02:22.000> if<00:02:22.090> i<00:02:22.209> do

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
i'll just get rid of it i mean if i do

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.670 
i'll just get rid of it i mean if i do
that<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.959> don't<00:02:22.989> have<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.560> energy

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680

are not a blue photo expected level
again<00:03:37.070> of<00:03:37.280> blue<00:03:37.720> but<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.960> know<00:03:39.080> Blue<00:03:39.560> has<00:03:39.590> a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
again of blue but you know Blue has a

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.020 
again of blue but you know Blue has a
lot<00:03:40.070> of<00:03:40.100> energy<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:41.330> I<00:03:42.160> can<00:03:43.160> kind<00:03:43.820> of<00:03:43.880> make

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
lot of energy and I can kind of make

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.930 
lot of energy and I can kind of make
change<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.750> say<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.710> the<00:03:46.370> amount<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.730> energy

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
change and say that the amount of energy

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.630 
change and say that the amount of energy
that<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:47.450> interview<00:03:47.930> would<00:03:48.890> be<00:03:49.040> equal<00:03:49.490> the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
that it's interview would be equal the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.110 
that it's interview would be equal the
amount<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:50.090> energy<00:03:50.270> in<00:03:50.810> a<00:03:50.990> green<00:03:51.560> in<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.580> red

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
amount of energy in a green in the red

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.110 
amount of energy in a green in the red
photo<00:03:53.390> so<00:03:54.260> it's<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.890> same<00:03:54.920> energy<00:03:55.550> but

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
photo so it's the same energy but

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.050 
photo so it's the same energy but
instead<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.600> blue<00:03:56.840> I'd<00:03:57.530> rather<00:03:57.980> have<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.550> green

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
instead of blue I'd rather have a green

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.470 
instead of blue I'd rather have a green
and<00:03:59.390> red<00:03:59.660> okay<00:04:00.380> this<00:04:01.130> way<00:04:01.370> what<00:04:02.120> I'm<00:04:02.270> allowed

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
and red okay this way what I'm allowed

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.850 
and red okay this way what I'm allowed
to<00:04:02.540> do<00:04:02.810> is<00:04:02.990> I<00:04:03.230> will<00:04:03.860> admit<00:04:04.820> the<00:04:05.030> great<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.420> red

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
to do is I will admit the great the red

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.430 
to do is I will admit the great the red
and<00:04:06.860> come<00:04:07.160> back<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.300> green<00:04:08.540> energy<00:04:09.080> level

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
and come back to the green energy level

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.680 
and come back to the green energy level
I<00:04:09.650> still<00:04:10.400> have<00:04:10.520> some<00:04:10.670> energy<00:04:11.120> I'm<00:04:11.450> still

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
I still have some energy I'm still

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.930 
I still have some energy I'm still
excited<00:04:11.990> not<00:04:12.950> as<00:04:13.100> much<00:04:13.220> as<00:04:13.340> I<00:04:13.460> was<00:04:13.640> before<00:04:15.940> what

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
excited not as much as I was before what

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.720 
excited not as much as I was before what
can<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.150> do<00:04:17.239> now<00:04:17.890> I'll<00:04:18.890> just<00:04:18.950> hang<00:04:19.250> around<00:04:19.280> here

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
can I do now I'll just hang around here

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.840 
can I do now I'll just hang around here
great<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.359> like<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.049> green<00:04:21.460> do<00:04:22.460> something

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
great I like the green do something

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.130 
great I like the green do something
honey<00:04:23.060> oh<00:04:23.980> this<00:04:24.980> is<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.310> very<00:04:25.850> energetic<00:04:26.150> photon

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
honey oh this is a very energetic photon

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.710 
honey oh this is a very energetic photon
ok<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:28.040> is<00:04:28.220> ultraviolet<00:04:28.700> it's<00:04:29.540> actually

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
ok this is ultraviolet it's actually

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.450 
ok this is ultraviolet it's actually
incredible<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.500> you<00:04:30.530> can<00:04:30.800> see<00:04:31.040> it<00:04:31.160> because

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
incredible that you can see it because

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.280 
incredible that you can see it because
it<00:04:31.610> should<00:04:31.790> be<00:04:31.910> invisible<00:04:32.150> with<00:04:32.900> this<00:04:33.080> amount

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
it should be invisible with this amount

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.130 
it should be invisible with this amount
of<00:04:33.440> energy<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:34.040> can<00:04:34.430> be<00:04:34.550> analyzed<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.720> leave

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
of energy I can be analyzed and leave

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.610 
of energy I can be analyzed and leave
