I've<00:01:10.860> already<00:01:11.040> adjusted<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.880> bubble<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I've already adjusted this bubble to the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.160 
I've already adjusted this bubble to the
12<00:01:13.530> degree<00:01:13.860> angle<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.850> we're<00:01:15.750> ready<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> go

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
12 degree angle so we're ready to go

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.450 
12 degree angle so we're ready to go
ahead<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.409> start<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.479> sharp<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.720> late

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
ahead and start the sharp of this late

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.570 
ahead and start the sharp of this late
the<00:01:23.119> since<00:01:24.119> my<00:01:24.270> hands<00:01:24.570> are<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.869> close<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
the since my hands are so close to the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.050 
the since my hands are so close to the
belt<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.909> made<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:28.579> little<00:01:29.579> holder<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
belt I made up this little holder to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.319 
belt I made up this little holder to
stack<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.400> rare<00:01:32.400> earth<00:01:32.549> magnets

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
stack of rare earth magnets

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
stack of rare earth magnets
it's<00:01:33.720> got<00:01:33.900> tape<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.590> won't<00:01:34.860> scar<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's got tape on it so won't scar the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.359 
it's got tape on it so won't scar the
blade<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.630> kind<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.869> an<00:01:36.990> extension<00:01:37.369> that

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
blade and it's kind of an extension that

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
blade and it's kind of an extension that
I<00:01:38.430> put<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> blade<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> keep<00:01:39.750> my<00:01:39.930> fingers

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
I put on the blade and keep my fingers

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.370 
I put on the blade and keep my fingers
out<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> way<00:01:40.920> which<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.840> very<00:01:42.840> important

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
out of the way which is very important

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.420 
out of the way which is very important
so<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.700> already<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:46.100> point<00:01:47.100> zero

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
so this is already is that point zero

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.080 
so this is already is that point zero
one<00:01:47.759> nine<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.780> already<00:01:49.200> fairly<00:01:50.040> thin<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.640> I'm

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
one nine it's already fairly thin so I'm

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.340 
one nine it's already fairly thin so I'm
using<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.509> 400<00:01:52.100> try<00:01:53.100> Zack<00:01:53.340> belt<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:54.869> do<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
using a 400 try Zack belt to do this and

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.959 
using a 400 try Zack belt to do this and
it's<00:01:55.439> only<00:01:55.590> gonna<00:01:55.740> take<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> couple<00:01:56.100> passes<00:01:56.820> on

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it's only gonna take a couple passes on

00:01:56.969 --> 00:03:02.880 
it's only gonna take a couple passes on
each<00:01:57.450> side<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:59.159> make<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.939> working<00:02:00.299> edge

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.819 

just<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.980> couple<00:03:04.189> passes<00:03:04.760> on<00:03:04.909> each<00:03:04.939> side<00:03:08.829> it's

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
just a couple passes on each side it's

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.490 
just a couple passes on each side it's
going<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.010> be<00:03:10.069> fine<00:03:10.310> for<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.609> working<00:03:11.030> edge<00:03:11.379> if<00:03:12.379> I

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
going to be fine for a working edge if I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.030 
going to be fine for a working edge if I
want<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.859> pop<00:03:13.069> hairs<00:03:14.049> this<00:03:15.049> is<00:03:15.260> this<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:15.859> how<00:03:15.980> I

it<00:04:13.010> with<00:04:13.129> my<00:04:13.340> nail<00:04:15.039> if<00:04:16.039> I<00:04:16.250> have<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.549> leaning

it with my nail if I have it leaning
this<00:04:17.030> way<00:04:17.090> I'll<00:04:17.989> switch<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.769> other<00:04:18.949> side

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
this way I'll switch to the other side

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.210 
this way I'll switch to the other side
and<00:04:20.780> all<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:20.959> want<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.289> do<00:04:21.440> on<00:04:21.560> this<00:04:21.709> side<00:04:21.769> is

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
and all I want to do on this side is

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.510 
and all I want to do on this side is
just<00:04:22.610> get<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.090> bend<00:04:23.330> back<00:04:24.099> just<00:04:25.099> getting<00:04:25.430> it

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
just get it to bend back just getting it

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:42.190 
just get it to bend back just getting it
thinned<00:04:25.820> out<00:04:26.530> top<00:04:27.530> of<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.710> 12<00:04:28.010> degree<00:04:28.310> wedge

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.860 

it<00:04:43.200> usually<00:04:43.410> takes<00:04:43.590> about<00:04:43.920> half<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.550> amount

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
it usually takes about half the amount

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.540 
it usually takes about half the amount
on<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.080> second<00:04:46.470> side<00:04:46.680> as<00:04:46.950> it<00:04:47.070> does<00:04:47.250> from<00:04:47.520> the

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
first one after you get that to roll

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
seem that this works I bring the blade

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.870 
seem that this works I bring the blade
up<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:57.990> about<00:04:58.230> thirty<00:04:58.700> to<00:04:59.700> forty<00:05:00.060> degrees<00:05:00.510> and

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
up to about thirty to forty degrees and

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.820 
up to about thirty to forty degrees and

make one pass on the stem and just and

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.830 
make one pass on the stem and just and
it<00:05:08.520> will<00:05:08.610> tear<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.270> wire<00:05:09.720> edge<00:05:11.270> right<00:05:12.270> off<00:05:12.330> and

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
it will tear the wire edge right off and

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.170 
it will tear the wire edge right off and
leave<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:15.330> real<00:05:15.780> crisp<00:05:16.290> hair<00:05:17.040> popping<00:05:17.370> heads
