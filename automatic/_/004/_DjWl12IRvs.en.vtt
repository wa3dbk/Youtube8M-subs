00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:21.289
 another trip on electricity energies 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.289
 an electricity 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.140
 Mr. So-and-so today, he bought a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.199
 electric lamp with a power of 100 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.199
 Watts 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:39.079
 Ms. Fulana went to buy a dryer. 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.079
 hair to dry your hair 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.570
 power of 1000 watts 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.860
 this is a kilowatt 2000 anything 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.750
 if it says a pound any thing sir 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 of the railroad wanted a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.340
 electric locomotive to pull your train 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.840
 130 kilometers time 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.080
 the power of the locomotive 8 million 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.210
 watts 8 million watts or if you 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.250
 prefer 8 megawatts 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.770
 today a million things we call 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.930
 mega things watt kilowatt megawatt is the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.979
 power of the devices is what they 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.439
 can do 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.710
 but for now they do not do anything they do not 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.020
 connected to the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.860
 However, the network is ready 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.610
 alternators central girÃ£o 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.690
 the alternator you remember is the magnet 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.520
 the coils in practice. 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.960
 this alternator image 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.370
 be a little closer to reality 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.370
 but the principle is the same 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:51.950
 the coils are called status 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:56.150
 the magnet that is actually an electromagnet 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.220
 flame rotor they saw the 3 thousand turns 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.410
 per minute and the stator releases a 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.509
 three-phase alternating current with 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.759
 frequency of 50 years, exactly this is 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:12.200
 the trainer has a maximum power of 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.030
 600 megawatts but currently the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.750
 tells us that it works with 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.730
 only 50% of its power 300 megawatts 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.770
 that it only works 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.840
 the equivalent of 300 and scavengers of 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.840
 hair of one kilowatt each 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.010
 but you imagine that if 300 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.660
 megawatts leaving the alternator is 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.330
 I need a machine or less 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:45.410
 so powerful to spin do not exist 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.410
 miracles more than machine 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.500
 in the plants is always a turbine but 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.720
 with which it turns it 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.760
 This is where the heads of 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.570
 divides into two schools 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.910
 on one hand the so-called hydraulics 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.080
 because it turns your turbines with water 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.080
 rivers and dams 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.100
 the others already spin with the steam that 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.520
 make them sing the water in a 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.520
 boiler 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.590
 these are called thermal 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.300
 they are divided in two by the technician 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.940
 classic that warms your boiler with 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.750
 coal oil gas 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.550
 the other the nuclear thermal serves a 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.980
 reactor 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.410
 but let's go back to her headquarters 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.410
 continues to avoid its 300 megawatts 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.080
 we dream that suddenly we are 40 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.510
 locomotives are linked beyond 300 thousand 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.700
 hair dryers already connected to the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.950
 makes a total of 600 megawatts 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.709
 need if our central supply 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.330
 alone 300 megawatts it is not enough anymore 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.580
 power must be increased 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.000
 hydraulic lord to open the 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.000
 Water 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.760
 the thermometer opens the arrival of steam without 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.930
 forget to fire and open 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.239
 also register the fuel 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.609
 machine power increases 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.030
 generator releases its 600 megawatts 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.300
 keep your speed and your exact 50 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.300
 defendants 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.770
 in practice all this is automatic 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.410
 nobody notices anything but is 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.950
 the heat that sees the consumption of 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.410
 increase or increase the hydraulic 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.370
 can see the water reserve download 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.160
 but water in principle costs nothing 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.190
 so if the water costs nothing because 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.090
 not only make hydraulic power plants 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:00.560
 would be much more economical 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.560
 We'll see this next time.
