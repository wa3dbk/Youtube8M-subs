00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.570
 the florence anp doctors veenendaal is a working group 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.260
 have to defend Amsterdam commercial by the hour 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.519
 pay attention to let go 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:13.440
 how are you going to do that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.299
 if you calculated 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.299
 is emitted 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.249
 the commercial motives in Amsterdam 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.779
 how can you see how much September is exactly 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.480
 by investing in others 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.480
 in set two and pixi plus 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.080
 emit the total CV 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.579
 but that his projects will already grow in Poland 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.550
 Bart Caron 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.679
 what a power station was registered 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.980
 a time that recently if it is true 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.200
 and that is beautiful mind and environmental pollution 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.270
 yes i see what there are of course good 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.940
 certainly if they would sail on green electricity, but this is not always the case 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.570
 the power that is used in these boats comes on top 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.570
 actually an environmentally harmful power plant for time 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.710
 that is why we have chosen to compensate these electric boats 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.530
 through the very against it is one of the projects 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.600
 meaning the news of the ball from a boat trip like bryan 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.550
 borger 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.180
 no absolutely not 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.900
 funny is that we found out it from carbon footprint that it found out 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.510
 amount per boat trip 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.570
 on average two storms are so low that we bear the costs ourselves tony 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.200
 to be mowbray among all 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.940
 the boat was without it 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.860
 Simon Stoltz has absolutely nothing in the plan 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.100
 yes that would indeed be wonderful 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.710
 only it is practically impossible to achieve 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.730
 provide all boats recovery with solar cells 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.720
 and with this plan it is possible 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.280
 put all boats into the water immediately 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.140
 but this sounds like it 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.560
 rkc because 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.950
 much more can be applied from le mans boats is that way 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.820
 he is already in turkey airplanes by himself I can this one from the set 2 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.590
 to offset emissions 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.130
 but well the top team are a big company in Amsterdam restaurants hotels 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.050
 and everyone can start 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.400
 Amsterdam 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.080
 I do not know
