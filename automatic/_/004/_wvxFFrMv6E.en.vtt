on<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.500> other<00:01:03.620> side<00:01:05.590> this<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.650> actually<00:01:07.040> one

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
on the other side this is actually one

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.620 
on the other side this is actually one
of<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.310> longest<00:01:07.700> courses<00:01:08.000> I've<00:01:08.119> ever<00:01:08.270> tried

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
of the longest courses I've ever tried

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.330 
of the longest courses I've ever tried
from<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.140> center<00:01:09.440> front<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.920> height<00:01:10.100> of<00:01:10.220> this

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
from the center front the height of this

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.180 
from the center front the height of this
is<00:01:10.520> 14<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.240> half<00:01:11.420> inches<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.080> on<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.950> side

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
is 14 and a half inches and on the side

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.370 
is 14 and a half inches and on the side
seam<00:01:13.580> which<00:01:13.909> is<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.450> shortest<00:01:14.840> part<00:01:15.110> is

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
seam which is the shortest part is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.950 
seam which is the shortest part is
actually<00:01:15.830> closer<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.280> 12<00:01:16.610> inches<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:17.540> this

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
actually closer to 12 inches so this

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.870 
actually closer to 12 inches so this
corset<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:18.530> definitely<00:01:18.950> only<00:01:19.190> for<00:01:19.610> people

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
corset is definitely only for people

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.880 
corset is definitely only for people
with<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.090> very<00:01:20.330> long<00:01:20.570> torso<00:01:20.869> unless<00:01:21.680> you

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
with the very long torso unless you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.830 
with the very long torso unless you
don't<00:01:22.100> intend<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.490> sit<00:01:22.700> down<00:01:22.880> in<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.180> if<00:01:23.390> you

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
don't intend to sit down in it if you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.600 
don't intend to sit down in it if you
have<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:24.110> bit<00:01:24.409> of<00:01:24.440> a<00:01:24.560> shorter<00:01:24.860> torso<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:25.460> might

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
have a bit of a shorter torso you might

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.280 
have a bit of a shorter torso you might
find<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:26.060> if<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.270> try<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.479> sit<00:01:26.780> down<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.170> this

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
find that if you try to sit down in this

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.380 
find that if you try to sit down in this
corset<00:01:27.860> is<00:01:28.070> either<00:01:28.399> going<00:01:28.729> to<00:01:28.820> dig<00:01:29.030> into<00:01:29.210> your

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
corset is either going to dig into your

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.749 
corset is either going to dig into your
lap<00:01:29.659> or<00:01:29.990> it's<00:01:30.289> going<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.770> push<00:01:31.220> up<00:01:31.399> on<00:01:31.580> your

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
lap or it's going to push up on your

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.680 
lap or it's going to push up on your
bust<00:01:32.060> area

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
bust area

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.570 
bust area
so<00:01:33.049> I<00:01:33.440> would<00:01:33.590> definitely<00:01:33.920> recommend<00:01:34.009> this<00:01:34.399> for

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
so I would definitely recommend this for

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.460 
so I would definitely recommend this for
people<00:01:34.640> who<00:01:35.000> are<00:01:35.119> of<00:01:35.300> taller<00:01:35.690> stature<00:01:36.110> or

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
people who are of taller stature or

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.070 
people who are of taller stature or
people<00:01:37.429> who<00:01:37.520> have<00:01:37.700> longer<00:01:38.000> torsos<00:01:38.539> in<00:01:38.690> general

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
people who have longer torsos in general

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.050 
people who have longer torsos in general

the<00:02:49.910> actual<00:02:50.150> Assembly<00:02:50.629> of<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.840> corset<00:02:51.230> I

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
the actual Assembly of this corset I

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.350 
the actual Assembly of this corset I
think<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.250> fashion<00:02:52.790> fabric<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.300> the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
think that the fashion fabric and the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.020 
think that the fashion fabric and the
lining<00:02:53.390> were<00:02:54.050> flat<00:02:54.349> lined<00:02:54.590> together<00:02:54.950> then<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
lining were flat lined together then the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.270 
lining were flat lined together then the
panels<00:02:56.510> were<00:02:56.660> assembled<00:02:57.200> using<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.769> top<00:02:58.040> stitch

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
panels were assembled using a top stitch

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.130 
panels were assembled using a top stitch
because<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.640> do<00:02:58.790> see<00:02:59.180> multiple<00:02:59.659> stitching

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
because I do see multiple stitching

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.649 
because I do see multiple stitching
along<00:03:00.290> each<00:03:00.709> panel<00:03:01.159> here<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.659> interestingly

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
along each panel here and interestingly

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.990 
along each panel here and interestingly
there<00:03:03.319> were<00:03:03.409> external<00:03:03.920> boning<00:03:04.430> channels<00:03:04.819> laid

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
there were external boning channels laid

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.580 
there were external boning channels laid
down<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:05.569> it's<00:03:05.750> not<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.080> sandwich<00:03:06.440> method

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
down so it's not the sandwich method

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.640 
down so it's not the sandwich method
like<00:03:06.920> some<00:03:07.159> other<00:03:07.700> author<00:03:08.209> out<00:03:08.510> corset<00:03:08.959> brands

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
the fifth panel so these four panels

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.240 
the fifth panel so these four panels
here<00:03:23.450> these<00:03:23.690> are<00:03:23.900> protected<00:03:24.440> against<00:03:24.950> the

have the waist tape there so those

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.910

still do use some plastic boning on the
sides<00:05:18.260> here<00:05:18.710> so<00:05:19.669> I<00:05:19.700> do<00:05:20.030> believe<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:20.960> would

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
sides here so I do believe that it would

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.490 
sides here so I do believe that it would
be<00:05:21.169> better<00:05:21.470> if<00:05:21.740> they<00:05:21.919> had<00:05:22.190> used<00:05:22.430> spirals

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
be better if they had used spirals

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.190 
be better if they had used spirals
instead<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.800> plastic<00:05:25.310> on<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.610> sides<00:05:25.849> that

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
instead of plastic on the sides that

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.650 
instead of plastic on the sides that

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600

I<00:05:33.360> had<00:05:33.570> reviewed<00:05:33.840> three<00:05:34.170> years<00:05:34.410> ago<00:05:34.530> this<00:05:35.070> one

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
I had reviewed three years ago this one

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.240 
I had reviewed three years ago this one
I<00:05:35.610> find<00:05:35.940> is<00:05:36.240> less<00:05:36.810> susceptible<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.440> bending<00:05:38.040> or

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
I find is less susceptible to bending or

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.970 
I find is less susceptible to bending or
warping<00:05:38.730> it's<00:05:39.660> very<00:05:39.960> similar<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.620> type<00:05:40.950> of

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
warping it's very similar to the type of

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.400 
warping it's very similar to the type of
boning<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.490> was<00:05:41.640> used<00:05:41.880> in<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.690> gallery's

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
serpentine corsets that I had reviewed

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.770 
serpentine corsets that I had reviewed
in<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.390> past<00:05:45.420> as<00:05:45.780> well<00:05:46.220> so<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:48.150> is<00:05:48.390> a<00:05:48.420> minor

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
in the past as well so it is a minor

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.510 
in the past as well so it is a minor
improvement<00:05:49.500> but<00:05:49.680> I<00:05:49.710> would<00:05:50.010> really<00:05:50.220> prefer

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
improvement but I would really prefer

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.970 
improvement but I would really prefer
for<00:05:51.360> this<00:05:51.750> entire<00:05:52.260> course<00:05:52.650> it<00:05:52.770> to<00:05:52.860> be

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
of the grommets there are 26 of them so

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.720

them the top part in the washer and they

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
know if they are size zero or if they're

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.180 
know if they are size zero or if they're
actually<00:06:06.060> size<00:06:06.570> one<00:06:06.990> because<00:06:07.530> the<00:06:07.830> internal

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
actually size one because the internal

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.220 
actually size one because the internal
diameter<00:06:08.400> here<00:06:09.030> seems<00:06:09.330> to<00:06:09.390> be<00:06:09.450> quite<00:06:09.750> large<00:06:09.960> it

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
diameter here seems to be quite large it

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.650 
diameter here seems to be quite large it
can<00:06:10.350> accommodate<00:06:10.760> some<00:06:11.760> bulkier<00:06:12.120> laces<00:06:12.540> if

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
can accommodate some bulkier laces if

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.200 
can accommodate some bulkier laces if
you<00:06:12.750> prefer<00:06:13.050> to<00:06:13.170> switch<00:06:13.410> some<00:06:13.760> these<00:06:14.760> out<00:06:14.940> for

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
you prefer to switch some these out for

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.900 
you prefer to switch some these out for
thicker<00:06:16.140> ribbons<00:06:16.530> if<00:06:16.710> you<00:06:16.800> wanted<00:06:17.160> here's<00:06:17.760> the

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
thicker ribbons if you wanted here's the

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.400 
thicker ribbons if you wanted here's the
back<00:06:18.060> of<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.240> grommets<00:06:18.450> so<00:06:18.870> they<00:06:19.170> have<00:06:19.380> a

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
back of the grommets so they have a

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.710 
back of the grommets so they have a
decent<00:06:19.890> size<00:06:20.040> washer<00:06:20.580> none<00:06:21.390> of<00:06:21.480> them<00:06:21.600> appear

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
decent size washer none of them appear

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.390 
decent size washer none of them appear
to<00:06:21.870> be<00:06:22.020> pulling<00:06:22.260> out<00:06:22.470> all<00:06:22.650> but<00:06:22.890> I'll<00:06:23.040> continue

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
to be pulling out all but I'll continue

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.510 
to be pulling out all but I'll continue
watching<00:06:24.150> these<00:06:24.450> grommets<00:06:24.690> as<00:06:25.050> usual<00:06:25.520> the

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
watching these grommets as usual the

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.950 
watching these grommets as usual the
back<00:06:26.670> of<00:06:26.880> every<00:06:27.120> single<00:06:27.420> one<00:06:27.480> of<00:06:27.540> these<00:06:27.750> have

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
back of every single one of these have

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.950 
back of every single one of these have
multiple<00:06:28.470> splits<00:06:28.800> in<00:06:29.070> them<00:06:29.280> but<00:06:30.150> I<00:06:30.480> find<00:06:30.870> that

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
multiple splits in them but I find that

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.630 
multiple splits in them but I find that
it<00:06:31.080> doesn't<00:06:31.380> actually<00:06:31.530> catch<00:06:31.860> on<00:06:32.100> the<00:06:32.220> laces

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
it doesn't actually catch on the laces

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.910 
it doesn't actually catch on the laces
so<00:06:32.670> it's<00:06:33.240> not<00:06:33.600> a<00:06:33.660> huge<00:06:33.990> point<00:06:34.320> as<00:06:34.500> long<00:06:34.680> as<00:06:34.800> they

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
so it's not a huge point as long as they

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.700 
so it's not a huge point as long as they
stay<00:06:35.130> in<00:06:35.160> the<00:06:36.000> laces<00:06:36.420> themselves<00:06:37.050> are<00:06:37.290> about

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
stay in the laces themselves are about

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.310 
stay in the laces themselves are about
1/8<00:06:38.130> of<00:06:38.190> an<00:06:38.310> inch<00:06:38.400> wide<00:06:38.730> very<00:06:39.210> dense<00:06:39.570> nylon

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
1/8 of an inch wide very dense nylon

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.640 
1/8 of an inch wide very dense nylon
cord<00:06:40.800> I<00:06:41.460> find<00:06:41.850> that<00:06:42.030> they<00:06:42.690> actually<00:06:43.080> grip

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
cord I find that they actually grip

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.250 
cord I find that they actually grip
pretty<00:06:44.130> well<00:06:44.370> I<00:06:44.970> don't<00:06:45.660> find<00:06:45.840> that<00:06:45.990> it's

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
pretty well I don't find that it's

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.200 
pretty well I don't find that it's
sliding<00:06:46.470> open<00:06:46.740> a<00:06:46.950> whole<00:06:47.160> lot<00:06:47.430> the<00:06:47.790> price<00:06:48.000> for

sliding open a whole lot the price for

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.610 
sliding open a whole lot the price for

the Athena underbust course and other
colossal<00:06:50.160> website<00:06:50.580> is<00:06:50.820> 50<00:06:51.270> pounds<00:06:51.600> in<00:06:51.690> the<00:06:51.810> UK

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
colossal website is 50 pounds in the UK

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.620 
colossal website is 50 pounds in the UK
which<00:06:52.680> converts<00:06:53.070> to<00:06:53.160> about<00:06:53.250> $80<00:06:54.120> in<00:06:54.270> the<00:06:54.360> u.s.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
which converts to about $80 in the u.s.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.170 
which converts to about $80 in the u.s.
so<00:06:55.290> this<00:06:55.530> concludes<00:06:55.800> my<00:06:56.280> review<00:06:56.460> of<00:06:56.700> the

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
so this concludes my review of the

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.120 
so this concludes my review of the
