00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.570
 my dad started as a stop 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.160
 delicate company then appears on 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.029
 sir jack and decide times to 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.110
 see for himself 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.800
 the keeper of the happiness signs with 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.640
 17 years boarded with him as a clerk 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.770
 working at school in 1986 we have 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.949
 get through convenience stores we have revenues 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.080
 on the fire from 90 to 93 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.879
 it was this happiness evaluates wrong there is 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.880
 is approached by the little silly group 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.649
 but we held besides 83 then we 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.870
 noticed after year that we were 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.430
 too small and studied 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.250
 market then the potential is such 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.410
 that we have decided to enlarge their 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.980
 doubled of area of a relationship 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.070
 it was in 2002 we had the opportunity to 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.350
 graft the assaults that is what we could 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.920
 enlarge also the store of 2000 feet 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.020
 that he wanted that in 2003 we are 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.450
 approached by sobiz for buying a 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.130
 other store then it just falls to 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.409
 point because we were due for another 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.090
 charm when we see the second 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.950
 store will have to fart the braces 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.110

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.510
 is easy going on but we have lived 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.900
 very very difficult years sales and 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.600

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.369
 still ' we would have given more we are 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.650
 made today that it's going extremely 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.920
 well and we actually like it we even 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.400
 approached on before a third store 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.170
 I was very young as soon as we started 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.049

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.030
 little too much but rainier and I have 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.920
 started working with them you're not 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.320
