00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
switches for the configuration that you

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.570

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
see here on the screen I realize this is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.070 
see here on the screen I realize this is
probably<00:00:17.609> difficult<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.420> read<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.900> I'm<00:00:18.960> just

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
probably difficult to read so I'm just

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.960 
probably difficult to read so I'm just
going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> quickly<00:00:19.439> go<00:00:19.590> over<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.789> have

already set up the two switches this is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.020 
already set up the two switches this is

taken the time to already plug in the
console<00:01:12.420> cable<00:01:12.920> I've<00:01:13.920> installed<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.520> rack

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
console cable I've installed the rack

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.560 
console cable I've installed the rack
mount<00:01:14.939> ears<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.590> have<00:01:16.590> unscrewed<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.700> and

mount ears I have unscrewed the and
removed<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:20.100> cover<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.759> Bay<00:01:21.540> 1<00:01:21.869> which<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:22.830> be

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
removed the cover of Bay 1 which will be

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.330 
removed the cover of Bay 1 which will be
used<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.460> install<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> stacking<00:01:24.630> module<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
used to install the stacking module and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.679 
used to install the stacking module and
I've<00:01:26.340> already<00:01:26.520> plugged<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> power<00:01:27.330> in

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
I've already plugged the power in

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.840 
I've already plugged the power in
although<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:28.979> turned<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> power<00:01:29.549> on

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
although I have not turned the power on

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.319 
although I have not turned the power on
yet<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:31.820> found<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:34.100> USB<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> serial<00:01:35.310> cable<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
yet I found a USB to serial cable that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.460 
yet I found a USB to serial cable that
actually<00:01:36.689> splits<00:01:37.079> into<00:01:37.259> two<00:01:37.530> different<00:01:38.270> ports

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
actually splits into two different ports

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.609 
actually splits into two different ports
so<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.770> switch<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.850> plugged<00:01:42.420> into<00:01:42.659> serial

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
so I have switch one plugged into serial

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.120 
so I have switch one plugged into serial
port<00:01:43.890> three<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.520> switch<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:46.049> plugged<00:01:46.920> into

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
port three and switch to plugged into

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.749 
port three and switch to plugged into
serial<00:01:48.119> port<00:01:48.450> 4<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:50.220> what<00:01:50.369> I'm<00:01:50.460> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.610> do

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
serial port 4 so what I'm going to do

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.359 
serial port 4 so what I'm going to do
now<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.240> install<00:01:51.899> these<00:01:52.259> stacking<00:01:52.920> modules

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
now is install these stacking modules

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.700 
now is install these stacking modules
they're<00:01:54.240> fairly<00:01:54.509> easy<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:55.020> install

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
they're fairly easy to install

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.810 
they're fairly easy to install
I've<00:01:55.860> already<00:01:56.009> removed<00:01:56.430> them<00:01:56.579> from<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
I've already removed them from the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.289 
I've already removed them from the
packaging<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:58.700> want<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.759> handle<00:02:00.030> them<00:02:00.119> very

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
packaging you want to handle them very

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.530 
packaging you want to handle them very
carefully<00:02:00.540> obviously<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:02.579> you'll<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:03.119> that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
carefully obviously and you'll see that

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.219 
carefully obviously and you'll see that
on<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.399> back<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.640> these<00:02:05.759> there's<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.630> slot<00:02:07.049> or<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
on the back of these there's a slot or a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.870 
on the back of these there's a slot or a
groove<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:08.239> fits<00:02:09.239> pretty<00:02:09.539> snugly<00:02:10.520> into<00:02:12.140> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
groove that fits pretty snugly into the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.860 
groove that fits pretty snugly into the
into<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.970> bay<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.470> slide<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.980> back<00:02:18.870> until

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
into the bay so to slide it back until

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.730 
into the bay so to slide it back until
you<00:02:20.020> feel<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:21.060> module<00:02:22.470> connect<00:02:23.470> with<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
you feel the module connect with the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:32.180 
you feel the module connect with the
backplane<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:25.170> then<00:02:26.170> just<00:02:27.510> finger<00:02:28.510> tight

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190

it's a special cable built specifically
for<00:03:34.540> stacking<00:03:34.900> modules<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:36.340> we'll<00:03:36.730> slide

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
for stacking modules and we'll slide

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.729

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
this cable into XG 1 and you here to

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.630 
this cable into XG 1 and you here to
hear<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.459> click<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:44.070> then<00:03:45.070> we'll<00:03:45.250> take<00:03:45.489> this

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
hear it click and then we'll take this

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.740 
hear it click and then we'll take this
other<00:03:45.880> side<00:03:46.769> making<00:03:47.769> sure<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.420> up<00:03:49.420> is

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
other side making sure that up is

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.259 
other side making sure that up is
properly<00:03:50.140> labeled<00:03:50.590> up<00:03:51.900> plug<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.019> into<00:03:53.140> XG<00:03:53.620> 2

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
properly labeled up plug it into XG 2

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.050 
properly labeled up plug it into XG 2
till<00:03:55.269> we<00:03:55.360> hear<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.600> snap<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.640> then<00:03:57.640> do<00:03:57.910> the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
till we hear it snap and then do the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.780 
till we hear it snap and then do the
same<00:03:58.239> thing<00:03:59.519> with<00:04:00.519> XG<00:04:01.209> 2<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:02.920> switch<00:04:03.430> 1<00:04:03.730> and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
same thing with XG 2 on switch 1 and

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.000 
same thing with XG 2 on switch 1 and
connect<00:04:06.790> that<00:04:06.970> stacking<00:04:07.540> module<00:04:08.160> 2<00:04:09.160> XG<00:04:09.940> 1<00:04:11.010> on

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
connect that stacking module 2 XG 1 on

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.650 
connect that stacking module 2 XG 1 on
switch<00:04:12.730> 2

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.780 

and<00:04:18.660> that's<00:04:19.500> how<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.709> install<00:04:20.040> stacking

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
and that's how you install stacking
