and I really need to speed things up a
little<00:02:36.329> I<00:02:36.720> will<00:02:37.079> try<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.319> TTL<00:02:37.920> mode<00:02:38.129> all

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
little I will try the TTL mode all

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.149 
little I will try the TTL mode all
automatic<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.319> using<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.709> speed<00:02:40.980> light

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
automatic just like using a speed light

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.089 
automatic just like using a speed light
but<00:02:41.610> with<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.849> lot<00:02:42.120> more<00:02:42.360> power<00:02:42.659> I'm<00:02:43.530> asking<00:02:43.980> my

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099
