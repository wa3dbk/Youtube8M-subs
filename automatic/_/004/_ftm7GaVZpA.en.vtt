so<00:00:06.420> we<00:00:06.810> have<00:00:07.410> an<00:00:08.150> all-comers<00:00:09.150> system<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:10.679> was

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
so we have an all-comers system that was

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.129 
so we have an all-comers system that was
designed<00:00:10.950> intentionally<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.880> way<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:13.019> is

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
designed intentionally that way that is

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.410 
designed intentionally that way that is
funded<00:00:13.590> about<00:00:13.889> half<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.519> rate<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:15.000> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
funded about half the rate of a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.680 
funded about half the rate of a
selective<00:00:15.960> system<00:00:16.850> one<00:00:17.850> should<00:00:18.119> expect<00:00:18.210> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
selective system one should expect to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:27.170 
selective system one should expect to
get<00:00:18.810> different<00:00:18.990> atoms<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:26.970> there's

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
get different atoms you know there's

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.179 
get different atoms you know there's
this<00:00:27.240> idea<00:00:27.480> that's<00:00:28.019> sometimes<00:00:28.590> stated<00:00:29.070> out

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
this idea that's sometimes stated out

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.009 
this idea that's sometimes stated out
there<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.910> know<00:00:30.000> more<00:00:30.539> spending<00:00:30.929> on

the fullest of his or her capacity

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.160 
the fullest of his or her capacity
period<00:00:47.370> everyone<00:00:48.149> really<00:00:48.539> should<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
period everyone really should get the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.709 
period everyone really should get the
tools<00:00:49.410> needs<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.950> succeed<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.610> when<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.480> comes

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
tools needs to succeed and when it comes

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.380 
tools needs to succeed and when it comes
down<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.379> comes<00:00:52.530> down<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.000> we<00:00:54.000> live<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
down to it it comes down to we live in a

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
down to it it comes down to we live in a
society<00:00:54.629> where<00:00:54.989> money<00:00:55.440> drives<00:00:55.890> everything

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
society where money drives everything

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.049 
society where money drives everything
and<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.640> money<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.300> key<00:00:57.770> money<00:01:01.430> we<00:01:02.430> spend<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.030> lot

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and so money is key money we spend a lot

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.219 
and so money is key money we spend a lot
of<00:01:03.359> dough<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:05.240> education<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:08.000> ton<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> money<00:01:09.360> as

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
of dough on education a ton of money as

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.940 
of dough on education a ton of money as
far<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.000> resources<00:01:12.000> more<00:01:12.510> money<00:01:12.780> well<00:01:13.740> big

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
far as resources more money well big

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.789 
far as resources more money well big
problem<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.580> keep<00:01:14.760> throwing<00:01:15.060> money<00:01:15.330> at

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
problem is we keep throwing money at

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.240 
problem is we keep throwing money at
education

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.980 

our<00:01:22.250> funding<00:01:22.670> for<00:01:22.880> students<00:01:23.300> in<00:01:23.480> Washington

our funding for students in Washington

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.350 
our funding for students in Washington
state<00:01:24.320> comes<00:01:24.830> in<00:01:24.980> at<00:01:25.100> about<00:01:25.220> 40<00:01:25.670> second<00:01:26.090> in<00:01:26.240> the

like California and New Jersey take a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.990 
like California and New Jersey take a
state<00:01:42.650> like<00:01:42.800> New<00:01:42.950> Jersey<00:01:43.340> they're<00:01:43.610> spending

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
state like New Jersey they're spending

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.420 
state like New Jersey they're spending

and they're getting more for their money

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.910 
and they're getting more for their money
because<00:01:50.150> in<00:01:50.480> what<00:01:50.630> in<00:01:50.780> New<00:01:50.930> Jersey<00:01:51.320> their

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
because in what in New Jersey their

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.710 
because in what in New Jersey their
graduation<00:01:52.520> rate<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:52.820> somewhere<00:01:52.970> near<00:01:53.330> ninety

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
no fan of the arguments that way you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.670 
no fan of the arguments that way you
can't<00:01:59.540> throw<00:01:59.810> money<00:01:59.990> in<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.350> because<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
can't throw money in it because the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.990 
can't throw money in it because the
truth<00:02:00.890> of<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.100> matter<00:02:01.220> is<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.430> can<00:02:01.729> throw

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
truth of the matter is you can throw

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.400 
truth of the matter is you can throw
when<00:02:02.150> he<00:02:02.240> had<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.360> if<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.750> threw<00:02:03.020> money<00:02:03.200> in

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
when he had it if you threw money in

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.200 
when he had it if you threw money in
that<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.680> quality<00:02:03.890> would<00:02:04.220> go<00:02:04.400> up<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.910> that

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
that the quality would go up and that

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.870 
that the quality would go up and that
isn't<00:02:05.479> enough<00:02:05.570> alone<00:02:05.960> I'd<00:02:06.290> be<00:02:06.580> very<00:02:07.580> clear

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
isn't enough alone I'd be very clear

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.440 
isn't enough alone I'd be very clear
about<00:02:07.940> that<00:02:08.300> we<00:02:08.510> raised<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.229> bar<00:02:09.410> high<00:02:09.890> and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
about that we raised the bar high and

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.880 
about that we raised the bar high and
real<00:02:11.450> funding<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:11.930> education<00:02:12.380> started<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.770> go

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
real funding and education started to go

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.850 
real funding and education started to go
down<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.420> we<00:02:14.570> started<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.959> create<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.350> funding

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
down so we started to create a funding

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.060 
down so we started to create a funding
crisis<00:02:16.370> as<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:17.000> were<00:02:17.120> trying<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.510> improve

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
crisis as we were trying to improve

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.190 
crisis as we were trying to improve
