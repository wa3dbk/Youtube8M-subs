are the most dry because you'll be able

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.690 
are the most dry because you'll be able
to<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.890> very<00:01:40.950> patchy<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
to see it because it's very patchy and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.040 
to see it because it's very patchy and
with<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> gloves<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.630> make<00:01:42.780> sure

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
with the gloves you have to make sure

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.749 
with the gloves you have to make sure
that<00:01:43.289> you<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.800> as<00:01:43.950> evenly<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.640> can

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that you do it as evenly as you can

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.210 
that you do it as evenly as you can
without<00:01:45.179> shrieks<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.110> by<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.920> is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
without shrieks and by that it is

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.639 
without shrieks and by that it is
easiest<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.759> use<00:01:47.819> your<00:01:48.119> palm<00:01:48.360> because<00:01:48.690> if<00:01:49.470> you

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
easiest to use your palm because if you

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.499 
easiest to use your palm because if you
use<00:01:49.830> your<00:01:50.250> fingers<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.819> that<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:51.360> you're

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
use your fingers like that then you're

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
use your fingers like that then you're
more<00:01:51.539> likely<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.110> get<00:01:52.289> streaks<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:52.890> your

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
more likely to get streaks with your

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.029 
more likely to get streaks with your
fingers<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.660> use<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:54.899> palm<00:01:55.289> and<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.709> just

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
fingers so I just use my palm and I just

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.190 
fingers so I just use my palm and I just
put<00:01:56.429> the<00:01:56.640> amount<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.300> I<00:01:57.330> want<00:01:57.660> on<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.050> but

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
put the amount that I want on there but

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.840 
put the amount that I want on there but
make<00:01:58.350> sure<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.830> even<00:01:59.190> for<00:01:59.399> each<00:01:59.520> limb

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
make sure that it's even for each limb

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.370 
make sure that it's even for each limb
because<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.750> don't<00:02:00.869> want<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.050> pull<00:02:01.200> like

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
because you don't want to pull like

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.749 
because you don't want to pull like
double<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.830> amount<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.160> one<00:02:02.220> like<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
double the amount on one like then you

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.210 
double the amount on one like then you
have<00:02:02.910> on<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.179> other<00:02:03.209> and<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:04.229> overnight<00:02:04.770> or

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
have on the other and then overnight or

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.889 
have on the other and then overnight or
throughout<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.910> duration<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.390> day<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.720> once

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
throughout the duration the day it once

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.960 
throughout the duration the day it once
it<00:02:07.050> develops<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.679> have<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.069> nice<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> gradual

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
it develops you have a nice a gradual

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.460 
it develops you have a nice a gradual
glow<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.500> makes<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.920> look<00:02:11.130> focused<00:02:11.580> I

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
glow and then makes you look focused I

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.620 
glow and then makes you look focused I
don't<00:02:13.470> turn<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.160> never<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.390> burn

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
don't turn I just never have I just burn

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.140 
don't turn I just never have I just burn
and<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.260> all<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.980> think<00:02:17.040> if<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.610> use<00:02:17.940> a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and that is all and I think if I use a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.780 
and that is all and I think if I use a
regular<00:02:18.420> fake<00:02:18.840> tan<00:02:19.140> then<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.950> be<00:02:20.069> like<00:02:20.280> me<00:02:20.550> and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
regular fake tan then and be like me and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.790 
regular fake tan then and be like me and
then<00:02:20.910> bare<00:02:21.180> boom<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.620> wouldn't

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
then bare boom and it just wouldn't

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.440 
then bare boom and it just wouldn't
really<00:02:23.040> look<00:02:23.250> like<00:02:23.310> me<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.670> that's<00:02:23.970> why<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.180> use

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
really look like me so that's why I use

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.930 
really look like me so that's why I use
this<00:02:24.690> because<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.380> more<00:02:25.620> natural<00:02:25.950> so

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
this because it is more natural so

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.300 
this because it is more natural so
letting<00:02:27.209> on<00:02:27.300> from<00:02:27.569> natural<00:02:27.959> this<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.280> so

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
letting on from natural this is so so so

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.059 
letting on from natural this is so so so
natural<00:02:30.330> I've<00:02:30.510> had<00:02:30.780> some<00:02:31.380> people<00:02:31.530> compliment

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
natural I've had some people compliment

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.010 
natural I've had some people compliment
me<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.550> say<00:02:32.760> oh<00:02:32.790> what<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.569> use<00:02:33.750> type
