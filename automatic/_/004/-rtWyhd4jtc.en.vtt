this took me ages we were looking for
George<00:03:10.920> Foreman<00:03:12.980> see<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.130> game<00:03:14.280> uses<00:03:14.910> this

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
George Foreman see if the game uses this

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.650 
George Foreman see if the game uses this
sense<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.660> confusing<00:03:16.410> false<00:03:16.769> difficulty<00:03:17.660> to

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
sense of confusing false difficulty to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.479 
sense of confusing false difficulty to
make<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.200> game<00:03:19.350> lasts<00:03:19.680> more<00:03:20.010> than<00:03:20.250> an<00:03:20.340> hour

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
make the game lasts more than an hour

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.640 
make the game lasts more than an hour
and<00:03:21.239> that's<00:03:22.230> not<00:03:22.560> very<00:03:23.400> nice<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.720> then<00:03:25.530> again

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
and that's not very nice but then again

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.860 
and that's not very nice but then again
I<00:03:25.860> can't<00:03:26.130> really<00:03:26.250> accuse<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.420> game<00:03:27.660> of

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
I can't really accuse just this game of

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.110 
I can't really accuse just this game of
doing<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.290> because<00:03:28.700> practically<00:03:29.700> every

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
doing that because practically every

but you get my point still this game is
much<00:03:48.840> much<00:03:49.230> better<00:03:49.500> than<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.890> lot<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.040> that

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220

from<00:06:25.229> what<00:06:25.290> I<00:06:25.440> hear<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:25.979> ps2<00:06:26.490> version<00:06:26.820> is<00:06:26.910> not

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
from what I hear the ps2 version is not

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.530 
from what I hear the ps2 version is not
as<00:06:27.330> good<00:06:27.660> I<00:06:27.870> don't<00:06:28.080> actually<00:06:28.290> know<00:06:28.830> but<00:06:29.270> yeah<00:06:30.270> I

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
as good I don't actually know but yeah I

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.960 
as good I don't actually know but yeah I
think<00:06:31.260> it's<00:06:31.410> pretty<00:06:31.590> much<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:32.070> same<00:06:32.100> just<00:06:32.370> it

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
think it's pretty much the same just it

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.230 
think it's pretty much the same just it
didn't<00:06:33.479> really<00:06:34.380> receive<00:06:34.740> the<00:06:35.160> same<00:06:35.820> kind<00:06:36.150> of

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
didn't really receive the same kind of

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.600 
didn't really receive the same kind of
positive<00:06:36.570> response<00:06:36.990> because<00:06:37.410> I<00:06:37.440> guess<00:06:37.860> the

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
positive response because I guess the

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.230 
positive response because I guess the
ps2<00:06:39.500> the<00:06:40.500> game<00:06:40.800> has<00:06:41.070> a<00:06:41.100> pretty<00:06:41.460> poor<00:06:41.790> framerate

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
ps2 the game has a pretty poor framerate

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.870 
ps2 the game has a pretty poor framerate
but<00:06:42.750> I<00:06:42.960> don't<00:06:43.229> think<00:06:43.680> kids<00:06:43.950> care<00:06:44.370> about<00:06:44.400> that

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
but I don't think kids care about that

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.960 
but I don't think kids care about that
in<00:06:45.150> the<00:06:45.330> slightest<00:06:46.140> and<00:06:46.520> it<00:06:47.520> is<00:06:47.729> also

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
in the slightest and it is also

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.930 
in the slightest and it is also
