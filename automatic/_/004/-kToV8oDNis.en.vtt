00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.670
 a match of strange sensations placed 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.980
 playing with 2 - here at the stadium 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.809
 monumental 11 to 1 who rescued the painting 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.120
 popular the reactions and the next 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.129
 report here in colo colo should tie 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.150
 suffered was what I rescue colo colo 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.920
 before santiago wanderers 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.500
 the picture something ended with two players 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.370
 less pablo contreras per double card 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.140
 yellow and the goalie renny vega a 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.540
 equality wants campus value the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.770
 effort in the face of adversity but the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.640
 delivery of the players again was 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.290
 very important with a man less what 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.630
 we put water right when we built the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.840
 Goal options must be followed 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.239
 working, we have to keep improving today 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.760
 It was not the ideal match, either. 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.380
 that be realistic the second time as 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.560
 you say with a man less we put them 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.750
 a bow to wanderers we had three or 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.399
 four clear chances of being able to 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.600
 closed the score and unfortunately 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.820
 forgive us as well as after 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.079
 He also forgives us with the penalty but 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.040
 I think that today the team put a lot 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.230
 egg and he knew how to trace the match 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.450
 and I think we could win it with good 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.520
 players and we waste in that 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.820
 opportunity and I think with 1 - the team 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.580
 showed that he still can and the truth 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.890
 we are very hurt with you can not get out 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.630
 the three points and well now you have to 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.830
 continue working so that the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.510
 next match do not repeat the 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.190
 mistakes with two parents men is also 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.580
 difficult to get some point at home with 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.410
 very good and much more the drama 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.570
 he came when the 29 minutes 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.460
 Eladio Herrera put the advantage for 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.870
 wanderers and in the second half to the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.080
 67 minutes muÃ±oz car put the equality 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.330
 however the 49 and 83 minutes pablo 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.670
 Contreras and Renny Vega respectively 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.280
 they would be expelled but still the team 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.950
 never lowered his arms 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.200
 and finish again with nine players 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.930
 I rescue 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.390
 the delivery and 20 minutes when it went 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.820
 expelled contreras and we had 20 minutes 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.890
 that the team at least tried 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.689
 offensively with change of pace both 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.170
 time we got up we had two options 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.010
 of goal with civil gutierrez and with muÃ±oz and 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.030
 good are rugged matches that 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.060
 we will have to continue talking to 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.349
 that these accidents do not happen to us 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.569
 for a party to work 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.769
 We can quite difficult when on 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.840
 minus the last minute of the same as the 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.150
 last week 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.500
 It's sad because it plays by how 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.120
 it ended because it was tying in 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.250
 house where we want to win that in addition to 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.349
 not respecting one that debuted juan 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.569
 guillermo dominguez spoke about his 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.569
 first encounter I want to win 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.519
 will go there 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.610
 to make people have the possibility 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.019
 enjoy more of the team's soccer but 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.790
 I think the team and how I told you 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.150
 he played a lot and that and that led to 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.590
 to get a multiple a comparison 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.720
 who deals points 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.489
 Carlos MuÃ±oz scoring the equalizer and 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.489
 ending as a substitute goalie 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.590
 and
