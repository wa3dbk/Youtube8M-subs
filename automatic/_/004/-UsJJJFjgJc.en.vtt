countdown show with with Carol Vorderman
you<00:02:12.209> know<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> number<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.020> want<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.290> end

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
you know the number that you want to end

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.059 
you know the number that you want to end
up<00:02:13.560> with

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
up with

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.599 
up with
but<00:02:14.969> what<00:02:15.540> goes<00:02:15.780> into<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:16.230> changes<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.249> you

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
but what goes into it changes and you

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.190 
but what goes into it changes and you
have<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.849> try<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.120> combine<00:02:18.359> those<00:02:18.689> numbers

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
have to try and combine those numbers

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.959 
have to try and combine those numbers
correctly<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.790> produce<00:02:20.999> the<00:02:21.329> right<00:02:21.480> result

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
correctly to produce the right result

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.420 
correctly to produce the right result
the<00:02:23.969> real<00:02:24.180> challenge<00:02:24.659> is<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.049> we<00:02:25.430> don't

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the real challenge is that we don't

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.729 
the real challenge is that we don't
always<00:02:26.639> know<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.939> result<00:02:27.389> either<00:02:27.599> when<00:02:28.560> we're

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
always know the result either when we're

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.289 
always know the result either when we're
developing<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.340> new<00:02:29.489> blend<00:02:29.730> we<00:02:29.909> don't<00:02:30.120> always

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
developing a new blend we don't always

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.599 
developing a new blend we don't always
know<00:02:30.659> what<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.959> want<00:02:31.079> to<00:02:31.260> end<00:02:31.379> up<00:02:31.530> with<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.489> we

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
know what we want to end up with so we

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.640 
know what we want to end up with so we
end<00:02:32.730> up<00:02:32.879> with<00:02:33.000> two<00:02:33.150> unknowns<00:02:33.329> and<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.469> very

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
end up with two unknowns and it's a very

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.319 
end up with two unknowns and it's a very
interesting<00:02:34.739> game<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.579> that's<00:02:35.670> what<00:02:35.909> I<00:02:35.939> spend

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
interesting game and that's what I spend

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.370 
interesting game and that's what I spend
quite<00:02:37.139> a<00:02:37.170> large<00:02:37.409> part<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.799> my<00:02:37.859> time<00:02:38.159> doing
