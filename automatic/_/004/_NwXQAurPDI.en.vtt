the ground I've made one here and one
here<00:00:36.580> so<00:00:36.640> this<00:00:36.879> is<00:00:37.059> my<00:00:37.239> ball<00:00:37.570> to<00:00:37.809> target<00:00:38.230> line

here so this is my ball to target line

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:39.570 
here so this is my ball to target line
if<00:00:38.530> you<00:00:38.650> like<00:00:38.680> so<00:00:39.010> I'm<00:00:39.070> not<00:00:39.160> going<00:00:39.309> to<00:00:39.400> stand

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
open or close to it because that's going

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.530 
open or close to it because that's going
to<00:00:41.200> really<00:00:41.950> reflect<00:00:42.250> your<00:00:42.700> your<00:00:43.030> swing<00:00:43.300> plane

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
to really reflect your your swing plane

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.630 
to really reflect your your swing plane
so<00:00:43.750> important<00:00:44.559> that<00:00:44.680> you<00:00:44.739> set<00:00:44.950> two<00:00:45.160> canes<00:00:45.430> up

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
regular alignment so you're parallel to

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.049

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
arm now getting back to the swing path

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.540 
arm now getting back to the swing path
and<00:01:24.670> plane<00:01:24.910> if<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.960> rotate<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.680> top<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.160> I'm

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
and plane if I rotate to the top and I'm

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.490 
and plane if I rotate to the top and I'm
a<00:01:27.700> slicer<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.360> pillar<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:28.720> would<00:01:29.020> see<00:01:29.290> my

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
a slicer and a pillar you would see my

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.350 
a slicer and a pillar you would see my
downswing<00:01:30.070> being<00:01:30.310> very<00:01:30.610> much<00:01:30.790> this<00:01:30.970> way<00:01:31.180> where

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
downswing being very much this way where

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.930 
downswing being very much this way where
I<00:01:31.390> rotate<00:01:31.900> my<00:01:31.930> body<00:01:32.080> out<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.680> position<00:01:33.370> and<00:01:33.850> I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
I rotate my body out of position and I

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.840 
I rotate my body out of position and I
swing<00:01:34.270> down<00:01:34.450> on<00:01:34.660> this<00:01:34.780> path<00:01:35.130> now<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.370> hoop<00:01:36.640> as

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
swing down on this path now that hoop as

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.370 
swing down on this path now that hoop as
I<00:01:37.000> look<00:01:37.180> at<00:01:37.300> it<00:01:37.390> in<00:01:37.480> relation<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:37.930> this<00:01:38.110> line

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
I look at it in relation to this line

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.710 
I look at it in relation to this line
it's<00:01:38.590> very<00:01:38.650> much<00:01:39.010> going<00:01:39.310> across<00:01:39.520> this<00:01:39.910> way<00:01:40.210> in

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
it's very much going across this way in

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.800 
it's very much going across this way in
relation<00:01:41.230> to<00:01:41.260> my<00:01:41.470> balls<00:01:41.710> target<00:01:42.220> line<00:01:42.600> hence<00:01:43.600> a

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
relation to my balls target line hence a

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.680 
relation to my balls target line hence a
slice<00:01:44.080> in<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.410> pool<00:01:44.710> if<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.700> go<00:01:45.910> to<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.180> top<00:01:46.420> and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
slice in the pool if I go to the top and

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.750 
slice in the pool if I go to the top and
I'm<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.080> bit<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:47.560> sort<00:01:47.980> of<00:01:48.010> a<00:01:48.130> block<00:01:48.400> out<00:01:48.580> to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
I'm a bit of a sort of a block out to

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.640 
I'm a bit of a sort of a block out to
the<00:01:48.850> right<00:01:49.000> or<00:01:49.120> a<00:01:49.150> hooker<00:01:49.570> my<00:01:50.440> natural

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
the right or a hooker my natural

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.290 
the right or a hooker my natural
downswing<00:01:51.310> path<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.760> going<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:51.940> be<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.090> little

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
downswing path is going to be a little

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.840 
downswing path is going to be a little
bit<00:01:52.480> more<00:01:52.660> this<00:01:52.870> way<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:54.100> now<00:01:54.130> as<00:01:54.430> I<00:01:54.580> look<00:01:54.610> at

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
bit more this way so now as I look at

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.340 
bit more this way so now as I look at
the<00:01:54.910> hoop<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.210> very<00:01:55.420> much<00:01:55.570> going<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:56.020> way<00:01:56.200> in

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
the hoop is very much going that way in

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.830 
the hoop is very much going that way in
relation<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.800> my<00:01:57.040> ball<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.430> target<00:01:57.790> line<00:01:57.970> now

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
relation to my ball to target line now

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.500 
relation to my ball to target line now
in<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.140> perfect<00:01:59.740> swing<00:02:00.040> or<00:02:00.400> a<00:02:00.460> real<00:02:01.150> good

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
in a perfect swing or a real good

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.020 
in a perfect swing or a real good
dynamic<00:02:02.050> downswing<00:02:02.500> part<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:02.980> playing<00:02:03.280> you'll

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
dynamic downswing part of playing you'll

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.230 
dynamic downswing part of playing you'll
go<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.480> top<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:04.900> as<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.500> come<00:02:05.680> down<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
go to the top and as you come down you

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.990 
go to the top and as you come down you
should<00:02:07.510> return<00:02:07.870> this<00:02:08.110> hoop<00:02:08.470> back<00:02:09.190> parallel<00:02:09.849> to

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
should return this hoop back parallel to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.150 
should return this hoop back parallel to
your<00:02:10.119> ball<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.539> target<00:02:10.959> line<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.830> I'm<00:02:11.950> no

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
your ball to target line so I'm no

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.699 
your ball to target line so I'm no
longer<00:02:12.190> out<00:02:12.640> in<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:12.970> way<00:02:13.269> I'm<00:02:14.140> no<00:02:14.470> longer

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
longer out in this way I'm no longer

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.089 
longer out in this way I'm no longer
either<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:16.000> way<00:02:16.269> I<00:02:16.540> really<00:02:17.530> start<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.980> get

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
either this way I really start to get

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.649 
either this way I really start to get
the<00:02:18.220> sense<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.760> feel<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.300> I'm<00:02:19.420> more

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
the sense and the feel that I'm more

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.259 
the sense and the feel that I'm more
here<00:02:20.019> so<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:20.830> could<00:02:21.069> see<00:02:21.370> that's<00:02:21.670> back<00:02:21.940> parallel

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
here so I could see that's back parallel

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.449 
here so I could see that's back parallel
that's<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.379> good<00:02:23.560> swing<00:02:23.769> plane<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.340> that's

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
that's a good swing plane and that's

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.980 
that's a good swing plane and that's
going<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.670> lead<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.210> good<00:02:25.420> swing<00:02:25.720> path

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
going to lead to a good swing path

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.590 
going to lead to a good swing path
through<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.410> ball<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> few<00:02:27.730> sort<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.120> drills

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
through the ball so a few sort of drills

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.380 
through the ball so a few sort of drills
on

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
on

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.910 
on
to<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.660> top<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.110> getting<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.500> into<00:02:30.740> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
to the top and getting this into the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.590 
to the top and getting this into the
right<00:02:31.069> position<00:02:31.280> here<00:02:31.790> coming<00:02:32.090> down

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
right position here coming down

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.640 
right position here coming down
if<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.200> then<00:02:33.380> grab<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> golf<00:02:33.950> club<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:35.650> you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
if you then grab a golf club and you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.760 
if you then grab a golf club and you
make<00:02:36.830> your<00:02:37.010> swing<00:02:37.250> up<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.580> top<00:02:38.770> you'll

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
make your swing up to the top you'll

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.220 
make your swing up to the top you'll
start<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.430> really<00:02:40.760> get<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.150> feel<00:02:41.240> of<00:02:41.630> where<00:02:42.020> you

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
start to really get a feel of where you

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.710 
start to really get a feel of where you
actually<00:02:42.800> need<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.040> be<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.090> your<00:02:44.270> old<00:02:44.420> swing

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
actually need to be so if your old swing

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.980 
actually need to be so if your old swing
plane<00:02:45.020> is<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:46.060> you'll<00:02:47.060> really<00:02:47.330> feel<00:02:47.690> that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
plane is this you'll really feel that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.650 
plane is this you'll really feel that
you're<00:02:48.080> more<00:02:48.320> here<00:02:48.640> if<00:02:49.640> your<00:02:49.910> old<00:02:50.090> swing<00:02:50.420> plane

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
you're more here if your old swing plane

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.949 
you're more here if your old swing plane
was<00:02:50.959> too<00:02:51.410> much<00:02:51.590> here<00:02:52.150> you'll<00:02:53.150> really<00:02:53.480> feel<00:02:53.780> as

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
was too much here you'll really feel as

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.420 
was too much here you'll really feel as
though<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.230> club<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.650> little<00:02:54.950> bit<00:02:55.130> more<00:02:55.310> out

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
though the club is a little bit more out

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.479 
though the club is a little bit more out
in<00:02:55.610> front<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.180> now<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.200> say<00:02:57.489> 5-10

in front of you now like I say 5-10

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.920 
in front of you now like I say 5-10

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
minutes a day each day that's really

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.510
