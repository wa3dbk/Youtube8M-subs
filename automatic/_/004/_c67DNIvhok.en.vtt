video is I have actually
installed<00:02:16.550> I've<00:02:17.550> actually<00:02:18.180> installed

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
installed I've actually installed

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.350 
installed I've actually installed
virtual<00:02:20.550> box<00:02:22.160> inside<00:02:23.160> VirtualBox

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
virtual box inside VirtualBox

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.980 
virtual box inside VirtualBox
I<00:02:24.390> ran<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.440> ISO<00:02:25.950> file<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:27.180> actually<00:02:27.570> create

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
I ran the ISO file to actually create

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.140 
I ran the ISO file to actually create
the<00:02:28.380> virtual<00:02:29.130> machine<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.580> you're<00:02:29.910> seeing

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the virtual machine that you're seeing

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.690 
the virtual machine that you're seeing
running<00:02:30.450> right<00:02:30.840> now<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.350> background<00:02:31.830> so

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
running right now in the background so

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.270 
running right now in the background so
the<00:02:33.630> aim<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:34.080> video<00:02:34.530> itself<00:02:35.010> is

the aim of this video itself is

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.770 
the aim of this video itself is
basically<00:02:35.520> just<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.850> show<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.090> how<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.690> is

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
basically just to show you how it is

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.750 
basically just to show you how it is
that<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.170> can<00:02:37.350> update<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.800> firmware<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.670> your

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
that you can update the firmware on your

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.199 
that you can update the firmware on your
SCR<00:02:39.450> 331<00:02:40.170> she<00:02:41.010> do<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.220> by<00:02:41.340> clicking<00:02:41.490> start<00:02:41.790> I

already went past and did all the update
to<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.000> because<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.900> would<00:02:45.990> actually<00:02:46.200> put

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
to this because you would actually put

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.410 
to this because you would actually put

to be updating the firmware on our

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.220 
to be updating the firmware on our
reader<00:03:06.959> we<00:03:07.950> first<00:03:08.220> have<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.610> browse<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.390> in

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
reader we first have to browse and in

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.229 
reader we first have to browse and in
this<00:03:10.380> case<00:03:10.680> we're<00:03:10.920> gonna<00:03:10.980> be<00:03:11.100> doing<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.459> 331

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
this case we're gonna be doing the 331

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.860 
this case we're gonna be doing the 331
it's<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.050> same<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.730> 531<00:03:14.730> but<00:03:15.150> we<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.690> the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
it's the same for a 531 but we have the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.150 
it's the same for a 531 but we have the
331<00:03:16.440> we're<00:03:16.800> going<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.040> hit<00:03:17.160> OK<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:19.160> mine

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
331 we're going to hit OK and mine

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.800 
331 we're going to hit OK and mine
already<00:03:20.430> popped<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:20.940> right<00:03:21.150> here<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.480> says<00:03:21.630> oh

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
already popped in right here it says oh

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.930 
already popped in right here it says oh
I<00:03:22.110> see<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.739> 331<00:03:23.340> reader<00:03:23.580> already

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
I see you have a 331 reader already

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.420 
I see you have a 331 reader already
installed<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.080> current<00:03:25.739> firmware<00:03:26.010> on<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
installed so the current firmware on the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.539 
installed so the current firmware on the
Left<00:03:26.700> column<00:03:27.019> which<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.170> right<00:03:28.350> over<00:03:28.380> here<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
Left column which is right over here the

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.250 
Left column which is right over here the
important<00:03:29.910> point<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.180> see<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.720> version

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
important point you see is the version

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.210 
important point you see is the version
firmware<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.790> have<00:03:32.910> anything<00:03:33.360> less<00:03:33.660> than

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
firmware if you have anything less than

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.910 
firmware if you have anything less than
5.25<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.750> recommend<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.810> upgraded<00:03:37.320> updated

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
5.25 I recommend you upgraded updated

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.340 
5.25 I recommend you upgraded updated
that<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.510> exactly<00:03:39.900> where<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.140> do

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
that is and this is exactly where you do

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.470 
that is and this is exactly where you do
it<00:03:40.380> at<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.310> for<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:41.580> example<00:03:41.970> I'm<00:03:42.269> going<00:03:42.420> to

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
it at so for this example I'm going to

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.150 
it at so for this example I'm going to
click<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.750> download<00:03:42.900> i'll<00:03:43.739> updated<00:03:44.100> the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
click the download i'll updated the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.770 
click the download i'll updated the
firmware<00:03:44.310> on<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:44.790> reader<00:03:45.000> many<00:03:45.299> many<00:03:45.510> times

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
firmware on this reader many many times

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.900 
firmware on this reader many many times
it<00:03:46.080> doesn't<00:03:46.470> hurt<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.830> do<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.040> again<00:03:47.280> all

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
it doesn't hurt it to do it again all

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.699 
it doesn't hurt it to do it again all
the<00:03:48.120> way<00:03:48.180> hearses<00:03:48.540> if<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.780> do<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> firmware<00:03:49.260> for

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
the way hearses if you do a firmware for

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.729 
the way hearses if you do a firmware for
a<00:03:49.769> different<00:03:50.400> reader<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.510> not<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.290> correct

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
a different reader so not the correct

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.210 
a different reader so not the correct
reader<00:03:53.810> it's<00:03:54.810> downloading<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.500> firmware<00:03:56.010> to

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
reader it's downloading the firmware to

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.380 
reader it's downloading the firmware to
the<00:03:56.489> actual<00:03:57.120> hardware<00:03:57.630> right<00:03:57.840> now<00:03:59.239> this<00:04:00.239> is

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
the actual hardware right now this is

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.820 
the actual hardware right now this is
different<00:04:00.810> than<00:04:00.930> drivers<00:04:02.330> so<00:04:03.330> we<00:04:03.959> are<00:04:04.080> done<00:04:04.260> we

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
different than drivers so we are done we

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.940 
different than drivers so we are done we
hit<00:04:05.010> close<00:04:05.690> this<00:04:06.690> reader<00:04:07.049> has<00:04:07.380> now<00:04:07.650> been

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
hit close this reader has now been
