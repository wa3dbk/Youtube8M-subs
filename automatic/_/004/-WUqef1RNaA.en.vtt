00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.680
 I was in my minecraft world 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.680
 and I found this 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.750
 recalls earlier but apparently not 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.550
 remember where and I also remember that 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.960
 if I jumped and hit him below I was going 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.960
 to give something to see 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.520
 and true it was from mario and when 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.060
 I just did not give anymore 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.680
 ok well that's great hey guys that 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.720
 such today here with you with a new 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.810
 video and today I bring you this video in the 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.370
 I've been working since last night before 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.510
 to start I want to apologize 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.790
 because he has not uploaded videos in the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.460
 last good yesterday I 'm not video and I'm not 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.520
 up recently also so this 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.450
 Today I'm going to start again with three videos 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.450
 but good this one 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.200
 ok if this mario box is all made 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.940
 we completely did this in fact 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.660
 it's even a good text a five years 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.960
 as you can see nothing I already broke it though 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.799
 this one here 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.900
 this consists everything is made without 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.900
 completely without texture boxing 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.909
 this one without mods without anything is basically 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.590
 this 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.039
 command blogs for the rest though 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.259
 we have here this and good these maps 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.719
 that I made them with a filter to measure this 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.920
 it was industrial after and all good 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.860
 We know that the latest update if 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.560
 you put a this one a map 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.020
 a frame item fills it in full 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.660
 instead of simply putting it inside the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.980
 item prime like in the xbox so good 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.540
 this is basically what I did now 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.940
 let's see what is happening here in the 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.730
 network are for it to work 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.500
 ok here what we have here is a clock 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.600
 that will repeat the network signal are 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.820
 for this command what this is 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.570
 seeing if there is a player down here 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.330
 this 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.789
 so if this is for europe that is 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.280
 player in these coordinates with a radio 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.410
 of this one so that it is fixed in a single 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.580
 block does not specify as in several 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.290
 blocks around but you have to 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.710
 detect that it is exactly below the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.400
 block 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.579
 so good 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.650
 as this is repeated every time 12 ticks 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.450
 you needed to do so with each 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.829
 this repeater when it goes off this 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.329
 it turns on and when it goes off it 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.579
 turn on then basically as if 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.230
 outside attacks you taca taca so for 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.610
 show the best I will show it with 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.610
 some pistons quickly 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.019
 as you can see when this is activated 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.160
 this is disabled and if they see it very very 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.640
 well if you can see 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.590
 but hey that 's fine ok then 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.740
 when these two commands blogs detect 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.410
 that this there is a player send a 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.160
 signal to this block and this block to this 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.660
 this dust from the rest and this dust of 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.060
 rest in what he does is here with a 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.730
 repeater intensifies the signal is this 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.780
 it's something very interesting then what 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.670
 happens here it is detected and this this 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.160
 repeater is activated by sending them a signal 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.620
 these two command blocks here says play 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.690
 in play with arroba coin or play sound 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.190
 elevated which means all this if 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.840
 I return to do this command the only thing that 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.150
 will do is make the sound of the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.390
 coin to get the sound of the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.680
 coin in this minecraft in western what 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.450
 we had to do good what 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.300
 I had to do was put a thickness pac 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.900
 where I add customized sounds only 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.230
 there are two 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.629
 this 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.660
 then what is making the noise of the 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.350
 currency 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.690
 and this gives the player who is here 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.700
 gold nuggets after he gave us 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.410
 the coins here activates a whole chain 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.660
 that gives perfect time to give us 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.720
 seven coins so although I'm going to 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.340
 do flipping over there 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.190
 and see how it is like a kind of 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.110
 circuit of the clock there goes forward and 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.490
 there it stays activated and just when 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.660
 arrives here deactivates all this mechanism 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.690
 that mechanism simply does not work 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.280
 here and what it does is activate this other 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.989
 mechanism here is the same circuit 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.109
 clock here is basically the same this 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.940
 command block that after a tick gives 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.940
 the signal to this saying that it would be the same 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.920
 it's the same as we saw there 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.370
 and good since they detected that in 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.160
 player here the only thing he does is 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.479
 and reproduce this sound that is the 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.479
 Mario when there are no coins 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:47.300
 what this does is reproduce that 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.300
 sound then yes so recapitulating 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.900
 ok then when it detects a player 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.850
 down he detects it with these two blocks 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.620
 commands which activates this signal that 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.960
 plays a sound and it gives you the 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.510
 gold nuggets and activate this clock what 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.290
 it is perfect time to that of 7 exact 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.030
 this little coins could give more but for 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.620
 that we would have to modify this could 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.020
 give less we will also have to remove 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.460
 repeaters etcetera and good it 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.010
 They will ask you to eat what you 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.600
 here it is simply to make it 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.380
 day just when it gets dark by 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.290
 example we have &amp; light 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.590
 when it detects that it is nighttime it is activated 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.560
 this signal and this is tecomÃ¡n block it 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.350
 active so wait 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.690
 if it is activated so that seems that command 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.560
 and well that's the whole tutorial today 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.450
 I hope it's good to bring more 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.080
 tutorials like this one for example here 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.640
 I have this I have the idea that when 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.470
 end the coins for example here 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.270
 three four five six seven and here 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.010
 just when this happens that makes it 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.660
 change this block 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.810
 why do you have frames that you have in this 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.810
 Map 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.320
 ok you have on this map that as yes 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.250
 may remember when we had 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.320
 I put this not so good this is what 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.330
 I'm seeing how it's done for now 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.840
 I could not do it was already a vile this 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.840
 thing again 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:24.449
 okay 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.919
 so that 's this is basically all for 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.720
 today I hope you liked it if 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.360
 they want to play this map they are going to have a 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.500
 download although I'm sure that 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.770
 nobody is going to play because he does not want 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.330
 download my maps and yes yes if they want 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.740
 perform the whole circuit what they have 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.889
 what to do is come to this part where 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.419
 see this comparator realizing itself 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.180
 what they are going to do is also 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:48.570
 just remove it and put it back 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.949
 and they 're going to start this again and if I 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.100
 I guess I'll soon make a map of 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:58.400
 adventures with this 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:59.750
 well of 456 I suppose I'm going to make a 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.940
 adventure map with all this 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.950
 circuitry would have it or superman to a 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.440
 map of supermario rather a superman 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.170
 hehehe 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.640
 but hey, yes, I hope you have 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.880
 liked if you liked please leave a 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.300
 like and subscribe is basically the box 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.300
 from mario 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.680
 and it says listen to the coordinates 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.210
 and that's all for today 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:47.889
 for me 

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:03.340
 the same 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:03.340
 friends life
