giant sea battle nobody turned in no one
grew<00:02:33.750> into<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> huge<00:02:34.860> skyscraper<00:02:35.580> size

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
grew into like a huge skyscraper size

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.540 
grew into like a huge skyscraper size
thing<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.330> got<00:02:36.420> murdered<00:02:37.020> impaled<00:02:37.800> by<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> ship

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.240 
thing and got murdered impaled by a ship
I<00:02:38.820> think<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.600> was<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.870> best<00:02:40.110> scene<00:02:40.350> yeah<00:02:40.860> but

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
I think that was the best scene yeah but

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.670 
I think that was the best scene yeah but
overall<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.790> think<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:43.320> is<00:02:43.380> going

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
overall I think this is a this is going

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.320 
overall I think this is a this is going
to<00:02:43.770> be<00:02:43.860> really<00:02:44.100> good<00:02:44.130> for<00:02:44.400> epcot<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:45.210> know

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
maybe people won't like so much that

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.120 
maybe people won't like so much that
you're<00:02:48.450> taking<00:02:48.810> away<00:02:49.050> from<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.530> real<00:02:49.890> history

huge Park is it bad when we lose

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.900 
huge Park is it bad when we lose
something<00:03:21.870> that's<00:03:22.050> maybe<00:03:22.230> more<00:03:22.910> educational

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
something that's maybe more educational

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.220 
something that's maybe more educational
like<00:03:24.150> over<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.600> Disneyland<00:03:25.020> two

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
like over in Disneyland two

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.720 
like over in Disneyland two
interventions<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:26.010> closed<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.490> that<00:03:26.550> was

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
interventions is closed and that was

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.070 
interventions is closed and that was
where<00:03:26.850> we<00:03:27.000> would<00:03:27.240> learn<00:03:27.390> about<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.780> mean

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
where we would learn about I mean

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.240 
where we would learn about I mean
heavily<00:03:28.860> sponsored<00:03:29.520> technology<00:03:31.010> but<00:03:32.010> it

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
heavily sponsored technology but it

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.950 
heavily sponsored technology but it
seemed<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.760> be<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.030> more<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.360> educational

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
seemed to be the more the educational

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.730 
seemed to be the more the educational
aspect<00:03:34.350> as<00:03:34.530> being<00:03:34.940> drawn<00:03:35.940> away<00:03:36.320> yeah<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.620> think

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
aspect as being drawn away yeah I think

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.490 
aspect as being drawn away yeah I think
