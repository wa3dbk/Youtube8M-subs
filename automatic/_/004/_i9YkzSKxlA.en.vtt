eighties and late 70s where there was a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.600 
eighties and late 70s where there was a
music<00:00:30.880> scene<00:00:31.060> that<00:00:31.090> was<00:00:31.500> first-generation

Punk and things like that and was doing
that<00:00:35.590> at<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.800> same<00:00:35.949> time<00:00:36.309> and<00:00:36.760> I<00:00:36.940> always

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
that at the same time and I always

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.910 
that at the same time and I always
wanted<00:00:37.540> painting<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.500> have<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.739> same

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
wanted painting to have the same

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.580 
wanted painting to have the same
immediacy<00:00:39.600> realness<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:40.780> danger<00:00:41.440> and

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
immediacy realness and danger and

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.799 
immediacy realness and danger and
presence<00:00:42.220> that<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:42.879> felt<00:00:43.120> in<00:00:43.239> that<00:00:43.269> music

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
presence that I felt in that music

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.630 
presence that I felt in that music
because<00:00:44.320> painting<00:00:44.860> had<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.129> come<00:00:45.309> in<00:00:45.460> some

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
because painting had to come in some

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.090 
because painting had to come in some
ways<00:00:45.790> very<00:00:45.909> very<00:00:46.300> and<00:00:46.629> it<00:00:47.320> still<00:00:47.710> is<00:00:47.860> in<00:00:48.070> some

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
ways very very and it still is in some

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.460 
ways very very and it still is in some
ways<00:00:48.430> very<00:00:48.519> safe<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.229> mannered<00:00:50.229> and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
ways very safe and mannered and

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.439 
ways very safe and mannered and
decorative<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.220> working<00:00:52.150> with<00:00:52.330> the

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
decorative and working with the

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.829 
decorative and working with the
immediacy<00:00:52.870> of<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.260> wax<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:54.489> speed<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:55.540> heat

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
immediacy of the wax the speed the heat

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.549 
immediacy of the wax the speed the heat
the<00:00:56.739> danger<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.309> it<00:00:57.460> was<00:00:58.330> very<00:00:58.870> similar<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.290> me

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
the danger of it was very similar to me

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.410 
the danger of it was very similar to me
to<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.460> same<00:01:00.670> things<00:01:00.940> that<00:01:01.000> I<00:01:01.150> was<00:01:01.180> interested

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
to the same things that I was interested

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.120 
to the same things that I was interested
in<00:01:01.750> in<00:01:02.790> painting<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:03.940> so<00:01:04.299> for<00:01:04.479> me<00:01:04.570> wax<00:01:04.869> hot<00:01:05.799> wax

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
in in painting and so for me wax hot wax

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.250 
in in painting and so for me wax hot wax
because<00:01:06.400> I<00:01:06.460> don't<00:01:06.610> paint<00:01:06.760> with<00:01:06.850> encaustic<00:01:07.260> has

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
because I don't paint with encaustic has

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
because I don't paint with encaustic has
always<00:01:08.590> been<00:01:09.040> a<00:01:09.369> link<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.720> visceral<00:01:11.650> 'no<00:01:12.040> sin

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
always been a link to a visceral 'no sin

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.340 
always been a link to a visceral 'no sin
the<00:01:12.369> act<00:01:12.549> of<00:01:12.760> painting<00:01:13.030> it's<00:01:13.420> so<00:01:14.049> specific

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
the act of painting it's so specific

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.160 
the act of painting it's so specific
that<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.859> act<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.369> painting<00:01:15.780> defines<00:01:16.780> the

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
that the act of painting defines the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.840 
that the act of painting defines the
narrative<00:01:17.710> more<00:01:18.100> than<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.369> narrative

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
narrative more than the narrative

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:27.950 
narrative more than the narrative
defining<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.630> act

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.490 

it's<00:01:28.960> gonna<00:01:29.140> take

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.430 

I<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:35.370> paint<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.000> paintings<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.570> years<00:01:36.960> you

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
I will paint on paintings for years you

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.440 
I will paint on paintings for years you
know<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.950> build<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.370> under<00:01:38.760> painting<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
know and build up under painting and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.570 
know and build up under painting and
services<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> react<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.220> point<00:01:41.490> I've

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
services to react to at this point I've

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.310 
services to react to at this point I've
been<00:01:41.640> doing<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.330> long<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.900> I<00:01:43.260> have

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
been doing it so long that I have

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
been doing it so long that I have
pattern<00:01:43.860> recognitions<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.729> know<00:01:44.790> how<00:01:45.000> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
pattern recognitions that I know how to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.640 
pattern recognitions that I know how to
react<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.050> almost<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.410> jazz

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
react to it's almost like a jazz

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.280 
react to it's almost like a jazz
musician<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.570> improvises<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:48.720> improvisers

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
musician that improvises but improvisers

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.880 
musician that improvises but improvisers
off<00:01:49.440> of<00:01:49.620> all<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.010> same<00:01:50.630> things<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.830> some

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
off of all the same things and in some

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.040 
off of all the same things and in some
ways<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.580> even<00:01:53.790> crucial<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.900> what

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
ways it's not even crucial as to what

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.430 
ways it's not even crucial as to what
the<00:01:55.200> first<00:01:55.380> two<00:01:55.710> or<00:01:55.740> three<00:01:56.330> rounds<00:01:57.330> are<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.900> can

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
the first two or three rounds are I can

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.680 
the first two or three rounds are I can
then<00:01:58.700> riff<00:01:59.700> off<00:01:59.910> of<00:01:59.940> those

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
then riff off of those

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.510 
then riff off of those
I<00:02:00.720> mean<00:02:01.710> I've<00:02:01.800> used<00:02:01.830> lacks<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.280> lot<00:02:02.430> of

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I mean I've used lacks a lot of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.980 
I mean I've used lacks a lot of
different<00:02:02.790> ways<00:02:02.880> when<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.600> know<00:02:03.720> but<00:02:03.869> it's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
different ways when I you know but it's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.820 
different ways when I you know but it's
really<00:02:04.170> about<00:02:04.350> building<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.760> history<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
really about building up a history and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.080 
really about building up a history and
compressing<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.009> expanding<00:02:08.340> time

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
compressing and expanding time

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.870 
compressing and expanding time
simultaneously<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.130> not<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.550> crucial

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
simultaneously so it's not so crucial

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.640 
simultaneously so it's not so crucial
with<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.630> first<00:02:13.250> two<00:02:14.250> or<00:02:14.580> three<00:02:15.060> rounds<00:02:16.020> are

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
with the first two or three rounds are

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.100 
with the first two or three rounds are
you<00:02:17.489> know<00:02:17.610> they<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.420> almost<00:02:18.540> be<00:02:18.720> anything

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
you know they can almost be anything

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.229 
you know they can almost be anything
that<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.260> can<00:02:19.440> react<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.970> know<00:02:21.060> I've

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
that I can react to and so you know I've

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.870 
that I can react to and so you know I've
been<00:02:21.270> working<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:21.780> paintings<00:02:22.340> over<00:02:23.340> paintings

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
been working on paintings over paintings

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.430 
been working on paintings over paintings
for<00:02:24.030> years<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:26.810> worry<00:02:27.810> about<00:02:28.020> when<00:02:28.320> I've

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
for years and I worry about when I've

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.140 
for years and I worry about when I've
got<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.709> start<00:02:28.890> from<00:02:28.980> scratch<00:02:29.670> when<00:02:29.970> they're

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
got to start from scratch when they're

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.860 
got to start from scratch when they're
clean<00:02:30.390> again

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
clean again

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.330 
clean again
because<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.470> all<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.709> history<00:02:32.070> that

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
because I have all this history that

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.860 
because I have all this history that
though<00:02:32.459> I'm<00:02:32.520> getting<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.270> chance<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.630> react<00:02:33.840> to

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
though I'm getting a chance to react to

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.250 
though I'm getting a chance to react to
and<00:02:34.470> if<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:34.890> start<00:02:35.130> from<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.400> clean<00:02:35.430> place<00:02:35.910> I

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
and if I start from a clean place I

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.330 
and if I start from a clean place I
don't<00:02:37.260> know<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.739> it's<00:02:37.890> going<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.070> have<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
don't know that it's going to have the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.220 
don't know that it's going to have the
same<00:02:38.549> kind<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:39.440> detail<00:02:40.440> nuance<00:02:41.130> time

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
same kind of detail nuance time

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.900 
same kind of detail nuance time
sequences<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.320> are<00:02:43.380> jumped<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:43.890> mean<00:02:44.130> one<00:02:44.790> of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
sequences that are jumped I mean one of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.550 
sequences that are jumped I mean one of
the<00:02:45.000> great<00:02:45.239> things<00:02:45.450> about<00:02:45.570> painting<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.350> that

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the great things about painting is that

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.280 
the great things about painting is that
it's<00:02:46.830> like<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.670> embodies<00:02:48.239> time<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.110> can

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
it's like it embodies time that you can

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.680 
it's like it embodies time that you can
have<00:02:49.440> things<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.830> happened<00:02:50.190> quickly<00:02:50.730> things

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
have things that happened quickly things

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.630 
have things that happened quickly things
that<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:51.930> happen<00:02:52.140> slowly<00:02:52.709> at<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.070> same<00:02:53.370> time

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
that can happen slowly at the same time

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.100 
that can happen slowly at the same time
you<00:02:54.180> can<00:02:54.299> have<00:02:54.420> things<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.720> happen<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.080> year

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
you can have things that happen a year

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.780 
you can have things that happen a year
ago<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.650> then<00:02:55.769> things<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.160> happen<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:56.549> top

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
ago and then things that happen on top

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.910 
ago and then things that happen on top
of<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.630> it's<00:02:57.810> really<00:02:58.049> like<00:02:58.320> time<00:02:58.650> and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
of that so it's really like time and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.720 
of that so it's really like time and
most<00:02:59.850> painters<00:03:00.230> rush<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.470> process<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.160> try

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
most painters rush that process and try

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.400 
most painters rush that process and try
to<00:03:02.790> finish<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.329> process<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.019> sequential

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
to finish that process in a sequential

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.729 
to finish that process in a sequential
manner<00:03:04.820> in<00:03:05.820> great<00:03:06.060> abstract<00:03:06.720> painting<00:03:07.200> that

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
manner in great abstract painting that

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.789 
manner in great abstract painting that
time<00:03:08.100> sequence<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.299> split<00:03:09.930> far<00:03:10.170> apart

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
time sequence is split far apart

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.949 
time sequence is split far apart
you've<00:03:11.100> got<00:03:11.250> fast<00:03:11.579> moves<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.329> slow<00:03:12.660> moves

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
you've got fast moves you get slow moves

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.449 
you've got fast moves you get slow moves
you've<00:03:13.470> got<00:03:13.620> things<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.920> were<00:03:14.070> done<00:03:14.220> three

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
you've got things that were done three

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.770 
you've got things that were done three
months<00:03:14.700> ago<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.060> top<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.360> things<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.690> were

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
months ago on top of things that were

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.410 
months ago on top of things that were
done<00:03:15.959> now<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.160> more<00:03:17.730> like<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.060> way<00:03:18.209> that

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
done now so it's more like the way that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.949 
done now so it's more like the way that
life<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.709> where<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.340> time<00:03:20.579> is<00:03:20.760> much<00:03:21.690> more

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
life is where the time is much more

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.680 
life is where the time is much more
complicated

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.490 

everything<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.750> know<00:03:26.870> about<00:03:26.959> painting<00:03:27.380> you

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
everything you know about painting you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.170 
everything you know about painting you
already<00:03:27.770> know<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:28.250> think<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:28.760> really<00:03:29.150> are

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
already know I think you really are

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.350 
already know I think you really are
painting<00:03:29.870> about<00:03:30.459> some<00:03:31.459> way<00:03:31.580> about<00:03:31.760> sex<00:03:32.180> and

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
painting about some way about sex and

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.120 
painting about some way about sex and
same<00:03:32.569> way<00:03:32.690> about<00:03:32.780> death<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.530> some<00:03:33.770> way<00:03:33.890> about

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
same way about death and some way about

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.070 
same way about death and some way about
trying<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:34.970> make<00:03:35.150> sense<00:03:35.390> out<00:03:35.630> of<00:03:35.690> those<00:03:35.900> two

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
trying to make sense out of those two

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.510 
trying to make sense out of those two
things<00:03:36.290> because<00:03:36.709> in<00:03:36.860> life<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.250> mean<00:03:37.370> that's

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
things because in life I mean that's

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.400 
things because in life I mean that's
really<00:03:37.670> what<00:03:37.760> that's<00:03:38.720> how<00:03:38.810> life<00:03:38.989> starts<00:03:39.319> and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
really what that's how life starts and

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.020 
really what that's how life starts and
that's<00:03:39.470> how<00:03:39.590> life<00:03:39.770> ends<00:03:40.099> I<00:03:40.310> don't<00:03:40.730> I<00:03:40.940> don't

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030

that's how life ends I don't I don't
mean<00:03:41.209> sex<00:03:41.720> in<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.959> way<00:03:42.050> that<00:03:42.170> people<00:03:42.200> think

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
mean sex in the way that people think

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.930 
mean sex in the way that people think
about<00:03:42.739> sex<00:03:43.220> I've<00:03:43.400> got<00:03:43.550> called<00:03:43.760> in<00:03:43.880> the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
about sex I've got called in the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.000 
about sex I've got called in the
Psilakis<00:03:44.390> but<00:03:44.810> but<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.080> mean<00:03:45.260> sex<00:03:45.560> in<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.800> fact

Psilakis but but I mean sex in the fact

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.070 
Psilakis but but I mean sex in the fact
that<00:03:46.099> there<00:03:46.340> is<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.459> in<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.150> insects<00:03:47.870> there's

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
that there is a in the insects there's

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.270 
that there is a in the insects there's
an<00:03:48.170> exchange<00:03:48.380> in<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.769> creativity<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:50.269> work<00:03:51.280> one

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
an exchange in a creativity the work one

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.620 
an exchange in a creativity the work one
thing<00:03:52.519> becomes<00:03:52.910> two<00:03:53.090> things<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.540> then

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
thing becomes two things and then

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.100 
thing becomes two things and then
becomes<00:03:53.900> one<00:03:54.140> thing<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:55.640> by<00:03:55.940> sex<00:03:56.269> I<00:03:56.420> just<00:03:56.930> mean

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
becomes one thing so by sex I just mean

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.850 
becomes one thing so by sex I just mean
that<00:03:57.140> it's<00:03:57.769> more<00:03:58.010> of<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:59.350> more<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.380> a<00:04:00.440> concept

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
that it's more of a more of a concept

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.150 
that it's more of a more of a concept
about<00:04:01.160> this<00:04:01.370> merger<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:02.769> creativity<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:04.100> a

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
about this merger and creativity of a

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.670 
about this merger and creativity of a
shared<00:04:04.400> experience<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.239> then<00:04:06.019> death<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.500> kind

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
shared experience and then death it kind

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.770 
shared experience and then death it kind
of<00:04:06.739> finishes<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.580> then<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.150> rebirth<00:04:08.600> it's

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
of finishes it and then a rebirth it's

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.720 
of finishes it and then a rebirth it's
like<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:09.140> take<00:04:09.410> from<00:04:09.620> what<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:10.310> take<00:04:10.580> from

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
like you take from what you take from

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.300 
like you take from what you take from
what<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.480> created<00:04:11.900> would<00:04:12.200> stop<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.799> then<00:04:13.190> you

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
what you created would stop and then you

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.670 
what you created would stop and then you
reinvent<00:04:14.060> what<00:04:14.239> you're<00:04:14.390> doing<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:14.900> so<00:04:15.470> you're

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
reinvent what you're doing and so you're

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.960 
reinvent what you're doing and so you're
in<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:15.830> middle<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.100> trying<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.430> mediate<00:04:16.700> those

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
in the middle of trying to mediate those

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.759 
in the middle of trying to mediate those
two<00:04:17.150> things<00:04:17.389> and<00:04:17.750> that's<00:04:18.169> what<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.470> rebirth

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
two things and that's what the rebirth

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.680 
two things and that's what the rebirth
is<00:04:18.979> the<00:04:19.130> rebirth<00:04:19.370> is<00:04:19.579> like<00:04:19.729> how<00:04:20.120> do<00:04:20.180> i<00:04:20.269> mediate

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
is the rebirth is like how do i mediate

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.320 
is the rebirth is like how do i mediate
those<00:04:20.930> two<00:04:21.169> things<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:21.739> yeah<00:04:21.889> I<00:04:22.490> still<00:04:22.729> I<00:04:22.940> mean

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
those two things so yeah I still I mean

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.360 
those two things so yeah I still I mean
it's<00:04:23.419> dramatic<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:23.960> I<00:04:24.229> do<00:04:24.710> that<00:04:24.979> because<00:04:25.130> I

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
it's dramatic and I do that because I

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.650 
it's dramatic and I do that because I
think<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:25.639> when<00:04:25.880> people<00:04:26.090> talk<00:04:26.389> about

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
think that when people talk about

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.210 
think that when people talk about
painting<00:04:26.990> academically<00:04:27.680> they<00:04:27.830> go<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.010> sleep

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
painting academically they go to sleep

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.430 
painting academically they go to sleep
but<00:04:29.180> if<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:29.330> talk<00:04:29.479> about<00:04:29.690> painting<00:04:29.930> about

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
but if you talk about painting about

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.900 
but if you talk about painting about
pending<00:04:30.740> in<00:04:30.800> terms<00:04:30.950> of<00:04:31.100> sex<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:31.640> time

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
pending in terms of sex and time

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.820 
pending in terms of sex and time
sequence<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.630> life<00:04:33.140> and<00:04:33.380> death

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
sequence and life and death

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.890 
sequence and life and death
then<00:04:34.130> people<00:04:34.340> understand<00:04:35.000> that<00:04:35.200> painting<00:04:36.200> is

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
then people understand that painting is

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.680 
then people understand that painting is
immediate<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.020> real
