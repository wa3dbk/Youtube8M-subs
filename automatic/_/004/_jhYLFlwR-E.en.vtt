why<00:00:32.430> they<00:00:32.699> are<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> way<00:00:32.970> they<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.720> again

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
why they are the way they are so again

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.540 
why they are the way they are so again
that's<00:00:34.350> kind<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.710> backstory<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.399> kind

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
that's kind of backstory and that kind

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.329 
that's kind of backstory and that kind
of<00:00:35.579> thing<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.879> mean<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.360> think<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.809> life<00:00:37.339> nobody

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
of thing I mean I think in life nobody

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:39.799 
of thing I mean I think in life nobody
is<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.730> well<00:00:39.059> thirty<00:00:39.329> people<00:00:39.449> are<00:00:39.629> truly

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
is like well thirty people are truly

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
is like well thirty people are truly
evil<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.440> even<00:00:40.949> if<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.220> a<00:00:41.250> character

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
evil so even if you have a character

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.890 
evil so even if you have a character
that<00:00:41.820> might<00:00:41.970> be<00:00:42.120> covered<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.449> that<00:00:42.480> nasty

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
that might be covered on that nasty

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.020 
that might be covered on that nasty
character<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.589> have<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.949> understand<00:00:44.579> why<00:00:44.790> they

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
character we have to understand why they

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.729 
character we have to understand why they
are<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.329> way<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.750> therefore<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.589> become

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
are that way and therefore they become

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.250 
are that way and therefore they become
believable<00:00:47.370> again<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.899> not

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
believable again it's like not not

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.689 
believable again it's like not not
having<00:00:49.530> characters<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.220> are<00:00:50.339> cliches

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
either I mean that's quite an easy thing

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.799 
either I mean that's quite an easy thing
to<00:00:53.670> an<00:00:53.969> easy<00:00:54.120> road<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> go<00:00:54.539> down

behaving the way they're the way they

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
behaving the way they're the way they
are<00:02:08.069> behaving<00:02:08.220> why<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.910> are<00:02:09.000> reacting<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450

motivation is extremely important again

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.910 
motivation is extremely important again
I<00:02:13.050> think<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.440> your<00:02:13.560> character<00:02:13.890> is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I think if your character is

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.760 
I think if your character is
well-rounded<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.670> real<00:02:15.230> unbelievable<00:02:16.260> then

well-rounded and real unbelievable then

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.890 
well-rounded and real unbelievable then
you'll<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.459> know<00:02:17.640> you'll<00:02:17.879> understand<00:02:18.510> your

reader understand and you as a writer
will<00:02:20.370> understand<00:02:20.730> why<00:02:21.239> they're<00:02:21.420> behaving

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
will understand why they're behaving

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.790 
will understand why they're behaving
that<00:02:21.750> way<00:02:21.870> why<00:02:22.140> they're<00:02:22.290> reacting<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.680> way

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
that way why they're reacting that way

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.410 
that way why they're reacting that way
why<00:02:23.099> they<00:02:23.280> did<00:02:23.489> why<00:02:23.610> they<00:02:23.760> acted<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.239> way

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
why they did why they acted that way

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.930 
why they did why they acted that way
because<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.379> way<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.830> create<00:02:26.220> character<00:02:26.849> it

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
because the way to create character it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.210 
because the way to create character it
seems<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.390> me<00:02:27.569> once<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.620> some<00:02:28.890> kind<00:02:29.129> of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
seems to me once you have some kind of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.210 
seems to me once you have some kind of
sense<00:02:29.460> of<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.970> characters<00:02:30.420> voice<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:31.220> is

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
sense of what the characters voice is is

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.070 
sense of what the characters voice is is
to<00:02:32.940> get<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.330> room

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
to get in the room

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.030 
to get in the room
or<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.680> get<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> person<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:37.080> then<00:02:37.710> and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
or to get to the person and then and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.550 
or to get to the person and then and
then<00:02:38.310> ask<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.670> questions<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.390> get<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.110> to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
then ask the questions and get in to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.640 
then ask the questions and get in to
that<00:02:40.590> scene<00:02:41.070> I'm<00:02:41.340> once<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.540> will<00:02:43.260> reveal

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
that scene I'm once and that will reveal
