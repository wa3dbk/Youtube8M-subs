 out loud practiced both in the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.160
 homes like public libraries 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.770
 allow these young people to have a 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.410
 different view of the world in which 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.670
 They come observe details will 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.530
 we do reading promotion in front of 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.579
 subject we allow you not to take those 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.810
 texts for the house so 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.720
 transmit in their everyday environment 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.320
 as long as 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.160
 well directed is reading 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.440
 we are going to have children already in the future 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.260
 young people with a very perspective 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.660
 different from the one that is being lived today 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.460
 we really do activities with so much 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.440
 for children as with parents 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.140
 we have a space to work with 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.390
 them in which parents read to 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.770
 the children in the library like them 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.670
 the texts are taken to work on them 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.670
 the house with the children 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:26.799
 me mine for that garment so that 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.799
 reading it is very important 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.810
 for many more things than atrocity said 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.530
 Mrs. Bozzo, I imagine how funny 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.530
 what would be 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.610
 He is my brother and I like to read him high 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.550
 because for him to learn and when 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.730
 is bigger has not cheated and not 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.220
 that he read well my brother does not like 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.760
 reading a lot but I will read it for 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.610
 that when he is big he has the same 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.740
 example that I give to them them 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.900
 when the eldest tells me stories 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.410
 because I do not sleep without sleeping 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:16.820
 tell me stories because my mom 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.820
 you better read with desire and read 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:25.310
 very well 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.310
