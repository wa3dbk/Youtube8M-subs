00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay so getting right to it this is how

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.559 
okay so getting right to it this is how
I<00:00:03.330> got<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.659> stats<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.790> took<00:00:05.790> off<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.270> right<00:00:06.450> as

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
I got the stats I took off and right as

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.350 
I got the stats I took off and right as
I<00:00:06.660> accelerated<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:07.890> took<00:00:08.580> off<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> break<00:00:09.120> I

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
I accelerated and it took off a break I

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.440 
I accelerated and it took off a break I
started<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.809> timer<00:00:10.080> as<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.950> hit<00:00:11.099> my<00:00:11.250> spot<00:00:11.700> as<00:00:11.940> it

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
started the timer as I hit my spot as it

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.440 
started the timer as I hit my spot as it
was<00:00:12.540> 10<00:00:12.780> 17<00:00:13.139> right<00:00:13.469> there<00:00:13.880> that<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.030> when<00:00:15.179> i<00:00:15.210> got

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
was 10 17 right there that is when i got

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.290 
was 10 17 right there that is when i got
my<00:00:15.480> takeoff<00:00:15.960> time<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:17.369> then<00:00:17.640> i<00:00:17.670> restarted<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
my takeoff time and then i restarted the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.710 
my takeoff time and then i restarted the
timer<00:00:18.570> again<00:00:19.039> and<00:00:21.020> i<00:00:22.340> kept<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.519> until<00:00:23.939> i

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
timer again and i kept it going until i

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.300 
timer again and i kept it going until i
get<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> top<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.859> takes<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
get up to the top here this takes a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.290 
get up to the top here this takes a
while<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:28.910> just<00:00:29.910> click<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
while but you can just click and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.780 
while but you can just click and
fast-forward<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> 245<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.610> when

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
fast-forward to 245 because that is when

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.080 
fast-forward to 245 because that is when
it<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.300> at<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.630> end<00:00:34.969> and<00:00:37.969> basically<00:00:38.969> i

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
it is about at the end and basically i

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.470 
it is about at the end and basically i
end<00:00:39.390> up<00:00:39.570> getting<00:00:40.640> two<00:00:41.640> minutes<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.030> 43

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
end up getting two minutes and 43

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.450 
end up getting two minutes and 43
seconds<00:00:42.960> i'm<00:00:43.140> pretty<00:00:43.559> sure<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.040> I'll<00:00:44.190> fast

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
seconds i'm pretty sure here I'll fast

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.650 
seconds i'm pretty sure here I'll fast
forward<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:44.969> end<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.329> figure<00:00:45.840> out<00:00:47.660> yeah

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
forward to the end and figure out yeah

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
forward to the end and figure out yeah
it<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:48.840> two<00:00:49.020> minutes<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.379> 43<00:00:49.800> seconds<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.430> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it was two minutes and 43 seconds so I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.060 
it was two minutes and 43 seconds so I
end<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:50.789> taking<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.270> number<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.870> i<00:00:52.770> ended<00:00:52.980> up

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
end up taking that number and i ended up

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.180 
end up taking that number and i ended up
climbing<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:53.719> 4,000<00:00:54.719> meters<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> i<00:00:55.860> did<00:00:56.039> all

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
climbing up 4,000 meters and i did all

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.840 
climbing up 4,000 meters and i did all
these<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.550> Sicily<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:58.609> actually<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> vast

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
these on Sicily and actually the vast

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.340 
these on Sicily and actually the vast
majority<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.270> did<00:01:00.449> something<00:01:00.660> test<00:01:00.989> flight<00:01:01.199> but

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
majority I did something test flight but

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
majority I did something test flight but
I<00:01:01.379> always<00:01:01.739> climbed<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.370> 4,000<00:01:03.059> meters<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.539> I

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
I always climbed up 4,000 meters and I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.050 
I always climbed up 4,000 meters and I
ended<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.799> taking<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> number<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> time

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
ended up taking the number of the time

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.539 
ended up taking the number of the time
that<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.360> took<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> took

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
that it took to get up there so I took

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.020 
that it took to get up there so I took
each<00:01:08.549> second<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.200> minute<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.030> 63

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
each second so there is a minute and 63

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.170 
each second so there is a minute and 63
seconds<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:13.040> 163<00:01:14.040> seconds<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> two

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
seconds or 163 seconds for the two

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.170 
seconds or 163 seconds for the two
minutes<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.540> 43<00:01:15.960> seconds<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:17.250> divided

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
minutes and 43 seconds and I divided

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.810 
minutes and 43 seconds and I divided
four<00:01:18.390> thousand<00:01:18.810> by<00:01:18.900> 163<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.040> get<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.400> meters

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
four thousand by 163 to get the meters

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.420 
four thousand by 163 to get the meters
per<00:01:21.000> second<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.520> then

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
per second and then

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.670 
per second and then
if<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:25.030> guys<00:01:25.150> want<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.450> fast<00:01:25.720> forward<00:01:25.840> after

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
if you guys want to fast forward after

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.120 
if you guys want to fast forward after
this<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:28.420> 3<00:01:28.780> 15<00:01:28.960> you'll<00:01:29.590> be<00:01:29.680> able<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.890> see

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
this to about 3 15 you'll be able to see

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.980 
this to about 3 15 you'll be able to see
me<00:01:30.460> explain<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.060> other<00:01:31.180> things<00:01:31.510> because<00:01:31.750> it

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
me explain the other things because it

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.660 
me explain the other things because it
does<00:01:32.110> take<00:01:32.320> quite<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.650> long<00:01:32.770> time<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.370> do<00:01:33.490> each

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
does take quite a long time to do each

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.560 
does take quite a long time to do each
one<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:33.910> these<00:01:34.060> things<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.460> i'll<00:01:36.910> pick<00:01:37.390> up

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
one of these things but i'll pick up

00:01:37.570 --> 00:02:54.360 
one of these things but i'll pick up
right<00:01:37.780> there

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.970 

so<00:02:54.940> at<00:02:55.420> this<00:02:55.690> point<00:02:55.930> I'm<00:02:56.140> trying<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.590> get<00:02:56.709> the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
so at this point I'm trying to get the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.190 
so at this point I'm trying to get the
cruising<00:02:57.670> time<00:02:57.909> and<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.480> cruising<00:02:58.840> time<00:02:59.019> at

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
cruising time and the cruising time at

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.330 
cruising time and the cruising time at
4,000<00:02:59.890> meters<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.370> tried<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.790> keep<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.150> within<00:03:01.420> a

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
4,000 meters I tried to keep it within a

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.899 
4,000 meters I tried to keep it within a
50-meter<00:03:03.930> window<00:03:04.930> plus<00:03:05.620> or<00:03:05.799> minus<00:03:06.159> and<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:06.700> use

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
50-meter window plus or minus and I use

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.899 
50-meter window plus or minus and I use
the<00:03:07.090> pitch<00:03:07.269> angle<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.830> just<00:03:09.489> I'm<00:03:09.670> going<00:03:09.819> to

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
the pitch angle and just I'm going to

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.490 
the pitch angle and just I'm going to
reiterate<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.360> here<00:03:10.780> as<00:03:10.930> opposed<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.379> before

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
reiterate that here as opposed to before

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500 
reiterate that here as opposed to before
I<00:03:11.739> use<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.040> pitch<00:03:12.220> angle<00:03:12.400> angle<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:13.090> climb<00:03:13.329> it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
I use the pitch angle angle to climb it

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.319 
I use the pitch angle angle to climb it
was<00:03:13.599> a<00:03:13.629> 15<00:03:14.019> degree<00:03:14.110> pitch<00:03:14.470> angle<00:03:15.329> just

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
was a 15 degree pitch angle just

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.850 
was a 15 degree pitch angle just
throwing<00:03:16.629> this<00:03:16.750> video<00:03:17.019> together<00:03:17.379> just<00:03:17.769> to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
throwing this video together just to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.559 
throwing this video together just to
kind<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.280> show<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.489> guys<00:03:18.670> what<00:03:18.909> I<00:03:18.940> did<00:03:19.209> for<00:03:19.480> all

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
kind of show you guys what I did for all

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.059 
kind of show you guys what I did for all
this<00:03:19.750> I'm<00:03:19.900> really<00:03:20.230> flippin<00:03:20.590> tired<00:03:20.769> at<00:03:20.950> this

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
this I'm really flippin tired at this

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.920 
this I'm really flippin tired at this
point<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:23.140> i<00:03:23.230> got<00:03:23.379> 601<00:03:24.040> km/h<00:03:24.819> so<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:25.599> classed

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
point and i got 601 km/h so I classed

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.410 
point and i got 601 km/h so I classed
this<00:03:26.230> as<00:03:26.440> whatever<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.579> top<00:03:27.760> speed<00:03:28.060> was<00:03:28.269> I

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
this as whatever the top speed was I

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.780 
this as whatever the top speed was I
tried<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.930> put<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.349> at<00:03:29.560> 25<00:03:30.069> kilometers<00:03:30.099> below

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
tried to put it at 25 kilometers below

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.880 
tried to put it at 25 kilometers below
that<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.359> would<00:03:31.450> be<00:03:31.569> my<00:03:31.720> turns<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.349> turn

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
that and that would be my turns to turn

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.020 
that and that would be my turns to turn
time<00:03:33.250> speed<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.720> at<00:03:35.019> this<00:03:35.440> point<00:03:36.250> I'm<00:03:36.609> doing<00:03:36.700> my

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
time speed so at this point I'm doing my

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.349 
time speed so at this point I'm doing my
turn<00:03:37.560> my<00:03:38.560> turn<00:03:38.590> time<00:03:39.040> speed<00:03:39.310> starts<00:03:39.730> at<00:03:39.849> 25

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
turn my turn time speed starts at 25

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.110 
turn my turn time speed starts at 25
kilometers<00:03:40.780> an<00:03:41.319> hour<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.489> four<00:03:42.700> thousand

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
kilometers an hour on the four thousand

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.789 
kilometers an hour on the four thousand
meter<00:03:43.349> test<00:03:45.720> slower<00:03:46.720> than<00:03:46.900> its<00:03:47.049> max<00:03:47.290> Kruse

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
meter test slower than its max Kruse

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.149 
meter test slower than its max Kruse
speed<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.190> i<00:03:48.250> got<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:49.500> this<00:03:50.500> one<00:03:50.709> turns<00:03:50.980> out

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
speed that i got and this one turns out

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.180 
speed that i got and this one turns out
to<00:03:51.220> be<00:03:51.400> 20<00:03:51.970> as<00:03:52.890> i<00:03:53.890> get<00:03:54.040> back<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.730> base<00:03:54.909> 20.3

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
to be 20 as i get back to the base 20.3

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.460 
to be 20 as i get back to the base 20.3
and<00:03:57.190> then<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.400> got<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.700> max<00:03:57.970> dive<00:03:58.239> speed<00:03:58.690> at<00:03:59.410> a

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
and then I got the max dive speed at a

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.559 
and then I got the max dive speed at a
negative<00:04:00.310> 40<00:04:00.609> degree<00:04:00.910> pitch<00:04:01.810> angle<00:04:02.669> from

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
negative 40 degree pitch angle from

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.670 
negative 40 degree pitch angle from
4000<00:04:06.569> meters<00:04:06.780> until<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.170> plane<00:04:07.349> started

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
4000 meters until the plane started

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.929 
4000 meters until the plane started
shaking<00:04:08.069> like<00:04:08.189> that<00:04:08.459> this<00:04:08.640> one<00:04:08.819> was<00:04:09.109> 865<00:04:10.939> km/h

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
shaking like that this one was 865 km/h

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.170 
shaking like that this one was 865 km/h
and<00:04:12.269> then<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.780> got<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.319> cruise<00:04:14.189> speed<00:04:14.519> for

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
and then I got the cruise speed for

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.159 
and then I got the cruise speed for
level<00:04:15.659> flight<00:04:15.840> at<00:04:16.380> 500<00:04:17.100> meters<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.750> then<00:04:18.750> the

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
level flight at 500 meters and then the

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.529 
level flight at 500 meters and then the
planes<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.769> then<00:04:19.949> took<00:04:20.190> my<00:04:20.250> turn<00:04:20.759> time<00:04:21.060> at

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
planes that I then took my turn time at

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.529 
planes that I then took my turn time at
the<00:04:21.750> max<00:04:21.959> speed<00:04:22.139> from<00:04:22.560> 500<00:04:23.039> meters<00:04:23.310> minus<00:04:24.210> jets

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
the max speed from 500 meters minus jets

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.150 
the max speed from 500 meters minus jets
because<00:04:25.350> they<00:04:25.470> would<00:04:25.620> break<00:04:25.770> their<00:04:25.949> wings

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
because they would break their wings

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.010 
because they would break their wings
otherwise<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.910> I've<00:04:27.389> just<00:04:27.419> made<00:04:27.780> that

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
otherwise and I've just made that

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.909 
otherwise and I've just made that
maximum<00:04:28.800> turn<00:04:29.160> as<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:30.570> go<00:04:30.750> right<00:04:30.990> here<00:04:33.800> so<00:04:34.800> you

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
maximum turn as I go right here so you

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.620 
maximum turn as I go right here so you
all<00:04:35.160> understand<00:04:35.759> a<00:04:36.060> little<00:04:36.210> bit<00:04:36.360> better<00:04:36.509> on

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
all understand a little bit better on

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.379 
all understand a little bit better on
how<00:04:36.960> well<00:04:37.229> each<00:04:37.440> plane<00:04:37.979> handles<00:04:38.789> at<00:04:39.000> different

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
how well each plane handles at different

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.390 
how well each plane handles at different
altitudes<00:04:41.900> how<00:04:42.900> fast<00:04:43.229> it<00:04:43.470> goes<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:44.009> things<00:04:44.250> of

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
altitudes how fast it goes and things of

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.580 
altitudes how fast it goes and things of
that<00:04:44.430> nature<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:45.150> this<00:04:45.419> is<00:04:45.539> all<00:04:45.690> relative<00:04:45.930> but

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
that nature and this is all relative but

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.370 
that nature and this is all relative but
that's<00:04:47.580> basically<00:04:47.789> what<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.300> did<00:04:48.419> I<00:04:48.870> some<00:04:49.349> of

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
that's basically what I did I some of

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.420 
that's basically what I did I some of
the<00:04:49.470> planes<00:04:49.710> did<00:04:50.099> have<00:04:52.099> issues<00:04:53.099> where<00:04:53.280> I<00:04:53.310> would

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
the planes did have issues where I would

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.070 
the planes did have issues where I would
get<00:04:53.550> shot<00:04:53.759> down<00:04:53.789> by<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.509> I<00:04:54.570> had<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.810> do<00:04:54.930> this

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
get shot down by a and I had to do this

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.689 
get shot down by a and I had to do this
multiple<00:04:55.410> time<00:04:55.650> so<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:55.949> took<00:04:56.099> me<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.310> long

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
multiple time so this took me a long

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:02.529 
multiple time so this took me a long
long<00:04:57.090> long<00:04:57.150> long<00:04:57.479> time<00:04:59.030> the<00:05:00.030> vests<00:05:00.389> I<00:05:00.539> think<00:05:00.840> I

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
long long long time the vests I think I

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.210 
long long long time the vests I think I
think<00:05:03.539> I<00:05:03.630> had<00:05:03.840> two<00:05:04.229> three<00:05:04.470> planes<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:04.860> didn't

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
think I had two three planes that didn't

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.149 
think I had two three planes that didn't
have<00:05:05.370> everything<00:05:06.740> maxed<00:05:07.740> out<00:05:08.039> as<00:05:08.280> far<00:05:09.030> as<00:05:10.159> the

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
have everything maxed out as far as the

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.300 
have everything maxed out as far as the
air<00:05:12.060> resistance<00:05:12.389> and<00:05:12.780> things<00:05:12.990> this<00:05:13.860> is<00:05:14.010> one<00:05:14.190> of

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
air resistance and things this is one of

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.260 
air resistance and things this is one of
them<00:05:15.949> but<00:05:16.949> yeah<00:05:17.070> that<00:05:17.340> I<00:05:17.370> did<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.639> lot<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.120> work

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
them but yeah that I did a lot of work

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.730 
them but yeah that I did a lot of work
on<00:05:18.449> this<00:05:18.599> I<00:05:18.750> hope<00:05:18.930> it<00:05:19.080> works<00:05:19.229> out<00:05:19.380> I'm<00:05:19.560> going<00:05:19.650> to

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
on this I hope it works out I'm going to

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.680 
on this I hope it works out I'm going to
keep<00:05:19.889> updating<00:05:20.400> daily<00:05:21.180> like<00:05:21.389> one<00:05:21.570> or<00:05:21.659> two

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
keep updating daily like one or two

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.450 
keep updating daily like one or two
flight<00:05:22.169> models<00:05:22.500> one<00:05:22.740> one<00:05:23.070> two<00:05:23.220> or<00:05:23.310> three

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
flight models one one two or three

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.310 
flight models one one two or three
flight<00:05:23.699> models<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:24.240> whenever<00:05:24.419> flight<00:05:25.169> model

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
flight models and whenever flight model

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.740 
flight models and whenever flight model
changes<00:05:25.970> i<00:05:26.970> will<00:05:27.389> do<00:05:27.659> my<00:05:27.690> best<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.139> update<00:05:28.530> that

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
changes i will do my best to update that

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.570 
changes i will do my best to update that
