over there only a 7-foot door really
tight<00:00:28.830> fit<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.689> I<00:00:30.689> still<00:00:30.929> managed<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> build

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
tight fit and I still managed to build

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.260 
tight fit and I still managed to build
this<00:00:31.740> thing<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.399> flipped<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.180> in

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
this thing so like it flipped it like in

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.830 
this thing so like it flipped it like in
the<00:00:33.329> car<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.410> made<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
the car so it's just made out of a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.709 
the car so it's just made out of a
double<00:00:36.840> 2<00:00:36.930> by<00:00:37.079> 6<00:00:37.320> header<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.399> four<00:00:39.360> by<00:00:39.480> fours

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
double 2 by 6 header and four by fours

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.190 
double 2 by 6 header and four by fours
and<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.890> some<00:00:41.160> important<00:00:41.940> bracing<00:00:42.420> around

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
and just some important bracing around

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.310 
and just some important bracing around
and<00:00:44.390> because<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.510> my<00:00:45.600> ceiling<00:00:46.079> height

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and because of my ceiling height

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.569 
and because of my ceiling height
problems<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> fact<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
problems and the fact that the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
problems and the fact that the
come-alongs<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.360> used<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:48.989> fairly<00:00:49.320> long

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
come-alongs that I used are fairly long

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.250 
come-alongs that I used are fairly long
they're<00:00:50.100> normal<00:00:50.399> come<00:00:50.550> along<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.510> needed

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
they're normal come along but I needed

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.810 
they're normal come along but I needed
to<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.590> hooks<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.980> higher<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> sort<00:00:53.760> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
to get the hooks up higher so I sort of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.920 
to get the hooks up higher so I sort of
fabricated<00:00:54.390> some<00:00:54.510> brackets<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.230> above<00:00:55.610> that

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
fabricated some brackets up above that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.170 
fabricated some brackets up above that
are<00:00:57.930> strong<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:59.120> I<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:01.109> hook<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:02.789> bumpers

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
are strong and I can hook up the bumpers

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.149 
are strong and I can hook up the bumpers
you<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.480> I've<00:01:03.629> sacrificed<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.619> set<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.860> bumpers

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you see I've sacrificed a set of bumpers

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.240 
you see I've sacrificed a set of bumpers
to<00:01:05.930> put<00:01:06.930> some<00:01:07.140> bolts<00:01:07.439> through<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> mounting

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
to put some bolts through the mounting

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
to put some bolts through the mounting
points<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> use<00:01:09.750> them<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.820> pull<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> car

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
points and use them to pull on the car

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
points and use them to pull on the car
so<00:01:12.600> right<00:01:13.020> now<00:01:13.170> I've<00:01:13.290> got<00:01:13.470> both<00:01:13.590> come-alongs

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
so right now I've got both come-alongs

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.660 
so right now I've got both come-alongs
attached<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.530> side<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
attached to the one side just as and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.030 
attached to the one side just as and
then<00:01:17.759> I've<00:01:17.880> got<00:01:18.090> an<00:01:18.210> extra<00:01:18.509> safety<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.650> orange

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
then I've got an extra safety in orange

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.420 
then I've got an extra safety in orange
there<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> protect<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
there just to protect it so you know it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.899 
there just to protect it so you know it
works

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
works

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.140 
works
cars<00:01:24.799> absolutely<00:01:25.799> stable<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.850> see

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
cars absolutely stable I can see

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.450 
cars absolutely stable I can see
everything<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.689> need<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.140> now<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.310> can

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
everything I need to see now and I can

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.929 
everything I need to see now and I can
get<00:01:29.640> at<00:01:29.820> scraping<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.140> endless<00:01:31.939> seam

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
get at scraping all this endless seam

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.120 
get at scraping all this endless seam
sealer<00:01:33.270> off<00:01:33.420> under<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:36.470> I'll<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
sealer off under here and I'll get to it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.740 
sealer off under here and I'll get to it
basically<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.500> it's<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:41.270> big<00:01:42.270> relief<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.689> have

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
basically so it's a big relief to have

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.600 
basically so it's a big relief to have
this<00:01:42.990> done<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> had<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> few<00:01:43.710> false<00:01:44.009> starts<00:01:44.100> just

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
this done I had a few false starts just

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.249 
this done I had a few false starts just
because<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> tight<00:01:45.299> fit<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
because of the tight fit in here and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.639 
because of the tight fit in here and
when<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> started<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.909> lift<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.020> car<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> was

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
when I started to lift the car I was

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.620 
when I started to lift the car I was
noticing<00:01:50.220> things<00:01:50.520> moving<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.270> had<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> put

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
noticing things moving and I had to put

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.030 
noticing things moving and I had to put
extra<00:01:51.840> bracing<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.729> but<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:53.850> she's<00:01:54.060> good<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
extra bracing in but now she's good and

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.929 
extra bracing in but now she's good and
you<00:01:56.040> know<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.610> basically<00:01:57.200> no<00:01:58.200> room<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.939> spare

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
you know like basically no room to spare

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.020 
you know like basically no room to spare
given<00:02:00.869> how<00:02:00.990> small<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.590> garage<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.850> flip

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
given how small the garage so I can flip

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.270 
given how small the garage so I can flip
it<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.439> only<00:02:04.439> with<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> book<00:02:04.860> two<00:02:05.009> or<00:02:05.100> three

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it but only with the book two or three

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.359 
it but only with the book two or three
inches<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.180> bottom<00:02:06.540> which<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.250> more<00:02:08.250> than

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
inches on the bottom which is more than

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.920 
inches on the bottom which is more than
enough<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.420> enough<00:02:09.720> all<00:02:10.709> right
