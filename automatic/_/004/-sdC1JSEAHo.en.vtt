could<00:04:43.970> put<00:04:44.690> this<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:45.110> good<00:04:45.140> use<00:04:45.500> but<00:04:45.830> then

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
could put this to good use but then

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.560 
could put this to good use but then
again<00:04:46.100> some<00:04:46.430> of<00:04:46.460> you<00:04:46.610> all<00:04:46.790> might<00:04:47.000> just<00:04:47.270> be<00:04:47.390> like

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570
