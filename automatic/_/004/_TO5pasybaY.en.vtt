 and simultaneously 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.450
 the sample of the artist professor arminda a short of the faculty of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.930
 humanities but that soul rosary city with sculptures and throws nothing 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.740
 less than the divine comedy 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.940
 the great work of somo poet dante alighieri and also 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.910

 January were today the president of the association dante alighieri 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.140
 but it has a very long trajectory, it has knowledge, I think 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.219
 this species one of the openings that takes place in the community p 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.090
 I think it's unprecedented, not because 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.510
 this during the time 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.759
 the Italian cast its positioning and others 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.000
 he is offering a general level openness with his culture with his tongue 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.590
 abstention continues, art always arrives where only that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.620
 apart from that is the signal be 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.630

 the 1 general of italy 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.109
