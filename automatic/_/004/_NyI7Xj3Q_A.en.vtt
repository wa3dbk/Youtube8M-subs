00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello to everyone this is katya today 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.780
 I will do a little review on my 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.259
 recent purchases it will be bronzing 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.320
 powder he is a warm care balm for 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.730
 lips too from dior and in comparison with the base 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.890
 there are literally several clinics 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.769
 the products are just so small 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.349
 updating my collection of dekorativka 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 I had a gift just recently 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.910
 a week ago they gave me this 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.620
 I wanted her wildly in this 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.760
 shade is the most such 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.680
 light shade 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.840
 About such a case nothing special 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.879
 the fact is that insanely insanely beautiful 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.260
 packaging 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.329
 a long time I did not lay 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.180
 I didn't even have my purse 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.940
 mirrors something that however equalizes the same don and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.850
 all i wanted was insanely beautiful 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.920
 to carry with me such a beautiful one 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.170
 powder box she does not snap here 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.590
 nothing like this is just a magnet 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.600
 very very easy to watch and yes and behold 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.820
 so here it looks 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.340
 what not big mosaic in shade 003 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.159
 for me it is the lightest shade of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.729
 at least it seemed so to me 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.070
 posing Kūdra that shine in 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:32.610
 In general, you can somehow even make the contour 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.810
 There was this powder with a brush tassel me 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.869
 I liked everything in such a case 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.080
 small but very very elastic that is 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.560
 You can easily draw a contour 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.360
 barely barely touching 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.759
 she does not carry powder for her whole face for her 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.800
 this is a bronzing corner 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.550
 it's it's a good circuit 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.300
 draws what I want to tell me she 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.080
 liked 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:07.920
 shine she gives a little bit like a bronzer she 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.250
 perfect but how to draw the lip contour 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.340
 your muscles don't seem like it are a little bit 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.440
 yellow then in general if you drag it 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:22.530
 a shelter with a great desire can 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:28.140
 even to powder a little that is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:31.260
 such dark letters are lighter I do not 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.870
 I know there will not be anything told but 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.090
 no shine like gorgeous 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.459
 meteorites by the way about the meteorite and 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.019
 finally i 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.660
 cut them completely now they 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.390
 absolutely perfectly applied them 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.850
 very much can even sponzhikom 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.660
 maybe we only have them you buy them 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.380
 need to shake there literally there about the corner 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.590
 the walls beat them there and then they will 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.560
 the fact is that when I just bought them 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.430
 I could not understand what they actually do not 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.370
 ordinariness 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.470
 and why such delight cause as 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.630
 then when they tried to carry on a brush 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.550
 or should they can absolutely not 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.750
 recruited on the face could not see anything 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.420
 and only after perhaps six months how much 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.150
 I have them finally they are ok 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.400
 face because they themselves have already revealed 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.780
 and there is already such a glow on the face 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.880
 in general, those who want to buy themselves 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.060
 I advise everyone to diority first and 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.150
 shake well shatter and then 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.780
 they will look great on your face 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.440
 Yes, but actually what about powder wanted 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.460
 say that as a bronzer she is good as 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.600
 contouring it seems to me that she 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.450
 slightly yellowish 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.850
 yes, but here in pure purses to drag me 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.180
 really like it though we don’t have enough 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:01.230
 very light weight probably needed 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.140
 still say 10 grams in it but such things 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.100
 I have been stored for a very, very long time. 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.650
 I thought the next five years to you . me 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.530
 lie a purse or in a beautician if 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.950
 no one passes her next product 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.299
 it is like this lip balm in winter 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:27.030
 I started some time 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:28.620
 frenzy care 7 and 2 grams i 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.710
 I think on a dozen of such pink 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:36.480
 colors smell like a rose too 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.070
 I could not use that is I 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.680
 tried to put sent with what 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.140
 but it was given very badly and 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.480
 I had to rub my lips somehow 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.490
 Now it is very easy to apply. 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:52.200
 tender lips restores fills but 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.360
 I still think that is not such a healing 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.340
 effect like from carmex karmak themselves never 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.770
 there was no but pause you I understand that everything 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.540
 yet it is slightly inferior although the price 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.040
 Of course this thing is not cheap but also with 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.320
 carry bags 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.040
 I have it for a long time 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:14.710
 will still serve me at least 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:17.450
 I hope it smells nice unlike 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.550
 hygienic lipstick from clinics is mine 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.720
 disappointing tearing of the year 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.400
 century decryption 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.690
 very beautiful it looks but 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.370
 look how quickly I ran out 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.160
 literally 1 10 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:35.600
 used this lipstick already half 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:38.690
 no, that is, look here one two three 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.810
 and I only come out here so much left 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.610
 for 10 use very, very fast 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.240
 spent I regret that I did not take immediately 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.240
 dior 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.090
 how does she smell she the fact is that without 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.700
 fragrances but from the fact that she is without a sweetheart on 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.480
 worse, it just smells like that 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:02.120
 natural rancid olive oil 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.190
 on the lips it feels worse 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.310
 as if some kind of oil product as you like 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.350
 express bloggers but I'm right again 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.530
 natural but still like butter 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:16.570
 rancid on lips and mouth and all that 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.830
 ugly absolutely lies on the lips 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.350
 does not give a shade to any 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.370
 slight oily such effect it 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:28.450
 need to be applied on the lips and going beyond 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:32.680
 contour a little bit because it moistens 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:35.830
 villus sinks i.e. absolutely 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.180
 very very good there 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.130
 intense intensive 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:45.190
 recovery not even just become 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:49.070
 well, I can't say anything better 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:53.030
 for the price so surely this balm is a little bit 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:56.600
 will bring in just a little shine attached 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.700
 no shade and source from 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:03.260
 tell very nicely and then he has 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:05.120
 lays down lipstick almost perfect here 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.850
 such a small review I don't know 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.440
 maybe this video I glue with 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:13.310
 some other for you to be 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.710
 more interesting it was all big 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.410
 thank 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.410
 for watching everyone have a nice day everyone bye
