00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.930
 what's up with the embers, well, we're 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.800
 here with am and the new champion 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.700
 and good but 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.700
 you do not catch me 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.660
 Well, this girl is already fed up but 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.120
 to see is a 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.200
 because they have sold us rivers so they 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.750
 we saw yesterday in 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.460
 well they are news of the forum of 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.130
 default of gens 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.790
 that it was going to be his for good still 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.290
 support but good you can see when 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.370
 let's see the skills that can go 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.680
 so much power to medium because the truth that 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.500
 is very very very well I liked it 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.210
 much this champion a lot or this cai 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.739
 fixed 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.629
 let's see a little bit of the skills 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.910
 well let's see first the passive 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.400
 best 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.510
 is that every time I make a 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.510
 for a shearing to one of his allies 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.240
 gains movement speed one with 25 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.490
 Now it seems to me that with the levels 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.430
 is increasing 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.170
 we see the Cuba that what they do is 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.220
 like he puts them in a bubble and the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.740
 climb up 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.240
 Look, I just did the aunt is that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.490
 is doing everything like here of good 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.930
 Perate roll 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.359
 so good w 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.750
 to which he also does magical damage is worth and 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:34.300
 est unites at the same time that the lorito is 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.110
 skill is very good 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.260
 w the w as you can see I give this 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.530
 champion and gives me back life, I'll make you 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.210
 magical damage and it brings me back to life and he 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.720
 he just did it if there was more 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.720
 champions here around bounce vale 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.310
 om 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.560
 come her 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.110
 this is the small milk fact like to 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.380
 watch 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.750
 I explain 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.750
 the w slogans of the label 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:18.480
 If I do it once to a friend or a 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.300
 1 on average the last and heavy male 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.970
 if I have done it to an ally or if I have 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.090
 done to an enemy can not we go 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.080
 jump more than three times more than three 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.080
 goals worth 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.820
 well what nightmare of the day then the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.330
 It gives us movement speeds 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.330
 OK 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.099
 and real in chalk with our our 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.720
 basic attacks will do magic damage and 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.900
 Slow down suit very well too 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.840
 this is skill and then the last one 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.890
 look at what range has or is 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.410
 one pass and more here in aran do not 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.230
 get all 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.720
 what he does is study and do 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.790
 magic damage is also worth 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:22.909
 I think I'm going to come to life 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:27.219
 because they last longer the more 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.219
 far be it is you 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.500
 the slowdown let's see here do not you 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.500
 I do not 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.420
 is how it is about if it has bounced if 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.250
 there would be champions nearby 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.430
 bounced back 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.819
 this champion is very good this fixed cai 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.110
 prix fixe I liked it much better 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.100
 tell you too how good 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.330
 the boots are going to change 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.010
 there will be a third degree not one and two 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.140
 the store I have seen has changed all the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.330
 interface so good this afternoon 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.980

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.960

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.550
