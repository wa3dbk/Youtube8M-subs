bad<00:02:37.460> weather<00:02:37.670> all<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.030> time<00:02:38.210> but<00:02:38.510> we<00:02:38.660> can't

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
bad weather all the time but we can't

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.780 
bad weather all the time but we can't
control<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.410> weather<00:02:39.500> patterns<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:40.550> there

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
control the weather patterns so there

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.760 
control the weather patterns so there
will<00:02:40.940> be<00:02:41.000> inversions<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.840> there<00:02:42.350> have<00:02:42.530> been

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
will be inversions and there have been

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.690 
will be inversions and there have been
since<00:02:43.270> forever<00:02:44.500> but<00:02:45.500> we<00:02:45.740> can<00:02:46.010> control<00:02:46.370> what

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
since forever but we can control what

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.190 
since forever but we can control what

goes into the air during those

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.470 
goes into the air during those
inversions<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:49.100> comes<00:02:49.340> from<00:02:49.670> three<00:02:50.090> primary

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
inversions it comes from three primary

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.510 
inversions it comes from three primary

things the state is taking unprecedented

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.699 
things the state is taking unprecedented
actions<00:03:08.300> right<00:03:08.600> now<00:03:08.660> we're<00:03:09.110> developing<00:03:09.590> a

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
actions right now we're developing a

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.100 
actions right now we're developing a
whole<00:03:09.950> new<00:03:10.340> set<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.120> standards<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.989> we've

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
whole new set of standards and we've

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.320 
whole new set of standards and we've
imposed<00:03:12.470> strict<00:03:13.160> new<00:03:13.370> regulations<00:03:14.060> on

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
imposed strict new regulations on

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.810 
imposed strict new regulations on
industry<00:03:14.989> that<00:03:15.739> are<00:03:15.769> going<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.040> reduce<00:03:16.310> their

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
industry that are going to reduce their

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.110 
industry that are going to reduce their
emissions<00:03:16.970> by<00:03:17.720> thousands<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.530> tons<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:19.760> then

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
emissions by thousands of tons and then

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.850 
emissions by thousands of tons and then
we've<00:03:20.330> got<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.720> look<00:03:20.870> at<00:03:21.019> how<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.230> reduce

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
we've got to look at how we reduce

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.860 
we've got to look at how we reduce
vehicular<00:03:22.310> emissions<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.600> comes<00:03:23.780> from

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
vehicular emissions and that comes from

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.360 
vehicular emissions and that comes from
giving<00:03:24.230> people<00:03:24.380> good<00:03:24.650> alternatives<00:03:25.190> we've

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
giving people good alternatives we've

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.280 
giving people good alternatives we've
got<00:03:25.550> an<00:03:25.700> incredible<00:03:26.209> rail<00:03:26.420> system<00:03:26.930> here<00:03:27.170> we've

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
got an incredible rail system here we've

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.620 
got an incredible rail system here we've
got<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.560> flush<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.130> out<00:03:28.190> with<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.120> better<00:03:29.360> bus

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
got to flush that out with a better bus

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.030
