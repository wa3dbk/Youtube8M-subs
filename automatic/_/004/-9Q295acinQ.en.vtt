00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.410
 by no means 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.740
 you manage to get you further I am 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.630
 back do you realize what are you doing when you do 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.950
 not cluster i carry the post out of the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.430
 first post boat on the rhine is that 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.220
 I hope 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.779
 I like it a lot of mountain 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.690
 experience in this room gathered without 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.260
 will be here but the everest is the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.260
 most dangerous 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 I would like to be with you 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.460
 Next time we climb together 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.970
 the third we find the short time 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.970
 are divorced 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.790
 the mayor of the base camp puts 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.790
 acclimate you my 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.820
 People are simply not for it 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.310
 created 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.050
 the cruise altitude of a 747 too 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.720
 our bodies would work 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.990
 literally die so the question is 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.590
 we'll get you up and down again 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.590
 before that happens 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.079
 hold tight 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.790
 that is still suffering a few days 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.720
 and the rest of your life is you 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.720
 man who was on the everest 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.560
 but now you can achieve it 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.560
 Wanted from the tavern looks bad 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.860
 That's why people are stuck and the storm 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.380
 It's getting worse 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.789
 a problem the bottles are empty 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.789
 I will not leave you 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.000
 I would die 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.900
 Do you have me running ? 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.140
 you have to move 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.140
 his 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.390
 there you i love you
