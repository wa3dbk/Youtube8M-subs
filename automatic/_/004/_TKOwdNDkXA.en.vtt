well<00:00:02.639> looking<00:00:02.970> at<00:00:03.060> memory<00:00:03.570> cards<00:00:04.140> there's<00:00:04.799> one

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
well looking at memory cards there's one

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.089 
well looking at memory cards there's one
of<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.160> first<00:00:05.960> static<00:00:06.960> memory<00:00:07.200> cards<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:08.010> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
of the first static memory cards for the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.209 
of the first static memory cards for the
mid<00:00:08.309> solitaire<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.570> card<00:00:10.490> contains<00:00:13.219> 1,000

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
mid solitaire this card contains 1,000

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.050 
mid solitaire this card contains 1,000
bytes<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.990> thousand<00:00:16.529> eight<00:00:16.859> bit<00:00:17.250> words<00:00:17.760> one

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
bytes one thousand eight bit words one

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.330 
bytes one thousand eight bit words one
thousand<00:00:18.480> bytes<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:19.619> contained<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.189> these

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
thousand bytes it's contained in these

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.380 
thousand bytes it's contained in these
eight<00:00:20.730> chips<00:00:21.090> right<00:00:21.330> here<00:00:21.359> each<00:00:21.779> chip<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:23.390> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
eight chips right here each chip is a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.570 
eight chips right here each chip is a
4-bit<00:00:25.170> word<00:00:26.180> 256<00:00:27.180> words<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.689> two<00:00:27.750> chips<00:00:28.580> makes

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
4-bit word 256 words so two chips makes

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.470 
4-bit word 256 words so two chips makes
the<00:00:29.820> 8-bit<00:00:30.210> word<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.949> have<00:00:32.809> 256<00:00:33.809> 512

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
the 8-bit word and so you have 256 512

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.069 
the 8-bit word and so you have 256 512
756<00:00:38.090> 1,024<00:00:39.710> words<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.980> memory<00:00:41.600> now<00:00:42.600> let's

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
756 1,024 words of memory now let's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.160 
756 1,024 words of memory now let's
relate<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.270> modern<00:00:45.270> memory<00:00:45.480> that's<00:00:45.809> one

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
relate that to modern memory that's one

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.950 
relate that to modern memory that's one
kilo<00:00:46.980> byte<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.940> memory<00:00:49.550> one<00:00:50.899> megabyte<00:00:51.899> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
kilo byte of memory one megabyte of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.040 
kilo byte of memory one megabyte of
memory<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.800> million<00:00:53.219> bytes<00:00:53.899> would<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
memory that's a million bytes would be a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.380 
memory that's a million bytes would be a
million<00:00:55.559> times<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.670> card<00:00:57.059> you'd

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
million times this so this card you'd

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330 
million times this so this card you'd
have<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> million<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.260> these<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:59.190> get

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
have to have a million of these to get

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.149 
have to have a million of these to get
one<00:01:00.050> megabyte<00:01:01.850> now<00:01:02.850> modern<00:01:03.660> computers<00:01:04.439> use

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
one megabyte now modern computers use

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.679 
one megabyte now modern computers use

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
gigabytes let's go back to just one

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.730 
gigabytes let's go back to just one
gigabyte<00:01:17.720> how<00:01:18.720> many<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.140> cards<00:01:19.470> would

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
gigabyte how many of these cards would

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.109 
gigabyte how many of these cards would
it<00:01:19.890> take<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.390> make<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.450> gigabyte<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.350> memory

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
it take to make a gigabyte of memory

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.429 
it take to make a gigabyte of memory
well<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> takes<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.840> thousand<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.380> them

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
well we know it takes a thousand of them

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.319 
well we know it takes a thousand of them
to<00:01:25.560> make<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> mega<00:01:26.630> bit<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.869> memory<00:01:28.170> mega

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
to make a mega bit of memory mega

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.870 
to make a mega bit of memory mega
megabytes<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.570> memory<00:01:30.770> takes<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.979> thousand<00:01:32.790> of

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
megabytes of memory takes a thousand of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.899 
megabytes of memory takes a thousand of
those<00:01:33.000> cards<00:01:33.590> we<00:01:34.590> take<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> thousand<00:01:35.369> times<00:01:35.640> out

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
those cards we take a thousand times out

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
those cards we take a thousand times out
to<00:01:36.090> make<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> gigabyte<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.110> would<00:01:37.290> take<00:01:37.530> 1

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
to make a gigabyte it would take 1

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.429 
to make a gigabyte it would take 1
million<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.780> cards<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:41.909> make<00:01:42.140> just<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
million of these cards to make just a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.460 
million of these cards to make just a
gigabyte<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.220> memory<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.930> let's<00:01:46.140> look<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
gigabyte of memory so let's look at a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.210 
gigabyte of memory so let's look at a
gigabyte<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.009> memory<00:01:48.530> here's<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> current

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.440 

gigabyte<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.300> memory<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:57.520> gigabyte<00:01:58.300> of

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
gigabyte of memory one gigabyte of

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.960 
gigabyte of memory one gigabyte of
memory<00:02:02.100> let's<00:02:03.100> try<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.340> again<00:02:03.700> let's<00:02:03.910> look

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
memory let's try this again let's look

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.330 
memory let's try this again let's look
at<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:06.100> gigabyte<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.760> memory<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.950> is<00:02:09.160> one

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
at one gigabyte of memory this is one

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.910 
at one gigabyte of memory this is one
gigabyte<00:02:09.850> of<00:02:10.030> memory<00:02:10.350> it'll<00:02:11.350> take<00:02:11.560> one

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
gigabyte of memory it'll take one

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.030 
gigabyte of memory it'll take one
million<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.820> those<00:02:12.970> cards<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.810> look<00:02:14.770> at<00:02:14.890> all

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
million of those cards and look at all

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.300 
million of those cards and look at all
the<00:02:15.160> connectors<00:02:15.610> at<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.910> bottom<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:18.010> if<00:02:18.190> I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the connectors at the bottom and if I

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:27.420 
the connectors at the bottom and if I
turn<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.790> over<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.530> see<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:27.040> there's<00:02:27.280> an

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
turn this over you see that there's an

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.280 
turn this over you see that there's an
equal<00:02:27.670> number<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.970> connectors<00:02:28.570> an<00:02:28.810> enormous

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
equal number of connectors an enormous

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.100 
equal number of connectors an enormous
number<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.620> connectors<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:31.270> this<00:02:31.570> little<00:02:31.930> card

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
number of connectors so this little card

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.020 
number of connectors so this little card
I'm<00:02:32.260> holding<00:02:32.290> in<00:02:32.650> my<00:02:32.680> hand<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:35.050> gigabyte<00:02:35.710> is

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
I'm holding in my hand is a gigabyte is

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.740 
I'm holding in my hand is a gigabyte is
equivalent<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.740> 1<00:02:38.740> million<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.760> these<00:02:40.240> cards

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
equivalent to 1 million of these cards

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.070 
equivalent to 1 million of these cards
now<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.710> wonder<00:02:42.010> why<00:02:42.220> I'm<00:02:42.400> using<00:02:42.850> gloves<00:02:43.390> well

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
now you wonder why I'm using gloves well

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.480 
now you wonder why I'm using gloves well
we<00:02:44.200> don't<00:02:44.320> want<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.560> get<00:02:44.680> finger<00:02:45.040> prints<00:02:45.370> on

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
we don't want to get finger prints on

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.820 
we don't want to get finger prints on
these<00:02:45.670> cards<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.240> are<00:02:46.420> actually<00:02:47.080> kind<00:02:47.770> of

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
these cards that are actually kind of

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.450 
these cards that are actually kind of
rare<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.310> valuable<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:49.980> could<00:02:50.980> bring<00:02:51.100> this<00:02:51.250> up

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
rare and valuable I could bring this up

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.360 
rare and valuable I could bring this up
here<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.670> little<00:02:51.880> closer<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.950> can<00:02:54.100> probably

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
here a little closer you can probably

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:05.930 
here a little closer you can probably
see<00:02:56.460> there's<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.580> fingerprint<00:03:02.520> right<00:03:03.520> here

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
see there's a fingerprint right here

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.160 
see there's a fingerprint right here
definite<00:03:06.940> fingerprint<00:03:07.450> there<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.959> some

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
definite fingerprint there and some

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.370 
definite fingerprint there and some
fingerprints<00:03:08.800> other<00:03:08.980> places<00:03:10.230> there's<00:03:11.230> a

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
fingerprints other places there's a

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.970 
fingerprints other places there's a
smidge<00:03:11.709> here<00:03:12.040> as<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.190> fingerprint<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:14.739> we<00:03:14.830> just

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
smidge here as a fingerprint so we just

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.380 
smidge here as a fingerprint so we just
don't<00:03:15.070> want<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.310> get<00:03:15.430> fingerprints<00:03:16.030> all<00:03:16.120> over

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
don't want to get fingerprints all over

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.979 
don't want to get fingerprints all over
these<00:03:16.510> cards<00:03:18.090> let's<00:03:19.090> take<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> look<00:03:19.750> at<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
these cards let's take a look at the

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:28.310 
these cards let's take a look at the
backside<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.500> this<00:03:20.709> card

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.300 

so<00:03:29.320> there's<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.650> backside<00:03:30.960> basically<00:03:32.310> here's

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
so there's the backside basically here's

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.460 
so there's the backside basically here's
your<00:03:33.460> 50<00:03:33.820> pins<00:03:34.030> on<00:03:34.270> this<00:03:34.390> side<00:03:34.630> fit<00:03:34.900> depends<00:03:35.350> on

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
your 50 pins on this side fit depends on

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.310 
your 50 pins on this side fit depends on
the<00:03:35.680> reverse<00:03:36.370> side<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.900> gives<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.200> the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
the reverse side and that gives you the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.270 
the reverse side and that gives you the
100<00:03:38.830> pin<00:03:39.270> they<00:03:40.270> call<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.750> MIT's<00:03:40.990> bus<00:03:41.260> for<00:03:42.250> a

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
100 pin they call it the MIT's bus for a

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.970 
100 pin they call it the MIT's bus for a
long<00:03:42.310> time<00:03:42.700> it's<00:03:42.970> Altair<00:03:43.390> bus<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.990> then

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
long time it's Altair bus and then

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.390 
long time it's Altair bus and then
eventually<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.670> was<00:03:46.560> made<00:03:47.560> into<00:03:47.830> an<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.070> Triple

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
eventually it was made into an I Triple

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.890 
eventually it was made into an I Triple

you had to do a little bit to make them
