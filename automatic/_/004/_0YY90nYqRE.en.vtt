00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
robot as you see I've added all the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.029 
robot as you see I've added all the
details<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> head<00:00:24.050> all<00:00:25.050> those<00:00:25.470> parts<00:00:25.890> were

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
details in the head all those parts were

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.679 
details in the head all those parts were
handcrafted<00:00:27.260> out<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.439> acrylic<00:00:29.000> out<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.210> resin

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
Robbie project was a completion of all

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.209 
Robbie project was a completion of all
the<00:00:54.300> construction<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.320> make<00:00:55.469> sure<00:00:55.710> everything

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the construction to make sure everything

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.400 
the construction to make sure everything
fits<00:00:58.910> if<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.239> any<00:01:00.390> problems<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.230> work

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
fits if there was any problems to work

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.039 
fits if there was any problems to work
out<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.390> he<00:01:03.570> went<00:01:03.719> together

you see here try to get with the glare

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.420 
you see here try to get with the glare
of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> dome<00:01:43.409> not<00:01:43.710> quite<00:01:43.920> sure<00:01:43.950> how<00:01:44.220> much<00:01:44.369> you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
of the dome not quite sure how much you

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.940 
of the dome not quite sure how much you
can<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:44.880> inside<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.360> there<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.649> all<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
can see inside of there but all the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.490 
can see inside of there but all the
parts<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.399> there<00:01:47.960> I've<00:01:48.960> tested

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
parts are in there I've tested

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.340 
parts are in there I've tested
everything<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.610> very<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:51.869> pleased<00:01:52.229> I

everything out and very very pleased I
have<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.590> add<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> few<00:01:52.920> lights<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.180> ears<00:01:54.540> but

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
have to add a few lights on the ears but

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.360 
have to add a few lights on the ears but
everything<00:01:56.250> else<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.790> place

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.649 

so<00:02:01.370> stay<00:02:01.729> tuned<00:02:01.970> for<00:02:03.369> part<00:02:04.369> five<00:02:04.640> which<00:02:05.299> will

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
so stay tuned for part five which will

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.910 
so stay tuned for part five which will
be<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.290> continuation<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:07.159> Robbie<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.790> robot

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
be the continuation of Robbie the robot

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.070 
be the continuation of Robbie the robot
seeing<00:02:09.920> all<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.250> electronics<00:02:10.819> work<00:02:11.060> as<00:02:11.300> well

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
seeing all the electronics work as well

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.010 
seeing all the electronics work as well
