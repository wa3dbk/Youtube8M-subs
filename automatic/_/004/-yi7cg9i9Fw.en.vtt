00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
after about three or four holes willing

00:01:43.100 --> 00:02:17.199 
after about three or four holes willing
to<00:01:44.170> post<00:01:45.170> our<00:01:45.350> pain<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.650> white

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.660 

our<00:02:17.599> main<00:02:17.810> challenge<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.349> getting<00:02:19.250> all<00:02:19.489> the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
our main challenge is getting all the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.110 
our main challenge is getting all the
humidity<00:02:20.330> out<00:02:20.599> of<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.080> building<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:22.940> can

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
humidity out of the building so we can

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.470 
humidity out of the building so we can
get<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.360> good<00:02:23.599> dry<00:02:23.900> time<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.730> let's<00:02:26.120> say<00:02:26.239> dry

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
get a good dry time and let's say dry

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.880 
get a good dry time and let's say dry
time<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.930> that's<00:02:27.049> how<00:02:27.409> long<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.650> takes<00:02:27.799> for

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
time and that's how long it takes for

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.949 
time and that's how long it takes for
though<00:02:28.069> I<00:02:28.340> used<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.819> set<00:02:29.030> up<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.659> we've<00:02:29.780> done

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
though I used to set up so we've done

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:37.270 
though I used to set up so we've done
more<00:02:30.140> water<00:02:30.319> on

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.330 

as<00:02:38.280> we<00:02:38.490> painted<00:02:38.820> white<00:02:39.060> we<00:02:39.840> will<00:02:40.070> take<00:02:41.070> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
as we painted white we will take and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.790 
as we painted white we will take and
seal<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.910> again<00:02:42.240> with<00:02:42.390> clear<00:02:42.600> water<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:43.560> after

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
seal it again with clear water and after

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.520 
seal it again with clear water and after
that<00:02:43.920> freezes<00:02:44.340> will<00:02:44.640> start<00:02:45.290> laying<00:02:46.290> out<00:02:46.470> our

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that freezes will start laying out our

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.220 
that freezes will start laying out our
logos<00:02:46.980> for<00:02:47.550> our<00:02:47.670> red<00:02:47.880> lines<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.270> blue<00:02:48.450> lines

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.870 

basically<00:02:52.230> right<00:02:52.530> now<00:02:52.680> we're<00:02:52.860> using<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.280> yarn

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
basically right now we're using the yarn

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.610 
basically right now we're using the yarn
here<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.390> get<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> complete<00:02:54.870> straight<00:02:55.140> line<00:02:55.380> and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
here to get a complete straight line and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.430 
here to get a complete straight line and
then<00:02:56.400> he's<00:02:56.970> freezing<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.510> down

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
then he's freezing it down

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.170 
then he's freezing it down
and<00:02:59.560> then<00:03:00.100> we'll<00:03:00.250> take<00:03:00.460> it<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:00.790> we'll<00:03:00.880> paint

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
and then we'll take it and we'll paint

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.460 
and then we'll take it and we'll paint
the<00:03:01.300> inside<00:03:01.690> with<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.840> brush<00:03:07.170> okay<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.440> a

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
the inside with a brush okay so a

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.740 
the inside with a brush okay so a
quarter<00:03:08.860> paint<00:03:09.280> oil<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:09.850> water<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.270> get<00:03:10.660> all

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
quarter paint oil and water you get all

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.510 
quarter paint oil and water you get all

laying<00:03:35.350> of<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.560> ice<00:03:35.739> takes<00:03:36.040> about<00:03:36.160> three<00:03:36.459> days

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
laying of the ice takes about three days

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.280 
laying of the ice takes about three days
they'll<00:03:36.970> work<00:03:37.090> around<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.480> clock<00:03:37.630> from<00:03:38.110> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
they'll work around the clock from the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.750 
they'll work around the clock from the
time<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:38.500> they<00:03:38.800> first<00:03:39.100> turned<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.459> chillers

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
time that they first turned the chillers

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.270 
time that they first turned the chillers
on<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.060> get<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.270> floor<00:03:40.569> cold<00:03:40.870> enough<00:03:41.280> to

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
on to get the floor cold enough to

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.830 
on to get the floor cold enough to
painting<00:03:42.760> everything<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.390> laying<00:03:43.600> enough

water<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.350> build<00:03:44.530> up<00:03:44.709> about<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.550> half<00:03:45.760> an<00:03:45.880> inch

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
water to build up about a half an inch

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.370 
water to build up about a half an inch
of<00:03:46.090> ice<00:03:46.209> so<00:03:46.420> that'll<00:03:46.630> take<00:03:46.750> about<00:03:46.900> three<00:03:47.230> days

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380

these employment holds approximately 300
gallons<00:04:43.630> and<00:04:44.630> that<00:04:44.960> would<00:04:45.050> take<00:04:45.260> us<00:04:45.440> about<00:04:46.370> a

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
gallons and that would take us about a
