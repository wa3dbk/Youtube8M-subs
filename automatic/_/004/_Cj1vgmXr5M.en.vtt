measured<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.390> bit<00:00:51.570> thicker<00:00:51.809> in

and accurate watches we could reliably

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.500

determine<00:01:02.070> latitude<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.609> longitude<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.359> that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
determine latitude and longitude so that

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.329 
determine latitude and longitude so that

visited<00:01:07.590> uncharted<00:01:08.460> regions<00:01:08.610> mapped<00:01:09.270> them

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
visited uncharted regions mapped them

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.390

and<00:01:09.659> even<00:01:10.080> found<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.530> tallest<00:01:10.890> mountain<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and even found the tallest mountain in

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.960

math and the same reference surface rail
tunnels<00:01:18.960> could<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.229> started<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.650> both<00:01:19.890> sides

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
tunnels could be started on both sides

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.070 
tunnels could be started on both sides
of<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.400> mountain<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.909> somehow<00:01:21.240> still<00:01:21.420> meet<00:01:21.960> in

the<00:01:22.170> mill<00:01:22.380> life<00:01:22.979> was<00:01:23.310> good

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the mill life was good

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.390 
the mill life was good
and<00:01:24.540> once<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:25.020> invented<00:01:25.409> radio<00:01:25.770> telescopes

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
and once we invented radio telescopes

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
and once we invented radio telescopes
and<00:01:26.580> satellites<00:01:26.790> things<00:01:27.600> got<00:01:27.930> even<00:01:28.200> better

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and satellites things got even better

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.679 
and satellites things got even better
when<00:01:29.130> scientists<00:01:29.729> used<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.119> bunch<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> small

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
when scientists used a bunch of small

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.749 
when scientists used a bunch of small
radio<00:01:31.079> dishes<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.650> one<00:01:31.860> big<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.490> look<00:01:32.610> at

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
radio dishes like one big one to look at

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.030 
radio dishes like one big one to look at
quasars<00:01:33.210> somebody<00:01:33.900> got<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> idea<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
quasars somebody got the idea that you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.260 
quasars somebody got the idea that you
could<00:01:35.159> use<00:01:35.220> these<00:01:35.549> measurements<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
could use these measurements to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.179 
could use these measurements to
determine<00:01:36.299> very<00:01:37.020> accurately<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.799> distance

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
determine very accurately the distance

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.130 
determine very accurately the distance
between<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.640> telescopes<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.990> look

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
between the telescopes now we can look

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.390 
between the telescopes now we can look
at<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> movement<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> Earth's<00:01:41.189> crust
