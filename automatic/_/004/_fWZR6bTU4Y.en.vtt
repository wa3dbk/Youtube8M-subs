00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Country decided to introduce tuna alarm to prevent overfishing of bluefin tuna in the Pacific Ocean 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:16.360
 For also becomes the target consumers not only fishermen 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.280
 There was also a fear that we would have to refrain from eating if ordered 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:28.660
 Even here at Tsukiji, a specialty store in Tokyo, the amount of flow tuna is sharply reduced 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:34.270
 It has become a different type, such as all the Indian Ocean tuna It is also tuna that is here now 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:38.060
 The stock of control of the bluefin tuna is comparable to the lowest level in the past 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:44.079
 It is estimated to be about 26,000 tons 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:47.379
 It is the overfishing of the small juvenile fish that is still the factor 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:51.770
 There is in a difficult situation is very resources for representative black bug 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:57.320
 Thank you for being strongly asked to buy 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:01:01.990
 About new resource management which national meeting held in working capital is not only member of the Diet 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:07.530
 An explanation was given to fishermen 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:15.060
 Immature of less than 30 kilograms of the Pacific Ocean bluefin tuna of the target 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:16.950
 The catch cap will be 4007 tons a year, which will be half of the average value from 2002 to 2004 from next year 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.460
 And 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:26.270
 This is a country-specific catch Rio 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.270
 It can be seen that Japan has many catches alongside Mexico 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:36.700
 Because it is the largest fishing country and consumption country 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.700
 You are the leader and you are the leader. 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:48.090
 Furthermore, in the fixed net fishing etc., the Japanese coast is divided into six areas and the catch upper limit is set 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:53.370
 Warning at 70% of the upper limit sound 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.220
 Alarm at 90% Alarm at 90% Special Alarm 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:05.230
 Announced to fishermen's groups 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:09.280
 And when it reaches 95%, it asks fishermen for self-restraint of business establishment 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.170
 I do not think you but I think we can not be helped even if there Well because I like Japan's number 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.600
 Ne 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.230
 Or rather say so 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:23.980
 The Fisheries Agency has issued warnings and warnings to help consumers understand the current situation. 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:31.180
 We are going to publish on the website of the Fisheries Agency 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:36.710
 Pacific bluefin tuna is designated as an endangered species at the International Convention of the Washington Convention 2016 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:39.819
 There is also fear and thorough international management is an issue 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.840
 Ask them to a decent resource management 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:48.980
 I have to make sustainable fishery 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:53.269
 Announcement of warning to passenger aircraft starting from next year 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:59.620
 And sacrificed water village chief has all the fishermen 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.620
 There as a resource is always recovered if the firm management
