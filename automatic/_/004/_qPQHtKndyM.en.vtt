00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.910 
new products well the TC 6 and TC 7 kits
are<00:00:23.310> basically<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.880> same<00:00:23.910> kit<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.570> only

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
are basically the same kit the only

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.230 
are basically the same kit the only

engineering process for this particular

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.139 
engineering process for this particular
product<00:00:34.860> was<00:00:35.010> fairly<00:00:35.309> straight<00:00:35.670> fold

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
product was fairly straight fold

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.850 
product was fairly straight fold
it's<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.510> conventional<00:00:37.050> design<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.649> we're

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it's a conventional design so we're

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.160 
it's a conventional design so we're
familiar<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.850> much<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.719> tooling

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
of that we already had so you'll be able

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.569 
of that we already had so you'll be able
to<00:00:47.340> use<00:00:47.460> existing<00:00:47.670> tooling<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.960> it

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
to use existing tooling for much of it
previously<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.820> offered<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.239> kit<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:52.410> one<00:00:52.620> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
previously we offered a kit for one of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.450 
previously we offered a kit for one of
the<00:00:53.039> applications<00:00:53.789> these<00:00:54.300> new<00:00:54.510> kits<00:00:54.750> fit<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
the applications these new kits fit and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
the applications these new kits fit and
quite<00:00:56.460> honestly<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.940> weren't<00:00:57.239> happy<00:00:57.590> with<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
quite honestly we weren't happy with the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.779 
quite honestly we weren't happy with the
design<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.609> clamp<00:00:59.969> load<00:01:00.180> was<00:01:01.489> simply<00:01:02.489> put

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
design the clamp load was simply put

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.710 
design the clamp load was simply put
overkill<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.220> we<00:01:05.220> wanted<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> design<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.360> kit

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
overkill and we wanted to design a kit

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.210 
overkill and we wanted to design a kit
that<00:01:07.229> suits<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.950> broader<00:01:08.540> customer<00:01:09.540> base<00:01:10.220> it's

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that suits a broader customer base it's

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.550 
that suits a broader customer base it's
just<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.520> matter<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> spending<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> time<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.560> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
just a matter of spending the time to to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.410 
just a matter of spending the time to to
do<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> testing<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> bench<00:01:14.729> testing<00:01:15.240> in

do the testing the bench testing in
vehicle<00:01:15.840> testing<00:01:16.320> there's<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.220> lot<00:01:17.460> of

vehicle testing there's a lot of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.160 
vehicle testing there's a lot of
variables<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.570> throw<00:01:18.840> into<00:01:19.049> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
variables that we can throw into a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.070
