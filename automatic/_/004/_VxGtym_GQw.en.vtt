fired by RB or r1 you know the equipment
button<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.010> there's<00:00:29.490> no<00:00:29.609> need<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.820> switch<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.090 
always shoot it at any point in time
which<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:33.989> makes<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.559> good<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:35.010> those

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
which is what makes it so good for those

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.530 
which is what makes it so good for those
you<00:00:35.219> know<00:00:35.309> super<00:00:35.670> close<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:36.090> awkward

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you know super close up awkward

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.479 
you know super close up awkward
gunfights<00:00:37.020> even<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> other<00:00:38.129> person<00:00:38.219> has

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
gunfights even if the other person has

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.700 
gunfights even if the other person has
an<00:00:38.700> SMG<00:00:39.030> you'll<00:00:39.719> still<00:00:40.050> win<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> lot<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
an SMG you'll still win a lot of the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.229 
an SMG you'll still win a lot of the
time<00:00:40.920> because<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.550> pretty<00:00:41.850> much<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
time because you pretty much have a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.209 
time because you pretty much have a
shotgun<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.440> Testament<00:00:43.800> itself<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
shotgun so the Testament itself is

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.680 
shotgun so the Testament itself is
modeled<00:00:44.579> after<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.969> bulldog<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.480> got<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
modeled after the bulldog it's got the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.569 
modeled after the bulldog it's got the
exact<00:00:46.020> same<00:00:46.079> reload<00:00:46.530> animation<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.100> pretty

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
exact same reload animation a pretty

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.400 
exact same reload animation a pretty
similar<00:00:47.789> hip<00:00:48.090> spread<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.870> got<00:00:49.020> similar

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
similar hip spread and it's got similar

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.110 
similar hip spread and it's got similar
damage<00:00:49.590> properties<00:00:50.219> although<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> lot

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
damage properties although it is a lot

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.430 
damage properties although it is a lot
weaker<00:00:51.390> than<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> Bulldog<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.289> this

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
weaker than the Bulldog you know this

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.750 
weaker than the Bulldog you know this
thing<00:00:52.559> isn't<00:00:52.710> quite<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.430> having<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
thing isn't quite like having a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
thing isn't quite like having a
secondary<00:00:54.120> shotgun<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> pretty

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
secondary shotgun but it is pretty

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.900 
secondary shotgun but it is pretty
effective<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:56.129> those<00:00:56.250> close-range<00:00:56.640> fights

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
effective for those close-range fights

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.420 
effective for those close-range fights
so<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.780> damage<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> does<00:00:58.260> 34<00:00:58.829> damage<00:00:59.160> per

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so as for damage it does 34 damage per

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.939 
so as for damage it does 34 damage per
pellet<00:00:59.460> up<00:01:00.059> close<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.780> then<00:01:00.930> 5<00:01:01.230> damage<00:01:01.590> per

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
pellet up close and then 5 damage per

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.009 
pellet up close and then 5 damage per
pellet<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> distance<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.420> there<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.660> 6

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
pellet at a distance and there are 6

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.560 
pellet at a distance and there are 6
pellets<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.619> each<00:01:05.189> round<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.180> shoot<00:01:06.420> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
pellets and each round that you shoot so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.750 
pellets and each round that you shoot so
you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:06.990> 204<00:01:07.650> damage<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.430> close

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
you can do up to 204 damage and up close

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.730 
you can do up to 204 damage and up close
if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.299> hit<00:01:09.570> somebody<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:09.960> all<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.590> those

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
if you hit somebody with all of those

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.960 
if you hit somebody with all of those
pellets<00:01:11.040> which<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> pretty<00:01:11.700> cool<00:01:11.850> that's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
pellets which is pretty cool that's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.789 
pellets which is pretty cool that's
pretty<00:01:12.090> powerful<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> comparison

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
pretty powerful now as for a comparison

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
pretty powerful now as for a comparison
the<00:01:14.010> Bulldog<00:01:14.280> does<00:01:14.490> 50<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.000> 17<00:01:15.450> up<00:01:15.630> close<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the Bulldog does 50 and 17 up close to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
the Bulldog does 50 and 17 up close to
the<00:01:16.080> distance<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.890> got<00:01:17.009> eight<00:01:17.220> pellets

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the distance and it's got eight pellets

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.090 
the distance and it's got eight pellets
per<00:01:17.880> shot<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> thing<00:01:19.140> does<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> 400

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
per shot so that thing does up to 400

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.340 
per shot so that thing does up to 400

if you guys want to kind of think about

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.380 
if you guys want to kind of think about
it<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.369> regard<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.000> still<00:01:27.150> pretty

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it in that regard but it's still pretty

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.520 
it in that regard but it's still pretty
good<00:01:27.509> it'll<00:01:27.720> still<00:01:27.900> take<00:01:28.049> people<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.350> pretty

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
good it'll still take people out pretty

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.740 
good it'll still take people out pretty
quick<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.549> rate<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.790> fire<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:29.970> around<00:01:30.329> 300

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
quick the the rate of fire is around 300

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.420 
quick the the rate of fire is around 300
rounds<00:01:30.810> per<00:01:31.020> minute<00:01:31.229> which<00:01:31.350> isn't<00:01:31.770> bad<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
rounds per minute which isn't bad the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.270 
rounds per minute which isn't bad the
Bulldog<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.060> 480<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.840> believe<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.409> again<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
Bulldog is 480 I believe so again it's a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
Bulldog is 480 I believe so again it's a
lot<00:01:35.520> less<00:01:35.729> than<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.240> hey<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.600> an

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
lot less than that but hey it's an

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.330 
lot less than that but hey it's an
attachment<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.409> can't<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.740> same<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
attachment so it can't be the same and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.490 
attachment so it can't be the same and
then<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.060> ammo<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.930> 8<00:01:40.140> rounds

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
then as for your ammo you get 8 rounds

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
then as for your ammo you get 8 rounds
total<00:01:40.710> split<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.340> into<00:01:41.520> two<00:01:41.759> magazines<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.299> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
total split up into two magazines so you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.639 
total split up into two magazines so you
have<00:01:42.450> your<00:01:42.570> starting<00:01:42.960> magazine<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.470> four

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
have your starting magazine of four

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.050 
have your starting magazine of four
rounds<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.700> backup

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
rounds and then you have a backup

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
rounds and then you have a backup
magazine<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.689> four<00:01:45.899> rounds<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.320> thing<00:01:46.500> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
magazine of four rounds on the thing is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.050 
magazine of four rounds on the thing is

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
alleys things like that but there's also

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
things like that to where you know the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.550 
things like that to where you know the
shotgun<00:03:21.360> attachment<00:03:21.840> even<00:03:21.990> though<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.470> have

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
shotgun attachment even though you have

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.380 
shotgun attachment even though you have
an<00:03:22.620> AR<00:03:22.740> is<00:03:23.100> still<00:03:23.640> gonna<00:03:23.760> help<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.060> out<00:03:24.120> do

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
an AR is still gonna help you out do

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.600 
an AR is still gonna help you out do
SMGs<00:03:25.050> or<00:03:25.260> possibly<00:03:25.620> other<00:03:25.800> shotguns<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.460> know

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
SMGs or possibly other shotguns you know

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.320 
SMGs or possibly other shotguns you know
whatever<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.000> may<00:03:27.150> be

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
whatever it may be

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.870 
whatever it may be
in<00:03:27.510> those<00:03:28.020> close-range<00:03:28.470> engagements<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:29.100> this

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
in those close-range engagements so this

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.280 
in those close-range engagements so this
thing<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.240> it<00:03:30.390> quite<00:03:30.690> like<00:03:30.900> having<00:03:31.230> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
thing is it quite like having a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.480 
thing is it quite like having a
secondary<00:03:31.590> shotgun<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.310> want<00:03:32.460> a

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
secondary shotgun like you want a

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.920 
secondary shotgun like you want a
full-on<00:03:32.730> secondary<00:03:33.240> shotgun<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.660> can<00:03:33.780> run

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
full-on secondary shotgun you can run

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.970 
full-on secondary shotgun you can run
around<00:03:34.020> with<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.440> would<00:03:34.560> definitely<00:03:34.890> run

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
around with I would definitely run

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.980 
around with I would definitely run
overkill<00:03:35.520> over<00:03:35.820> using<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.210> but<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.810> is

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
overkill over using this but this is

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.090 
overkill over using this but this is
great<00:03:37.230> if<00:03:37.440> you're<00:03:37.530> gonna<00:03:37.620> use<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:37.890> sparingly

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
great if you're gonna use it sparingly

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.350 
great if you're gonna use it sparingly
if<00:03:38.460> you're<00:03:38.580> only<00:03:38.700> gonna<00:03:38.850> use<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.180> when<00:03:39.270> you

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
if you're only gonna use it when you

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.670 
if you're only gonna use it when you
have<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.720> if<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.900> want<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.080> focus<00:03:40.410> on<00:03:40.560> using

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
have to if you want to focus on using

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.590 
have to if you want to focus on using
assault<00:03:41.040> rifle<00:03:41.340> but<00:03:41.520> still<00:03:41.970> have<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.270> backup

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
assault rifle but still have that backup

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.810 
assault rifle but still have that backup
kind<00:03:43.050> of<00:03:43.110> like<00:03:43.230> safety<00:03:43.530> net<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.070> it's<00:03:44.670> just

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
kind of like safety net and it's just

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.790 
kind of like safety net and it's just
it's<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.480> good<00:03:45.630> way<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.780> justify<00:03:46.170> using<00:03:46.470> assault

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
it's a good way to justify using assault

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.680 
it's a good way to justify using assault
rifles<00:03:47.070> analogies<00:03:47.490> on<00:03:47.820> certain<00:03:48.330> mats<00:03:48.510> they're

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
rifles analogies on certain mats they're

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.360 
rifles analogies on certain mats they're
a<00:03:48.720> little<00:03:48.870> bit<00:03:49.050> closer<00:03:49.230> range<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:50.130> kind<00:03:50.340> of

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
a little bit closer range and kind of
