00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.889 
really a setback for me I depend on a
lot<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.259> widgets<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.299> quick<00:02:03.299> updates<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
lot of widgets to get quick updates and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.160 
lot of widgets to get quick updates and
that's<00:02:04.020> why<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.200> don't<00:02:04.500> use<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:05.009> my<00:02:05.189> launcher

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
that's why I don't use it as my launcher

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.600 
that's why I don't use it as my launcher
so<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.320> click<00:02:07.469> home<00:02:07.799> we'll<00:02:08.280> go<00:02:08.399> back<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
so if you click home we'll go back to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.940 
so if you click home we'll go back to
the<00:02:08.789> HTC<00:02:09.420> Sense<00:02:09.720> home<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.619> see<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> can

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the HTC Sense home you can see I can

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.860 
the HTC Sense home you can see I can
already<00:02:11.220> put<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> lot<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.879> facebook<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.750> my

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
already put a lot of facebook on my

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.580 
already put a lot of facebook on my
HTC<00:02:14.739> Sense<00:02:15.099> app<00:02:15.790> launcher<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:17.200> that's<00:02:17.349> why<00:02:17.500> I'm

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
HTC Sense app launcher so that's why I'm

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.449 
HTC Sense app launcher so that's why I'm
not<00:02:17.769> using<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.220> as<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:20.010> application<00:02:21.010> launcher

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
not using it as the application launcher

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.130 
not using it as the application launcher
if<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.700> click<00:02:21.909> Facebook<00:02:22.360> home<00:02:22.599> again<00:02:22.930> and

if you click Facebook home again and

then click back home it's going to re

then click back home it's going to re
ask<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:26.980> which<00:02:27.220> one<00:02:27.459> used<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.760> want<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.090> start
