00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
to fracture gaming here and today I'm

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.740 
to fracture gaming here and today I'm
going<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.200> do<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.349> quick<00:00:10.620> guide<00:00:10.800> on<00:00:10.860> how<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.400> get

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
going to do a quick guide on how to get

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.999 
going to do a quick guide on how to get
blood<00:00:12.750> shards<00:00:13.080> really<00:00:13.380> easily<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.920> really

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
blood shards really easily and really

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.160 
blood shards really easily and really
fast<00:00:14.370> especially<00:00:15.000> if<00:00:15.059> you're<00:00:15.179> like<00:00:15.299> pushing

fast especially if you're like pushing

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.580 
fast especially if you're like pushing
for<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:16.650> item<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.980> need<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.289> so<00:00:19.289> what

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
for that one item you need and so what

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.170 
for that one item you need and so what
you<00:00:19.710> do<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.160> oh<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> probably<00:00:20.730> should've<00:00:21.090> done

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
you do is oh I probably should've done

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.420 
you do is oh I probably should've done
that<00:00:21.359> but<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.830> go<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.070> your

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
that but what you do is you go to your

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.089 
that but what you do is you go to your
greater<00:00:23.699> if<00:00:23.939> trial<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:25.320> don't<00:00:25.560> kill<00:00:25.800> any

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
greater if trial and you don't kill any

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.400 
greater if trial and you don't kill any
of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.330> gonna<00:00:27.449> show<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.109> did<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
of the I was gonna show you but I did it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.530 
of the I was gonna show you but I did it
wrong<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:30.000> don't<00:00:30.119> kill<00:00:30.470> any<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.180> mobs<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
wrong you don't kill any of the mobs and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.780 
wrong you don't kill any of the mobs and
you<00:00:33.630> get<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> level<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.380> greater<00:00:34.950> rift<00:00:35.250> key<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
you get a level one greater rift key and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.850 
you get a level one greater rift key and
then<00:00:36.750> it'll<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.930> something<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
then it'll be something like this that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.610 
then it'll be something like this that
you<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.070> totally<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.700> rush<00:00:39.149> through<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.360 

you'll<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> certain<00:00:44.040> amount<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.309> blood

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you'll get a certain amount of blood

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.810 
you'll get a certain amount of blood
shards<00:00:44.850> hold<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.149> I'll<00:00:45.270> skip<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:46.820> alright

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
shards hold on I'll skip to it alright

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.180 
shards hold on I'll skip to it alright
now<00:00:48.090> we're<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> complete<00:00:48.809> our<00:00:49.110> level<00:00:50.039> 1

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
now we're about to complete our level 1

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.500 
now we're about to complete our level 1
Great<00:00:50.460> Rift

Great Rift

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.270 
Great Rift
and<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:55.120> completed<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.859> see<00:00:56.859> fruit<00:00:57.070> wait

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
and it's completed and see fruit wait

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.740 
and it's completed and see fruit wait
for<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.550> pop-up<00:00:57.820> here<00:00:58.769> why<00:00:59.769> are<00:00:59.829> they<00:01:00.750> alright

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
for the pop-up here why are they alright

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.389 
for the pop-up here why are they alright
39<00:01:02.229> we've<00:01:02.409> gotten<00:01:02.680> 39<00:01:03.159> blood<00:01:03.430> shards<00:01:03.820> on<00:01:04.030> our

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
39 we've gotten 39 blood shards on our

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:11.240 
39 we've gotten 39 blood shards on our
first<00:01:07.409> try<00:01:08.409> our<00:01:08.830> first<00:01:09.310> greater<00:01:10.149> rift<00:01:10.420> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
first try our first greater rift you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.310 
first try our first greater rift you
collect<00:01:12.250> my<00:01:12.369> things<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:13.330> then<00:01:14.049> you<00:01:14.140> go<00:01:14.289> to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
collect my things and then you go to

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.560 
collect my things and then you go to
your<00:01:14.560> upgrade<00:01:14.950> Keystone<00:01:15.490> rank<00:01:15.940> 11<00:01:16.360> or

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
your upgrade Keystone rank 11 or

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.590 
your upgrade Keystone rank 11 or
whatever<00:01:16.930> rank<00:01:17.830> you<00:01:17.979> get<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:21.909> just<00:01:22.060> do

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
whatever rank you get to and you just do

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.529 
whatever rank you get to and you just do
that<00:01:22.750> one<00:01:23.039> probably<00:01:24.039> shouldn't<00:01:24.610> spend<00:01:25.390> your

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
that one probably shouldn't spend your

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.120 
that one probably shouldn't spend your
blood<00:01:25.720> shards<00:01:26.050> here<00:01:26.289> so<00:01:26.560> you<00:01:26.619> can<00:01:26.770> save<00:01:27.009> them

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
blood shards here so you can save them

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.029 
blood shards here so you can save them
up<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.580> I'll<00:01:30.580> be<00:01:30.729> back<00:01:30.909> in<00:01:30.940> a<00:01:31.090> second<00:01:32.039> alright

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
up and I'll be back in a second alright

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.120 
up and I'll be back in a second alright
it's<00:01:33.340> pretty<00:01:33.399> much<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.819> same<00:01:33.850> thing<00:01:34.330> you<00:01:35.130> go

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
it's pretty much the same thing you go

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.120 
it's pretty much the same thing you go
to<00:01:36.190> your<00:01:36.399> greater<00:01:36.700> rift<00:01:37.950> complete<00:01:38.950> this

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
to your greater rift complete this

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.950 
to your greater rift complete this
really<00:01:39.520> quickly<00:01:39.759> or<00:01:40.330> hopefully<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:40.840> do

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
really quickly or hopefully you do

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.399 
really quickly or hopefully you do
really<00:01:41.170> quickly<00:01:41.440> and<00:01:42.009> then<00:01:43.000> all<00:01:43.479> you<00:01:43.720> do<00:01:43.899> is<00:01:43.929> go

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
really quickly and then all you do is go

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.949 
really quickly and then all you do is go
to<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:45.009> greater<00:01:46.000> rift<00:01:46.270> difficulty<00:01:46.840> that

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
to the greater rift difficulty that

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.180 
to the greater rift difficulty that
you're<00:01:47.140> most<00:01:47.350> comfortable<00:01:47.619> with

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
you're most comfortable with

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:56.190 
you're most comfortable with
around<00:01:49.179> probably<00:01:50.190> 20<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.810> save<00:01:56.110> them

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
around probably 20 and if you save them

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.240 
around probably 20 and if you save them
up<00:01:56.380> until<00:01:56.709> you<00:01:56.830> get<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.069> that<00:01:57.160> 20<00:01:59.009> the<00:02:00.009> most

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
up until you get to that 20 the most

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.749 
up until you get to that 20 the most
common<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:00.849> have<00:02:01.030> is<00:02:01.209> about<00:02:01.319> 200<00:02:02.550> so<00:02:03.550> if<00:02:03.640> you

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
common I have is about 200 so if you

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.150 
common I have is about 200 so if you
save<00:02:03.970> them<00:02:04.119> up<00:02:04.239> until<00:02:04.629> you<00:02:05.170> get<00:02:05.770> higher<00:02:05.979> and

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
save them up until you get higher and

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.770 
save them up until you get higher and
higher<00:02:06.220> then<00:02:06.670> you'll<00:02:06.789> have<00:02:06.910> about<00:02:07.000> 200<00:02:07.629> blood

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
higher then you'll have about 200 blood

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.770 
higher then you'll have about 200 blood
shards<00:02:08.200> by<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.129> end<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.519> everything<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.599> do

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
shards by the end of everything you do

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.309 
shards by the end of everything you do
by<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.110> end<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.349> every<00:02:11.890> run<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.640> do<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
by the end of every run you do so the

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.040 
by the end of every run you do so the
first<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.680> takes<00:02:14.860> about<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.370> don't<00:02:15.519> know<00:02:15.610> 5<00:02:16.269> 3

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
first one takes about I don't know 5 3

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.460 
first one takes about I don't know 5 3
minutes<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:19.150> second<00:02:19.540> one<00:02:19.660> here<00:02:20.050> takes<00:02:20.319> about

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
minutes the second one here takes about

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.070 
minutes the second one here takes about
a<00:02:21.099> little<00:02:21.370> longer<00:02:21.610> 10<00:02:22.540> minutes

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
a little longer 10 minutes

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.160 
a little longer 10 minutes
and<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.920> third<00:02:24.160> one<00:02:24.370> should<00:02:24.700> take<00:02:24.879> you<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:25.930> I

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
and the third one should take you like I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.759 
and the third one should take you like I
it's<00:02:26.739> easier<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.129> do<00:02:27.250> three<00:02:27.519> in<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:28.209> row<00:02:28.239> and

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
it's easier to do three in a row and

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.380 
it's easier to do three in a row and
then<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:30.099> third<00:02:30.400> one<00:02:30.580> should<00:02:30.760> take<00:02:30.879> about<00:02:31.030> a

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
then the third one should take about a

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.910 
then the third one should take about a
little<00:02:31.569> bit<00:02:31.720> longer<00:02:31.930> maybe<00:02:32.170> twelve<00:02:32.560> minutes

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
little bit longer maybe twelve minutes

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.390 
little bit longer maybe twelve minutes
and<00:02:33.220> then<00:02:33.519> so<00:02:33.879> add<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.180> all<00:02:34.510> up<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:35.400> about

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
and then so add that all up it's about

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.930 
and then so add that all up it's about
20<00:02:36.909> minutes<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:38.019> 20<00:02:38.290> minutes<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:39.040> get<00:02:39.190> 200

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
20 minutes and in 20 minutes you get 200

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.089 
20 minutes and in 20 minutes you get 200
blood<00:02:40.599> shards<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.319> it's<00:02:41.620> just<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:41.890> really

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
blood shards and it's just a really

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.240 
blood shards and it's just a really
quick<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.430> easy<00:02:42.610> way<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:44.170> hope<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:44.590> video

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250
