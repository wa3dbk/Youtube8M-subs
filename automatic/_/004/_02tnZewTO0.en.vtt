the schools in the middle of our state

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:54.869 
the schools in the middle of our state
then<00:05:52.279> we<00:05:52.459> have<00:05:52.699> the<00:05:53.439> clash<00:05:54.439> eight

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:54.879 
then we have the clash eight

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:57.790 
then we have the clash eight
Championships<00:05:55.879> which<00:05:56.719> again<00:05:57.199> it's<00:05:57.589> the
