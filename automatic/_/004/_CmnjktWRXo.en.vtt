heavy<00:02:31.989> task<00:02:32.290> it's<00:02:32.829> great<00:02:33.099> for<00:02:33.220> office<00:02:33.549> work<00:02:33.730> in

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
heavy task it's great for office work in

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.839 
heavy task it's great for office work in
office<00:02:34.209> work<00:02:34.420> only<00:02:34.769> all<00:02:35.769> right<00:02:35.950> now<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.609> is

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
office work only all right now this is

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.690 
office work only all right now this is
1.4<00:02:37.480> case<00:02:37.689> is<00:02:37.840> quite<00:02:38.170> light<00:02:38.439> and<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:39.189> has<00:02:39.400> about

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
1.4 case is quite light and it has about

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.880 
1.4 case is quite light and it has about
four<00:02:40.390> hours<00:02:40.629> of<00:02:40.840> battery<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.439> the<00:02:41.530> battery

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
four hours of battery so the battery

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.000 
four hours of battery so the battery
life<00:02:42.069> is<00:02:42.220> low<00:02:42.640> alright<00:02:43.739> but<00:02:44.739> we'll<00:02:44.859> have<00:02:44.950> to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
life is low alright but we'll have to

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.500 
life is low alright but we'll have to
run<00:02:45.340> full<00:02:45.579> test<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.909> see<00:02:46.030> how<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.299> really

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
run full test to see how it really

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.140 
run full test to see how it really
performs<00:02:46.989> all<00:02:47.680> right<00:02:47.859> so<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.099> it<00:02:48.459> requires<00:02:49.030> an

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
performs all right so you it requires an

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.699 
performs all right so you it requires an
email<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.510> password<00:02:49.900> for<00:02:50.049> test<00:02:50.260> purposes<00:02:50.379> i'm

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
email and password for test purposes i'm

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.229 
email and password for test purposes i'm
not<00:02:50.829> going<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.010> bother<00:02:51.099> with<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:51.489> we<00:02:52.060> can

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
not going to bother with this we can

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.849 
not going to bother with this we can
skip<00:02:52.569> this<00:02:52.750> by<00:02:52.930> saying<00:02:53.139> you<00:02:53.349> may<00:02:53.470> skip<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
skip this by saying you may skip the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
signing it as a guest let's choose that

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.220 
signing it as a guest let's choose that
option<00:02:57.989> and<00:03:00.389> the<00:03:01.389> first<00:03:01.569> thing<00:03:01.689> that<00:03:01.780> boots<00:03:02.079> up

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
option and the first thing that boots up

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.509 
option and the first thing that boots up
is<00:03:02.379> of<00:03:02.530> course<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.189> chrome<00:03:03.579> browser<00:03:05.519> all

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
is of course the chrome browser all

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.520 
is of course the chrome browser all
right<00:03:06.790> let's<00:03:07.629> see<00:03:07.810> what<00:03:07.840> else<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.230> here<00:03:08.409> you

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
right let's see what else is here you

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.949 
right let's see what else is here you
have<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.889> familiar<00:03:09.819> windows<00:03:10.030> taskbar<00:03:10.599> and

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
have the familiar windows taskbar and

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.140 
have the familiar windows taskbar and
instead<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.950> start<00:03:12.609> button<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.030> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
instead of the start button you have the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.660 
instead of the start button you have the
google<00:03:13.450> chrome<00:03:13.720> start<00:03:14.049> button<00:03:14.379> and<00:03:14.670> that's

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
google chrome start button and that's

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.369 
google chrome start button and that's
your<00:03:15.879> that's<00:03:15.970> all<00:03:16.180> right<00:03:16.299> there<00:03:16.540> i<00:03:16.750> think<00:03:17.290> this

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
your that's all right there i think this

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.020

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
the apps that have come along with this

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.309 
the apps that have come along with this
you<00:03:21.340> can<00:03:21.760> download<00:03:22.150> more<00:03:22.449> from<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.840> store<00:03:23.109> no

you can download more from the store no

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.400 
you can download more from the store no
doubt<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.739> might<00:03:24.669> I<00:03:24.699> say<00:03:24.819> that<00:03:25.299> this<00:03:25.690> touchpad

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
doubt and might I say that this touchpad

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.640 
doubt and might I say that this touchpad
is<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.010> little<00:03:27.579> well<00:03:28.419> not<00:03:28.870> as<00:03:28.989> smooth<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.440> think<00:03:29.590> I

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
is a little well not as smooth I think I

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.470 
is a little well not as smooth I think I
have<00:03:29.769> to<00:03:29.859> make<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.069> more<00:03:30.190> sensitive<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:31.389> my
