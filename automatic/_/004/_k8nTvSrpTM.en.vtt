00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 50 first dates but without adam sandler 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.140
 and with high school teenagers it 's very 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.400
 when one begins to see this series 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.070
 I think the first thing that comes to mind 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.590
 head is that movie you know mine 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.990
 has an accident begin to loop the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.670
 memories adam sandler the cones and of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.800
 somehow he manages to have 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 a relationship with her in this series is 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.850
 something similar because the mine also 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.830
 have memory loss but it is 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 selective because everything is forgotten 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.519
 related to administrations by 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.710
 that that takes a pretty attitude 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.989
 unfriendly and tactless because he knows 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.610
 that if you are very fond of the course 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.940
 is going to forget everything a week that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.940
 follow 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 there is a gap all this because the loss 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.920
 of memory is limited to erase 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.809
 good experiences with friends and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.510
 the prota what he wants is to try to be 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.339
 the groom the point and the question of everything 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.980
 this is just that, that is, how 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.860
 win the skinny and get out of that 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.930
 friend zone in the form of loss 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.759
 memory to see the first thing that comes to me 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.920
 to the head is to make the skinny 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.299
 make a diary that just the idea 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 that gives him the prota so that he goes noticing 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.320
 all experiences what I get 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.690
 comes to mind two issues number 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.030
 one or the skinny one never goes through 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.800
 the head write a diary or the mother 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.380
 or the doctor never gave them that 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.659
 suggestion and number two write the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.460
 Daily is not every day what 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.009
 it would end up becoming something more 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.929
 great that the fat book of petete is 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.850
 imagine the skinny woman reading everything 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.610
 I remember the kid in a diary size 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.679
 serious encyclopedia a car but good 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.330
 The point is for the skinny man to paddle her 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.330
 with attention and timoshenko 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.290
 in chapter 1 the routine is established 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.210
 of how you are going to give the relationship 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.430
 has chapter 2 in the middle train as 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.229
 that the thing did not change much so 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.370
 I hope they vary a bit from the 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.290
 formula not go being 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.940
 repeated during every week 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.619
 because we agree that the characters 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.840
 they are not the most charismatic and 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.160
 fun I've seen besides I saw the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.500
 opening too and it seems that they are going to 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.180
 add a couple more characters besides 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.649
 that they will be swinging along with 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.140
 the emotional tension of the characters 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.880
 main because we're going to see drama 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.250
 and surely that if the girl continues 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.900
 reading that newspaper with the prescriptions or 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.209
 sentimental forgetting how happy they are 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.130
 are your little friends that emotional tension 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.110
 or that emotional charge as you want to say 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.270
 is going to explode in the form of bad 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.280
 understood , I tell you mostly about the 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.800
 protagonist who has that tendency of 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.060
 say kind words and have that 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.220
 Sincerity to see you that will end 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.709
 unnecessarily complicating the relationship 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.320
 for trying every moment to be the boyfriend 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.320
 well that's because you're this kid 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.830
 in that sense the friend of the bud has 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.600
 the post because it shows that it has more 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.970
 head that he at the time of giving him a 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.130
 advice more openly and despite 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.020
 that it does not have as much use to the 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.790
 time to tell him it shows that he meets 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.540
 pretty well the support role as 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.540
 friend of iron 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.280
 they are also dakota and you know me 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.280
 I wanted so much that I want to walk you 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.490
 from then on I do not have much to 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.290
 add because chapter 3 is 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.780
 built so that they put the friend 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.700
 of the protagonist in his group and from there 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.770
 I will also deny that there is a scene 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.390
 from drama very bad to the last where it was 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.940
 seed starts to cry in the class of 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.320
 mathematics because he saw the number 18 and 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.900
 when the protagonist asks him 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.430
 it says is not that the number 18 represents 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.610
 the amount of eggs he had to 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.740
 do cooking 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.420
 in that kind of thing I mean that 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.850
 the more he writes in the newspaper the more 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.650
 emotional tension and more misunderstandings 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.850
 they are going to have but there is something more than 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.230
 so I have a little something more comment 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.170
 shit that nobody ages in this world 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.210
 It is the dream of every good woman you know 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.450
 lay mind blank we do not know people 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.319
 in the next video 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.319
 no no
