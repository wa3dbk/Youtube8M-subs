 hi my name is miguel rodrÃ­guez and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.680
 this is the podcast of this method 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.200
 dotcom today in chapter 4 we are going to 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.990
 talk about the canon m 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.450
 20 efe script s 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.570
 this is a camera that is capable of 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.960
 reach a made 4 million which 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.359
 just launched 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.090
 and has a sensitivity that was almost 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.640
 impossible so far 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.960
 for example the normal camera have 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:36.170
 as standard sensitivity an iso 100 and 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.300
 they can only get good images 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:44.820
 between made 6400 or 12 thousand 800 depending 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.820
 If the sensor is full frame or not 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.489
 This camera has a 2.26 sensor 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.160
 megapixels with a maximum resolution of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.240
 full hd 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.490
 some of the applications would be 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.130
 for documentaries that require recording 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.940
 videos in complete darkness reality 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.670
 show astrophotography and applications 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.640
 cinematographic 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.140
 record a video made 4 million 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.200
 means that the camera will be watching 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.990
 much better than you in almost complete 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.490
 darkness in fact the night should 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.220
 look almost like the day 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.800
 but for this the sensor will require 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.490
 of a lot of energy 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.880
 what will produce it to be hot and for 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.420
 that 's the design that we see that is so 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.000
 I miss that basically a cube 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.710
 that apparently is not more than the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.580
 sensor container with two 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.060
 fans on the sides to cool the 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.060
 sensor 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.790
 with a lens mount that's why 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.120
 we see that it is not economic but that 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.980
 a bucket with two fan 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.940
 then canon 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.760
 apparently it has been several years 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.340
 developing the and in fact in 2013 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.930
 they presented a test where 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.479
 refer to the camera sensor 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.390
 this is undoubtedly a technological achievement 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.060
 very important but I do not know what 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.000
 passes canon that insists now in 2015 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.670
 with a camera with a maximum resolution of 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.680
 full hd knowing that both 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.760
 televisions like the monitors of 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.270
 new computer 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.000
 with 4k resolution they are going down 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.760
 price very quickly and especially 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.190
 in the case of this camera that is nothing 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.610
 economic with a price of 30 thousand 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.610
 Dollars 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.879
 that's all for today here I'm going to leave you 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:48.160
 the previous chapters of the podcast do not 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.040
 forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.610
 I like 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.610
 without more
