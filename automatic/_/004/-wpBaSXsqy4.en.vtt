00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 today I am going to present you a 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.020
 rare specimen that you probably have 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.839
 never seen 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.670
 here it is an actinidia then a 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.099
 actinidia simply it's a kiwi 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.769
 but this one is at least 60 years old 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.049
 to have a lot of fruits in mind 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.410
 have been grafted a bad foot and a feet 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.270
 females 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.000
 we'll have to plant it now 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.039
 in its final location then seen 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 the size of the basin I called 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.310
 a few friends to help me because I 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.500
 will never happen alone the india act 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
 needs a sunny exposure 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.390
 to be able to bloom well and so 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.309
 grow and then a regular organic soil 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.920
 relatively well drained enough 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.149
 here is the decompacting is over there 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.280
 we now have to pay 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.180
 the organic amendment to enrich the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.180
 soil before planting 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:56.250
 here it is following operations 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.210
 the installation of actine idia and there I 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.360
 I'm really happy not to be everything 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.360
 only 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 luckily that the main fashion she 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.510
 is grid we're going to do that's all 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.510
 who is in the pot in the in the hole 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.620
 now we're going to turn it for who 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.240
 leans on the wall because kiwis 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.820
 need are lianas so they have 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.290
 need some support to run so 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.670
 either strikes trellises 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.400
 pergolas and that's where we'll do it 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:45.150
 run on the wall so we 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:47.310
 oriente is falling like that we check 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.800
 the height is good we are 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.880
 practically at the level of dutroux so 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.260
 okay it is not obliged to 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.150
 come out and put back of the earth what 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.660
 is not bad and we will be able to start 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.850
 reseal 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.080
 so we all look forward to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.060
 October to be able to taste the 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.060
 first fruits and then thank you guys
