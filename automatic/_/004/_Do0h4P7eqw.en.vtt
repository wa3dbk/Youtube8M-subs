00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.910
 good afternoon dear friends constantine 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.429
 vyskogo paw company again with you 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.700
 today we will tell about such a thing as 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.429
 ordinary headphones plug-in so-called 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.480
 vacuum I prefer you now 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.189
 sony headphones are not high price 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.010
 have these headphones something within 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.480
 about 450 rubles x 50 series alpin by 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 the main feature that is good 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.669
 sound good bass but as 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.250
 all inexpensive headphones i mean they 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.270
 are considered consumable why 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.600
 this is so then see me here 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.730
 Headphones average hold about 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.680
 probably six months the most important 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.940
 the feature is that the headphones are also all 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.789
 sony firms only thing that syria 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.399
 in my opinion 10 out of 10 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.640
 that is , what is special about all 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.039
 these headphones using their laptop then 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.100
 I do not use any cellular players 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.110
 the phone is nothing but with the laptop itself 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 the main thing for me is plus what is available 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.939
 corner jab i mean three and a half 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.780
 millimeter he is angular 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.670
 it is very comfortable with gilt so I will say 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.340
 and they are perfect enough in the ear 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.840
 that is, they are these interchangeable pads they 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:33.259
 very soft that is, those who know each 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.259
 that is, they are roughly from that series of goats 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.680
 sleigh from about that series of goats series about 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.899
 the hatch was called made super soft 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.619
 part that is this ear cushion was very 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.290
 soft they are very small but compact 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.799
 At the same time, what is the disadvantage of the 10 series 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.570
 short and let's say protective 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.719
 this one here is a small element 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.360
 plastic part and this one is plastic 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.950
 part honestly say in white headphones then 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.950
 there is one ear does not work that is here 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.799
 this ear of a worker 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.039
 since I will honestly tell you somewhere here 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:15.239
 that simply leaves contact that is, these 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.310
 headphones on the image in black ink 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.310
 work worked perfect everything 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.030
 wonderful but with very active 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.720
 use see which minus 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:32.810
 appeared that is it is very active 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:37.620
 use that is, let's say that 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.050
 since you twisted and you fought 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.450
 Ie repairability principle 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.599
 is subject but not someone to do it 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.870
 because well the cost is penny again 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:54.150
 that is, in principle, they served their 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:56.370
 the main feature of 10 Syria from 50 here 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.730
 our principle is considered not gilded 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.739
 and do you bob magnet here 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.230
 which are used yes here are neodymium 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.580
 magnets but he goes to my 8 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.680
 millimeters there is 9 millimeter then 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.950
 there is packaging here packaging was a circle 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.769
 round now on the internet the price of such 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.810
 Headphones rubles 200 300 but quality 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.540
 sound they have a pretty good hotel 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.379
 for a laptop this is suitable for the eyes 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.810
 there is it just the option when bought 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.349
 used what happened there 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.890
 threw it all out consumable yet 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.110
 consumables 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.760
 That is, the price is a penny you need this 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.879
 cheap price sound quality 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.069
 good enough here with us 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.920
 packaging is already better 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:52.409
 Russian warranty card by the way at sony 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:54.239
 As far as I know, there are problems because 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.400
 they have the only service center 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.330
 so here we have a European warranty 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.330
 coupon instructions 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.270
 the classics of the genre is nothing like that 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.880
 principle than not liked what 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.590
 different size i.e. different size 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.540
 more hands that is highlighted by this one 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.340
 color meaning it is either green or 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:28.280
 reds here you see color there is 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.860
 they have different sound qualities now 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.110
 I'll check it out. I'll tell you honestly. I'm sure 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.350
 that the sound quality is very good and 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:41.600
 so here are the guys clips for storage 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.270
 buy headphones use that is 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.900
 those who, in principle, doubt cheap 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.520
 but take good earphones yourself 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.200
 spend 500 rubles you will not regret 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.960
 the quality will no longer suit you 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.570
 especially low mids ie 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.229
 they allow you to give out well in general 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:03.200
 I picked up the headphones because 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:06.289
 that i have an ultrabook movie 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.390
 fujitsu-siemens sound quality 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:12.340
 was not very good because even 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:16.490
 my old laptop asus 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.350
 sounds much better i mean i started 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.250
 select headphones respectively here 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.080
 stopped here on these models 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.800
 all good subscribe put 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.310
 huskies 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.310
 choose headphones naturally I, too 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:36.169
 I know that the case itself audio and goats 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:39.470
 make but more such expensive headphones and 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.360
 better but i use them then 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.550
 there are about three four five months 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.070
 then naturally if something happens 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.930
 I throw them out buy new here 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.660
 it makes no sense to spend money on more than any 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.740
 expensive things because you can and boyars 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.080
