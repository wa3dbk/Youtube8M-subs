00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
that I would cross a line like point two

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.380 
that I would cross a line like point two
I<00:03:44.200> can<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.100> won<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.520> I<00:03:45.580> just<00:03:46.180> can't

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
I can I and I won and I just can't

00:03:46.390 --> 00:04:13.900

believe<00:03:46.480> it

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:06:51.779 

take<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.060> out<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.210> put

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:51.789 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.779 

it<00:06:52.789> was<00:06:52.999> a<00:06:53.529> man<00:06:54.529> the<00:06:54.740> run<00:06:54.860> was<00:06:55.039> going<00:06:55.339> awesome

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
it was a man the run was going awesome

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:58.779 
it was a man the run was going awesome
and<00:06:56.089> then<00:06:56.300> I<00:06:56.419> I<00:06:56.990> ran<00:06:57.559> over<00:06:57.589> some<00:06:58.069> poles<00:06:58.370> right

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
and then I I ran over some poles right

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.329 
and then I I ran over some poles right
before<00:06:59.120> the<00:06:59.210> split<00:06:59.449> like<00:06:59.870> almost<00:07:00.860> got<00:07:01.129> the

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:01.339 
before the split like almost got the

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:03.519 
before the split like almost got the
track<00:07:01.580> just<00:07:01.879> barely<00:07:02.240> kept<00:07:02.629> it<00:07:02.779> in<00:07:02.900> line<00:07:03.110> and<00:07:03.379> I

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:03.529 
track just barely kept it in line and I

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:05.469 
track just barely kept it in line and I
thought<00:07:03.949> first<00:07:04.580> second<00:07:05.029> I<00:07:05.089> was<00:07:05.240> going<00:07:05.449> down

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 
thought first second I was going down

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.149 
thought first second I was going down
but<00:07:05.659> I<00:07:05.930> managed<00:07:06.229> to<00:07:06.289> kind<00:07:06.499> of<00:07:06.559> bunny<00:07:06.740> hop<00:07:06.949> back

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159 
but I managed to kind of bunny hop back

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:09.189 
but I managed to kind of bunny hop back
over<00:07:07.520> and<00:07:07.639> it<00:07:08.419> was<00:07:08.539> good<00:07:08.629> and<00:07:08.779> then<00:07:09.080> down

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 
over and it was good and then down

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.510 
over and it was good and then down
towards<00:07:09.469> the<00:07:09.559> bottom<00:07:09.710> somewhere<00:07:10.039> my<00:07:10.279> chain

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
towards the bottom somewhere my chain

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.269 
towards the bottom somewhere my chain
came<00:07:10.759> off<00:07:10.789> again<00:07:11.240> and<00:07:11.870> then<00:07:12.110> it<00:07:12.319> likely<00:07:12.919> went

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:13.279 
came off again and then it likely went

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:16.480 
came off again and then it likely went
back<00:07:13.430> on<00:07:13.669> so<00:07:13.990> man<00:07:14.990> wild<00:07:15.289> run<00:07:15.620> though<00:07:15.830> so<00:07:16.129> short

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
back on so man wild run though so short

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.769 
back on so man wild run though so short
