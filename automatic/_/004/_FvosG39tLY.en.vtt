way<00:01:58.920> rounds<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.790> go<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.090> way<00:02:00.270> round<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
way rounds we can go this way round and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.950 
way rounds we can go this way round and
plug<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.040> charge<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.579> synchronize<00:02:03.030> or<00:02:03.689> we

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
plug in to charge and synchronize or we

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.539 
plug in to charge and synchronize or we
can<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.320> fact<00:02:04.350> plug<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> other<00:02:05.369> way

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
can in fact plug it in the other way

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.719 
can in fact plug it in the other way
round<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:07.020> still<00:02:07.290> plugs<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.220> how<00:02:08.489> cool

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
round and it's still plugs in how cool
