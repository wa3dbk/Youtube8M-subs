that July has put down a third because
if<00:05:10.010> it<00:05:10.220> was<00:05:10.340> going<00:05:10.490> for<00:05:10.610> two<00:05:10.700> base<00:05:10.850> building

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
if it was going for two base building

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.360 
if it was going for two base building
most<00:05:11.419> likely<00:05:11.660> would<00:05:11.810> have<00:05:11.870> had<00:05:12.050> tech<00:05:12.370> early

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
most likely would have had tech early

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.260 
most likely would have had tech early
coming<00:05:13.850> in<00:05:15.639> already<00:05:16.639> would<00:05:16.850> have<00:05:16.940> had<00:05:17.060> tech

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
coming in already would have had tech

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.490 
coming in already would have had tech
coming<00:05:17.450> in<00:05:17.600> as<00:05:17.660> well<00:05:17.750> as<00:05:17.870> a<00:05:17.930> lair<00:05:18.110> on<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.380> way

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
coming in as well as a lair on the way

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.750 
coming in as well as a lair on the way
it's<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.800> little<00:05:19.010> bit<00:05:19.100> doing<00:05:19.310> in<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.460> opposite

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
it's a little bit doing in the opposite

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.850 
it's a little bit doing in the opposite
side<00:05:19.910> coming<00:05:20.060> for<00:05:20.270> stats<00:05:20.450> so<00:05:20.660> he<00:05:21.110> could<00:05:21.680> be<00:05:21.770> go

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
side coming for stats so he could be go

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.920 
side coming for stats so he could be go
for<00:05:22.010> DTS<00:05:22.340> here<00:05:22.699> most<00:05:23.270> likely<00:05:23.539> gonna<00:05:23.600> go<00:05:23.750> for

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
for DTS here most likely gonna go for

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.779 
for DTS here most likely gonna go for
DTS<00:05:24.199> I<00:05:24.440> haven't<00:05:24.680> seen<00:05:24.800> dt's<00:05:25.100> used<00:05:25.280> on<00:05:25.430> this<00:05:25.550> map

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
DTS I haven't seen dt's used on this map

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.090 
DTS I haven't seen dt's used on this map
and<00:05:26.380> looking<00:05:27.380> at<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.530> positioning<00:05:27.919> of<00:05:27.979> it

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
and looking at the positioning of it

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.370 
and looking at the positioning of it
they<00:05:28.370> could<00:05:28.550> be<00:05:28.669> fairly<00:05:28.990> effective<00:05:29.990> dementia

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
they could be fairly effective dementia

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.629 
they could be fairly effective dementia
extra<00:05:30.590> penetrate<00:05:30.950> right<00:05:31.100> inside<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.490> base

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
extra penetrate right inside the base

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:32.940 
extra penetrate right inside the base
and<00:05:31.789> do<00:05:31.880> some<00:05:32.030> decent<00:05:32.300> amount<00:05:32.450> of<00:05:32.479> damage

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
and do some decent amount of damage

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.080 
and do some decent amount of damage
finally<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.070> probes<00:05:34.340> got<00:05:34.550> me<00:05:34.669> to<00:05:34.789> kill<00:05:34.940> by

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
finally the probes got me to kill by

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.000 
finally the probes got me to kill by
July<00:05:35.389> Zurich<00:05:35.750> as<00:05:35.900> he<00:05:36.050> adds<00:05:36.200> in<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:36.740> fourth
