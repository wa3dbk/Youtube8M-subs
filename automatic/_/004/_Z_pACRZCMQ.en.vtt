00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
however when the conditions are just

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.410 
however when the conditions are just
right<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.160> they<00:00:23.460> all<00:00:23.640> decide<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.269> move

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
right and they all decide to move

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.019 
right and they all decide to move
together<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:25.140> one<00:00:25.380> they<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.400> become<00:00:26.730> one<00:00:26.939> of

the most destructive forces imaginable

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130 
the most destructive forces imaginable
and<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:30.060> definitely<00:00:30.570> something<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.109> be

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and are definitely something to be

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:52.970 
and are definitely something to be
treated<00:00:31.650> with<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> utmost<00:00:32.430> respect

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.729 

the<00:00:53.980> avalanche<00:00:54.399> risk<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.789> very<00:00:55.149> real

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the avalanche risk is very real

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.840 
the avalanche risk is very real
everywhere<00:00:56.739> in<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:56.920> backcountry<00:00:57.250> especially

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
everywhere in the backcountry especially

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.000 
everywhere in the backcountry especially
here<00:00:58.000> in<00:00:58.059> British<00:00:58.300> Columbia<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:58.930> a<00:00:58.960> lot<00:00:59.890> of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
here in British Columbia and a lot of

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.530 
here in British Columbia and a lot of
people<00:01:00.250> lose<00:01:00.370> their<00:01:00.579> lives<00:01:00.760> or<00:01:01.030> get<00:01:01.210> get

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
people lose their lives or get get

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.350 
people lose their lives or get get
really<00:01:01.780> damaged<00:01:02.550> traveling<00:01:03.550> around<00:01:03.820> so<00:01:04.059> we<00:01:04.180> do

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
really damaged traveling around so we do

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.350 
really damaged traveling around so we do
everything<00:01:04.989> we<00:01:05.229> can<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.409> mitigate<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.009> risk

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
everything we can to mitigate the risk

everything we can to mitigate the risk
avalanche<00:01:07.360> control<00:01:07.570> has<00:01:08.290> been<00:01:08.649> a<00:01:08.680> huge<00:01:09.040> issue

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
avalanche control has been a huge issue

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.149 
avalanche control has been a huge issue
for<00:01:10.210> this<00:01:10.300> event<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:11.140> whole<00:01:11.290> way<00:01:11.500> through<00:01:11.530> you

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
for this event the whole way through you

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.710 
for this event the whole way through you
know<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.280> think<00:01:12.369> we're<00:01:12.580> lucky<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.940> have<00:01:12.970> some<00:01:13.540> of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
know I think we're lucky to have some of

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.660 
know I think we're lucky to have some of
really<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.500> best<00:01:14.770> in<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.070> world

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670

disposal that are passionate about this
project<00:01:20.500> -<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.890> need<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.369> do<00:01:24.460> more<00:01:24.670> Avalanche

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149

project - we need to do more Avalanche
control<00:01:25.539> than<00:01:25.690> what<00:01:25.780> we<00:01:25.899> would<00:01:26.050> normally<00:01:26.200> do

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
control than what we would normally do

control than what we would normally do
at<00:01:26.830> bald-faced<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.630> we<00:01:28.750> brought<00:01:28.899> in<00:01:29.050> this

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
at bald-faced so we brought in this

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.499 
at bald-faced so we brought in this
special<00:01:29.649> device<00:01:29.800> called<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.369> daisy<00:01:30.789> bell'<00:01:31.149> for

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.249 
avalanche control
that's<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:33.009> hydrogen<00:01:33.729> oxygen<00:01:34.090> exploder<00:01:34.720> that

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
that's a hydrogen oxygen exploder that

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.320 
that's a hydrogen oxygen exploder that
delivers<00:01:35.770> about<00:01:35.979> an<00:01:36.070> eight<00:01:36.190> kilo<00:01:36.580> charge<00:01:36.940> and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
delivers about an eight kilo charge and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.960 
delivers about an eight kilo charge and
we<00:01:37.840> fly<00:01:38.050> it<00:01:38.110> under<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.440> helicopter<00:01:39.039> it's<00:01:39.880> a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
we fly it under the helicopter it's a

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.880 
we fly it under the helicopter it's a
new<00:01:40.149> device<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.479> allows<00:01:41.020> us<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.380> pinpoint

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
new device that allows us to pinpoint

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.480 
new device that allows us to pinpoint
and<00:01:42.539> repeatedly<00:01:43.539> blast<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.830> sweet<00:01:45.069> spots<00:01:45.310> on

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
and repeatedly blast the sweet spots on

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.130 
and repeatedly blast the sweet spots on
the<00:01:45.580> slope<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.060> on<00:01:46.210> adjacent<00:01:46.509> slope<00:01:46.929> so<00:01:47.110> we

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
the slope and on adjacent slope so we

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.510 
the slope and on adjacent slope so we
could<00:01:47.319> get<00:01:47.409> an<00:01:47.560> idea<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:47.920> what<00:01:48.130> was<00:01:48.220> going<00:01:48.280> on

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
could get an idea of what was going on

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.700 
could get an idea of what was going on
with<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.729> snowpack<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.229> pretty<00:01:50.470> cool

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
with the snowpack it's a pretty cool

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.100 
with the snowpack it's a pretty cool
little<00:01:50.950> new<00:01:51.640> piece<00:01:52.119> of<00:01:52.270> technology<00:01:52.869> I<00:01:52.960> think

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
little new piece of technology I think

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.480 
little new piece of technology I think
there's<00:01:53.289> three<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.679> North<00:01:53.830> America<00:01:54.310> right<00:01:54.429> now

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
there's three in North America right now

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.790 
there's three in North America right now
and<00:01:55.240> even<00:01:55.479> with<00:01:55.600> all<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:55.840> there's<00:01:56.590> always

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
and even with all that there's always

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.469 
and even with all that there's always
this<00:01:57.009> little<00:01:57.220> bit<00:01:57.429> of<00:01:57.520> an<00:01:57.610> unknown<00:01:57.759> factor<00:01:58.330> out

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
this little bit of an unknown factor out

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.400 
this little bit of an unknown factor out
there<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:58.840> that's<00:01:59.020> what<00:01:59.229> we're<00:01:59.380> really

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
there and that's what we're really

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.320 
there and that's what we're really
trying<00:01:59.860> to<00:02:00.069> nail<00:02:00.340> down<00:02:00.369> is<00:02:00.819> what<00:02:01.060> is<00:02:01.179> the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
trying to nail down is what is the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.809 
trying to nail down is what is the
unknown<00:02:01.479> factor<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:02.259> what<00:02:02.440> can<00:02:02.590> we<00:02:02.679> do<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.039> try

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
unknown factor and what can we do to try

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.599 
unknown factor and what can we do to try
to<00:02:03.880> mitigate<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.390> risk
