so<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.590> walk<00:01:09.400> you<00:01:09.610> through<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:09.940> here

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
so to walk you through it here

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.840 
so to walk you through it here
Stirling's<00:01:11.530> gonna<00:01:11.680> activate<00:01:12.250> this<00:01:12.430> linear

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
Stirling's gonna activate this linear

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.700 
Stirling's gonna activate this linear
actuator<00:01:13.120> that's<00:01:13.720> gonna<00:01:13.870> push<00:01:14.140> down<00:01:14.380> on<00:01:14.410> the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
actuator that's gonna push down on the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.470 
actuator that's gonna push down on the
pedal<00:01:14.860> spindle<00:01:15.400> and<00:01:15.490> simulate<00:01:15.940> a<00:01:15.970> pedaling

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
pedal spindle and simulate a pedaling

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.450 
pedal spindle and simulate a pedaling
load<00:01:16.690> we've<00:01:17.320> got<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.530> chain<00:01:17.920> wrapped<00:01:18.280> around

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
load we've got a chain wrapped around

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.520 
load we've got a chain wrapped around
the<00:01:19.000> chain<00:01:19.270> ring<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.750> cassette<00:01:20.140> which<00:01:20.350> is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
the chain ring to the cassette which is

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.880 
the chain ring to the cassette which is
fixed<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.260> applies<00:01:23.560> load

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
fixed and as it applies load

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.410 
fixed and as it applies load
everything's<00:01:24.370> going<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.640> deflect<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.300> we're

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
everything's going to deflect and we're

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.380 
everything's going to deflect and we're
gonna<00:01:25.540> measure<00:01:25.810> force<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.650> displacement<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
gonna measure force and displacement and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.760 
gonna measure force and displacement and
the<00:01:28.630> slope<00:01:28.870> of<00:01:28.990> that<00:01:29.050> force<00:01:29.410> and<00:01:29.620> displacement

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
the slope of that force and displacement

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.310 
the slope of that force and displacement
curve<00:01:30.370> tells<00:01:30.700> us<00:01:30.880> what<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.210> stiffness<00:01:31.630> is<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
curve tells us what the stiffness is the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.740 
curve tells us what the stiffness is the
steeper<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.920> curve<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:34.210> stiffer<00:01:34.630> the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
steeper that curve the stiffer the

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.420 
steeper that curve the stiffer the
system<00:01:35.110> so<00:01:36.100> all<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.700> sterling<00:01:36.970> take<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.480> away

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.190 

so<00:01:42.430> we're<00:01:42.610> very<00:01:42.640> slowly<00:01:43.270> applying<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.990> load

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
so we're very slowly applying the load

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.560 
so we're very slowly applying the load
and<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:44.710> can<00:01:44.860> see<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.760> numbers<00:01:46.090> up<00:01:46.270> there<00:01:46.300> in

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
and you can see the numbers up there in

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.000 
and you can see the numbers up there in
the<00:01:46.690> upper<00:01:46.900> left<00:01:47.140> corner<00:01:47.350> that's<00:01:47.680> how<00:01:47.830> much

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
the upper left corner that's how much

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.720 
the upper left corner that's how much
force<00:01:48.310> or<00:01:49.050> applying<00:01:50.050> in<00:01:50.290> real<00:01:50.440> time<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.310> we're

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
force or applying in real time and we're

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:59.410 
force or applying in real time and we're
starting<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.150> see<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.510> plot<00:01:52.750> form<00:01:53.080> there

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.820 

and<00:01:59.900> I<00:01:59.960> think<00:02:00.140> we're<00:02:00.260> gonna<00:02:00.350> run<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.710> up<00:02:00.800> to

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
and I think we're gonna run it up to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.180 
and I think we're gonna run it up to
about<00:02:01.070> 200<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.880> 250<00:02:02.480> pounds<00:02:03.140> keep<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.040> within

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
about 200 to 250 pounds keep it within

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.060 
about 200 to 250 pounds keep it within
the<00:02:04.340> realm<00:02:04.640> of<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.510> force<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.050> actual<00:02:06.800> rider

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
the realm of the force that actual rider

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.590 
the realm of the force that actual rider
can<00:02:07.340> impart<00:02:07.610> on<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.970> bike<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:11.210> that<00:02:11.270> should

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
can impart on the bike and that should

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.290 
can impart on the bike and that should
provide<00:02:11.870> us<00:02:11.930> enough<00:02:12.260> data<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.970> analyze<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
provide us enough data to analyze to

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.030 
provide us enough data to analyze to
determine<00:02:14.330> what<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.170> actual<00:02:15.440> stiffness<00:02:15.920> of

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
determine what the actual stiffness of

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.130 
determine what the actual stiffness of
this<00:02:16.190> entire<00:02:16.520> system<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.750> right<00:02:17.930> now<00:02:18.080> we

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
this entire system is so right now we

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.980
