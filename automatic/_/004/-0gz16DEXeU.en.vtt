note<00:01:45.170> like<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:45.800> go<00:01:47.110> 1210<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:49.100> opening

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
note like that so go 1210 so the opening

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.440 
note like that so go 1210 so the opening
two<00:01:50.030> beats<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:51.250> like<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.430> now<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.210> happens

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
two beats is like that now that happens

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.090 
two beats is like that now that happens
to<00:01:53.540> repeat<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.170> once<00:01:54.380> you've<00:01:54.500> got<00:01:54.710> that<00:01:54.890> little

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
to repeat so once you've got that little

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.070 
to repeat so once you've got that little
to<00:01:55.430> beat<00:01:55.610> section<00:01:56.000> down<00:01:56.150> you<00:01:56.420> kind<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:56.720> have

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
to beat section down you kind of have

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.290 
to beat section down you kind of have
most<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.620> lick<00:01:57.800> as<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.460> goes

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.420 

like<00:02:03.300> that<00:02:03.510> then<00:02:04.470> you're<00:02:04.800> gonna<00:02:04.950> shift<00:02:05.220> all

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
like that then you're gonna shift all

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.070 
like that then you're gonna shift all
the<00:02:05.490> way<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:06.030> second<00:02:06.360> second<00:02:06.810> position

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
the way to the second second position

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.840 
the way to the second second position
remember<00:02:07.260> when<00:02:07.500> we<00:02:07.680> call<00:02:08.160> first<00:02:08.399> position

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
remember when we call first position

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.609 
remember when we call first position
second<00:02:09.119> position<00:02:09.149> things<00:02:09.570> like<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.869> it's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
second position things like that it's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.550 
second position things like that it's
it's<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.130> system<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.850> kind<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.560> describing

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it's a system of kind of describing

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.780 
it's a system of kind of describing
where<00:02:13.800> you're<00:02:13.950> playing<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.400> neck<00:02:14.610> by

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
where you're playing on the neck by

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.280 
where you're playing on the neck by
saying<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.300> if<00:02:15.390> you're<00:02:15.510> using<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:16.020> finger

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
saying that if you're using one finger

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.070 
saying that if you're using one finger
per<00:02:16.590> fret<00:02:16.620> discipline<00:02:17.550> 2nd<00:02:18.390> position<00:02:18.570> means

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
per fret discipline 2nd position means

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.420 
per fret discipline 2nd position means
your<00:02:19.200> index<00:02:19.470> finger<00:02:19.710> would<00:02:19.800> be<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.070> second

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
your index finger would be on the second

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.760 
your index finger would be on the second
fret<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.850> that's<00:02:21.000> where<00:02:21.240> I'm<00:02:21.330> at<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.620> you

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
fret and that's where I'm at and if you

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.180 
fret and that's where I'm at and if you
look<00:02:23.040> at<00:02:23.310> beats<00:02:23.790> beat<00:02:24.570> three<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.800> second

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
look at beats beat three of the second

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.950 
look at beats beat three of the second
measure<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.730> starts<00:02:27.060> again<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.510> same<00:02:27.690> to

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
measure it starts again with the same to

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.790 
measure it starts again with the same to
open<00:02:28.290> A's<00:02:28.760> then<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.880> play<00:02:30.120> second<00:02:31.020> fret<00:02:31.230> third

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
open A's then you play second fret third

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.820 
open A's then you play second fret third
fret<00:02:32.070> fifth<00:02:32.790> fret<00:02:32.900> second<00:02:33.900> fret<00:02:33.990> fifth<00:02:34.740> fret

fret fifth fret second fret fifth fret

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.940 
fret fifth fret second fret fifth fret
and<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:39.140> you<00:02:40.140> want<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.470> isolate<00:02:40.800> that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
and it's you want just isolate that

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.350 
and it's you want just isolate that
element<00:02:41.400> before<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.970> put<00:02:42.150> them<00:02:42.240> together

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
element before you put them together

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360 
element before you put them together
make<00:02:43.230> sure<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.590> play<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.890> part

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
make sure you can play this part

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.800 
make sure you can play this part
clean<00:02:44.640> link<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.180> play<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:45.540> part

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
clean link and then play this part

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.960 
clean link and then play this part
cleaner<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.890> then<00:02:47.160> once<00:02:47.670> you've<00:02:47.790> done<00:02:47.910> that

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
cleaner and then once you've done that

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.410 
cleaner and then once you've done that
at<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.300> slow<00:02:48.630> tempo<00:02:48.900> with<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.680> maybe<00:02:50.190> a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
at a slow tempo with like maybe a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.250 
at a slow tempo with like maybe a
metronome<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.510> kind<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.780> keep<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:51.990> consistent

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
metronome to kind of keep you consistent

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.230 
metronome to kind of keep you consistent
then<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.130> want<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.340> put<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.610> all<00:02:53.700> together<00:02:53.850> and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
then you want to put it all together and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:09.010 
then you want to put it all together and
slowly<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.900> sound<00:02:55.140> like<00:02:55.260> this

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.940 

now<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.080> important<00:03:10.440> thing<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.650> don't<00:03:10.770> just

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
now the important thing is don't just

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.910 
now the important thing is don't just
play<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.220> one<00:03:11.370> time<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.760> stop<00:03:11.970> repeat<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.920> many

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
play it one time and stop repeat it many

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.160 
play it one time and stop repeat it many
times<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.520> because<00:03:14.820> you're<00:03:15.510> developing<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
times and because you're developing the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.630 
times and because you're developing the
spit<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> skill<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.310> able<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.520> play

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
spit of the skill to be able to play

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.850 
spit of the skill to be able to play
here<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.300> down<00:03:18.510> here<00:03:18.840> then<00:03:19.200> back<00:03:19.470> up<00:03:19.650> here

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
here then down here then back up here

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.530 
here then down here then back up here
cleanly<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.400> down<00:03:20.670> here<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.030> kind<00:03:21.510> of

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
cleanly and down here and kind of

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.210 
cleanly and down here and kind of
getting<00:03:21.810> your<00:03:21.900> hand<00:03:22.140> used<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.500> moving<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.040> two

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
getting your hand used to moving to two

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.390 
getting your hand used to moving to two
ranges<00:03:23.670> or<00:03:23.910> two<00:03:24.120> zones<00:03:24.420> on<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.080> fingerboard

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
ranges or two zones on the fingerboard

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.400 
ranges or two zones on the fingerboard
so<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.700> pretty<00:03:26.970> self-explanatory<00:03:27.330> pretty<00:03:28.140> easy

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
so a pretty self-explanatory pretty easy

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.070 
so a pretty self-explanatory pretty easy

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
work out each section by itself until

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.030 
work out each section by itself until
you<00:03:33.690> can<00:03:33.810> play<00:03:33.900> cleanly<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.440> consistently

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
you can play cleanly and consistently

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.350 
you can play cleanly and consistently
and<00:03:35.280> then<00:03:35.430> try<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.610> plan<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.000> whole<00:03:36.150> look

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
and then try to plan the whole look

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.970 
and then try to plan the whole look
together<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:37.110> I<00:03:37.290> think<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:37.560> kind<00:03:37.710> of<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:37.800> fun

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
together and I think it's kind of a fun

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.199 
together and I think it's kind of a fun
lick<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.310> sounds<00:03:38.550> good<00:03:38.730> put<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> little

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
lick it sounds good put a little

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.030 
lick it sounds good put a little
overdrive<00:03:39.690> on<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.050> kind<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.230> gets<00:03:40.500> nutty<00:03:40.740> gets

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
overdrive on it kind of gets nutty gets

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.460 
overdrive on it kind of gets nutty gets
