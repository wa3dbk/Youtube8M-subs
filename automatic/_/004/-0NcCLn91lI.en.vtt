00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
wanted to borrow it so I thought I'd try

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.680 
wanted to borrow it so I thought I'd try
it<00:03:49.709> out<00:03:49.890> for<00:03:50.070> an<00:03:50.190> angle<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.580> did<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:50.970> zoom

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
it out for an angle I did have to zoom

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.930 
it out for an angle I did have to zoom
in<00:03:51.989> using<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.459> movie<00:03:54.090> because<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:56.310> GoPro

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
in using a I movie because the GoPro

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.260 
in using a I movie because the GoPro
doesn't<00:03:57.270> really<00:03:57.390> soom<00:03:57.959> so<00:03:58.739> my<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.340> guess<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.120> have

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
doesn't really soom so my I guess I have

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.090 
doesn't really soom so my I guess I have
a<00:04:00.300> really<00:04:00.750> long<00:04:00.959> neck<00:04:01.290> or<00:04:01.530> something<00:04:01.680> because

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
a really long neck or something because

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.680 
a really long neck or something because
it<00:04:02.370> looked<00:04:02.520> really<00:04:02.790> really<00:04:03.000> far<00:04:03.239> away<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.600> I

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
it looked really really far away and I

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.860 
it looked really really far away and I
like<00:04:03.900> closer<00:04:04.560> up<00:04:04.800> videos<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:06.450> might<00:04:06.690> not<00:04:06.720> be

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
like closer up videos so it might not be

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.199 
like closer up videos so it might not be
the<00:04:07.200> best<00:04:07.500> quality<00:04:07.980> now<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.580> I've<00:04:08.670> zoomed<00:04:08.910> in
