00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
striking disaster sequences and I mean

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.460 
striking disaster sequences and I mean
the<00:03:00.180> effects<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.570> this<00:03:00.720> movie<00:03:01.079> are<00:03:01.170> pretty

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
great um we saw it in 3d and this

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.210 
great um we saw it in 3d and this
tourneys<00:03:04.320> pretty<00:03:04.560> good<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.769> mean<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.130> all

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
tourneys pretty good I mean it's all

right<00:03:05.400> um<00:03:05.900> I'm<00:03:06.900> not<00:03:07.109> a<00:03:07.140> big<00:03:07.380> fan<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.620> 3d<00:03:07.980> myself

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
right um I'm not a big fan of 3d myself

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.699 
right um I'm not a big fan of 3d myself
so<00:03:08.609> maybe<00:03:08.820> you'll<00:03:09.060> dig<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.690> more<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.900> feel<00:03:10.590> like

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
with precision it plays itself pretty

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.960

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
handled him in a more sophisticated way

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.870 
handled him in a more sophisticated way
instead<00:06:02.720> of<00:06:02.870> making<00:06:03.229> him<00:06:03.349> like<00:06:03.590> the<00:06:03.919> one<00:06:04.340> kind

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
instead of making him like the one kind

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.330 
instead of making him like the one kind
of<00:06:05.000> despicable<00:06:05.840> asshole<00:06:06.440> you<00:06:06.800> know<00:06:06.830> I<00:06:07.130> thought

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
of despicable asshole you know I thought

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.760 
of despicable asshole you know I thought
they<00:06:07.520> handled<00:06:08.060> him<00:06:08.330> in<00:06:08.630> a<00:06:08.690> really<00:06:09.020> kind<00:06:09.500> of

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
they handled him in a really kind of

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.920 
they handled him in a really kind of
petty<00:06:10.070> way<00:06:10.370> with<00:06:10.910> as<00:06:11.060> much<00:06:11.210> good<00:06:11.479> nature<00:06:11.810> as

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
petty way with as much good nature as

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.330 
petty way with as much good nature as
the<00:06:12.080> movie<00:06:12.289> handles<00:06:12.620> most<00:06:12.770> of<00:06:12.979> its<00:06:13.099> characters

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
the movie handles most of its characters

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.670 
the movie handles most of its characters
with<00:06:13.759> they<00:06:14.479> just<00:06:14.660> sort<00:06:14.900> of<00:06:14.960> make<00:06:15.139> him<00:06:15.289> hateable

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
with they just sort of make him hateable

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.050 
with they just sort of make him hateable
and<00:06:15.979> I<00:06:16.039> think<00:06:16.250> this<00:06:16.340> is<00:06:16.400> kind<00:06:16.639> of<00:06:16.729> a<00:06:16.820> shallow

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
and I think this is kind of a shallow

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.240 
and I think this is kind of a shallow
choice<00:06:17.509> to<00:06:17.810> make<00:06:17.960> but<00:06:18.349> that's<00:06:18.620> just<00:06:18.800> me<00:06:18.979> you
