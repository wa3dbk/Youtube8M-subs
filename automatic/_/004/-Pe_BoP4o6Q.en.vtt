00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.240
 I collected the ones I did professionally 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.139
 round natural round on the river 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.840
 January 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.100
 I'm 26 years old and skateboarding for 14 years. 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.810
 actually since I started walking 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 skateboard 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.189
 What has improved in my life has been 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.910
 I was a guy had a lot though 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.660
 high of always doing bullshit and such 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.420
 on the street in high school I did not talk much 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.860
 people were in the field like this and when 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.079
 I started to skate spent 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.940
 my socializing better with the guys 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.250
 I wanted to learn the maneuvers 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.190
 Come on, man, tell me how you do it. 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.760
 look how I explain this and then 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.280
 I started to make friends, I went like this. 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.420
 becoming more communicative right? 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.880
 It was then that I also went to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.130
 talk more and just talking to everyone 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.909
 that is friend of everybody and create 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.909
 several friends, right? 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.840
 it was a known time for animals too 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.900
 see the magazines and various programs 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.900
 skateboard too and do journalism right 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.870
 so something that has changed a lot in the 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.820
 my life is what in the skaters is 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.330
 always traveling with this year all 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.790

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.720

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.720
 all skateboard 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.950
 I'm not going to talk on the line but very bratty. 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.860
 who started skateboarding already practice the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.540
 football right have played football right 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.060
 I really liked soccer. 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.860
 benefited and played cool I thought 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.960
 played legal games on the team or on foot 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.070
 home then suddenly she that more 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.070
 I always liked sports 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.869
 so round round so thank God 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.530
 We have managed to accomplish a great deal 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.140
 thing knows I think for the city ​​to be 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.600
 smaller than a capital 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.360
 people get more united 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.489
 not getting closer to the other already calls 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.480
 by law and can not accomplish much 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.870
 thing in the house and with the association there 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.760
 my father always encouraged me and my 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.650
 An hour ago he said ok 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.050
 missing organization on skateboard 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.220
 then the stop way to stop legal and 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.739
 as he already has experience of 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.739
 organization of other things union 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:46.130
 he participated he brought that he is not he 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.019
 a guy from the crowd also did it then 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.600
 several circuits continue to do 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.130
 enough demonstration in colleges in 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.650
 neighborhoods also we will in 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.010
 neighborhoods that are most needed so 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.900
 more devoid of God in school too 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.940
 and nowadays so beyond 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.780
 round I came back quite a lot 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.329
 half the river on the river is a big screen and 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.910
 I'm doing a lot of action with qix and 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.550
 show action and 10 free 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.940
 so inside my skateboarding career 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.680
 I always go, so you know you are. 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.690
 most of the friends who 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.660
 I knew it was through the championships. 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.490
 So there's no way we can see that 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.470
 many people talk about the legal championship 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.690
 I think it's cool, you understand. 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.310
 I'm even here I met the 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.370
 friends in the league so I think it's cool 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.060
 have a competitiveness of talbot that 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.830
 I always liked that thing but also 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.860
 the challenge is to get the line together and 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.300
 but I have focused a lot of skate and 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.820
 through the videos né 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.270
 and today I arrive in the city I see that 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.150
 I am very grateful because of that I 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.730
 arrive kid comes a damn at night 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.860
 here your video knows how to speak first 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.550
 and the last video maneuver knows the 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:06.060
 parts it has is in which in video or 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.210
 Internet is released so I guess 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.280
 It 's a huge satisfaction to me and I 'm 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.900
 I feel fulfilled, it's all day. 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.780
 leaving to walk and bring a new house 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.780
 filmed not that I left for this alone 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.150
 The intention is always to have fun. 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.190
 is always on the street knows how to trade 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.430
 information with the galley 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.400
 The idea is to interact in the same fan 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.380
 the people on the street and the result 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.630
 is also filming in the street this maneuver is 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.450
 known to do something different than 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.250
 I did not do what someone did not think 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.110
 skateboarding or always likes to do 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.300
 that regardless if people go 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.930
 Like it or not I was going to walk my way 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.590
 respect and I think the guys 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.450
 recognize this 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.830
 I'm good to walk even introduce 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.830

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:02.030

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.520
 family that always supported me very skateboard 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.910
 always gave full force 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.080
 all sponsors anyway 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:14.060
 Believe me, you know, I believe in my 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:17.180
 potential and all the friends on the trip 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.800

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.880
 of each city 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.630
 friendship it makes difference in the same help 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:29.150
 and also the malls by industry 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:34.960

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.960
 frame then for that skate in vein
