it<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.770> could<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:43.920> put<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
it that way you could just put it in a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.249 
it that way you could just put it in a
ponytail<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.090> behind<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> morning

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
ponytail or behind it but in the morning

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.990 
ponytail or behind it but in the morning
though<00:01:46.590> you're<00:01:46.860> gonna<00:01:46.920> need<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.280> spray<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
though you're gonna need to spray it and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
though you're gonna need to spray it and
then<00:01:48.060> apply<00:01:48.479> something<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> hold

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
then apply something to it just to hold

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.319 
then apply something to it just to hold
it<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.549> doesn't<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:50.939> too<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.299> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
it down so it doesn't get too out of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:51.740 
it down so it doesn't get too out of
control

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
control

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
control
cuz<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.530> get<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.920> wind<00:01:53.100> it's

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
cuz when you get out in the wind it's

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.800 
cuz when you get out in the wind it's
gonna<00:01:53.430> start<00:01:53.670> blowing<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.240> stuff<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
gonna start blowing and stuff and like I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.969 
gonna start blowing and stuff and like I
said<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.049> depends<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.560> how<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.920> to

Brazilian the Peruvian the Malaysian I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.720 
Brazilian the Peruvian the Malaysian I
don't<00:02:27.630> know<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.200> don't<00:02:28.410> know<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:29.099> I<00:02:29.160> really

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
don't know I don't know but I really

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.170 
don't know I don't know but I really
enjoy<00:02:30.209> wearing<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.050> um<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:31.950> still<00:02:32.099> soft<00:02:32.670> I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
enjoy wearing it um it's still soft I

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300 
enjoy wearing it um it's still soft I
thought<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:33.720> was<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> higher<00:02:34.170> luster<00:02:34.739> hair<00:02:34.980> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
thought it was a higher luster hair and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.890 
thought it was a higher luster hair and
I<00:02:35.370> think<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.730> was<00:02:35.940> like<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.269> before<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.840> it

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
I think it was like that before but it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.300 
I think it was like that before but it
seems<00:02:37.080> like<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.290> lustre<00:02:37.680> went<00:02:37.860> down<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.069> little

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
seems like the lustre went down a little

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.160 
seems like the lustre went down a little
bit<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.849> don't<00:02:39.239> know<00:02:39.360> if<00:02:39.420> that's<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.599> good<00:02:39.989> or<00:02:40.110> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
bit I don't know if that's a good or a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.199 
bit I don't know if that's a good or a
bad<00:02:40.230> thing<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.769> was<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.920> good<00:02:41.129> thing<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:42.060> me

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
bad thing but it was a good thing for me

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.660 
bad thing but it was a good thing for me
because<00:02:42.510> my<00:02:42.630> hair<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.959> lower<00:02:43.230> luster<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:43.950> it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
because my hair is a lower luster and it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.400 
because my hair is a lower luster and it
just<00:02:44.849> matches<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.269> lot<00:02:45.330> better<00:02:45.750> than<00:02:46.049> else<00:02:46.230> oh<00:02:46.380> I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
just matches a lot better than else oh I

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.360 
just matches a lot better than else oh I
like<00:02:46.739> that

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
like that

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.670 
like that
I<00:02:47.400> found<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.329> very<00:02:48.569> strong<00:02:48.989> hair<00:02:49.410> I

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
I found it to be a very strong hair I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.500 
I found it to be a very strong hair I
