00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.890
 the fires precisely this is the domain 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.480
 of Sebastian he is a trainer and 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.250
 today these students are the members 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:28.430
 crew of a large airline 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:31.869
 goal ferries learn to turn off a 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.869
 fire starting in a boat 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.390
 my time 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.780
 we are in saint malo in a center 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.820
 training 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.160
 they are cooked hostesses or 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.590
 commissioner all must be 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.239
 trained in fire prevention and that's 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.890
 a novelty 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.229
 previously only officers receive 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.180
 this type of training for two years 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.070
 all members of a crew are 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.979
 considered as sailors and must 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.660
 be trained in emergency situations me 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.800
 I was born aboard it's true that by 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.460
 compared to the fryer not just the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.460
 worries that I had garage 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.549
 essence and 2 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.530
 carbide and arrive anytime 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.990
 it's things you need to 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.990
 intervene quickly to contain it 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.550
 that does not stop me there structures 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.230
 are metal in 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.090
 by conduction there may be a 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.920
 burning is important to have these 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.060
 formations there 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.060
 there is always one to one 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.640
 a great apprehension after all is 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.450
 there too we have to learn 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.370
 to control fear and that is that in 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.250
 putting into practice that 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:05.300
 color no longer shock the back we go 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.770
 and we go back there again I'm looking for the 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.060
 margin is the first in europe 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.470
 that does not stop me from announcing the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.360
 first step colleagues pay attention to the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.870
 mario walk and then pretty fluid 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.870
 down 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.319
 Do you have any questions 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.360
 on board the boats the drums are often 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.700
 hydrocarbon fires and for 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.230
 turn off the most effective is the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.230
 foam that stifles the flames 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.130
 in tight places 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.440
 she can quickly invade everything so much 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.420
 have already lived this to realize 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.650
 that one can breathe once under the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.650
 foam and do not panic 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.760
 the purpose of this kind of device is 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.580
 of noyen volume to make the extinction 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.120
 and so people can be caught in 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.540
 this dance is foam and so low for 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.739
 the goal is to show them 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.269
 who can safely evacuate 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.519
 formations are not always so 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.769
 pushed according to the companies but a 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.500
 minimum learning is required 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.620
 for all these measures follow on from 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.269
 number of fires growing on board 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.170
 this is the major risk on big 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.170
 cruise ships
