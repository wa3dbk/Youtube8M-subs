properly specifically this is what the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.960 
properly specifically this is what the
dr<00:01:33.240> tests<00:01:33.720> will<00:01:33.930> entail<00:01:34.460> you'll<00:01:35.460> make<00:01:35.670> four

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
dr tests will entail you'll make four

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.140 
dr tests will entail you'll make four
left<00:01:36.210> turns<00:01:36.480> and<00:01:36.750> four<00:01:37.680> right<00:01:37.890> turns<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
left turns and four right turns when you

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.060 
left turns and four right turns when you
make<00:01:39.300> a<00:01:39.330> turn<00:01:39.660> you're<00:01:40.080> making<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.440> turn<00:01:40.650> at<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
make a turn you're making a turn at the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.500 
make a turn you're making a turn at the
intersection<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.910> when<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.120> come<00:01:42.300> to<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
intersection so when you come to the

both<00:01:44.520> ways<00:01:44.820> check<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:45.960> mirror<00:01:46.400> when<00:01:47.400> you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
both ways check your mirror when you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.610 
both ways check your mirror when you
finish<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> turn<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:49.020> check<00:01:49.290> your<00:01:49.440> mirror

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
finish a turn you check your mirror

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.960 
finish a turn you check your mirror
check<00:01:50.100> your<00:01:50.190> mirror<00:01:50.400> because<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.790> want<00:01:50.940> to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.330 
know what's going on behind you you'll
drive<00:01:53.610> through<00:01:53.910> 16<00:01:54.780> intersections<00:01:55.620> eight<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
drive through 16 intersections eight of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.030 
drive through 16 intersections eight of
which<00:01:56.550> you<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.960> stop<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.830> call

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
which you do not have to stop we call

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.910 
which you do not have to stop we call
those<00:01:59.250> through<00:02:00.030> intersections<00:02:00.540> now<00:02:01.530> just

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
those through intersections now just

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.560 
those through intersections now just
because<00:02:02.220> you<00:02:02.340> don't<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.670> stop<00:02:03.000> doesn't

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
because you don't have to stop doesn't

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
because you don't have to stop doesn't
mean<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.810> don't<00:02:04.260> have<00:02:04.410> to<00:02:04.740> look<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.160> when

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
mean you don't have to look so when

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.040 
mean you don't have to look so when
you're<00:02:05.760> driving<00:02:06.000> through<00:02:06.210> an<00:02:06.600> intersection

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
you're driving through an intersection

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.990 
you're driving through an intersection
where<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.500> don't<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.980> to<00:02:08.099> stop<00:02:08.340> make<00:02:08.970> sure

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
where you don't have to stop make sure

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.390 
where you don't have to stop make sure
that<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.539> look<00:02:09.690> both<00:02:10.200> ways<00:02:10.229> now<00:02:11.220> when<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that you look both ways now when you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.580 
that you look both ways now when you
look<00:02:11.610> both<00:02:11.849> ways<00:02:11.879> it's<00:02:12.630> not<00:02:12.810> just<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.230> matter<00:02:13.440> of

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
look both ways it's not just a matter of

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.590 
look both ways it's not just a matter of
looking<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.370> your<00:02:14.550> eyes<00:02:14.730> remember<00:02:15.480> the

looking with your eyes remember the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.400 
looking with your eyes remember the
examiner

approaching that intersection you want

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.120 
approaching that intersection you want
to<00:02:20.460> move<00:02:20.580> your<00:02:20.850> head<00:02:21.150> okay<00:02:21.750> all<00:02:22.290> right<00:02:22.560> now

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
to move your head okay all right now

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.280 
to move your head okay all right now
when<00:02:23.730> you're<00:02:23.990> going<00:02:24.990> through<00:02:25.080> an

intersection where you actually have to

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.820 
intersection where you actually have to
stop<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.360> very<00:02:28.050> important<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.470> check<00:02:28.680> your

stop is very important to check your

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.260 
stop is very important to check your

mirror because when you reduce your
speed<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:31.200> want<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.470> make<00:02:31.590> sure<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:32.010> you

we're<00:04:07.500> going<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.680> get<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.800> chance<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.280> practice

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
we're going to get a chance to practice

we're going to get a chance to practice
the<00:04:09.360> actual<00:04:09.930> drive<00:04:10.260> test<00:04:10.530> will<00:04:10.709> do<00:04:10.800> a

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
the actual drive test will do a

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.440 
the actual drive test will do a
simulated<00:04:11.370> drive<00:04:11.640> test<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.120> get<00:04:12.239> an<00:04:12.330> idea

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
simulated drive test so you get an idea

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.240 
simulated drive test so you get an idea
of<00:04:12.720> what<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.140> test<00:04:13.380> feels<00:04:13.620> like<00:04:13.890> well<00:04:14.130> that

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
of what the test feels like well that

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.199 
of what the test feels like well that
sound<00:04:14.459> okay<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:15.209> sounds<00:04:15.540> great
