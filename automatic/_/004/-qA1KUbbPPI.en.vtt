averaging<00:00:25.920> about<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.550> pound<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.689> day<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.710> but

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
averaging about a pound a day so but

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.420

which<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.910> still<00:00:30.090> really<00:00:30.359> good<00:00:30.480> overall<00:00:31.430> it's

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
which is still really good overall it's

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.240 
which is still really good overall it's
a<00:00:32.550> day<00:00:32.700> 13<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.570> lost<00:00:33.719> 16<00:00:34.200> pounds<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.680> 13<00:00:35.100> days

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
I can't even tell you the amount of

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.010 
I can't even tell you the amount of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
feeling and now I think my body is in a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.490 
feeling and now I think my body is in a
new<00:00:49.289> phase<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.780> cleaning<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.960> my<00:00:52.199> system

new phase of cleaning out my system

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.299 
new phase of cleaning out my system

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
because the stuff that's coming out is

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.270 
because the stuff that's coming out is
kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.090> new<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:59.809> it's<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.129> going
