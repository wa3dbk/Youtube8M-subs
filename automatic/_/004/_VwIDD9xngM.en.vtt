hi everyone its Brian from Brandt echo
the<00:00:03.689> UK<00:00:04.520> got<00:00:05.520> another<00:00:05.759> tutorial<00:00:06.270> every<00:00:06.750> today

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.130 
the UK got another tutorial every today

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.820 
the UK got another tutorial every today
and<00:00:08.130> they're<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.429> be<00:00:08.519> discussed<00:00:09.030> in<00:00:09.210> the

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
and they're going to be discussed in the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.680 
and they're going to be discussed in the
driver<00:00:10.830> verifier<00:00:11.360> Manager<00:00:12.360> tool<00:00:12.920> for<00:00:13.920> Windows

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
driver verifier Manager tool for Windows

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.890 
driver verifier Manager tool for Windows
now<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:16.500> tool<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.340> hinton<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.390> Windows

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
now this tool is hinton in Windows

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.810 
now this tool is hinton in Windows
operating<00:00:19.109> system<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.949> won't<00:00:20.160> see<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.490> until

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
operating system you won't see it until

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.380 
operating system you won't see it until
you<00:00:21.689> type<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> rum<00:00:22.560> bar<00:00:23.119> down<00:00:24.119> at<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
you type in the rum bar down at the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.320 
you type in the rum bar down at the
bottom<00:00:24.750> there<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.140> then<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.730> basically<00:00:26.730> will

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
bottom there and then it basically will

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.650 
bottom there and then it basically will
come<00:00:27.570> up<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> verifier<00:00:28.769> tool<00:00:29.390> before<00:00:30.390> we

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
come up with the verifier tool before we

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.450 
come up with the verifier tool before we
open<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:30.990> up<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.560> want<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> explain

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
open that up I just want to explain

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.330 
open that up I just want to explain
basically<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.390> does<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:34.620> basically<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
basically what it does it's basically a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.940 
basically what it does it's basically a
talk<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.880> was<00:00:36.030> designed<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:36.989> software

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
talk that was designed for software

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.780 
talk that was designed for software
developers<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.960> test<00:00:39.960> their<00:00:40.170> drivers<00:00:40.790> which

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
developers to test their drivers which

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.990 
developers to test their drivers which
is<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.570> handy<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.340> techies<00:00:44.340> because

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
is really handy for techies because

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.319 
is really handy for techies because
basically<00:00:46.160> if<00:00:47.160> you've<00:00:47.340> got<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> driver<00:00:48.000> error

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
basically if you've got a driver error

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.850 
basically if you've got a driver error
from<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.809> blue<00:00:49.050> screen<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.750> stop<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.710> it's

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
from a blue screen like so stop and it's

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.270 
from a blue screen like so stop and it's
an<00:00:53.039> actual<00:00:53.190> driver<00:00:53.610> issue<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.899> actually

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
an actual driver issue you can actually

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.369 
an actual driver issue you can actually
take<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.879> driver<00:00:57.270> through<00:00:57.899> using<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
take in that driver through using the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.069 
take in that driver through using the
verifier<00:00:59.210> reboot<00:01:00.210> machine<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.989> will

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
verifier reboot machine and it will

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.310 
verifier reboot machine and it will
actually<00:01:01.260> test<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.949> driver<00:01:02.719> now<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.960> if

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
actually test the driver now if it if

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.950 
actually test the driver now if it if
that<00:01:04.680> drivers<00:01:05.129> at<00:01:05.280> full<00:01:05.549> blue<00:01:06.240> screen<00:01:06.600> again

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
that drivers at full blue screen again

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.750 
that drivers at full blue screen again
and<00:01:07.320> tell<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.040> that's<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.490> driver

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and tell you that that's the driver

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.000 
and tell you that that's the driver
that's<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.240> fault<00:01:09.479> which<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.990> now<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.770> way<00:01:10.950> you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that's at fault which is now the way you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.880 
that's at fault which is now the way you
can<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:11.490> rectify<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> problem<00:01:12.890> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
can actually rectify the problem so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.700 
can actually rectify the problem so
anyway<00:01:14.220> let's<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> look<00:01:14.790> at<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.710> driver

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
anyway let's have a look at the driver

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.609 
anyway let's have a look at the driver
verifier<00:01:17.070> tool<00:01:17.850> that's<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:19.220> Windows<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:22.409> let's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
verifier tool that's in Windows so let's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.660 
verifier tool that's in Windows so let's
just<00:01:22.830> show<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.159> dalian<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:24.659> need<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.670> it's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
just show this dalian we need to do it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.719 
just show this dalian we need to do it's
also<00:01:26.820> designed<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.829> when<00:01:28.829> debugger<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
also designed for when debugger in that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670 
also designed for when debugger in that
previous<00:01:30.299> tutorial<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:31.020> talking<00:01:31.409> about<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
previous tutorial was talking about the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.030 
previous tutorial was talking about the
win<00:01:31.860> debugger<00:01:32.280> many<00:01:33.270> dump<00:01:33.570> files<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.829> once

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
win debugger many dump files and once

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.530 
win debugger many dump files and once
you<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.490> information<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.900> actual

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
you get that information that the actual

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.200 
you get that information that the actual
driver<00:01:39.540> issue<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.439> called<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.220> certain<00:01:41.939> name

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
driver issue is is called a certain name

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.969 
driver issue is is called a certain name
you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.810> actually<00:01:43.140> look<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.649> driver

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
you can actually look for that driver

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
you can actually look for that driver
and<00:01:44.280> actually<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> search<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.630> make

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and actually do a search on it to make

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.569 
and actually do a search on it to make
sure<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> driver<00:01:46.890> that's<00:01:47.159> actually<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
sure it's that driver that's actually a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.880 
sure it's that driver that's actually a
full<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.299> get<00:01:51.299> started<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:52.829> you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
full so it's just get started so you

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.160 
full so it's just get started so you
need<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.670> run<00:01:53.850> by<00:01:54.090> type<00:01:54.960> in

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
need to go to the run by type in

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.280 
need to go to the run by type in
verifier<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:56.159> all<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> need<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.850> put

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
verifier that's all you need to put

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.030 
verifier that's all you need to put
and<00:01:57.890> up<00:01:58.040> comes<00:01:58.070> this<00:01:58.550> box<00:01:58.880> here<00:01:59.860> from<00:02:00.860> there

you<00:02:19.940> want<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.180> do<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.630> look<00:02:21.080> for<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.410> driver<00:02:21.740> that

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
you want to do is look for a driver that

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.930 
you want to do is look for a driver that
was<00:02:22.310> full<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.120> your<00:02:23.660> machine<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.400> say<00:02:25.700> for

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
was full on your machine so say for

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.560 
was full on your machine so say for
argument's<00:02:26.420> sake<00:02:26.570> which<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.050> going<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.350> be

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
argument's sake which is going to be

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.070 
argument's sake which is going to be
just<00:02:29.570> saying<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.020> driver<00:02:30.290> really<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:31.250> was<00:02:32.080> for

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
just saying a driver really that was for

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.350 
just saying a driver really that was for
now<00:02:33.380> say<00:02:33.620> Franz<00:02:33.890> like<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:34.460> driver<00:02:34.910> was<00:02:35.060> at

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
now say Franz like this driver was at

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.170 
now say Franz like this driver was at
fault<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.710> driver<00:02:37.070> was<00:02:37.190> at<00:02:37.460> fault<00:02:37.490> they

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
fault and this driver was at fault they

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.230 
fault and this driver was at fault they
put<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.570> two<00:02:38.750> texting<00:02:39.350> like<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:41.060> what

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
put the two texting like so and what

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.850 
put the two texting like so and what
you'd<00:02:41.390> need<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.780> do<00:02:41.930> then<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.200> obviously<00:02:42.680> go

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
you'd need to do then is obviously go

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.810 
you'd need to do then is obviously go
finish<00:02:43.810> if<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:45.080> click<00:02:45.350> finish<00:02:45.380> now<00:02:45.950> obviously

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
finish if I click finish now obviously

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.970 
finish if I click finish now obviously
that<00:02:47.330> would<00:02:47.570> want<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.850> reboot<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.030> machine<00:02:50.980> so

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
that would want to reboot the machine so

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.800 
that would want to reboot the machine so
then<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.490> must<00:02:52.760> reboot<00:02:53.090> machine<00:02:53.540> to

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
then so you must reboot machine to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.990 
then so you must reboot machine to
injury<00:02:53.990> per<00:02:54.260> machine<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.040> verifier<00:02:55.610> will

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
injury per machine the verifier will

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.410 
injury per machine the verifier will
actually<00:02:56.330> check<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.840> drivers<00:02:57.350> that<00:02:57.830> work<00:02:58.070> for

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
actually check the drivers that work for

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.720 
actually check the drivers that work for
if<00:02:59.420> they<00:02:59.690> were<00:02:59.930> at<00:03:00.080> fault<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:01.250> was<00:03:01.489> what

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
if they were at fault and this was what

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.330 
if they were at fault and this was what
was<00:03:01.880> causing<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.420> crash<00:03:02.660> dump<00:03:02.989> file<00:03:03.340> and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
was causing the crash dump file and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.400 
was causing the crash dump file and
causing<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:04.910> blue<00:03:05.090> screen<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.930> will<00:03:06.230> then

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
causing the blue screen this will then

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.710 
causing the blue screen this will then
obviously<00:03:07.070> create<00:03:07.520> another<00:03:07.790> blue<00:03:08.090> screen<00:03:08.450> so

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
obviously create another blue screen so

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.810 
obviously create another blue screen so
you<00:03:08.780> now<00:03:09.110> know<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:09.410> these<00:03:09.830> files<00:03:10.220> are<00:03:10.640> the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
you now know that these files are the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.479 
you now know that these files are the
ones<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.300> are<00:03:11.540> actually<00:03:11.840> causing<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
ones that are actually causing it the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.400 
ones that are actually causing it the
blue<00:03:13.700> screen<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.330> then<00:03:14.630> gives<00:03:14.989> you<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.170> way<00:03:15.380> of

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
blue screen and then gives you a way of

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.229 
blue screen and then gives you a way of
rectifying<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.430> problem<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:19.220> that's<00:03:19.910> how<00:03:20.180> you

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
rectifying the problem so that's how you

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.650 
rectifying the problem so that's how you
basically<00:03:20.570> use<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.080> driver<00:03:21.530> verifier<00:03:21.860> tool

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
basically use the driver verifier tool

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.840 
basically use the driver verifier tool
it's<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.780> real<00:03:23.989> handy<00:03:24.350> tool<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.620> use<00:03:25.010> especially

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
it's a real handy tool to use especially

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.800 
it's a real handy tool to use especially
for<00:03:26.290> reading<00:03:27.290> once<00:03:27.769> you've<00:03:27.950> read<00:03:28.570> many<00:03:29.570> dumb

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
for reading once you've read many dumb

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.600 
for reading once you've read many dumb
files<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.410> can<00:03:30.530> actually<00:03:30.709> get<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.220> name<00:03:31.400> of

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
files you can actually get the name of

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.180 
files you can actually get the name of
the<00:03:31.930> system<00:03:32.930> file<00:03:33.170> or<00:03:33.380> driver<00:03:33.739> that's<00:03:34.040> at

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
the system file or driver that's at

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.040 
the system file or driver that's at
fault<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.640> end<00:03:34.760> time<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.360> then<00:03:35.510> look<00:03:35.750> for<00:03:35.959> it

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
fault and end time and then look for it

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.300 
fault and end time and then look for it
in<00:03:36.170> there<00:03:36.440> now<00:03:37.400> once<00:03:37.760> you've<00:03:38.000> done<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:39.310> once

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
in there now once you've done that once

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.390 
in there now once you've done that once
you've<00:03:40.519> done<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.959> need<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.500> the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
you've done that you need to the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.270 
you've done that you need to the
verifier<00:03:43.910> tool<00:03:44.150> will<00:03:44.390> constantly<00:03:44.900> run<00:03:45.280> until

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
verifier tool will constantly run until

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.460 
verifier tool will constantly run until
you<00:03:46.340> turn<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:46.940> off<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:47.600> what<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:47.930> need<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.140> do

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
you turn it off so what you need to do

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.370 
you turn it off so what you need to do
to<00:03:48.769> turn<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.160> off<00:03:49.480> let's<00:03:50.480> go<00:03:50.690> back<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.170> rum

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
to turn it off let's go back to the rum

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.830 
to turn it off let's go back to the rum
bar<00:03:51.650> box<00:03:52.280> like<00:03:52.910> so<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.800> you<00:03:54.800> need<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.840> type

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
bar box like so and you need to type

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.839 
bar box like so and you need to type
verifier

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
verifier

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:05.860 
verifier
pulled<00:03:59.090> space<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:01.510> space<00:04:02.510> Ford<00:04:03.260> /<00:04:03.620> reset<00:04:04.870> like

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
pulled space and space Ford / reset like

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.459 
pulled space and space Ford / reset like
so<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:07.159> it<00:04:07.310> just<00:04:07.519> pushed<00:04:07.760> enter<00:04:08.540> and

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:09.469 
so and it just pushed enter and

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.259 
so and it just pushed enter and
basically<00:04:09.799> that<00:04:09.920> one<00:04:10.249> to<00:04:10.400> turn<00:04:10.549> off<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.999> very

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
basically that one to turn off the very

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.470 
basically that one to turn off the very
fire<00:04:12.069> management<00:04:13.069> tool<00:04:13.549> that<00:04:13.819> you've<00:04:14.239> got

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
fire management tool that you've got

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.830 
fire management tool that you've got
there<00:04:15.220> okay<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.759> hope<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.239> clears<00:04:17.539> up<00:04:17.750> the

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
there okay so I hope this clears up the

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.080 
there okay so I hope this clears up the
up<00:04:18.079> for<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.709> wasn't<00:04:19.099> it's<00:04:19.400> not<00:04:19.639> really<00:04:19.970> an

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
up for you it wasn't it's not really an

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.390 
up for you it wasn't it's not really an
in-depth<00:04:20.599> sort<00:04:21.109> of<00:04:21.289> tutorial<00:04:21.590> really<00:04:22.250> it's

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
in-depth sort of tutorial really it's

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.350 
in-depth sort of tutorial really it's
just<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.759> sort<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:24.490> sort<00:04:25.490> of<00:04:25.580> scratching<00:04:26.330> the

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
just a sort of sort of scratching the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.439 
just a sort of sort of scratching the
surface<00:04:26.599> of<00:04:27.050> what<00:04:27.229> you<00:04:27.259> can<00:04:27.380> do<00:04:27.710> that<00:04:27.949> tool

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
surface of what you can do that tool

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.210 
surface of what you can do that tool
basically<00:04:29.449> all<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.229> need<00:04:30.259> to<00:04:30.530> do<00:04:30.710> is<00:04:30.979> read

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
basically all you need to do is read

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.999 
basically all you need to do is read
your<00:04:31.370> dumb<00:04:31.520> files<00:04:31.910> from<00:04:32.270> here<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.009> then

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
your dumb files from here and then

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.550 
your dumb files from here and then
obviously<00:04:34.639> find<00:04:35.120> out<00:04:35.419> if<00:04:35.900> it's<00:04:36.199> a<00:04:36.289> driver

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
obviously find out if it's a driver

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.010 
obviously find out if it's a driver
related<00:04:37.130> problem<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:37.789> it<00:04:37.880> kicks<00:04:38.150> up<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.630> name

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
related problem and it kicks up the name

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.230 
related problem and it kicks up the name
of<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.320> driver<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:40.009> then<00:04:40.729> you<00:04:40.880> can<00:04:41.060> actually

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
of the driver and then you can actually

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.520 
of the driver and then you can actually
log<00:04:41.630> in<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.889> verifier<00:04:43.729> that<00:04:44.479> ticking<00:04:45.380> that

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
log in to the verifier that ticking that

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.570 
log in to the verifier that ticking that
driver<00:04:46.250> that<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:46.699> want<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.000> scan<00:04:47.500> reboot<00:04:48.580> find

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
driver that you want to scan reboot find

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.640 
driver that you want to scan reboot find
out<00:04:49.849> the<00:04:50.060> blue<00:04:50.509> screen<00:04:50.900> you<00:04:51.080> know<00:04:51.199> it's<00:04:51.410> that

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
out the blue screen you know it's that

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.140 
out the blue screen you know it's that

and then you can do something about that

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.879 
and then you can do something about that
