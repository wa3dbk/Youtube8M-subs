while continuing to whisk once you've

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.090 
while continuing to whisk once you've
got<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.430> egg<00:00:56.550> yolks<00:00:57.050> nice<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.320> hot<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.739> okay

got the egg yolks nice and hot it's okay

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.220 
got the egg yolks nice and hot it's okay
to<00:00:59.489> add<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.910> remaining<00:01:00.120> mixture<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> quick

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
to add the remaining mixture at a quick

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.959 
to add the remaining mixture at a quick
pace<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> initial<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> most<00:01:02.730> crucial

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
pace but the initial is the most crucial

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.109 
pace but the initial is the most crucial
so<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.719> don't<00:01:03.930> cook<00:01:04.680> your<00:01:04.860> eggs<00:01:05.040> once<00:01:06.000> this

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
so you don't cook your eggs once this

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
so you don't cook your eggs once this
mixture<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.570> completely<00:01:06.990> smooth<00:01:07.549> we're<00:01:08.549> going

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
mixture is completely smooth we're going

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.390 
mixture is completely smooth we're going
to<00:01:08.729> go<00:01:08.820> ahead<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> strain<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:10.220> we're<00:01:11.220> going<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to go ahead and strain it we're going to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.820 
to go ahead and strain it we're going to
go<00:01:11.580> right<00:01:12.150> into<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> ramekin<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.619> hot

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
go right into the ramekin with this hot

jiggle in the center maybe about the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.320 
jiggle in the center maybe about the

size of a dime once that is achieved

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.060 
size of a dime once that is achieved
we'll<00:01:27.689> remove<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> oven<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.950> I
