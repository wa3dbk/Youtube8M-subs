you hit the reset button one more time

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.770 
you hit the reset button one more time
it'll<00:06:57.110> pop<00:06:57.350> this<00:06:57.980> one<00:06:58.190> up<00:06:58.370> and<00:06:58.550> then<00:06:59.210> you<00:06:59.540> will

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
it'll pop this one up and then you will
