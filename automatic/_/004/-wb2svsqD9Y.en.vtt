00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:05.120
 those things cost the moment of choice further cost solving gets the question of 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.510
 not 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.540
 and am someone you do not know and who costs in large halls, according to him, it is still 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.689
 how do i go to calculate the cost of the kitchen 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:15.639
 and m last seen 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.820
 I now have a very scary hand in the kitchen 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.800
 no 230 euros 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.859
 but yes so 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.039
 about ten choices at the kitchen 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.569
 determine direct costs 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:31.390
 first of all 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.680
 the kitchen unit that is going to be placed 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.460
 as needed 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.070
 it does have a number of budgets 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.390
 finally one and a half thousand 300,000 5700 top 10 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.030
 and 15 and if you can still learn a lot, the kitchen level is that ex 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.300
 complete 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.330
 always pay attention because want that is just not complete 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.800
 he is coming to work more 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 but suppose you leave your kitchen like a surgeon 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.640
 or fight life changed 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 ser mara just names it doesn't matter 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.410
 or 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.880
 Yes maybe 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.250
 Do you have a different budget yourself I thought I would use it again 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.320
 for example the 16,500 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.900
 we add it 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.500
 according to the veb you at the top the lot on loose screws and scored 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.410
 square meters 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.500
 in yemen from the kitchen that is the whole idea 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.980
 they turned the floor area resident of the kitchen large 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.800
 engine back to the kitchen 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.980
 furthermore, who sees that most are seated you have to do something with the floor 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.290
 doing is free 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.080
 the demolition work 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.720
 then it may have to be realized 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.310
 or maybe seven the ek team 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.350
 then asked for warm clothes for the rubble floor finish with whole 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.100
 different flatter tips 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.510
 have materials such as wood 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.220
 daniels if you are 0 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.200
 or you just drove in a budget per square meter 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.229
 and whether you can fight here early or exactly here too 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.150
 for those 40 meters to rise then maybe there is a need for prints in the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.200
 kitchen 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.079
 I have to do something by hand seems to be now and then also needs days 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:13.469
 there are around thirty choices to make for deductions now different 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.029
 price levels of course 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.889
 then have to dare to deal with it alone 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.649
 so put the paintwork or a new doors 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.269
 and the ceiling 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.360
 and each calculated the cost of the kitchen 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.540
 and if you have more questions, it doesn't matter if anyone else costs that 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.319
 possible to solve the cost of a tree 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.409
 gain control
