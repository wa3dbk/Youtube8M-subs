you an overview of everything that's
gone<00:00:17.760> into<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.680> single<00:00:20.490> action

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
gone into it it is a single action

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.259 
gone into it it is a single action
oscillating<00:00:21.510> steam<00:00:21.810> engine<00:00:22.609> every<00:00:23.609> part<00:00:24.060> on

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
oscillating steam engine every part on

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.839 
oscillating steam engine every part on
it<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:24.990> hand<00:00:25.740> cast<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.550> machined<00:00:27.060> by<00:00:27.390> me<00:00:28.849> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
it was hand cast and machined by me the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.209 
it was hand cast and machined by me the
frame<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:31.820> cast<00:00:32.820> aluminum<00:00:34.070> everything<00:00:35.070> else

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
frame is cast aluminum everything else

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.900 
frame is cast aluminum everything else
this<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:36.030> solid<00:00:36.420> piece<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.910> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
this is one solid piece and then the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.130 
this is one solid piece and then the
cylinder<00:00:39.600> was<00:00:39.899> cast<00:00:41.149> drilled<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.480> bored<00:00:42.870> out

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
cylinder was cast drilled and bored out

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.880 
cylinder was cast drilled and bored out
it<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.559> cast<00:00:43.800> solid<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:45.660> crank<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.559> cast

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it was cast solid the crank was cast

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.600 
it was cast solid the crank was cast
from<00:00:47.340> another<00:00:47.670> piece<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:49.860> was<00:00:50.039> machined

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
from another piece and it was machined

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.840 
from another piece and it was machined
and<00:00:50.940> everything<00:00:51.500> there's<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.620> steel<00:00:53.550> pin

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and everything there's a steel pin

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.130 
and everything there's a steel pin
that's<00:00:54.030> been<00:00:54.180> pressed<00:00:54.480> into<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:55.789> the

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
that's been pressed into it and then the

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.110 
that's been pressed into it and then the
plunger<00:00:59.059> or<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.539> piston<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.989> should<00:01:01.170> say<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
plunger or the piston I should say a

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.550 
plunger or the piston I should say a
machine<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.390> also<00:01:04.820> out<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.970> aluminum<00:01:06.560> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
machine that also out of aluminum and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.429 
machine that also out of aluminum and
then<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.799> course<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.100> flywheel<00:01:09.200> I'll<00:01:10.200> show

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
then of course the flywheel I'll show

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.310 
then of course the flywheel I'll show
you<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> other<00:01:10.830> side<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.830 

the<00:01:17.660> cylinder<00:01:18.660> is<00:01:18.810> kept<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:20.330> with<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:23.510> bolt<00:01:24.510> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the cylinder is kept on with a bolt that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320 
the cylinder is kept on with a bolt that
goes<00:01:25.050> through<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> frame<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.010> a<00:01:26.880> washer<00:01:27.180> with

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
goes through the frame and a washer with

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.270 
goes through the frame and a washer with
a<00:01:27.360> spring<00:01:27.720> pressing<00:01:28.110> against<00:01:28.410> it<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
a spring pressing against it the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.450 
a spring pressing against it the
cylinders<00:01:30.410> pressed<00:01:31.410> up<00:01:31.620> tight<00:01:31.920> against<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
cylinders pressed up tight against the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:42.170 
cylinders pressed up tight against the
face<00:01:32.870> and<00:01:35.300> I'm<00:01:36.300> going<00:01:36.510> to<00:01:36.630> run<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.750 

it's<00:01:42.870> not<00:01:43.140> self-starting<00:01:44.010> but<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.610> run

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
it's not self-starting but you can run

00:01:44.760 --> 00:02:17.960 
it's not self-starting but you can run
it<00:01:44.940> in<00:01:45.090> either<00:01:45.360> direction

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.130 

you

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:54.930 

and<00:02:27.140> reverse

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.700 

there<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.060> go

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
there you go

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.690 
there you go
the<00:02:57.710> engine<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.220> run<00:02:58.250> quite<00:02:58.730> slow<00:03:00.700> it's

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
the engine can run quite slow it's

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.870 
the engine can run quite slow it's
difficult<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:03.140> keep<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.160> running<00:03:04.340> slow<00:03:04.670> just

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
difficult to keep it running slow just

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.720 
difficult to keep it running slow just
because<00:03:05.240> I<00:03:05.330> don't<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.630> true<00:03:06.530> valves<00:03:07.430> and

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
because I don't have true valves and

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.210 
because I don't have true valves and
regulators<00:03:08.570> hooked<00:03:09.140> up<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.680> right<00:03:09.830> now

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
regulators hooked up to it right now

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.400 
regulators hooked up to it right now
but<00:03:10.850> eventually<00:03:11.690> I'm<00:03:12.110> going<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.410> tap<00:03:12.680> out<00:03:12.890> the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
but eventually I'm going to tap out the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.610 
but eventually I'm going to tap out the
exhaust<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.860> intake<00:03:16.160> ports<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:18.020> I'll

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
exhaust and the intake ports and I'll

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.330 
exhaust and the intake ports and I'll
put<00:03:19.220> some<00:03:19.660> pipe<00:03:20.660> in<00:03:20.840> there<00:03:21.260> with<00:03:21.710> some<00:03:21.920> valves

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
put some pipe in there with some valves

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.440 
put some pipe in there with some valves
and<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.760> regulator<00:03:24.970> I'm<00:03:25.970> going<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.180> build<00:03:26.330> a

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
and a regulator I'm going to build a

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.650 
and a regulator I'm going to build a
boiler<00:03:26.810> for<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.230> soon<00:03:27.500> too<00:03:27.770> I<00:03:27.800> have<00:03:28.190> some<00:03:29.000> four

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
boiler for it soon too I have some four

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.250 
boiler for it soon too I have some four
inch<00:03:29.810> diameter<00:03:30.230> steel<00:03:30.950> pipe<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:32.480> I'll<00:03:32.630> weld<00:03:33.080> up

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
inch diameter steel pipe so I'll weld up

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.470 
inch diameter steel pipe so I'll weld up
a<00:03:33.380> boiler<00:03:33.740> for<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.310> don't<00:03:34.850> plan<00:03:35.000> on<00:03:35.150> running

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
a boiler for it I don't plan on running

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.340 
a boiler for it I don't plan on running
on<00:03:35.630> any<00:03:35.810> crazy<00:03:36.260> high<00:03:36.560> pressure<00:03:38.110> everything<00:03:39.110> is

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
on any crazy high pressure everything is

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.680 
on any crazy high pressure everything is
going<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.590> be<00:03:39.650> less<00:03:39.800> than<00:03:40.040> 50<00:03:40.820> psi<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:41.330> believe

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
going to be less than 50 psi I believe

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.949 
going to be less than 50 psi I believe
so<00:03:43.480> that'll<00:03:44.480> be<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:46.100> next<00:03:46.280> step

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.949 

everything<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:49.890> aluminum<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.970> go<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.569> oil<00:03:51.810> it

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
everything is aluminum so go to oil it

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.530 
everything is aluminum so go to oil it
really<00:03:52.260> well<00:03:52.439> are<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.939> metal<00:03:53.939> we're<00:03:54.299> out

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
really well are the metal we're out

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.210 
really well are the metal we're out
eating<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.049> can<00:03:55.110> already<00:03:55.379> see<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.860> I<00:03:55.890> mean

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
eating you can already see that I mean

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.089 
eating you can already see that I mean
it<00:03:57.000> wears<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.750> little<00:03:58.110> bit<00:03:58.260> that's<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:59.010> be

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
it wears a little bit that's to be

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.710
