00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.599 
actually really if you think about it
it's<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.690> really<00:04:19.109> stupid<00:04:19.530> attack<00:04:20.040> because<00:04:20.430> like

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
it's a really stupid attack because like

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.150 
it's a really stupid attack because like
he<00:04:21.239> needs<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.570> fucking<00:04:21.960> army<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.470> protect<00:04:22.620> him

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
he needs a fucking army to protect him

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.510 
he needs a fucking army to protect him
he<00:04:24.000> can't<00:04:24.270> fight<00:04:24.540> alone<00:04:24.930> because

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
he can't fight alone because

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.520 
he can't fight alone because
he<00:04:25.580> needs<00:04:25.789> one<00:04:26.060> hour<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.660> power<00:04:26.930> up<00:04:27.229> that

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
he needs one hour to power up that

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.270 
he needs one hour to power up that
attack<00:04:27.889> and<00:04:28.190> he<00:04:28.400> actually<00:04:28.849> mrs.<00:04:29.419> that<00:04:29.629> attack

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
attack and he actually mrs. that attack

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.309 
attack and he actually mrs. that attack
then<00:04:31.280> he<00:04:31.550> is<00:04:31.789> totally<00:04:32.030> fucked<00:04:32.509> like<00:04:32.810> that's

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
then he is totally fucked like that's

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.920 
then he is totally fucked like that's
probably<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.830> most<00:04:33.979> useless<00:04:34.659> fighter<00:04:35.659> that

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
probably the most useless fighter that

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.320 
probably the most useless fighter that
you<00:04:36.080> can<00:04:36.229> have<00:04:36.500> like<00:04:36.830> he<00:04:37.099> is<00:04:37.580> like<00:04:37.759> a<00:04:37.789> one-punch
