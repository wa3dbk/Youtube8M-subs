part of show jumping is how you take the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.350 
part of show jumping is how you take the
corner<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:24.280> impulsion<00:01:24.610> you<00:01:24.910> have<00:01:25.060> through

corner the impulsion you have through
the<00:01:25.479> turn<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:26.320> angle<00:01:26.860> maybe<00:01:27.039> of<00:01:27.250> which<00:01:27.430> you

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
the turn the angle maybe of which you

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.120 
the turn the angle maybe of which you
approach<00:01:27.729> events<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.619> momentum<00:01:30.100> you

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
approach events and the momentum you

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.169 
approach events and the momentum you
take<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.570> get<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:31.840> over<00:01:32.050> that<00:01:32.229> jump<00:01:33.179> the

take to get you over that jump the
demands<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.690> we<00:01:34.990> as<00:01:35.140> course<00:01:35.410> designers<00:01:36.009> put

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250

solvable by the riders so the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.410 
solvable by the riders so the
difficulties<00:01:42.039> that<00:01:42.069> we<00:01:42.250> put<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.789> are<00:01:43.209> the

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
difficulties that we put in are the

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.020 
difficulties that we put in are the
distances<00:01:43.929> between<00:01:43.990> fences<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.759> that<00:01:45.940> the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
distances between fences so that the
