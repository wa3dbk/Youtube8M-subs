playing<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.470> little<00:00:38.559> better<00:00:38.860> is<00:00:39.040> that<00:00:39.070> fair<00:00:39.370> to

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
playing a little better is that fair to

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.680 
playing a little better is that fair to
say<00:00:39.550> I'm<00:00:39.820> not<00:00:39.910> sure<00:00:40.090> they're<00:00:40.239> playing<00:00:40.539> a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
say I'm not sure they're playing a

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.150 
say I'm not sure they're playing a
little<00:00:40.780> better<00:00:41.109> better<00:00:41.710> they're<00:00:41.859> probably<00:00:42.039> a

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
little better better they're probably a

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.229 
little better better they're probably a
little<00:00:42.219> bit<00:00:42.370> more<00:00:42.519> predictable<00:00:43.090> in<00:00:43.210> their

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
little bit more predictable in their

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.000 
little bit more predictable in their
performances<00:00:43.960> I<00:00:44.019> mean<00:00:44.289> they're<00:00:44.410> just<00:00:44.440> grinded

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
performances I mean they're just grinded

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.060 
performances I mean they're just grinded
it<00:00:45.129> yeah<00:00:45.489> Benitez<00:00:46.120> must<00:00:46.359> be<00:00:46.859> manna<00:00:47.859> from

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
it yeah Benitez must be manna from

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.340 
it yeah Benitez must be manna from
heaven<00:00:48.160> for<00:00:48.460> a<00:00:48.670> minute<00:00:49.059> no<00:00:49.629> they're<00:00:50.170> winning

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
heaven for a minute no they're winning

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.739 
heaven for a minute no they're winning
games<00:00:50.649> or<00:00:51.039> getting<00:00:52.030> results<00:00:52.329> apart<00:00:52.539> from<00:00:52.660> the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
games or getting results apart from the

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.139 
games or getting results apart from the
Astor<00:00:53.109> one<00:00:53.260> yeah<00:00:53.559> but<00:00:54.039> doing<00:00:54.579> in<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.820> way<00:00:54.969> that

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
Astor one yeah but doing in a way that

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.689 
Astor one yeah but doing in a way that
is<00:00:55.300> not<00:00:55.539> really<00:00:55.809> heavily<00:00:56.589> to<00:00:56.859> easy<00:00:57.100> on<00:00:57.429> ya

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
is not really heavily to easy on ya

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.520 
is not really heavily to easy on ya
particularly<00:00:58.510> in<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.929> eye<00:00:58.960> but<00:00:59.260> they<00:00:59.350> get

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
particularly in the eye but they get

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.500 
particularly in the eye but they get
results<00:01:00.309> that<00:01:00.429> become<00:01:00.640> an<00:01:00.760> effective<00:01:00.999> huntley

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
results that become an effective huntley

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.470 
results that become an effective huntley
so<00:01:02.460> yeah<00:01:03.460> in<00:01:03.579> a<00:01:03.640> way<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.820> almost<00:01:04.150> know<00:01:04.360> what

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
so yeah in a way you almost know what

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.490

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
it's not great to watch it as I said

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.940 
it's not great to watch it as I said
it's<00:01:08.260> effective<00:01:08.680> man<00:01:09.400> city<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.740> fair<00:01:11.920> to

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
it's effective man city is it fair to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.260 
it's effective man city is it fair to
say<00:01:12.070> that<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.399> little<00:01:12.790> bit<00:01:12.880> like<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.149> man

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
say that a little bit like the man

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.760 
say that a little bit like the man
sitting<00:01:13.509> there<00:01:13.659> on<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.899> market<00:01:14.140> yeah<00:01:14.470> yeah

sitting there on the market yeah yeah
there's<00:01:15.250> too<00:01:15.399> much<00:01:15.520> difference<00:01:15.909> is<00:01:16.060> how<00:01:16.240> many

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
there's too much difference is how many

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.020 
there's too much difference is how many
did<00:01:16.689> not<00:01:16.720> no<00:01:17.259> not<00:01:17.470> really<00:01:17.649> I<00:01:17.909> clearly<00:01:18.909> think

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
did not no not really I clearly think

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.480 
did not no not really I clearly think
them<00:01:19.420> through<00:01:19.659> out<00:01:20.290> here<00:01:20.439> when<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:20.680> think<00:01:20.860> 350

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
them through out here when you think 350

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.580 
them through out here when you think 350
million<00:01:21.729> has<00:01:21.850> been<00:01:21.880> spent<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.270> that<00:01:22.329> Club<00:01:22.659> I'm

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
million has been spent in that Club I'm

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.130 
million has been spent in that Club I'm
not<00:01:23.799> sure<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.040> I<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:25.750> this<00:01:25.810> should<00:01:25.990> be<00:01:26.110> a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
not sure that I think this should be a

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.780 
not sure that I think this should be a
little<00:01:26.320> bit<00:01:26.469> further<00:01:26.799> down<00:01:26.950> them<00:01:27.399> down<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
little bit further down them down the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.639 
little bit further down them down the
road<00:01:27.909> than<00:01:28.060> they<00:01:28.210> actually<00:01:28.329> are<00:01:28.540> so<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.259> think

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
road than they actually are so I think

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.260 
road than they actually are so I think
it's<00:01:30.070> still<00:01:30.159> it's<00:01:30.369> still<00:01:30.430> on<00:01:30.670> convincing<00:01:31.030> at

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
it's still it's still on convincing at

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.649 
it's still it's still on convincing at
times<00:01:31.509> they<00:01:31.719> would<00:01:31.810> pour<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.350> other<00:01:32.500> day

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
times they would pour the other day

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.120 
times they would pour the other day
massively<00:01:34.659> poor<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.140> fact<00:01:35.380> very<00:01:35.649> very<00:01:35.920> lucky

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
massively poor in fact very very lucky

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.920 
massively poor in fact very very lucky
to<00:01:36.310> get<00:01:36.460> away<00:01:36.520> with<00:01:36.850> that<00:01:37.000> with<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.719> draw

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
to get away with that with the draw

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.700 
to get away with that with the draw
should<00:01:38.320> have<00:01:38.409> got<00:01:38.500> beaten<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.509> yeah<00:01:41.320> I<00:01:41.350> mean<00:01:41.560> I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
should have got beaten so yeah I mean I

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.700 
should have got beaten so yeah I mean I
if<00:01:42.369> you<00:01:43.149> send<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.479> me<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:44.049> I<00:01:44.259> didn't<00:01:44.500> think<00:01:44.560> I'd

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
if you send to me and I didn't think I'd

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.760 
if you send to me and I didn't think I'd
say<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.039> this<00:01:45.100> year<00:01:45.399> you<00:01:46.210> know<00:01:46.299> if<00:01:46.810> are<00:01:47.560> we

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
say that this year you know if are we

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.870 
say that this year you know if are we
more<00:01:47.920> likely<00:01:48.219> to<00:01:48.310> know<00:01:48.430> what<00:01:48.579> we're<00:01:48.700> going<00:01:48.789> to

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
more likely to know what we're going to

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.249 
more likely to know what we're going to
get<00:01:48.939> from<00:01:49.090> Liverpool<00:01:49.509> than<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.780> opponent's

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
get from Liverpool than the opponent's

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.200 
get from Liverpool than the opponent's
then<00:01:50.979> probably<00:01:51.310> in<00:01:51.430> this<00:01:51.579> game<00:01:51.789> you<00:01:51.909> could<00:01:52.060> say

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
then probably in this game you could say

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.660 
then probably in this game you could say
yes<00:01:52.390> we<00:01:52.570> are<00:01:52.689> yes<00:01:52.960> I<00:01:53.200> suppose<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.310> big<00:01:54.460> point

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
yes we are yes I suppose the big point

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.340 
yes we are yes I suppose the big point
for<00:01:54.820> City<00:01:55.060> since<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:55.420> matches<00:01:55.750> at<00:01:55.899> home<00:01:56.049> form

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
for City since the matches at home form

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.349 
for City since the matches at home form
is<00:01:56.469> excellent<00:01:56.619> they're<00:01:57.009> still<00:01:57.219> unbeaten<00:01:57.549> at

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
is excellent they're still unbeaten at

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.330 
is excellent they're still unbeaten at
Eastlands<00:01:58.869> this<00:01:59.020> season<00:01:59.409> with<00:01:59.560> nine<00:01:59.799> wins<00:01:59.829> and

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
Eastlands this season with nine wins and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.490 
Eastlands this season with nine wins and
three<00:02:01.060> draws<00:02:01.359> their<00:02:01.930> favorites<00:02:02.320> with<00:02:02.439> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
three draws their favorites with the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.740 
three draws their favorites with the
bookies<00:02:02.829> William<00:02:03.250> Hill<00:02:03.399> make<00:02:03.579> them<00:02:03.729> 625<00:02:04.420> and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
bookies William Hill make them 625 and

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.310 
bookies William Hill make them 625 and
Liverpool<00:02:05.619> are<00:02:05.829> nine<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.369> five<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.110> think

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
Liverpool are nine to five do you think

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.930 
Liverpool are nine to five do you think
Liverpool<00:02:08.500> can<00:02:08.920> keep<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.280> as<00:02:09.369> tight<00:02:09.399> against

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
Liverpool can keep it as tight against

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.400 
Liverpool can keep it as tight against
it<00:02:10.149> here's<00:02:10.360> Irving<00:02:10.509> s<00:02:10.750> other<00:02:11.020> side<00:02:11.200> yeah<00:02:11.380> I

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
it here's Irving s other side yeah I

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.500 
it here's Irving s other side yeah I
think<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:11.800> there's<00:02:12.130> nothing<00:02:12.460> in<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.790> arsenal

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
think so there's nothing in the arsenal

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.120 
think so there's nothing in the arsenal
game<00:02:13.690> nothing<00:02:14.020> in<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.410> everton<00:02:14.770> game<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:14.980> don't

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
game nothing in the everton game I don't

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.740 
game nothing in the everton game I don't
think<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.580> Liverpool<00:02:16.000> without<00:02:16.360> Tory's<00:02:16.720> a

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
think the Liverpool without Tory's a

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.560 
think the Liverpool without Tory's a
setup<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.410> score<00:02:18.310> goes<00:02:18.520> in<00:02:18.760> God<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.180> don't<00:02:19.510> think

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
setup to score goes in God I don't think

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.000 
setup to score goes in God I don't think
at<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.870> stage<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.230> good<00:02:20.410> enough

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
at this stage is good enough

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.210 
at this stage is good enough
quite<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> fantastic<00:02:22.420> player<00:02:22.629> but<00:02:23.040> scores<00:02:24.040> big

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
quite a fantastic player but scores big

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.679 
quite a fantastic player but scores big
goals<00:02:24.280> at<00:02:24.640> child<00:02:24.849> he's<00:02:25.150> not<00:02:25.299> he's<00:02:25.420> not<00:02:25.450> he's

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
goals at child he's not he's not he's

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.420 
goals at child he's not he's not he's
not<00:02:25.780> tire<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.260> easy<00:02:26.439> yeah<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.099> way<00:02:27.220> they

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
not tire is easy yeah and the way they

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.800 
not tire is easy yeah and the way they
play<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.790> style<00:02:28.030> they<00:02:28.150> play<00:02:28.360> means<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:28.720> you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
play the style they play means that you

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.899 
play the style they play means that you
when<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.049> playing<00:02:29.230> one<00:02:29.439> up<00:02:29.560> front<00:02:29.909> you're

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
when you playing one up front you're

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.250 
when you playing one up front you're
going<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.090> be<00:02:31.180> better<00:02:31.329> defensively<00:02:31.930> than<00:02:32.140> you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
going to be better defensively than you

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.890 
going to be better defensively than you
are<00:02:32.349> going<00:02:32.620> forward<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.599> just<00:02:34.599> think<00:02:34.750> they

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
are going forward so I just think they

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.170 
are going forward so I just think they
say<00:02:35.049> game<00:02:35.230> setup<00:02:35.560> for<00:02:35.829> Liverpool<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:37.000> make

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
say game setup for Liverpool to make

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.460 
say game setup for Liverpool to make
life<00:02:37.360> difficult<00:02:37.569> they'll<00:02:37.930> try<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.260> stifle

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
life difficult they'll try and stifle

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.100 
life difficult they'll try and stifle
main<00:02:38.860> city<00:02:39.159> and<00:02:39.760> hopefully<00:02:40.180> they<00:02:40.900> probably

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
main city and hopefully they probably

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.479 
main city and hopefully they probably
know<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.319> main<00:02:41.590> city<00:02:41.829> a<00:02:41.860> subpage<00:02:42.250> that

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
know that main city a subpage that

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.589 
know that main city a subpage that
defense<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.909> going<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.120> give<00:02:43.239> them<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.360> chance

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
defense is going to give them a chance

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.420 
defense is going to give them a chance
yeah<00:02:43.900> absolutely<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.560> take<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.890> yeah<00:02:45.190> if<00:02:45.310> they

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
yeah absolutely to take it yeah if they

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.280 
yeah absolutely to take it yeah if they
can<00:02:45.610> keep<00:02:45.760> Arsenal<00:02:46.060> quiet<00:02:46.450> for<00:02:46.959> most<00:02:47.049> of<00:02:47.200> the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
can keep Arsenal quiet for most of the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.149 
can keep Arsenal quiet for most of the
game<00:02:47.319> that<00:02:47.560> would<00:02:47.620> pull<00:02:47.799> them<00:02:47.920> they'll<00:02:48.099> be

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
game that would pull them they'll be

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.069 
game that would pull them they'll be
confident<00:02:48.609> they<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.760> keep<00:02:49.030> city<00:02:49.299> quiet<00:02:49.599> our
