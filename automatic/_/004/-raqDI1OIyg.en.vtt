00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.880
 closed circuit 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.030

 Committees from both the USA and Canada 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.759

 trade and they are still security but 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.920
 you think we expect big deals 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.910
 in subject let's say migratory yesterday we 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.670
 they gave 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.920
 baltar that nothing is willing to 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.290
 review the issue of visas more not 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.540
 He said he could change his policy and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.860
 actually an important thing that is 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.390
 workshop and we can not fight but and 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.840
 harper gave a press conference 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.240
 the Canadian reporters something alive that 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.030
 team and strong place to accompany but 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.980
 he also made it very clear that usa by the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.500
 sorry moment forgive me nothing for the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.910
 time will keep the vices to 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.000
 Mexicans by two criteria 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.760
 internal security fundamentals 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.950
 Canada and keep the costs of 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.590
 legal migration so he said that in the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.560
 cut in the medium term as he understands 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.650
 of sight what became accompanied 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.630
 grandchild reviews are open to talk 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.540
 of this topic but rather in the long 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.310
 original term paul greets you a 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.010
 consultation they were also talking about 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.410
 of this possibility of having and being a 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.210
 great energy potential of the region and 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.890
 made up of mexico united states and 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.370
 Canada this is also one of the topics 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.849
 central to this normal summit of the 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.189
 specific details of how 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.859
 like American companies and 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.260
 Canadians that real opportunities 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.650
 have to enter the Mexican market what 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.540
 kind of agreements to make with 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.639
 contracts that they can make with 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.799
 American and Canadian oil companies 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.900
 you have to remember that fix the 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.909
 Americans ted in the country or one of 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.489
 the countries that have developed the maximum 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:52.069
 technology for oil extraction 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.230
 in deep water and it is one of the areas 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.450
 in which Mexico has to take advantage of 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.459
 this American capability must be 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.919
 As I pointed out in the cover of 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.230
 exceptional is not where it was talked about 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.290
 that you can create a power 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.959
 energy in North America and Miguel 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.159
 gutheim the expert of the pib mexico has 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.659
 to be very smart when it comes to 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.799
 negotiate negotiate conditions 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:18.919
 equitable and obtain a benefit of 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.109
 energy nationalization of america I do not 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.789
 you said it here at the end in the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.650
 I am publishing in tourism sector 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.660
 it was even said that it could be generated 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.120
 one more power giving of those that 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.250
 they have at this time the Middle East 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.930
 of course they would be against 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.990
 very important text to know why 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.940
 years the Arab oil producers 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.190
 have controlled the weight of oil to 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.830
 world level and there should be a 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.570
 special counterweight for this because it 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.479
 requires that they agree on the 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.639
 mexico usa and naval analysts 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.260
 consider that good three hours because no 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.180
 there was time for such a negotiation 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.060
 complex but maybe to do the 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.770
 paula beginning of this negotiation you 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.600
 we invite you to continue questioning the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.600
 information with the following videos
