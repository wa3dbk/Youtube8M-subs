00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.740
 so people hello and welcome 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.750
 better said to a new video 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.910
 one to the second part of the series 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.100
 aiming shoot kill those at the moment 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.199
 my channel is running 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.510
 and yes I have a few things before 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.400
 say so at the moment that is yes 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.380
 a little bit irregular with the videos 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.609
 So sometimes two or sometimes three days 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.750
 I'm not really me either 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.699
 because maybe only two of them 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.199
 week or what I have to me 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.759
 many amis think so too 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.200
 that I do so now after the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.090
 about to make a scheme 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.510
 we had last time on the first 24 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.399
 hours we had nearly 30 likes and 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.700
 once the video the new video 40 likes 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.649
 has reached I will the next high 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.969
 load as fast as possible so think so 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.649
 I'll be up there 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.239
 although of course the next time the same 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 starts with such a small exception 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.899
 I drive on Saturday with commander 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 warrior Sirius and the other then 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.729
 Cologne and we are testing army of two 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.310
 the co- op mode on in the studio and yes 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.869
 that means the next series or will 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.549
 in any case only next week out 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.860
 come the next part of the series because 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.920
 now it comes the abo special me 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.610
 I was told he clicked a few 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.750
 merchandising articles so a few 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.330
 maybe bring a t-shirt 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.500
 or something or the game too and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.360
 of course I would not be selfish 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.189
 keep it for me but it will be one 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.080
 small raffle take place that should 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.700
 mainly for the people who are mine 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.560
 also on facebook twitter or on 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.750
 follow my blog and me, of course 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.680
 have subscribed 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.210
 Since we have to look we'll do it 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.770
 Will definitely be so on the weekend 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.450
 take place at the beginning or the beginning of the week 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.369
 monday tuesday he will be the raffle 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.899
 take place as a small substitute to 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.740
 Hundreds of abo special that he has at the moment 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.790
 the house has remained 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.259
 smaller is background smaller 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.890
 background on the gameplay in the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.460
 background running this is a 31 to 9 35 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.799
 to 1 reign game on the parade and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.090
 the special thing is that I'm with that 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.409
 So I picked up subscribers 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.030
 Now always with the evening 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.469
 Colleagues online and we invite everyone 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.040
 subscribers one that also saved me 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.330
 have at psn 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.890
 So I can only do it again 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.180
 say if you're upset i got it in 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.960
 posted the description again 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.190
 my psn name facebook twitter the block 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.920
 I can also link again 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.090
 and yes, maybe it will follow me 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.420
 also in the next video or if that 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.900
 yes, yes, but come now too 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.120
 time to the next part 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.230
 today it's all about the topic 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.610
 I will sensitize you so 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.650
 a little something to tell about the two 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.570
 sensitivity types over the very high 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.340
 about the 14 sensitivity over the whole 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.390
 low over the one and at the end 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.620
 I'll tell you a little bit more 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.660
 how I do it all and maybe 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.410
 A few more recommendations which was good 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.270
 is good then I will now first 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.610
 To begin with, show what we are talking about 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.280
 I also have sensitivity here 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.910
 a little video prepared moment like that 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.230
 Here you see For with the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.670
 Photosensitivity 1 I show you 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.260
 sometimes it turns here on the stone 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.270
 relatively I'll push the right one 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.220
 analog stick now completely to the right 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.470
 you just see that you are relative 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.070
 slowly turns around its own axis 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.019
 Now let's turn to 14 on the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.510
 crazy sight then sensitivity 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.769
 you can see that the environment hardly 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.810
 can see more because you are so fast 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.489
 turns what also means if you 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.510
 just still prevails or so that you yourself 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:25.340
 lightning 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.430
 Okay, so we come to the before and 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.810
 Disadvantages of the two variants first 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.879
 Let's start with the low one 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.159
 photosensitivity all in one direction 1 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.730
 is just great to far distance 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.560
 aim 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.599
 precise aiming becomes a lot easier 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.790
 just with weapons like the sniper at the 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.280
 then you just balance the breathing 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.040
 must or if the lmg if you are far 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.190
 one only has to teach distanz sein magazin 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.500
 so a little the slight recoil 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.010
 Balancing is so great for a long way 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.069
 distance shots suited the high 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.139
 Sensitivity all the way 14 it 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.819
 Great on close distance you can very very 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.200
 react quickly to adversaries 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.310
 for example, those who are behind you 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.409
 For example, it comes in a situation 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.670
 where there is an enemy in front of you, you kill him 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.139
 and look at the mini more almost im 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.879
 same moment behind you is also one 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.870
 you press the analog stick once briefly 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.060
 you are already to the left 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.489
 turned around and could be super fast 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.989
 respond to such situations 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.090
 That is why this is just the view 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.289
 sensitivity very well suited 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.650
 for faster depending on now comes again 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:30.560
 my recommendation depending on the style of play must 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.360
 you just watch what you like so much more 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.770
 what you like better there are people 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.720
 the quick more as I said there are people 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.919
 they are more tactic but actually 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.210
 it never so it's such a black 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.740
 white painting is but actually 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.940
 you always do a bit of both 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.260
 That's why you just have to watch what 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.660
 Do not make more use of them either 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.949
 sensitivities 1 or 14 but 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.669
 always something in between he in 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:51.979
 direction of these different strengths 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.110
 i can say anything between 6 and 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.030
 9 is relatively balanced 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.770
 I play between nine and ten 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.260
 usually more like 10 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.870
 since I'm actually the heir of the simple 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.960
 through surprised and I think that's very 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.380
 a lot of small maps give up in black 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.539
 ops 2 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.699
 and you do not have any funny ones 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.320
 play because the sensitivity 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.210
 so switch between 9 and 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.409
 10 I can recommend you it is very 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.520
 Well then you can do it very fast as well 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.500
 in the video you can see very fast 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.389
 Actually, even those react 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.220
 situations but once it was one 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.260
 one in ten such a distance shot 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.520
 will reasonably be because they are anyway 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.870
 actually a bit so 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.700
 you can still reasonably 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.020
 Of course, not as good as regulating 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.969
 if they now four or five who 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.870
 but it still works and so believe 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.950
 I just have the biggest advantage for you 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.190
 yes that was it actually already 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.620
 from me as far as I what else 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:47.240
 can say to the new video for the third 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.469
 Part of the middle of next week is the 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.770
 will deal with the right one 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:53.900
 Put on and extras for better goals 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.789
 I think one will kill you 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.380
 two-piece will be because I all yes 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.180
 weapons classes pass once over 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.590
 sms storm rifles sniper i will do everything 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.430
 will appeal a bit 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.169
 elaborate the part yes otherwise many 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.099
 thank you that you have been watching when 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.469
 it can have you liked her 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.099
 leave something there and yes to the 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.460
 next time 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.460
 ciao
