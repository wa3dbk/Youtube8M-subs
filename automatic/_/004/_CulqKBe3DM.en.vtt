spike<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:08.010> know<00:00:08.069> compound<00:00:08.670> higher<00:00:10.580> against<00:00:11.580> V

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080

D boot multi bytes a compound tire both
of<00:00:17.369> them<00:00:17.720> spikes<00:00:18.949> extremely<00:00:19.949> stiff<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.760> they

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
of them spikes extremely stiff so they

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.870 
of them spikes extremely stiff so they
can<00:00:21.090> get<00:00:21.449> into<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> air<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.230> good<00:00:22.740> both<00:00:23.670> in

can get into the air so good both in
love<00:00:24.029> about<00:00:24.330> same<00:00:24.660> durability<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.769> runs<00:00:26.699> for

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
love about same durability the runs for

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.150 
love about same durability the runs for
about<00:00:27.590> an<00:00:28.590> hour<00:00:28.910> more<00:00:29.910> than<00:00:30.150> an<00:00:30.210> hour<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:32.009> this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
about an hour more than an hour and this

about an hour more than an hour and this
for<00:00:32.430> about<00:00:32.640> well<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.170> worn<00:00:34.469> down<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.680> bit

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
for about well this is worn down a bit

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.979 
for about well this is worn down a bit
more<00:00:35.190> because<00:00:35.579> I've<00:00:35.940> been<00:00:36.270> using<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> bit

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
more because I've been using that a bit

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260 
more because I've been using that a bit
more<00:00:37.170> bots<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> same<00:00:38.579> durability

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
more bots have about the same durability

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.069 
more bots have about the same durability
this<00:00:40.200> does<00:00:40.469> more<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.660> Schumacher<00:00:42.660> tire<00:00:42.870> has<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
this does more the Schumacher tire has a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.010 
this does more the Schumacher tire has a
bit<00:00:43.290> more<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.280> low<00:00:44.610> profile<00:00:45.120> type<00:00:45.329> air<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
bit more of the low profile type air to

the<00:00:46.670> D<00:00:47.670> boo<00:00:47.820> tire<00:00:48.140> both<00:00:49.140> them<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> same

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the D boo tire both them have the same

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.939 
the D boo tire both them have the same
grip<00:00:50.070> massive<00:00:51.030> grip<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:52.590> you're<00:00:52.710> getting

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
grip massive grip and you're getting

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.819 
grip massive grip and you're getting
onto<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.640> actual<00:00:54.320> handling<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> tire

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
onto the actual handling of the tire

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.770 
onto the actual handling of the tire
compared<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> each<00:00:56.550> other<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.329> may<00:00:57.480> think

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
compared to each other you may think

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.560 
compared to each other you may think
that<00:00:57.870> these<00:00:58.230> might<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.940> just<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> same

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that these might be just about the same

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.229 
that these might be just about the same
tire<00:01:01.079> well<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> same<00:01:02.579> time<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> same

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
tire well not the same time but the same

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.770 
tire well not the same time but the same
sort<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:04.439> performance<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:06.180> with<00:01:06.390> this

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
sort of like performance but with this

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.340 
sort of like performance but with this
like<00:01:07.350> sort<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:08.030> ring<00:01:09.030> around<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.780> side<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
like sort of ring around the side of the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.480 
like sort of ring around the side of the
tire<00:01:11.360> well<00:01:12.360> I'm<00:01:12.479> gonna<00:01:12.570> compare<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.110> first

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
tire well I'm gonna compare this first

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.090 
tire well I'm gonna compare this first
this<00:01:14.490> has<00:01:14.640> got<00:01:14.850> same<00:01:15.210> wide<00:01:15.420> grip<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
this has got same wide grip as this so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.999 
this has got same wide grip as this so
much<00:01:17.280> durability<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.439> humic<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> tire<00:01:20.030> but<00:01:21.030> it's

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
much durability as humic a tire but it's

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.380 
much durability as humic a tire but it's
with<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.189> ring<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> said<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> second<00:01:24.360> ago

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
with this ring like I said a second ago

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.410 
with this ring like I said a second ago
it<00:01:25.140> makes<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.820> makes<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.119> want<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
it makes it like it makes it want to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.929 
it makes it like it makes it want to
push<00:01:27.659> while<00:01:28.080> that's<00:01:28.650> probably<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.670> just

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
push while that's probably it's just

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.850 
push while that's probably it's just
like<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.659> doesn't<00:01:31.020> feel<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:31.770> good

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
like this doesn't feel like a very good

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.630 
like this doesn't feel like a very good
tire<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.369> doesn't<00:01:32.640> feel<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.479> wants<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
tire it doesn't feel like it wants to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.450 
tire it doesn't feel like it wants to
turn<00:01:37.130> turn<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.280> good<00:01:38.490> compared<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.939> when<00:01:40.460> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
turn turn that good compared to when it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.980 
turn turn that good compared to when it
doesn't<00:01:41.759> want<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.970> turn<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.600> car<00:01:42.810> doesn't

fifty but this is the last performance
tires<00:02:20.610> like<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:22.110> make<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.880> transition<00:02:24.650> by

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
tires like it make it the transition by

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.200 
tires like it make it the transition by

and<00:02:27.240> spa<00:02:27.710> isn't<00:02:28.710> as<00:02:28.890> good<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.600> time

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
and spa isn't as good on this time

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.370 
and spa isn't as good on this time
compared<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.500> because<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.880> basically

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
compared to that because this basically

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.560 
compared to that because this basically
makes<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.590> car<00:02:34.920> feel<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.310> bit<00:02:35.520> more<00:02:35.730> agile<00:02:36.210> I

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
makes the car feel a bit more agile I

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.080 
makes the car feel a bit more agile I
don't<00:02:37.200> know<00:02:37.320> why<00:02:37.500> but<00:02:37.830> he<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:38.160> probably<00:02:38.700> it's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
don't know why but he just probably it's

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.200 
don't know why but he just probably it's
more<00:02:39.120> simple<00:02:39.630> sign<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.020> just<00:02:40.050> got<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:41.210> pins

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
more simple sign you just got like pins

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.520 
more simple sign you just got like pins
and<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.530> there's<00:02:43.710> like<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.750> wall<00:02:45.750> nosov<00:02:46.170> ring

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
and so there's like the wall nosov ring

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.890 
and so there's like the wall nosov ring
around<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.100> stuff<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.820> bit<00:02:48.750> more

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
around and stuff up a bit more

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.980 
around and stuff up a bit more
complicated<00:02:49.320> design<00:02:50.000> but<00:02:51.000> yeah<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:53.990> overall

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
complicated design but yeah and overall

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.380 
complicated design but yeah and overall
though<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.230> felt<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.980> maket<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.370> opposite<00:02:56.850> like

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
though I felt you maket I opposite like

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.700 
though I felt you maket I opposite like
I<00:02:57.420> said<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.690> makes<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.990> much<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.290> car<00:02:58.500> feel

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
I said it makes it much the car feel

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.190 
I said it makes it much the car feel

more<00:03:08.400> than<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:08.970> tire<00:03:09.240> but<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:10.410> don't<00:03:10.530> care

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
more than that tire but I don't care
