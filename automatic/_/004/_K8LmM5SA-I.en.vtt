00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
for me it was just that wild abandonment

something that we all want to feel but

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.400 
something that we all want to feel but
first<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.239> order<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.290> be

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
first in order to do that you have to be

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.080 
first in order to do that you have to be
very<00:00:37.590> technically<00:00:38.129> strong<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> mentally

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
very technically strong and mentally

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.330 
very technically strong and mentally
strong<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:40.290> then<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.829> take<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.280> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
strong and then you can take it to that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.760 
strong and then you can take it to that
next<00:00:41.460> level<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.090> them<00:00:42.270> free<00:00:42.870> them<00:00:43.050> I'm<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.590> type

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
next level of them free them I'm a type

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.490 
next level of them free them I'm a type
of<00:00:43.920> person<00:00:44.280> who<00:00:44.629> really<00:00:45.629> enjoys<00:00:45.930> having

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
of person who really enjoys having

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.279 
of person who really enjoys having
consistency<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.910> being<00:00:48.149> mechanical<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> good

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
consistency so being mechanical is good

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.450 
consistency so being mechanical is good
for<00:00:49.920> me<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.309> think<00:00:50.760> having<00:00:52.129> repetition<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> good

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
for me I think having repetition is good

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.830

best<00:00:55.020> skates<00:00:56.120> every<00:00:57.120> moment<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.570> make<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
best skates every moment I make a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.130 
best skates every moment I make a
mistake<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:59.329> improved<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> next<00:01:00.719> time<00:01:00.870> stay

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
mistake it's improved the next time stay

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.060 
mistake it's improved the next time stay
in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.949> moment<00:01:02.780> every<00:01:03.780> single<00:01:04.170> edge<00:01:04.409> counts

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
in the moment every single edge counts

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.160 
in the moment every single edge counts
focus<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.970> everything<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.689> always<00:01:06.869> has

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.290 
moment now I've learned to really give
it<00:01:42.350> my<00:01:42.560> best<00:01:42.590> shot<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.250> that's<00:01:43.730> why<00:01:43.880> we<00:01:44.060> train

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
it my best shot and that's why we train

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.450 
it my best shot and that's why we train
because<00:01:44.540> at<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.900> end<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:45.410> can't<00:01:45.950> go<00:01:46.070> back<00:01:46.280> in

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
because at the end you can't go back in

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.280 
because at the end you can't go back in
time<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.880> redo<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.510> may<00:01:47.869> as<00:01:47.930> well<00:01:48.080> give<00:01:48.260> it

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
time and redo it so may as well give it

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.990 
time and redo it so may as well give it
your<00:01:48.500> best<00:01:48.560> shot<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:48.979> give<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.460> all<00:01:49.580> your<00:01:49.760> all
