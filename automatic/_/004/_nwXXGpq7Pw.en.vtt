00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
alright so hey guys I'm nice mark and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.540 
alright so hey guys I'm nice mark and
what<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:21.060> free<00:00:21.300> today<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:22.170> two<00:00:22.740> very<00:00:23.220> simple

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
what have free today is two very simple

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.390 
what have free today is two very simple
obsidian<00:00:24.300> generator<00:00:24.330> designs<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.529> Minecraft

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
obsidian generator designs in Minecraft

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.390 
obsidian generator designs in Minecraft
so<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.570> very<00:00:27.810> first<00:00:27.869> one<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.220> most

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
so this very first one here is the most

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.479 
so this very first one here is the most
efficient<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.470> so<00:00:31.470> all<00:00:31.740> dispensers<00:00:32.309> are

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
efficient one so all dispensers are

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.660 
efficient one so all dispensers are
exhibited<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> same<00:00:33.750> time<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.670> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
exhibited at the same time and the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.470 
exhibited at the same time and the
abscission<00:00:35.940> generates<00:00:37.670> now<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> second<00:00:39.329> one

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
abscission generates now the second one

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.459 
abscission generates now the second one
here<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.520> not<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> sufficient<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
here is not a sufficient but it is

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.209 
here is not a sufficient but it is
pretty<00:00:43.920> cool<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> dispensers<00:00:46.710> aren't

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
pretty cool so the dispensers aren't

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.670 
pretty cool so the dispensers aren't
exhibited<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> same<00:00:48.239> time<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.390> yes<00:00:52.379> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
exhibited at the same time and yes so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.250 
exhibited at the same time and yes so
those<00:00:53.160> designs<00:00:53.550> were<00:00:53.789> inspired<00:00:54.390> by<00:00:54.510> his<00:00:54.989> Summa

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
those designs were inspired by his Summa

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.680 
those designs were inspired by his Summa
void<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.920> made<00:00:56.579> them<00:00:56.760> after<00:00:57.180> watching<00:00:57.360> his

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
void I made them after watching his

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.410 
void I made them after watching his
video<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.440> i'll<00:00:59.370> provide<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.820> link<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.390> his

now<00:02:29.690> you're<00:02:29.959> pretty<00:02:30.349> much<00:02:30.530> done<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.579> we<00:02:31.849> can

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
now you're pretty much done so we can

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.300 
now you're pretty much done so we can
also<00:02:32.150> take<00:02:32.540> out<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:32.930> book<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.530> stand<00:02:33.860> here

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
also take out this book to stand here

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.319 
also take out this book to stand here
and<00:02:34.489> let's<00:02:35.450> test<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.900> out<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.090> very

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
and let's test it out it is very

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.539 
and let's test it out it is very
important<00:02:42.019> that<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.230> place<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.950> Redstone<00:02:43.340> in

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
important that you place the Redstone in

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.780 
important that you place the Redstone in
this<00:02:43.940> order<00:02:44.239> or<00:02:45.140> else<00:02:45.349> it<00:02:45.590> will<00:02:45.769> break<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.430> keep

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
this order or else it will break so keep

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.539 
this order or else it will break so keep
that<00:02:46.819> in<00:02:46.970> mind<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:48.220> another<00:02:49.220> little<00:02:49.519> thing

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
that in mind and another little thing

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:56.259 
that in mind and another little thing
that<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:49.970> could<00:02:50.090> add<00:02:50.299> is<00:02:50.799> hoppers<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:55.030> if<00:02:56.030> you

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
that you could add is hoppers so if you

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.949 
that you could add is hoppers so if you
place<00:02:56.569> hoppers<00:02:57.220> pointing<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.459> direction

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
place hoppers pointing in that direction

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.530 
place hoppers pointing in that direction
you<00:02:59.959> can<00:03:00.139> also<00:03:00.350> collect<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.370> season<00:03:01.880> so

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
you can also collect that season so

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.740 
you can also collect that season so
they'll<00:03:02.720> have<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:02.959> walk<00:03:03.370> like<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.540> but<00:03:05.540> it's

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
they'll have to walk like this but it's

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.129 
they'll have to walk like this but it's
up<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.790> now<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.239> second<00:03:08.600> design<00:03:08.870> is

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
up to you and now the second design is

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:14.770 
up to you and now the second design is
here<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.730> as<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.090> can<00:03:11.180> see<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.310> yeah<00:03:14.269> almost

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
here so as you can see it is yeah almost

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.960 
here so as you can see it is yeah almost
the<00:03:14.900> same<00:03:15.109> thing<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.519> look<00:03:16.819> at<00:03:16.850> it

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
the same thing and you just look at it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.860 
the same thing and you just look at it
and<00:03:17.269> you<00:03:17.329> can<00:03:17.780> build<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.109> from<00:03:18.260> here<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.780> you

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
and you can build it from here so you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.240 
and you can build it from here so you
can<00:03:21.019> see<00:03:21.049> that<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.319> redstone<00:03:21.829> dust<00:03:21.980> is

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
can see that the redstone dust is

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.629 
can see that the redstone dust is
replaced<00:03:22.700> by<00:03:22.850> repeaters<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.220> then<00:03:25.220> we<00:03:25.430> have

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
replaced by repeaters and then we have

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.479 
replaced by repeaters and then we have
arrest<00:03:26.030> online<00:03:26.410> diagonal<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.709> dispensers

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
arrest online diagonal to the dispensers

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.780 
arrest online diagonal to the dispensers
and<00:03:29.019> here<00:03:30.019> so<00:03:30.380> that's<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.370> this

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
and here so that's that and this

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.550 
and here so that's that and this
basically<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.510> hope<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:32.989> guys<00:03:33.170> like<00:03:33.410> this

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
basically I hope you guys like this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.120 
basically I hope you guys like this
little<00:03:33.769> design<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.489> our<00:03:35.269> CEO<00:03:35.769> later<00:03:37.090> bye<00:03:38.090> bye
