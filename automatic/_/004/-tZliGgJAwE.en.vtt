I've already loaded up a lot of this see

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.110 
I've already loaded up a lot of this see
even<00:02:17.350> online<00:02:17.470> Nvidia<00:02:17.980> shield<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.700> takes<00:02:19.000> a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
even online Nvidia shield it takes a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.260 
even online Nvidia shield it takes a

is<00:02:22.450> pretty<00:02:22.660> impressive<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.230> think<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:25.030> is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
is pretty impressive I think and this is

is pretty impressive I think and this is
a<00:02:25.210> quad-core<00:02:25.600> processor<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:27.130> pink<00:02:28.020> 1.7

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
a quad-core processor it's a pink 1.7

a quad-core processor it's a pink 1.7
gigahertz<00:02:29.610> not<00:02:30.610> sure<00:02:30.760> what<00:02:30.940> kind<00:02:31.120> of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
gigahertz not sure what kind of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.660 
gigahertz not sure what kind of
processor<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:33.130> runs<00:02:33.460> really

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
processor it is but it runs really

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
processor it is but it runs really
smooth<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.710> does<00:02:35.860> really<00:02:36.070> well<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.580> a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
smooth and it does really well on a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.800 
smooth and it does really well on a
rendering<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.870> far<00:02:38.110> distances<00:02:39.570> alright<00:02:40.570> so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
rendering the far distances alright so

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.080 
rendering the far distances alright so
if<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.170> want<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.410> place<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.680> block<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.430> would<00:02:42.910> go

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
if I want to place a block I would go

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.400 
if I want to place a block I would go
over<00:02:43.120> here<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.450> highlight<00:02:44.350> it<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.650> then<00:02:44.710> l2

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
over here and highlight it and then l2

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.260 
over here and highlight it and then l2
so<00:02:47.410> if<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:47.560> want<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.800> go<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.130> next<00:02:48.430> item<00:02:48.610> to

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
so if we want to go to the next item to

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.210 
so if we want to go to the next item to
the<00:02:49.390> right<00:02:49.600> it's<00:02:49.900> right<00:02:50.170> bumper<00:02:50.410> or<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.130> the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the right it's right bumper or to the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.820 
the right it's right bumper or to the
left<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.580> select<00:02:51.730> bumper<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.710> that'll<00:02:53.710> save

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
left to select bumper and that'll save

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.410 
left to select bumper and that'll save
me<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:54.070> my<00:02:54.160> little<00:02:54.370> hot<00:02:54.520> bar<00:02:54.760> down<00:02:54.970> there<00:02:55.210> and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
me to my little hot bar down there and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.320 
me to my little hot bar down there and
then<00:02:56.230> r2<00:02:56.770> is<00:02:57.040> mine<00:02:57.400> just<00:02:57.700> like<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.000> saw<00:02:58.180> me

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
then r2 is mine just like you saw me

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.480 
then r2 is mine just like you saw me
chopping<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.750> wood<00:02:58.810> there<00:02:59.250> also<00:03:00.250> on<00:03:00.370> the

I'm<00:04:09.100> just<00:04:09.160> going<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.459> start<00:04:09.670> off<00:04:09.820> a<00:04:09.850> little<00:04:10.150> bit

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
I'm just going to start off a little bit

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
here and see if there's any difference

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.830 
here and see if there's any difference
because<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.390> build<00:04:13.630> is<00:04:13.810> 8.2<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:16.480> I<00:04:16.510> want

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
because of the build is 8.2 but I want

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.440 
because of the build is 8.2 but I want
to<00:04:16.930> go<00:04:17.470> fast<00:04:18.250> forward<00:04:18.580> a<00:04:18.609> little<00:04:18.640> bit<00:04:18.850> into<00:04:19.299> it

the<00:05:37.479> way<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.599> bedrock<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.260> came<00:05:38.440> up<00:05:38.620> about<00:05:38.770> ten

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
the way to bedrock and came up about ten

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.680 
the way to bedrock and came up about ten
and<00:05:40.139> I<00:05:41.139> dug<00:05:42.039> the<00:05:42.250> whole<00:05:42.370> way<00:05:42.550> this<00:05:42.880> way<00:05:43.060> and<00:05:43.090> I

still haven't found any lava I know it's

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.120 
still haven't found any lava I know it's
not<00:05:45.910> that<00:05:46.120> far<00:05:46.360> but<00:05:46.690> usually<00:05:47.560> you<00:05:47.860> can<00:05:48.039> at

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
not that far but usually you can at

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.219 
not that far but usually you can at
least<00:05:48.220> hear<00:05:48.580> lava<00:05:48.820> or<00:05:49.120> see<00:05:49.300> lava<00:05:49.510> or<00:05:49.840> something

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
least hear lava or see lava or something

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.219 
least hear lava or see lava or something
and<00:05:50.729> I<00:05:51.729> haven't<00:05:52.030> seen<00:05:52.240> any<00:05:52.419> down<00:05:52.630> here<00:05:52.840> so<00:05:53.110> I'm

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
and I haven't seen any down here so I'm

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.129 
and I haven't seen any down here so I'm
pretty<00:05:53.380> sure<00:05:53.650> this<00:05:53.800> is<00:05:53.949> the<00:05:53.979> same<00:05:54.220> build<00:05:54.520> as

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
pretty sure this is the same build as

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.140 
pretty sure this is the same build as
8.1<00:05:56.139> with<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.410> exception<00:05:56.860> of<00:05:56.979> the<00:05:57.669> options

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
8.1 with the exception of the options

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.760 
8.1 with the exception of the options
are<00:05:58.300> a<00:05:58.330> little<00:05:58.449> different<00:05:58.690> and<00:05:59.050> it<00:05:59.260> has<00:05:59.289> game

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
are a little different and it has game

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.800 
are a little different and it has game
pad<00:06:00.099> all<00:06:01.000> right<00:06:01.180> you<00:06:01.419> know<00:06:01.539> the<00:06:01.660> game

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
pad all right you know the game

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.710 
pad all right you know the game
controller<00:06:02.229> support<00:06:02.800> built<00:06:03.070> into<00:06:03.430> it<00:06:03.610> so<00:06:04.360> it's

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
controller support built into it so it's

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.360 
controller support built into it so it's
a<00:06:04.750> little<00:06:05.050> different<00:06:05.349> you<00:06:05.949> know<00:06:06.070> just

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
a little different you know just

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.890 
a little different you know just
slightly<00:06:06.669> because<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.630> has<00:06:07.720> different

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
slightly because it has different

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.210 
slightly because it has different
programming<00:06:08.500> for<00:06:08.680> the<00:06:08.770> buttons<00:06:09.070> and

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
programming for the buttons and

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.390 
programming for the buttons and
everything<00:06:09.280> but<00:06:09.820> for<00:06:10.720> the<00:06:10.810> most<00:06:10.990> part<00:06:11.110> is<00:06:11.470> very

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
everything but for the most part is very

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.300 
everything but for the most part is very
much<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:12.729> same<00:06:13.139> again<00:06:14.139> may<00:06:15.010> look<00:06:15.220> a<00:06:15.250> little

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
much the same again may look a little

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.600 
much the same again may look a little
different<00:06:15.789> because<00:06:16.560> basically<00:06:17.560> this<00:06:17.949> feels

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
different because basically this feels

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.290 
different because basically this feels
like<00:06:18.940> I'm<00:06:19.120> play<00:06:19.300> an<00:06:19.389> Xbox<00:06:19.780> 360<00:06:20.380> version<00:06:20.800> of

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
like I'm play an Xbox 360 version of

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.089 
like I'm play an Xbox 360 version of

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
Minecraft but it's actually the Pocket

Minecraft but it's actually the Pocket
Edition<00:06:24.160> version<00:06:24.930> so<00:06:25.930> it's<00:06:26.889> $6.99<00:06:27.310> to

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060

pretty awesome so far a very little lag

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.200 
pretty awesome so far a very little lag
as<00:06:34.990> far<00:06:35.169> as<00:06:35.289> loading<00:06:35.560> and<00:06:35.979> it's<00:06:36.400> not<00:06:36.610> half<00:06:36.940> as

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
as far as loading and it's not half as

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.240 
as far as loading and it's not half as
is<00:06:37.600> what<00:06:37.960> I<00:06:37.990> get<00:06:38.169> from<00:06:38.319> my<00:06:38.500> Nvidia<00:06:38.979> shield

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
is what I get from my Nvidia shield

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.830 
is what I get from my Nvidia shield
which<00:06:39.550> is<00:06:39.580> very<00:06:40.240> good

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
which is very good

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.420 
which is very good
it's<00:06:41.740> a<00:06:41.800> quad-core<00:06:42.039> processor<00:06:42.250> as<00:06:42.910> well<00:06:43.139> so

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
it's a quad-core processor as well so

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.770 
it's a quad-core processor as well so
hopefully<00:06:45.430> this<00:06:45.639> gives<00:06:45.669> the<00:06:46.060> information<00:06:46.180> you

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780
