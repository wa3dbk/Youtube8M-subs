00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hi there, this is son today video i 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.429
 I'll tell you how to overclock the processor on 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:15.980
 example computer with a processor jay 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.980
 6950 and asus p750 motherboard 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:35.489
 look processor james 950 clock 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.489
 frequency 2 and 8 gigahertz 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:47.320
 Now we will disperse it to cleanliness in 3 and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.309
 4 gigahertz that is 2 and 8 about nothing 34 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:58.680
 level 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:01:04.989
 a and 3 already reboot naturally yet 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.990
 reboots I would like to say something 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.770
 that before overclocking the processor is necessary 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.049
 naturally get good 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.500
 cooling that is cooler on 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.920
 processor otherwise possible what he's 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.540
 you will overheat the best 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.229
 simply 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:32.109
 the computer will be stupid or off 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:36.750
 so go in the bios virus go here 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:42.039
 here and tweaker on the motherboard data 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:46.090
 radius there is such a situation 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:52.810
 the sub-menu is associated entirely with 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:02:00.789
 overclocking there is a multiplier 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:02.530
 the processor is also this one 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:08.380
 menu item we will need 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:12.510
 where we will improve in order to 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.990
 increase the processor clock frequency 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.560
 Also here you can increase the voltage but 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:25.360
 everything is lined up on cars 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:30.640
 let it remain volt voltage 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.690
 manually we will not exhibit 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:43.200
 use pure change 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:46.080
 purity so we see here 133 costs 162 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.150
 that is, with a multiplier of 21 in principle 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:57.120
 should make 3 4 gigahertz 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:04.260
 set and exit saving exit 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:06.090
 persisting principle I want to remind everything 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.330
 I just have about cooling 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:15.470
 expensive cooling completely copper 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:18.800
 Kohler 1200 rubles at one time bought 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.800
 hall man's sky 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.540
 so even the overclocked processor is not 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.220
 Heats more than 50 degrees with 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.380
 standard CPU cooler when 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.350
 acceleration to three or four he 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.410
 the temperature went over 100 degrees then 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.390
 have a computer stupid shut down had to 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.390
 here to change a cooler 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.590
 load up 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.090
 Now we will see how much we 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:18.350
 did in fact the calculations should have been 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.350
 be 3 4 gigahertz 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:46.280
 So we look at 3 4 GHz each core 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:49.699
 It has arrived that is, without buying a new one. 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.360
 processor we have acquired a good margin 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:56.660
 power principle these processors can and 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.620
 more overclocking I read something up to 4 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.819
 GHz accelerating 4 and 2 maximum 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:08.990
 I think they were dispersed to 4 5 but 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:11.630
 given a given frequency, they have already burned all 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.370
 thank you all subscribe to my channel 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.340
 in the next video I will tell you how 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.740
 overclock a video card using 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:23.289
 special program 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.289
 all all bye if you
