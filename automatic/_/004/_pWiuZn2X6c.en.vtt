series<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.699> channel<00:00:17.900> now<00:00:18.900> back<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
series on this channel now back to the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.630 
series on this channel now back to the
mechanism<00:00:19.890> his<00:00:20.760> mechanism<00:00:21.539> was<00:00:22.080> very<00:00:22.949> slow

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
mechanism his mechanism was very slow

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.150 
mechanism his mechanism was very slow
which<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> problem<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:25.769> it

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
which is the problem with it

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.810 
which is the problem with it
and<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:27.000> also<00:00:27.240> didn't<00:00:27.930> completely<00:00:28.550> make<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and it also didn't completely make the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.780 
and it also didn't completely make the
spear<00:00:30.210> they<00:00:30.689> had<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> lot<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.320> holes<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.949> so

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
spear they had a lot of holes in it so

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.150 
spear they had a lot of holes in it so
yeah<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> problem<00:00:33.980> with<00:00:34.980> this

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
yeah that was the problem with this

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.970 
yeah that was the problem with this
little<00:00:35.460> machine<00:00:35.730> right<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.320> create

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
little machine right here we can create

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.760 
little machine right here we can create
an<00:00:38.160> entire<00:00:38.520> spear<00:00:39.210> which<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.750> 100%<00:00:40.260> complete

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
an entire spear which is 100% complete

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.950 
an entire spear which is 100% complete
in<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.550> five<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.090> ten<00:00:42.239> seconds<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.840> it's

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
in about five to ten seconds so it's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.100 
in about five to ten seconds so it's
very<00:00:43.260> very<00:00:43.710> fast<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.960> just

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
very very fast now to do it we can just

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.600 
very very fast now to do it we can just
go<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.440> or<00:00:47.070> wherever

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
go up here or wherever

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.479 
go up here or wherever
really<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.260> place<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> block<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.250> can

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
really and we just place a block you can

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.209 
really and we just place a block you can
use<00:00:50.910> set<00:00:51.239> block<00:00:51.449> or<00:00:51.719> actually<00:00:52.110> tower<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.680> it's

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
use set block or actually tower up it's

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.430 
use set block or actually tower up it's
up<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:54.449> squid<00:00:54.930> whose

so let's actually get rid of this area
down<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.470> cuz<00:01:35.150> we<00:01:36.150> don't<00:01:36.270> want<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.720> right

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.230 
perfect so let's say we want to make
this<00:01:55.950> sphere<00:01:56.340> smaller

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
this sphere smaller

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.429 
this sphere smaller
okay<00:01:57.659> Mouse<00:01:58.040> stop<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.219> net<00:01:59.990> we<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.290> go

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
slipped the radius to let's say six and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.949 
slipped the radius to let's say six and
we<00:02:07.950> set<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> number<00:02:08.520> right<00:02:08.700> before<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.539> 5

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
we set a number right before that to 5

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.060 
we set a number right before that to 5
which<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.190> radius

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
which is the radius

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.560 
which is the radius
cool<00:02:14.070> now<00:02:14.910> let's<00:02:15.270> go<00:02:15.420> back<00:02:15.600> up<00:02:15.780> here<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.970> set

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
cool now let's go back up here and set

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.350 
cool now let's go back up here and set
our<00:02:18.690> stone<00:02:19.020> six<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:20.100> let's<00:02:20.760> watch<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.210> magic

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
our stone six and let's watch the magic

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.780 
our stone six and let's watch the magic
happen<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:24.180> yeah<00:02:24.600> pretty<00:02:24.930> cool<00:02:26.180> Danis<00:02:28.160> yeah<00:02:29.160> so

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
happen so yeah pretty cool Danis yeah so

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.890 
happen so yeah pretty cool Danis yeah so
now<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:30.120> our<00:02:30.210> little<00:02:30.480> sphere<00:02:30.930> right<00:02:31.170> here

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
now we have our little sphere right here

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.170 
now we have our little sphere right here
let's<00:02:33.900> say<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.140> wanted<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.470> make<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.830> sphere

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
let's say you wanted to make the sphere

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.760 
let's say you wanted to make the sphere
not<00:02:36.180> hollow<00:02:36.650> all<00:02:37.650> we'd<00:02:38.130> have<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.310> do<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:39.770> go

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
not hollow all we'd have to do is go

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.690 
not hollow all we'd have to do is go
back<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.670> remove<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.900> little<00:02:43.700> radius

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
back here and remove this little radius

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.910 
back here and remove this little radius
minimum<00:02:45.210> tag<00:02:46.070> now<00:02:47.070> if<00:02:47.640> we<00:02:47.760> go<00:02:47.880> back<00:02:47.910> up<00:02:48.240> here<00:02:48.920> we

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
minimum tag now if we go back up here we

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.680 
minimum tag now if we go back up here we
can<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.640> replace<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.660> with<00:02:51.870> air<00:02:53.510> go<00:02:54.510> back

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
can just replace this with air go back

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.000 
can just replace this with air go back
up<00:02:55.160> sit<00:02:56.160> block<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.820> let's<00:02:57.390> make<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:58.010> solid

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
up sit block and let's make a solid

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.130 
up sit block and let's make a solid
sphere<00:02:59.450> as<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.570> can<00:03:00.660> see<00:03:00.900> when<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.110> is

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
sphere as you can see when it is

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.070 
sphere as you can see when it is
building<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.710> is<00:03:01.830> solid

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
building it is solid

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.220 
building it is solid
okay<00:03:04.080> now<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.510> actually<00:03:06.690> saves<00:03:07.520> the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
okay now and it actually saves the

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.840 
okay now and it actually saves the
middle<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.470> block<00:03:10.860> or<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.400> middle<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
middle of the block or the middle of the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.020 
middle of the block or the middle of the
sphere<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:13.140> it's<00:03:13.680> kind<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:13.950> handy<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.820> now<00:03:14.970> we

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
sphere so it's kind of handy so now we

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.910 
sphere so it's kind of handy so now we
know<00:03:15.330> where<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.720> middle<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.530> sphere<00:03:16.800> is

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
know where the middle of the sphere is

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.830 
know where the middle of the sphere is
we<00:03:17.160> can<00:03:17.340> do<00:03:17.820> whatever<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.150> want<00:03:18.420> with<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.690> now

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
we can do whatever we want with it now

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.180 
we can do whatever we want with it now
that<00:03:19.459> was<00:03:20.459> kind<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.790> cool<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.810> once<00:03:22.530> again<00:03:22.709> if

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
that was kind of cool and once again if

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.210 
that was kind of cool and once again if
you<00:03:23.400> want<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.900> fix<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.110> sphere<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.070> need

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
you want to fix the sphere you just need

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.490 
you want to fix the sphere you just need
to<00:03:26.310> place<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:26.850> squid<00:03:27.270> this<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.170> gonna<00:03:28.260> kind

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
to place that squid this is gonna kind

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:46.280 
to place that squid this is gonna kind
of<00:03:28.620> trap<00:03:28.950> me<00:03:29.190> yeah<00:03:35.600> easy<00:03:40.010> nice<00:03:43.880> there<00:03:45.290> that's

of trap me yeah easy nice there that's

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.650 
of trap me yeah easy nice there that's
close<00:03:46.709> one<00:03:46.980> accidentally<00:03:47.489> almost<00:03:48.300> totally

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
close one accidentally almost totally

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.600 
close one accidentally almost totally
didn't<00:03:48.930> make<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.230> Mamluks<00:03:49.739> yeah<00:03:50.130> all<00:03:50.489> right

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
didn't make the Mamluks yeah all right

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.050 
didn't make the Mamluks yeah all right
so<00:03:51.000> let's<00:03:51.209> get<00:03:51.390> on<00:03:51.540> into<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.290> explanation

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
so let's get on into the explanation

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.840 
so let's get on into the explanation
what's<00:03:54.060> going<00:03:54.390> on<00:03:54.510> here<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:55.430> there's<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.580> fill

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
what's going on here is there's a fill

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.259 
what's going on here is there's a fill
clock<00:03:57.650> then<00:03:58.650> we're<00:03:59.130> going<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.519> execute<00:04:00.120> that

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
clock then we're going to execute that

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.020 
clock then we're going to execute that
any<00:04:00.510> squid<00:04:00.989> whose<00:04:01.290> name<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.709> spear<00:04:02.100> will<00:04:02.910> get

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
any squid whose name is spear will get

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.390 
any squid whose name is spear will get
execute<00:04:03.540> right<00:04:03.810> below<00:04:04.170> them<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:04.890> what<00:04:05.160> one

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
execute right below them so what one

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.509 
execute right below them so what one
block<00:04:05.610> below<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.350> forty<00:04:07.350> blocks<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:08.250> way

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
block below and forty blocks that way

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.490 
block below and forty blocks that way
and<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.760> positives<00:04:09.330> dead<00:04:09.600> so<00:04:09.900> if<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.110> squid

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
and the positives dead so if the squid

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.310 
and the positives dead so if the squid
is<00:04:10.650> here<00:04:10.980> it's<00:04:11.400> gonna<00:04:11.580> execute<00:04:11.970> here<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.690> 40

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
is here it's gonna execute here and 40

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.430 
is here it's gonna execute here and 40
blocks<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.800> way<00:04:14.330> it's<00:04:15.330> then<00:04:15.570> going<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.870> fill

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
blocks that way it's then going to fill

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.930 
blocks that way it's then going to fill
an<00:04:16.709> area<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.459> looks<00:04:17.669> like<00:04:17.820> this

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
an area that looks like this

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.230 
an area that looks like this
but<00:04:20.940> much<00:04:21.150> bigger<00:04:21.530> with<00:04:22.530> lily<00:04:23.310> pads<00:04:23.700> it's<00:04:24.030> a

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
but much bigger with lily pads it's a

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.530 
but much bigger with lily pads it's a
plane<00:04:25.020> it's<00:04:25.410> an<00:04:25.560> X<00:04:25.800> plane<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.910> yeah

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
plane it's an X plane so yeah

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.379 
plane it's an X plane so yeah
lily<00:04:27.870> pads<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:28.950> they<00:04:29.100> will<00:04:29.400> instantly<00:04:30.000> break

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
lily pads so they will instantly break

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.890 
lily pads so they will instantly break
and<00:04:30.660> turn<00:04:30.900> into<00:04:31.110> entities<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:31.950> then<00:04:32.550> we

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
and turn into entities and then we

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.350 
and turn into entities and then we
execute<00:04:33.900> at<00:04:34.380> any<00:04:34.620> entity<00:04:35.250> who's<00:04:35.790> a<00:04:35.820> squid

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
execute at any entity who's a squid

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.360 
execute at any entity who's a squid
whose<00:04:36.570> name<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:36.960> fear<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.500> we<00:04:38.160> give<00:04:38.340> a

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
whose name is fear and we give a

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.970 
whose name is fear and we give a
scoreboard<00:04:38.790> scored<00:04:39.300> fear<00:04:39.810> one<00:04:40.200> to<00:04:40.410> any<00:04:40.590> water

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
scoreboard scored fear one to any water

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.480 
scoreboard scored fear one to any water
lily<00:04:41.750> then<00:04:42.750> what<00:04:42.870> we<00:04:42.990> do<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.350> we<00:04:43.770> execute<00:04:44.190> any

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
lily then what we do is we execute any

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.750 
lily then what we do is we execute any
item<00:04:44.910> whose<00:04:45.300> score<00:04:46.169> whose<00:04:46.680> spear<00:04:47.040> score<00:04:47.490> is

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
item whose score whose spear score is

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.050 
item whose score whose spear score is
minimum<00:04:48.720> one<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.200> we<00:04:49.800> summon<00:04:50.280> an<00:04:50.400> item<00:04:50.790> frame

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
minimum one and we summon an item frame

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.490 
minimum one and we summon an item frame
whose<00:04:51.510> custom<00:04:52.140> name<00:04:52.410> is<00:04:52.740> spear<00:04:53.310> builder<00:04:54.500> then

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
whose custom name is spear builder then

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.800 
whose custom name is spear builder then
we<00:04:55.740> just<00:04:55.980> kill<00:04:56.490> any<00:04:56.850> item<00:04:57.180> with<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.360> score<00:04:57.780> of

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
we just kill any item with a score of

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.990 
we just kill any item with a score of
sphere<00:04:58.169> minimum<00:04:58.560> one<00:04:58.710> so<00:04:58.890> we<00:04:58.980> killed<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.580> water

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
sphere minimum one so we killed a water

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.390 
sphere minimum one so we killed a water
lily<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:00.600> now<00:05:01.440> that<00:05:01.530> we<00:05:01.650> have<00:05:01.680> this<00:05:01.830> item<00:05:02.040> frame

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
lily so now that we have this item frame

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.580 
lily so now that we have this item frame
but<00:05:02.580> it's<00:05:02.700> gonna<00:05:02.790> TP<00:05:03.150> every<00:05:03.690> item<00:05:03.990> frame<00:05:04.320> whose

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
but it's gonna TP every item frame whose

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.040 
but it's gonna TP every item frame whose
name<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:04.980> spear<00:05:05.280> builder<00:05:05.700> negative<00:05:06.690> one<00:05:06.900> on

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
name is spear builder negative one on

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.540 
name is spear builder negative one on
the<00:05:07.169> Z<00:05:07.410> so<00:05:07.770> this<00:05:07.980> way<00:05:08.220> every<00:05:09.060> tick<00:05:10.160> then<00:05:11.160> we

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
the Z so this way every tick then we

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.600 
the Z so this way every tick then we
execute<00:05:11.940> at<00:05:12.330> any<00:05:12.770> entity<00:05:13.770> whose<00:05:13.950> name<00:05:14.190> or

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
execute at any entity whose name or

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.360 
execute at any entity whose name or
whose<00:05:14.790> a<00:05:14.820> type<00:05:15.630> is<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:15.840> squid<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.740> should

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
whose a type is a squid I should

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.219 
whose a type is a squid I should
actually<00:05:17.550> probably<00:05:17.940> put<00:05:18.450> that<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.870> name

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
actually probably put that to name

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.240 
actually probably put that to name
equals<00:05:19.830> spear<00:05:21.530> and<00:05:22.530> we<00:05:22.740> summon<00:05:23.130> and

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
equals spear and we summon and

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.320 
equals spear and we summon and
understand<00:05:23.880> whose<00:05:24.120> name<00:05:24.450> is<00:05:24.870> spear<00:05:26.210> then<00:05:27.210> what

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
understand whose name is spear then what

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.690 
understand whose name is spear then what
we<00:05:27.419> do<00:05:27.570> is<00:05:27.840> we<00:05:28.140> execute<00:05:28.770> that<00:05:28.860> any<00:05:29.010> armorstand

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
we do is we execute that any armorstand

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.969 
we do is we execute that any armorstand
whose<00:05:30.000> name<00:05:30.240> is<00:05:30.419> sphere<00:05:30.780> basically<00:05:31.740> right

whose name is sphere basically right
below<00:05:32.250> them<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.960> we<00:05:34.400> execute<00:05:35.400> any<00:05:35.700> item<00:05:36.090> frame

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
below them and we execute any item frame

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.520 
below them and we execute any item frame

just going to fill bedrock right where
it<00:06:07.950> is<00:06:08.039> it's<00:06:08.340> gonna<00:06:08.460> replace<00:06:08.880> air<00:06:09.890> then<00:06:10.890> we

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
it is it's gonna replace air then we

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.909 
it is it's gonna replace air then we
just<00:06:11.340> add<00:06:11.729> a<00:06:11.789> sphere<00:06:12.419> counter<00:06:13.080> score<00:06:13.470> of<00:06:13.560> one

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
just add a sphere counter score of one

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.279 
just add a sphere counter score of one
to<00:06:14.160> every<00:06:14.419> armorstand<00:06:15.419> named<00:06:15.630> sphere<00:06:16.110> and

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
to every armorstand named sphere and

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.219 
to every armorstand named sphere and
every<00:06:17.010> item<00:06:17.220> frame<00:06:17.640> named<00:06:17.880> sphere<00:06:18.270> builder<00:06:18.690> we

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
every item frame named sphere builder we

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.800 
every item frame named sphere builder we
just<00:06:19.380> kill<00:06:19.770> them<00:06:20.340> when<00:06:20.970> their<00:06:21.120> sphere<00:06:21.450> counter

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
just kill them when their sphere counter

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.969 
just kill them when their sphere counter
score<00:06:21.990> is<00:06:22.080> ninety<00:06:22.500> so<00:06:22.620> it's<00:06:22.740> gonna<00:06:22.830> be

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
score is ninety so it's gonna be

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.250 
score is ninety so it's gonna be
counting<00:06:23.370> up<00:06:23.490> as<00:06:23.640> the<00:06:24.000> unfriend<00:06:24.690> move<00:06:24.990> and

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
counting up as the unfriend move and

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.350 
counting up as the unfriend move and
there's<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:25.860> armored<00:06:26.130> stance<00:06:26.400> it<00:06:26.610> says<00:06:26.820> kill

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
there's the armored stance it says kill

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.240 
there's the armored stance it says kill
them<00:06:27.510> when<00:06:27.630> it<00:06:27.750> reaches<00:06:28.050> ninety<00:06:28.440> it's<00:06:29.130> gonna

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
them when it reaches ninety it's gonna

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.530 
them when it reaches ninety it's gonna
just<00:06:29.490> kill<00:06:29.760> every<00:06:30.240> squid<00:06:30.690> whose<00:06:30.900> name<00:06:31.110> is

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
just kill every squid whose name is

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.440 
just kill every squid whose name is
here<00:06:31.740> that's<00:06:32.740> about<00:06:32.950> it<00:06:33.100> very<00:06:33.460> simple<00:06:33.940> system

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450 
here that's about it very simple system

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.590 
here that's about it very simple system
