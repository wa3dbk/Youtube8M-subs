the caterpillar 24m by North Scott comes
in<00:00:49.330> the<00:00:49.540> usual<00:00:50.160> caterpillar<00:00:51.160> style<00:00:51.430> box<00:00:51.670> it's

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
in the usual caterpillar style box it's

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.000 
in the usual caterpillar style box it's
quite<00:00:52.150> a<00:00:52.180> big<00:00:52.390> box<00:00:52.540> for<00:00:52.750> this<00:00:52.840> model<00:00:53.050> there's

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
quite a big box for this model there's

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.740 
quite a big box for this model there's
some<00:00:54.100> information<00:00:54.520> about<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.850> model<00:00:55.000> but

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
some information about the model but

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.860 
some information about the model but
nothing<00:00:56.020> at<00:00:56.110> all<00:00:56.230> about<00:00:56.380> the<00:00:56.620> real<00:00:56.770> machine

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
nothing at all about the real machine

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.229 
nothing at all about the real machine
and<00:00:58.870> if<00:00:59.050> you<00:00:59.140> get<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.350> model<00:00:59.590> out<00:00:59.710> then<00:01:00.670> we'll

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
and if you get the model out then we'll

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.939 
and if you get the model out then we'll
have<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.480> look<00:01:01.690> underneath<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.620> see<00:01:02.770> if<00:01:02.830> we've

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
have a look underneath and see if we've

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.140 
have a look underneath and see if we've
got<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.340> dreaded<00:01:04.150> ties<00:01:04.390> securing<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:05.110> model

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
got the dreaded ties securing the model

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.010 
got the dreaded ties securing the model
which<00:01:07.150> means<00:01:07.300> there'll<00:01:07.510> be<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.630> battle<00:01:07.930> in

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
which means there'll be a battle in

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.570 
which means there'll be a battle in
store<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.440> remove<00:01:08.710> them<00:01:08.920> let's<00:01:09.100> have<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.310> look

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
store to remove them let's have a look

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.680 
store to remove them let's have a look
and<00:01:10.860> yep<00:01:11.860> there<00:01:12.310> we<00:01:12.400> are<00:01:12.430> okay<00:01:13.210> I'm<00:01:13.450> just<00:01:13.540> going

and yep there we are okay I'm just going

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.090 
and yep there we are okay I'm just going
to<00:01:13.720> take<00:01:13.840> 10<00:01:14.050> minutes<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.350> get<00:01:14.770> them<00:01:14.890> all<00:01:14.979> out

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
to take 10 minutes to get them all out

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.690 
to take 10 minutes to get them all out
and<00:01:15.280> I'll<00:01:15.340> be<00:01:15.460> back<00:01:15.580> in<00:01:15.700> just<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.910> second<00:01:17.700> so

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
and I'll be back in just a second so

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.010 
and I'll be back in just a second so
let's<00:01:18.820> start<00:01:19.119> by<00:01:19.240> having<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.570> look<00:01:19.660> underneath

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
let's start by having a look underneath

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.690 
let's start by having a look underneath
the<00:01:20.259> model<00:01:21.210> there's<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.270> fair<00:01:22.450> effort<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:23.700> model

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
the model there's a fair effort to model

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.070 
the model there's a fair effort to model
some<00:01:24.850> of<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.000> transmission<00:01:25.479> components<00:01:25.990> on

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
some of the transmission components on

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.249 
some of the transmission components on
the<00:01:26.170> rear<00:01:26.320> axles<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.880> if<00:01:28.090> we<00:01:28.240> move<00:01:28.899> over<00:01:29.080> and

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
the rear axles and if we move over and

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.510 
the rear axles and if we move over and
look<00:01:29.410> at<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.590> circle<00:01:29.979> we<00:01:30.070> consider<00:01:30.399> some

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
look at the circle we consider some

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.310 
look at the circle we consider some
detailing<00:01:30.910> underneath<00:01:31.330> of<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.960> the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
detailing underneath of that and the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.690 
detailing underneath of that and the
complicated<00:01:32.890> mechanism<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.520> front

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
complicated mechanism that the front

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.570 
complicated mechanism that the front
axle<00:01:34.000> has<00:01:34.119> been<00:01:34.270> reproduced<00:01:35.200> also<00:01:35.560> here's<00:01:36.520> a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
axle has been reproduced also here's a

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.310 
axle has been reproduced also here's a
close-up<00:01:36.880> of<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.210> front<00:01:37.509> axle<00:01:37.660> and<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.170> can

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
close-up of the front axle and you can

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.080 
close-up of the front axle and you can
see<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.649> hydraulic<00:01:39.130> hoses<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.729> cylinders

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
see the hydraulic hoses to the cylinders

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.570 
see the hydraulic hoses to the cylinders
are<00:01:40.270> painted<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:41.380> really<00:01:41.860> it's<00:01:41.950> quite<00:01:42.160> a<00:01:42.340> good

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
are painted so really it's quite a good

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.240 
are painted so really it's quite a good
and<00:01:42.729> detailed<00:01:43.090> rendition<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.860> when<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.070> pull

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
and detailed rendition but when you pull

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.510 
and detailed rendition but when you pull
back<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.840> tire<00:01:46.840> tread<00:01:47.500> pattern<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:48.100> not<00:01:48.340> so

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
back the tire tread pattern is not so

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.830 
back the tire tread pattern is not so
convincing<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.149> looks<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.330> bit<00:01:49.360> tore<00:01:49.660> like

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
convincing and looks a bit tore like

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.320 
convincing and looks a bit tore like
really<00:01:50.369> sideways<00:01:51.369> on<00:01:51.580> things<00:01:51.940> look<00:01:52.119> better

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
really sideways on things look better

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.510 
really sideways on things look better
and<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:53.140> can<00:01:53.170> see<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.560> plastic<00:01:53.770> wheel<00:01:54.310> hubs

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
and you can see the plastic wheel hubs

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.510 
and you can see the plastic wheel hubs
have<00:01:54.700> got<00:01:54.880> wheel<00:01:55.660> nuts<00:01:55.869> detailed<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:57.369> can

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
have got wheel nuts detailed and you can

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.949 
have got wheel nuts detailed and you can
see<00:01:57.670> here<00:01:57.880> there<00:01:58.000> are<00:01:58.060> plenty<00:01:58.149> of<00:01:58.360> grab<00:01:58.599> rails

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
see here there are plenty of grab rails

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.710 
see here there are plenty of grab rails
and<00:01:59.170> lights<00:01:59.410> detailed<00:02:00.250> on<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.490> body<00:02:00.670> at<00:02:01.569> the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
and lights detailed on the body at the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.719 
and lights detailed on the body at the
back<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.229> rip<00:02:02.500> assembly<00:02:02.950> is<00:02:03.099> mostly<00:02:03.490> metal

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
back the rip assembly is mostly metal

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.300 
back the rip assembly is mostly metal
and<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:05.170> some<00:02:05.319> nicely<00:02:05.500> formed<00:02:05.860> teeth<00:02:06.039> and

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
and with some nicely formed teeth and

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.570 
and with some nicely formed teeth and
above<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.300> we<00:02:07.660> can<00:02:07.840> see<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.470> grille<00:02:09.369> on<00:02:09.490> the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
above that we can see the grille on the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.750 
above that we can see the grille on the
engine<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.149> some<00:02:10.899> painted<00:02:11.230> lights<00:02:11.760> detail

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
engine and some painted lights detail

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.980 
engine and some painted lights detail
around<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.090> cab<00:02:13.270> is<00:02:13.450> fine

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
around the cab is fine

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.500 
around the cab is fine
perhaps<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.349> handrails<00:02:15.160> are<00:02:15.400> just<00:02:15.550> touch<00:02:15.790> fat

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
perhaps the handrails are just touch fat

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.420 
perhaps the handrails are just touch fat
and<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.410> beacon<00:02:17.830> light<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.130> roof<00:02:18.280> is

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
and the beacon light on a roof is

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.670 
and the beacon light on a roof is
certainly<00:02:18.730> big<00:02:18.970> things<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.170> area<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.470> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
certainly big things in the area of the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.740 
certainly big things in the area of the
moldboard<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.610> circle<00:02:21.970> are<00:02:22.090> pretty<00:02:22.270> good

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
moldboard and the circle are pretty good

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.380 
moldboard and the circle are pretty good
perhaps<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.560> detail<00:02:23.860> isn't<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.760> sharpest

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
perhaps the detail isn't the sharpest

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.130 
perhaps the detail isn't the sharpest
and<00:02:25.540> crispest

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
and crispest

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
and crispest
but<00:02:26.890> at<00:02:27.069> least<00:02:27.190> it's<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.640> fair<00:02:27.910> rendition<00:02:29.160> one

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
but at least it's a fair rendition one

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.010 
but at least it's a fair rendition one
thing<00:02:30.370> about<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:30.700> model<00:02:30.910> is<00:02:31.300> although<00:02:31.810> it

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
thing about this model is although it

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.210 
thing about this model is although it
doesn't<00:02:32.170> look<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.560> there's<00:02:32.739> actually<00:02:32.860> quite<00:02:33.130> a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
doesn't look it there's actually quite a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.070 
doesn't look it there's actually quite a

now<00:03:05.160> play<00:03:05.430> around<00:03:05.610> with<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.850> features<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.210> the

now play around with the features of the
model<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.410> first<00:03:07.620> thing<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.860> notice

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
model and the first thing to notice

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.070 
model and the first thing to notice
though<00:03:08.280> it's<00:03:08.490> actually<00:03:08.850> really<00:03:09.060> quite<00:03:09.180> large

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
though it's actually really quite large

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.230 
though it's actually really quite large
obviously<00:03:10.470> reflecting<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.130> size<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
obviously reflecting the size of the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.720 
obviously reflecting the size of the
real<00:03:12.390> machine<00:03:12.720> because<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:13.320> is<00:03:13.610> plaster<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
real machine because this is plaster the

real machine because this is plaster the
mining<00:03:15.030> grader<00:03:15.270> by<00:03:15.480> caterpillar<00:03:15.990> it<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
mining grader by caterpillar it is the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.530 
mining grader by caterpillar it is the
biggest<00:03:16.710> in<00:03:16.800> their<00:03:16.950> range<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:18.030> pushes<00:03:18.420> on

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
biggest in their range it pushes on

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.510 
biggest in their range it pushes on
quite<00:03:18.780> nicely<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.260> wheels<00:03:19.440> turn<00:03:19.710> well<00:03:19.920> and

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
quite nicely the wheels turn well and

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.120 
quite nicely the wheels turn well and
you<00:03:20.670> can<00:03:20.820> articulate<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:22.010> stay<00:03:23.010> at<00:03:23.070> the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
you can articulate it and stay at the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.420 
you can articulate it and stay at the
front<00:03:23.310> axle<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:24.180> produce<00:03:24.480> some<00:03:24.690> interesting

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
front axle to produce some interesting

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.830 
front axle to produce some interesting
looking<00:03:26.810> poses<00:03:27.810> really<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.850> rear<00:03:30.150> axles<00:03:30.630> have

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
looking poses really the rear axles have

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.160 
looking poses really the rear axles have
floating<00:03:32.180> kind<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.240> a<00:03:33.300> suspension<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:33.960> you<00:03:33.990> can

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
floating kind of a suspension so you can

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.440 
floating kind of a suspension so you can
see<00:03:34.260> they're<00:03:34.410> pivoted<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:35.060> move<00:03:36.060> quite<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.300> lot

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
see they're pivoted and move quite a lot

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.430 
see they're pivoted and move quite a lot
so<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.750> good<00:03:36.840> range<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.140> movement<00:03:37.260> on

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
so it's a good range of movement on

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.530 
so it's a good range of movement on
those<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.520> Ripper<00:03:38.730> mechanism<00:03:39.420> at<00:03:39.510> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
those and the Ripper mechanism at the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.860 
those and the Ripper mechanism at the
back<00:03:39.750> can<00:03:40.650> fold<00:03:41.220> down<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.760> fold<00:03:42.600> up<00:03:42.750> it

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
back can fold down and fold up it

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.530 
back can fold down and fold up it
doesn't<00:03:43.080> fold<00:03:43.230> up<00:03:43.380> tight<00:03:43.650> because<00:03:44.100> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
doesn't fold up tight because the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.960 
doesn't fold up tight because the
hydraulic<00:03:45.540> cables<00:03:45.900> used<00:03:46.860> in<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.160> model<00:03:47.370> kind

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
hydraulic cables used in the model kind

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.280 
hydraulic cables used in the model kind
of<00:03:48.060> restrict<00:03:48.390> its<00:03:48.510> movement<00:03:48.570> just<00:03:48.990> a<00:03:49.110> little

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
of restrict its movement just a little

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.890 
of restrict its movement just a little
bit<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:49.710> it's<00:03:49.830> quite<00:03:50.010> effective<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:51.630> front

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
bit but it's quite effective the front

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.600 
bit but it's quite effective the front
axle<00:03:52.350> is<00:03:52.500> quite<00:03:52.740> a<00:03:52.770> complicated<00:03:53.130> piece<00:03:53.550> of

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
axle is quite a complicated piece of

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.000 
axle is quite a complicated piece of
modelling<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:55.170> steering<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.680> pretty

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
modelling and the steering is pretty

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.830 
modelling and the steering is pretty
good<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.760> can<00:03:56.790> get<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.060> really<00:03:57.600> quite<00:03:57.810> a

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
good you can get a really quite a

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.930 
good you can get a really quite a
reasonable<00:03:58.080> angle<00:03:58.620> on<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.670> steering

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
reasonable angle on the steering

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.630 
reasonable angle on the steering
mechanism<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:01.530> angle<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.070> oscillation

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
mechanism and the angle of oscillation

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.420 
mechanism and the angle of oscillation
of<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.850> whole<00:04:02.970> axle<00:04:03.450> up<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.020> down<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:05.070> very

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
of the whole axle up and down is very

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.940 
of the whole axle up and down is very
good<00:04:05.670> range<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.480> movement<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.350> on<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
good range of movement on the on the

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.580 
good range of movement on the on the
front<00:04:08.070> axle<00:04:08.310> there<00:04:08.700> not<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:09.690> good<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.110> the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
front axle there not so good is the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.500 
front axle there not so good is the
mechanism<00:04:11.190> for<00:04:11.430> tilting<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.090> tires

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
mechanism for tilting the tires

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.390 
mechanism for tilting the tires
so<00:04:13.200> although<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.470> cylinders<00:04:13.950> are<00:04:14.070> modelled

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
so although the cylinders are modelled

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.280 
so although the cylinders are modelled
it's<00:04:14.820> really<00:04:15.090> too<00:04:15.240> stiff<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.660> doesn't<00:04:16.049> move

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
it's really too stiff and doesn't move

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.710 
it's really too stiff and doesn't move
very<00:04:16.350> much<00:04:16.560> at<00:04:16.799> all<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.790> other<00:04:17.970> aspect<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.600> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
very much at all the other aspect of the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.900 
very much at all the other aspect of the
steering<00:04:19.080> is<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.530> articulation<00:04:20.430> between<00:04:20.580> the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
steering is the articulation between the

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.310 
steering is the articulation between the
front<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.480> back<00:04:21.600> of<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.840> machine<00:04:22.140> and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
front and the back of the machine and

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.470 
front and the back of the machine and
this<00:04:23.220> works<00:04:23.430> quite<00:04:23.610> well<00:04:23.850> on<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:23.970> model<00:04:24.180> a

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
this works quite well on the model a

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.350 
this works quite well on the model a
couple<00:04:25.230> of<00:04:25.290> cylinders<00:04:25.470> controlled<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.360> and

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
couple of cylinders controlled it and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.380 
couple of cylinders controlled it and
there's<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:27.630> reasonable<00:04:28.080> range<00:04:28.230> of<00:04:28.440> movement

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
there's a reasonable range of movement

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.909 
there's a reasonable range of movement
so<00:04:30.390> let's<00:04:30.690> turn<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.140> business<00:04:31.590> end<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.830> the

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
so let's turn to the business end of the

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.500 
so let's turn to the business end of the
machine<00:04:32.250> which<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.640> circle<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.419> the

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
machine which is the circle and the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.650 
machine which is the circle and the
moldboard<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:35.180> mechanism<00:04:36.180> that<00:04:36.300> holds<00:04:36.600> the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
moldboard the mechanism that holds the

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.600 
moldboard the mechanism that holds the
circle<00:04:37.050> is<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.530> bit<00:04:37.740> complicated<00:04:38.010> like<00:04:38.400> it<00:04:38.520> is

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
circle is a bit complicated like it is

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.700 
circle is a bit complicated like it is
on<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.760> real<00:04:38.940> machine<00:04:39.090> but<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.110> can<00:04:40.320> use<00:04:40.530> it

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
on the real machine but you can use it

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.670 
on the real machine but you can use it
to<00:04:40.950> both<00:04:41.940> lower<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.390> circle<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:42.900> also<00:04:43.080> put<00:04:43.500> an

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
to both lower the circle and also put an

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.100 
to both lower the circle and also put an
angle<00:04:43.919> of<00:04:44.130> tilt<00:04:44.340> on<00:04:44.580> it<00:04:44.700> so<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.900> blade<00:04:46.080> is

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
angle of tilt on it so that the blade is

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.650 
angle of tilt on it so that the blade is
tilted<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:47.700> bit<00:04:47.880> stiff<00:04:48.090> on<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.330> model<00:04:48.570> as

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
tilted is a bit stiff on the model as

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.540 
tilted is a bit stiff on the model as
you<00:04:48.750> can<00:04:48.870> imagine<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.380> as<00:04:50.220> long<00:04:50.340> as<00:04:50.370> you're

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
you can imagine and as long as you're

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.010 
you can imagine and as long as you're
careful<00:04:50.640> not<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.000> break<00:04:51.150> anything<00:04:51.480> you<00:04:51.840> can

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
careful not to break anything you can

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.090 
careful not to break anything you can
set<00:04:52.350> any<00:04:52.440> pose<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.100> would<00:04:53.550> like<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:55.100> the

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
set any pose that you would like and the

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.540 
set any pose that you would like and the
blade<00:04:56.460> itself<00:04:57.440> rotates<00:04:58.440> on<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.710> circle<00:04:59.039> quite

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
blade itself rotates on the circle quite

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.379 
blade itself rotates on the circle quite
nicely

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
nicely

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.619 
nicely
and<00:05:01.039> you<00:05:02.039> can<00:05:02.220> jiggle<00:05:02.430> is<00:05:02.819> about<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.180> bit<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.539> get

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
and you can jiggle is about a bit to get

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.719 
and you can jiggle is about a bit to get
it<00:05:03.780> how<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:03.990> want<00:05:04.259> it<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:05.520> moldboard

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
it how you want it and the moldboard

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.110 
it how you want it and the moldboard
also<00:05:06.360> moves<00:05:07.110> transversely<00:05:07.889> side<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.580> side<00:05:08.789> so

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
also moves transversely side to side so

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.869 
also moves transversely side to side so
you<00:05:09.210> get<00:05:09.300> to<00:05:09.389> put<00:05:09.569> it<00:05:09.689> at<00:05:09.810> different<00:05:10.879> offsets

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:11.879 
you get to put it at different offsets

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.050 
you get to put it at different offsets
and<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.870> rotates<00:05:13.159> forwards<00:05:14.159> and<00:05:14.370> backwards<00:05:14.580> as
