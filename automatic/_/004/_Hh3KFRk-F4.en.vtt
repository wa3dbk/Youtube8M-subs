00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
the cinnamon has become the cinnamon

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.660 
the cinnamon has become the cinnamon
dough<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:36.230> just<00:04:36.470> work<00:04:36.770> with<00:04:36.800> that<00:04:37.040> tool<00:04:37.520> all

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
the cinnamon is combined and this is

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.120 
the cinnamon is combined and this is
what<00:04:40.040> I<00:04:40.070> like<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.490> actually<00:04:40.990> put<00:04:41.990> this<00:04:42.770> like<00:04:43.010> I

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
what I like to actually put this like I

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.540 
what I like to actually put this like I
said<00:04:43.160> either<00:04:43.640> in<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.480> refrigerator<00:04:45.200> or<00:04:45.550> in

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
said either in the refrigerator or in

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.150 
said either in the refrigerator or in
the<00:04:47.360> freezer<00:04:47.660> because<00:04:48.020> I<00:04:48.230> find<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.650> it's<00:04:48.950> much

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
the freezer because I find it it's much

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.670 
the freezer because I find it it's much
easier<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.760> work<00:04:50.030> with<00:04:50.210> because<00:04:51.110> it<00:04:51.260> is<00:04:51.410> a<00:04:51.440> bit

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
easier to work with because it is a bit

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.070 
easier to work with because it is a bit
of<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:51.890> soft<00:04:52.250> dough<00:04:55.120> so<00:04:56.120> it'll<00:04:56.360> look<00:04:56.480> like<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:57.050> I

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
of a soft dough so it'll look like the I

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.170 
of a soft dough so it'll look like the I
don't<00:04:57.170> get<00:04:57.620> none<00:04:57.830> again<00:04:58.100> like<00:04:58.310> I<00:04:58.340> said<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.700> chill

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
don't get none again like I said I chill

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.450 
don't get none again like I said I chill
it<00:04:59.420> I<00:05:00.910> have<00:05:01.910> some<00:05:02.390> already<00:05:03.110> made<00:05:03.470> and<00:05:03.890> chilled

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460
