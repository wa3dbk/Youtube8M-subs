the next one so we simply come in and go
on<00:01:25.760> a<00:01:25.820> diagonal<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.020> other<00:01:27.230> string

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
on a diagonal so that the other string

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.890 
on a diagonal so that the other string
is<00:01:27.860> on<00:01:28.040> behind<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.700> pull<00:01:29.450> up<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:30.470> through

is on behind and pull up and through
okay<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.380> diagonally<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:35.320> both<00:01:36.320> of<00:01:36.530> these

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
okay so in diagonally and both of these

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.820 
okay so in diagonally and both of these
strings<00:01:37.010> there'll<00:01:37.250> be<00:01:38.170> one<00:01:39.170> in<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.410> front<00:01:39.680> and

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
strings there'll be one in the front and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.080 
strings there'll be one in the front and
one<00:01:39.980> on<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.160> back<00:01:41.890> again<00:01:42.890> this<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.520> really<00:01:43.970> a

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
one on the back again this is really a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.330 
one on the back again this is really a
quick<00:01:44.480> process<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:45.380> for<00:01:45.740> your<00:01:45.920> knitting<00:01:46.190> it

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.070 
really does look like knitting which is
shocks<00:01:48.680> me<00:01:48.920> hop<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.220> desert<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.640> can<00:01:49.760> imagine

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
shocks me hop to desert you can imagine

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.590 
shocks me hop to desert you can imagine
so<00:01:51.080> simply<00:01:51.680> again<00:01:52.040> just<00:01:52.880> there's<00:01:53.060> two<00:01:53.270> strings

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
so simply again just there's two strings

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.480 
so simply again just there's two strings
we're<00:01:53.960> coming<00:01:54.290> in<00:01:54.440> just<00:01:54.830> going<00:01:55.070> onto<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.340> one

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
we're coming in just going onto the one

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.749 
we're coming in just going onto the one
side<00:01:55.730> going<00:01:56.540> through<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.870> back<00:01:58.960> okay

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.950 

so<00:02:04.759> that's<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.149> interesting<00:02:05.479> thing<00:02:05.689> about

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
so that's the interesting thing about

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.520 
so that's the interesting thing about
Tunisian<00:02:06.560> crochet<00:02:06.680> is<00:02:07.100> that<00:02:07.310> essentially<00:02:08.119> it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
Tunisian crochet is that essentially it

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.809 
Tunisian crochet is that essentially it
all<00:02:09.530> depends<00:02:09.860> where<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.069> grab<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.399> project

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
all depends where you grab the project

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.839 
all depends where you grab the project
in<00:02:10.940> order<00:02:11.180> how<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.480> looks<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:16.280> I'm<00:02:16.520> simply

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
in order how it looks so I'm simply

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.770 
in order how it looks so I'm simply
diagonal<00:02:17.540> again<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.650> really<00:02:19.599> no<00:02:20.599> big

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
diagonal again this is really no big

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.000 
diagonal again this is really no big
deal<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:22.390> then<00:02:23.390> finally<00:02:23.930> on<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.080> last<00:02:24.170> one<00:02:24.709> we

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
deal and then finally on the last one we

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.770 
deal and then finally on the last one we
come<00:02:25.220> in<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.940> like<00:02:26.060> before<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
come in to the just like before the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.640 
come in to the just like before the
chain<00:02:27.170> or<00:02:27.940> pull<00:02:28.940> through<00:02:29.209> okay<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.410> we're

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
chain or pull through okay so we're

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.970 
chain or pull through okay so we're
ready<00:02:30.680> now<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.160> knit<00:02:32.060> as<00:02:32.300> always<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.680> we're<00:02:33.830> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
ready now to knit as always so we're the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.770 
ready now to knit as always so we're the

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
first one we wrap and pull through one

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.350 
first one we wrap and pull through one
only<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.760> then<00:02:37.760> wrap<00:02:37.970> into<00:02:39.010> Robin<00:02:40.010> -<00:02:43.000> Robin<00:02:44.000> -

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
knitting that's something I need to

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.290 
knitting that's something I need to
figure<00:03:53.530> out<00:03:53.650> yet<00:03:53.920> but<00:03:54.130> that's<00:03:54.880> another

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
figure out yet but that's another

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.820 
figure out yet but that's another
tutorial<00:03:55.690> for<00:03:55.930> another<00:03:56.140> time<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:59.680> here<00:03:59.950> we<00:04:00.040> go

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
tutorial for another time so here we go

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.980 
tutorial for another time so here we go
you<00:04:02.830> see<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.070> kind<00:04:03.550> of<00:04:03.610> got<00:04:03.790> my<00:04:03.940> rhythm<00:04:04.120> I<00:04:04.390> know

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
you see I kind of got my rhythm I know

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.670 
you see I kind of got my rhythm I know
what<00:04:05.140> I'm<00:04:05.230> doing

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
what I'm doing

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.550 
what I'm doing
so<00:04:06.070> at<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.640> end<00:04:06.790> again<00:04:07.300> it's<00:04:07.810> just<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:08.230> chain

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
so at the end again it's just a chain

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.310 
so at the end again it's just a chain
make<00:04:09.310> sure<00:04:09.460> there's<00:04:09.670> two<00:04:09.910> strings<00:04:10.320> pull

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
make sure there's two strings pull

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.950 
make sure there's two strings pull
through<00:04:11.680> so<00:04:12.210> you're<00:04:13.210> now<00:04:13.390> ready<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.720> come<00:04:13.930> back

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
through so you're now ready to come back

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.000
