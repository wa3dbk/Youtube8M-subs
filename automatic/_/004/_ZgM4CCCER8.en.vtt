out
so<00:02:15.109> that<00:02:15.260> should<00:02:15.530> cook<00:02:15.859> through<00:02:16.340> nicely<00:02:16.790> I'm

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
so that should cook through nicely I'm

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.789 
so that should cook through nicely I'm
gonna<00:02:17.390> get<00:02:17.480> really<00:02:17.930> dry<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.810> final<00:02:21.319> layer

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
gonna get really dry the final layer

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.509 
gonna get really dry the final layer
within<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.549> stack<00:02:22.939> it's<00:02:23.510> some<00:02:23.719> lovely

within this stack it's some lovely
sun-dried<00:02:25.519> tomatoes<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.329> then<00:02:26.420> just<00:02:26.599> chop

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
sun-dried tomatoes and then just chop

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.679 
sun-dried tomatoes and then just chop
them<00:02:27.170> up<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:28.189> pop<00:02:28.489> them<00:02:28.640> into<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.879> separate<00:02:29.390> pan

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
them up and pop them into a separate pan

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:37.440 
them up and pop them into a separate pan
just<00:02:30.409> to<00:02:30.650> warm<00:02:30.950> them<00:02:31.250> through

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.870 

like<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.350> stage<00:02:38.560> one<00:02:38.890> we've<00:02:39.190> got<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.490> shallots

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
like to stage one we've got the shallots

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.940 
like to stage one we've got the shallots
and<00:02:40.090> they're<00:02:40.240> cooked<00:02:40.510> nicely<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.530> I'm<00:02:41.770> gonna

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
and they're cooked nicely so I'm gonna

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.890 
and they're cooked nicely so I'm gonna
add<00:02:42.160> some<00:02:42.700> flour<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:45.400> thicken<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.940> sauce<00:02:46.180> so

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
add some flour to thicken the sauce so

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.680 
add some flour to thicken the sauce so
give<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.230> good<00:02:47.380> stir<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.430> cook<00:02:49.150> each<00:02:49.300> ounce<00:02:49.510> a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
give it a good stir to cook each ounce a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.720 
give it a good stir to cook each ounce a
little<00:02:49.960> bit<00:02:50.110> but<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.830> again<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.310> similar

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
little bit but this is again the similar

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.460 
little bit but this is again the similar
principle<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.450> making<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.840> roux<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:53.260> need<00:02:53.380> to

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
principle to making a roux you need to

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.160 
principle to making a roux you need to
add<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.770> flour<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.190> with<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.700> fats<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.870> allow

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
add the flour in with the fats and allow

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.120 
add the flour in with the fats and allow
it<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.440> cook<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:58.780> will<00:02:59.020> whistle<00:02:59.560> thicken

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
it to cook and this will whistle thicken

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.540 
it to cook and this will whistle thicken
our<00:03:00.220> sauce<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:03.100> that<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:03.459> can<00:03:03.610> add<00:03:03.760> our<00:03:04.240> cream

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
our sauce so that we can add our cream

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.730 
our sauce so that we can add our cream
now<00:03:06.550> this<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.850> double<00:03:07.570> cream<00:03:07.900> but<00:03:08.320> if<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.530> are

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
now this is double cream but if you are

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.340 
now this is double cream but if you are
watching<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.160> calories<00:03:09.780> then<00:03:10.780> use<00:03:11.050> some

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
watching the calories then use some

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.949 
watching the calories then use some
suitable<00:03:12.130> cream<00:03:12.580> but<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.240> still<00:03:13.570> will<00:03:13.780> have<00:03:13.810> a

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
suitable cream but it still will have a

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.420 
suitable cream but it still will have a
few<00:03:14.170> own<00:03:14.290> but<00:03:14.440> it's<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.590> Christmas<00:03:15.010> treat<00:03:15.280> this

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
few own but it's a Christmas treat this

few own but it's a Christmas treat this
one<00:03:15.640> this<00:03:15.820> is<00:03:15.940> not<00:03:16.300> an<00:03:16.450> everyday<00:03:16.720> dish<00:03:17.050> it

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.550 
really is a lovely luxurious treat so
that<00:03:21.280> should<00:03:21.489> thicken<00:03:21.900> nicely<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.320> little

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
that should thicken nicely and a little

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.510 
that should thicken nicely and a little
bit<00:03:23.680> more<00:03:23.860> cream<00:03:24.220> color<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.970> should<00:03:25.330> do<00:03:26.520> and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
lot more miles but if you do use a mild

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.880 
lot more miles but if you do use a mild
cheese<00:03:43.330> instead<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:43.840> this<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:44.350> won't<00:03:44.590> have

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
cheese instead of this it won't have

it so in goes the cheese and allow that
to<00:03:51.459> melt<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:52.890> should<00:03:53.890> just<00:03:53.980> take<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.790> few<00:03:55.360> minutes

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
to melt I should just take a few minutes

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.250 
to melt I should just take a few minutes
or<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:58.269> while<00:03:58.450> that's<00:03:58.570> cooking<00:03:58.840> I'm<00:03:59.080> just
