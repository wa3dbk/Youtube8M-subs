00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:14.449
 His technique knowledge can be implemented in the Content Inspection Quarterback 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.369
 square 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.919
 four of them improved the vertices of a square of about 20 meters 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.310
 Side length they throw each other the balls 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.949
 Inside the staked space play the fever in black and a 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.839
 defender 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.699
 Civelek Ortes is the test winner with an exact pass to play 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.700
 the defender 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.600
 tries to prevent that 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.660
 as long as the defense that Piech has his to 7 under control 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.250
 Eating the quarterbacks toss the ball back and forth 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.830
 but as soon as the receiver has shaken off its guard the must 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.840
 Quarterback into possession quickly 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.950
 skillfully staged by his teammates 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.550
 The receiver will soon receive six points for each prisoner 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.550
 Defender for every intercepted passport 3 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.850
 the receiver has to be in motion all over the world just so it stays 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.040
 Part of the game 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.310
 he has to offer himself 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.750
 he can only do that if he shakes off his defender again and again 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.930
 also had to recognize in the beginning where the ball thrown next 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.620
 becomes 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.450
 the defender needs quick legs as well as quick eyes because he has to 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.259
 always know where his opponent 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.259
 and the wandering ball is located 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.650
 on a 40 by 40 meter field are on two sides like a 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.320
 Staked gate area 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.420
 each is a player of the participating teams 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.329
 the others are moving in the 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.220
 and the playing field 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.810
 the team in possession now tried hereby players within his goal 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.650
 already playing 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.080
 while the ball carrier may only make two steps before he throws 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.570
 the goalie that does not leave his zone 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.020
 the attackers try to get free to be playable 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.790
 Defenders adjust so that the goal area and as many attackers 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.759
 could not be played 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.799
 for every prisoner ball in the goal area 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.819
 the attackers get six points 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.799
 changes the right of attack 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.909
 fast passes are the safest way to cross the field 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:28.929
 you wait too long 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:30.539
 the defenders can easily 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.539
 disturb in the game structure 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.309
 Furth 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.829
 The Lagetsi nen speaks of the movement of the parcel of professionals 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.149
 but largely dispenses with body contact 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:59.739
 to get used to it, the Lagetsi took unmoved opponents to try 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.249
 that allows the full concentration on the flags 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.249
 without having to estimate the path of the ball Regers 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:07.140
 at 3 6 percent 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.869
 comes this component added 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.209
 like the Fed watched over by a bed, an end zone five meters wide 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.629
 The running back starts five meters before that 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.689
 He tries to run past the defender inside the hat without his 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.629
 To lose flags 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.049
 The pros show how to move the side of the ball 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.609
 to cut the path for him 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.510
 just like that 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.339
 Make it the stain defender 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:33.109
 Again, the view of the hip and thus the body's center of gravity helps 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.600
 indicates the safest and if you run it away 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.600
 and the flags are also in view 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.689
 a defender is ten yards from a center and his quarterback 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.329
 these are the ones with the ball and running a short car still running at the same time 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.700
 The defender goes and tries to demolish the flag in the center 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.709
 Defenders and receivers have to move here as well as in the game 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.709
 if the range of motion is no longer artificially restricted 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:14.590
 you can simplify the task of the receiver first in the defender 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.589
 Then the loser runs into the center and has already caught the ball 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.969
 depending on the skill level of the exercise participants you can choose between 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.969
 choose these two variants 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.009
 The search can be combined in various ways. The most common is the 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.289
 Staggering into the depths of the room an attacker enters a short route 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.699
 another is running deep 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.949
 so the choir wears can keep at the look 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.529
 but a defender does not cover that 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.819
 there is also the crossing of routes 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.029
 so a defender got confused and maybe even slough off 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:07.439
 especially against man coverage is this variant 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.050
 very restrictive 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.800
 Short routes are supposed to develop quickly, so slow down 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.639
 The quarterback's gaze can wander from first to second route in peace 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.449
 sometimes it increases with this way 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.839
 is rather unusual 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:27.550
 Priggen zone coverage you send like two sieves in opposite corners 

00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:30.610
 In one zone, Karas single defenders are not both attackers 

00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:33.419
 check 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.370
 and with all good combinations applies 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.699
 so combine 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:38.759
 that nothing happens
