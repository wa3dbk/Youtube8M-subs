00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.000
 after mastering smartphones and giving 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.250
 source for tablets 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.890
 the touch screens began to 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.320
 to get to notebooks is one more way 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.460
 to interact with applications 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.400
 especially if you are using 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.109
 recently released windows 8 but will it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.520
 it 's worth spending more money to 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.800
 have this feature 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.410
 the bet of microsoft in the new interface 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.449
 of windows 8 leaves no doubts 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.699
 the touch screens arrived 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.650
 to stay at the same time systems 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.820
 operating systems are becoming more 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.949
 similar to tablets larger buttons 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.650
 movement and layout cleaner 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.360
 apple also ran a test on the mech- 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.150
 the steering wheel asks you to present the programs 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.670
 installed on the computer in the same way 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.210
 that the impossible ipad does not feel like it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.830
 put your finger on the screen but for now 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.479
 just with the mouse 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.489
 but the touch screens are 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.680
 far from taking the place of the mouse 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.630
 they work as a complement 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.850
 say you meet a colleague of 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 job requesting the meeting files 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 on a pendrive select multiple icons 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.220
 on the desktop and drag arrives at 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.320
 be funny 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.990
 if the computer is only animating a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.280
 party you do not have to bow to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.050
 use the touchpad 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.540
 if you are running a movie a 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.510
 audience is easy to rotate forward or 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.520
 back to take advantage of the screens 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.980
 to touch on notebooks is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.350
 necessary to download the right programs 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.340
 there are several options adapted to the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.100
 resource 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.350
 starting with the games the virtual store of 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.080
 microsoft offers several titles that 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.480
 Exclude the use of keyboard and mouse 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.440
 My favorite is a re-reading of the field 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.700
 new game options 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.560
 calculators and drawing programs will 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.180
 especially if you are already 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.200
 accustomed to the versions for 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.720
 smartphones 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.820
 Day by day the applications also 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.860
 benefit from the functionality but 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 operation at your fingertips may 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.600
 Disappointing when dealing with - for 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.720
 example the clickable areas are small 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.099
 and sometimes the finger misses the target to work 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.879
 in a spreadsheet or edit a document 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.550
 just with your fingers it would be a nightmare too 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.910
 it is possible to call a virtual keyboard but 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.459
 in a notebook makes no sense 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.870
 if you're going to type a better text do it 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.330
 old fashioned 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.459
 the touch screen is not yet a 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.770
 facilitator for all tasks 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.209
 it will become popular as 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.430
 program to adapt to this new 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.400
 interface for now is not worth it 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.720
 pay more for the resource 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.720
 especially if you already have a tablet
