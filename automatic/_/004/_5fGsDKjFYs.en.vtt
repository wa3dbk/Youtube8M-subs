offices<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.729> I<00:05:17.789> guess<00:05:18.030> they<00:05:18.210> do<00:05:18.270> things

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
offices and and I guess they do things

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.320 
offices and and I guess they do things
for<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:18.870> reason<00:05:19.080> but<00:05:19.970> you<00:05:20.970> know<00:05:21.090> that's<00:05:21.270> just

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
for a reason but you know that's just

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.920 
for a reason but you know that's just
the<00:05:21.509> way<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.720> is<00:05:21.810> but<00:05:22.139> as<00:05:22.800> far<00:05:22.860> as<00:05:23.159> the<00:05:23.280> league

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
the way it is but as far as the league

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.990 
the way it is but as far as the league
actually<00:05:25.220> doing<00:05:26.220> something<00:05:26.430> i'm<00:05:26.639> not<00:05:26.789> sure

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
actually doing something i'm not sure

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.420 
actually doing something i'm not sure
what<00:05:27.599> can<00:05:27.720> be<00:05:27.840> done<00:05:27.990> but<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.440> know<00:05:28.710> one<00:05:29.039> thing<00:05:29.070> is

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
what can be done but I know one thing is

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.659 
what can be done but I know one thing is
that<00:05:29.810> you<00:05:30.810> know<00:05:30.960> everybody<00:05:31.830> in<00:05:32.009> Canada<00:05:32.460> really

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
that you know everybody in Canada really

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.490
