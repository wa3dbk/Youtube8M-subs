00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.120
 four years later the neptune-like bustle after a trip of 12 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.370
 years 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.370
 but its signals took four hours to reach the earth 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.910
 this is the image of the f1 that had been obtained by the best telescopes 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.769
 terrestrial 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.249
 here you can see the first close and unfocused images taken by the 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.249
 voyager 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.530
 Neptune is almost twin of Uranus 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250
 but much easier to observe 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.660
 a gaseous sphere with a small solid core 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 its magnetic field has an inclination of 47 degrees with respect to 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040
 axis of rotation 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040
 the planet completes a rotation in 16 hours 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.610
 compared to the land Neptune is a giant 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.610
 but that scissor mind smaller than uranium 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.850
 the white spots solution 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.850
 clouds that are at high altitude 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.380
 nettuno's internal heat generates more energy than the planet receives 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.720
 of the sun 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.410
 from it derives a very variable meteorology and great hurricanes like the 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.410
 called command eye 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.719
 and over the eye of the magician 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.610
 the great dark spot 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 a big hurricane like the earth 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.920
 a shot of the stain 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.170
 the camera keeps it in the center 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.459
 actually the spot revolves around the planet with a period of 18 hours 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.410
 is pushed to the west by strong winds 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.410
 that blow at two thousand 200 kilometers per hour 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.910
 before the voyager's exploration it was considered that Neptune only had 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.899
 they partial 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.470
 practically arcs 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.700
 actually Neptune has a complete ring system 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.290
 They have two main rings 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.030
 and a dimmer one inside 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.709
 we go the is formed by estrogen the iop and a little methane 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.369
 the goal does not absorb the red light and that's why the planet seems absurd
