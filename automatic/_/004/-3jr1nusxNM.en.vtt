green gray card if that makes sense so
how<00:02:45.570> do<00:02:45.630> we<00:02:45.690> make<00:02:45.870> those<00:02:45.989> values<00:02:46.790> truly

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
how do we make those values truly

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.300 
how do we make those values truly
neutral<00:02:48.150> well<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.780> could<00:02:48.900> play<00:02:49.080> doing<00:02:50.010> color

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
neutral well you could play doing color

it works quite well you can come into

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.370 
it works quite well you can come into

actual middle this is my flute in black
and<00:03:43.620> half<00:03:43.769> we've<00:03:44.010> been<00:03:44.220> white<00:03:44.430> right<00:03:44.670> here<00:03:44.700> in

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
and half we've been white right here in

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.380 
and half we've been white right here in
the<00:03:45.030> middle<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.959> middle<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:47.239> push<00:03:48.239> this

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
the middle the middle of this push this

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.490 
the middle the middle of this push this
down<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.900> can<00:03:49.049> see<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:50.060> there<00:03:51.060> we<00:03:51.150> go<00:03:51.500> you

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
down so you can see it there we go you

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.740 
down so you can see it there we go you
can<00:03:52.650> see<00:03:52.859> that<00:03:52.890> our<00:03:53.790> exposure<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.329> bad<00:03:54.540> that

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
can see that our exposure is bad that

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.569 
can see that our exposure is bad that
gray<00:03:55.019> is<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.530> about<00:03:55.680> spiking<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.340> middle

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
gray is just about spiking in the middle

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.009 
gray is just about spiking in the middle
there's<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.850> couple<00:03:57.000> values<00:03:57.390> in<00:03:57.600> there<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.840> gray

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
there's a couple values in there of gray

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.380 
there's a couple values in there of gray
but<00:03:58.739> you'll<00:03:58.890> notice<00:03:59.070> it's<00:03:59.340> not<00:03:59.489> too<00:03:59.670> bad<00:03:59.850> if<00:04:00.239> we

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
but you'll notice it's not too bad if we

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.819 
but you'll notice it's not too bad if we
were<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.660> darken<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.380> down<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.530> little<00:04:01.680> bit

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
were to darken it down a little bit

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.140 
were to darken it down a little bit
that's<00:04:02.070> probably<00:04:02.310> about<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.549> mid-tone<00:04:02.910> gray

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
that's probably about the mid-tone gray

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.000 
that's probably about the mid-tone gray
we<00:04:03.299> really<00:04:03.570> want<00:04:03.810> right<00:04:03.959> there<00:04:04.140> let<00:04:04.829> me<00:04:04.859> get

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
we really want right there let me get

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.979 
we really want right there let me get
rid<00:04:05.070> of<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:06.000> I'm<00:04:06.239> gonna<00:04:06.390> get<00:04:06.600> rid<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.810> that

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
rid of that so I'm gonna get rid of that

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.650 
rid of that so I'm gonna get rid of that
selection<00:04:07.980> also<00:04:08.430> let's<00:04:09.060> call<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.329> levels

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
selection also let's call it levels

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.830 
selection also let's call it levels
command<00:04:10.260> L<00:04:10.880> inside<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:12.000> levels<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.359> see<00:04:12.450> now

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
command L inside of levels you see now

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.960 
command L inside of levels you see now
our<00:04:13.680> we<00:04:14.010> have<00:04:14.100> two<00:04:14.250> values<00:04:14.370> because<00:04:14.820> we've

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
our we have two values because we've

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.599 
our we have two values because we've
made<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.150> change<00:04:16.109> there<00:04:16.350> actually<00:04:16.709> but<00:04:17.250> earlier

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
made a change there actually but earlier

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.490 
made a change there actually but earlier
on<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:17.940> you'll<00:04:18.390> see<00:04:18.510> two<00:04:18.660> values<00:04:18.959> now<00:04:19.109> always

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
on but you'll see two values now always

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.170 
on but you'll see two values now always
look<00:04:19.650> at<00:04:19.769> this<00:04:19.919> second<00:04:20.340> right<00:04:20.519> hand<00:04:20.820> set<00:04:21.090> of

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
look at this second right hand set of

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.270 
look at this second right hand set of
numbers<00:04:21.419> now<00:04:21.570> that's<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.349> adjusted<00:04:22.950> numbers

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
numbers now that's the adjusted numbers

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.120 
numbers now that's the adjusted numbers
through<00:04:23.550> levels<00:04:24.409> now<00:04:25.409> what<00:04:25.560> we<00:04:25.620> can<00:04:25.740> do<00:04:25.830> is<00:04:26.010> we

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
through levels now what we can do is we

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.320 
through levels now what we can do is we
can<00:04:26.250> play<00:04:26.580> with<00:04:26.970> this

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
can play with this

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.179

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
gray we can grab this slider at the very

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.059 
gray we can grab this slider at the very
