floating in the tank equalize the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.020 
floating in the tank equalize the
temperature<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:52.340> we'll<00:00:53.340> come<00:00:53.520> back<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.699> show

just good practice to to just use the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.340 
just good practice to to just use the
net<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> put<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> fish<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.659> rather<00:01:22.080> than

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
net to put the fish in rather than

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620 
net to put the fish in rather than
dumping<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.220> tank<00:01:24.090> water<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.540> the
