00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi to all the cursed today we will talk 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.629
 of something very light that is 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.790
 which has been called case plays and vi 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.240
 I will explain why in my opinion it does not exist 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.219
 no case before we explain what it is 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.049
 a little boy happened a few days ago 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.480
 he made a video accusing him of youtuber 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.830
 joker cheers gameplay of cheating i 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.990
 his subscribers because his 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.150
 unpacking or better some 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.250
 players found in packages not fifa 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.050
 They were real but mounted little note 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.039
 for those who are not understanding a bat of that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.289
 what I'm saying 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.149
 there is a way to buy players 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.250
 when you play fifa online that is 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.680
 works like figurines buy a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.899
 wind package you can find some and the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.700
 stronger are also more rare and if to the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 duplicates or a player you don't need 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 you can sell it on the market will be worth auction that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.090
 youtuber is directly on the site 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.100
 mount a video where he opens some 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.020
 packets nothing happens if it doesn't find 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.360
 nothing and gets excited if he finds a player 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.969
 strong or however expensive in the market 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.410
 well then as i said joker was 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.239
 accused by this guy of having 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.980
 distorted some videos and having done 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.229
 pretend to find some packages 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.390
 famous players now we start from afar 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.580
 as I have often said the information 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.560
 concerning a topic is always good 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.689
 so I don't think that boy having that 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.150
 a doubt should not have done a 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.119
 video where he asked them for explanations but 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.100
 just to ask for explanations is different 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.080
 to be accused may happen that you follow 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.939
 youtube and in some videos no of 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.560
 something that does n't come back to you but we are 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.439
 all agree that the presumption is worth 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.180
 of doubt, therefore, some innocence 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.130
 why not make a nice video where you are 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.710
 ask youtube to clarify the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 like I noticed this this and this 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.600
 these are things that raised doubts about me 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.790
 the authenticity of the video and since you 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.270
 I follow I would like to know why and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.520
 bon 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.290
 this is a question but known that up 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.810
 internet instead of raising a doubt e 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.299
 maybe season it with various facets 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.880
 immediately start by accusing i 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.049
 journalists do not use the word 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.689
 guilty until he confirms it 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.049
 process first are just questions 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.030
 doubts 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.710
 and right on positions but we ask 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.390
 this topic and I would like to open a 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.299
 other referred exclusively to whom 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.220
 follows these guys in gameplay ma 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.679
 even if he plays or whoever he has 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.940
 rigged a video even if he didn't 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.400
 found messi and ronaldo 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.630
 but you see it because it amuses you 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.610
 or for other reasons 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.910
 what the game players do yes 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.200
 called non-documentary entertainment 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.390
 as if it were a transmission 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.310
 television as if it were a movie 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.990
 and what do you do when one who shoots in 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.360
 a film syndicated on the fact that the 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.280
 gun is fake, and now we will say 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.140
 we are not syndical about that but about the fact 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.120
 which was previously sold to us 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.520
 as true but here we enter the field 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.440
 of professional ethics and is dangerous 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.780
 for a reason because then it starts to 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.550
 relate everything to how and don't know what 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.200
 small example of the art 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.240
 and what do you do to become an artist? 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.950
 he paints his pictures with the pea 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.080
 but when you discover that it is not true but the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.970
 commonly paints with the brush i 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.250
 you don't like his paintings anymore 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.350
 for you, the how is the thing that matters 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.180
 it matters more the fact that he painted it with 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.130
 the pea that the painting itself 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.510
 practically gives more importance to the vehicle 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.430
 that to the art 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.800
 and I'm not comparing a joker video 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.360
 you never know art in my life but 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.760
 this is conceptually the reasoning 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.340
 to raga and watch videos of people with whom 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.530
 will not even go to dinner paid is so 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.170
 therefore difficult to make this distinction 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.590
 in entertainment I personally say the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.459
 ethical problem for a theoretical lie 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.620
 functional to entertainment 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.320
 I find it much less relevant than for 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.750
 say a sale of fifa credits or 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.010
 to say if we agree that big 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.320
 to mind the kids who follow the games 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.190
 plans are closer to 14 than a 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.630
 twenty years 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.820
 then I believe he would be there from 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.800
 to discuss the pedagogical level of 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.290
 who entertainers not at the level of 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.019
 bad language bad words or other but 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.180
 also only of Italian language e 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.430
 contents but we continue to talk about 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.410
 personal ethics not absolute therefore not 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.910
 come here to make me the moral can also 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.220
 yes low you see me the video more than 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.900
 once but still even if you have 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.090
 noticed that this news cannot be found 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.980
 in an absolute sense so relevant I can 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.739
 well understand that maybe someone can 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.110
 find such then as said well be 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.450
 doubt is welcome criticism if one 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.110
 inter person volume evening to do well 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.300
 are 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.430
 non-academic nothing well be a 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.560
 million questions but we distinguish i 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.630
 doubts the questions and anything that 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.789
 derives from partial knowledge of 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.770
 charges against those who asked me later 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.599
 on a personal level what you think 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.550
 I saw all the guys videos I saw them 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.110
 all and I think I can close here 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.729
 I can only say what I would have done 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.500
 I would have taken the cell 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.750
 since you really like fasti videos 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.970
 elves and I would have said this is me 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.620
 this is the game i enter this game 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.289
 it is my account these are messi ronaldo 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.389
 without screen without cuts without a cock 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.879
 but then again everyone can do a little cock 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.259
 which in any case seems to him to be citing himself 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.050
 can tell who can know 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.759
 only he or me too 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.620
 they go home against the but I don't think so 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:57.110
 just the beautiful case everyone is 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.110
 your club's pretty good
