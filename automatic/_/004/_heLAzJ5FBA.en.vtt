00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
most common grammar errors on this test

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.769 
most common grammar errors on this test
and<00:00:25.480> those<00:00:26.290> would<00:00:26.470> be<00:00:26.529> verb<00:00:27.369> errors<00:00:27.779> pronoun

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
and those would be verb errors pronoun

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.639 
and those would be verb errors pronoun

you'll notice ten is not that many I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.120 
you'll notice ten is not that many I
have<00:01:15.340> faith<00:01:15.610> in<00:01:15.640> all<00:01:16.030> of<00:01:16.180> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.040 

the<00:01:21.130> same<00:01:21.550> 10<00:01:21.940> grammar<00:01:22.330> errors<00:01:22.780> are

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
the same 10 grammar errors are

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.620 
the same 10 grammar errors are
repackaged<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.070> recycled<00:01:25.000> through<00:01:25.150> every

repackaged and recycled through every

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.400 
repackaged and recycled through every
SAT<00:01:26.940> but<00:01:27.940> using<00:01:28.570> different<00:01:28.930> words<00:01:29.110> in

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
SAT but using different words in

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.340 
SAT but using different words in
somewhat<00:01:29.830> different<00:01:29.980> formats<00:01:31.080> however<00:01:32.080> once

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
somewhat different formats however once

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.810 
somewhat different formats however once
you<00:01:32.500> really<00:01:32.800> get<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.070> hang<00:01:33.280> of<00:01:33.400> these<00:01:33.550> 10

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
you really get the hang of these 10

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.210 
you really get the hang of these 10
common<00:01:34.210> errors<00:01:34.570> you<00:01:35.110> will<00:01:35.350> dominate<00:01:35.710> the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
common errors you will dominate the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.040 
common errors you will dominate the
writing<00:01:36.550> section<00:01:36.970> like<00:01:37.180> King<00:01:37.450> Kong<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
writing section like King Kong to the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.830 
writing section like King Kong to the
Empire<00:01:38.440> State<00:01:38.470> Building<00:01:39.510> see<00:01:40.510> what<00:01:40.660> I<00:01:40.690> did

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
Empire State Building see what I did

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.220 
Empire State Building see what I did
there

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
there

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.030 
there
that<00:01:42.010> was<00:01:42.340> an<00:01:42.550> analogy<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.360> yeah<00:01:44.140> we<00:01:44.770> like

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
that was an analogy and yeah we like

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.630 
that was an analogy and yeah we like
those

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.910 

you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.610 

in<00:01:59.790> today's<00:02:00.300> lecture<00:02:00.570> we're<00:02:01.080> going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.440> head

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
in today's lecture we're going to head

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.969 
in today's lecture we're going to head
up<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> top<00:02:02.220> three<00:02:02.729> out<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.330> ten<00:02:03.570> errors

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
up the top three out of the ten errors

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.070 
up the top three out of the ten errors
these<00:02:04.979> three<00:02:05.400> are<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.670> ones<00:02:06.150> that<00:02:06.240> repeat<00:02:06.840> and

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
these three are the ones that repeat and

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.940 
these three are the ones that repeat and
recycle<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.920> reuse<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.970> very<00:02:09.300> most<00:02:09.950> practice

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
recycle and reuse the very most practice

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.130 
recycle and reuse the very most practice
these<00:02:11.100> three<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.120> will<00:02:12.270> watch<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.810> writing

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
these three and you will watch a writing

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.210 
these three and you will watch a writing
score<00:02:13.410> claim

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.060 

the<00:02:21.090> first<00:02:21.420> one<00:02:21.630> up<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.740> verb

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
the first one up to that is the verb

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.449 
the first one up to that is the verb
errors

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
errors

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.759 
errors
so<00:02:26.030> these<00:02:26.510> are<00:02:26.719> the<00:02:26.870> most<00:02:27.140> common<00:02:27.590> grammar

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
so these are the most common grammar

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:35.190 
so these are the most common grammar
errors<00:02:27.920> on<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.430> SAT

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 

if<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.950> recall<00:02:36.310> way<00:02:36.610> back<00:02:36.880> from<00:02:37.180> writing<00:02:37.360> one

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
if you recall way back from writing one

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.110 
if you recall way back from writing one
a<00:02:37.990> great<00:02:38.650> strategy<00:02:39.099> for<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.370> writing<00:02:39.670> section

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
a great strategy for the writing section

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.420 
a great strategy for the writing section
is<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.720> first<00:02:41.050> check<00:02:41.349> all<00:02:41.650> verbs<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.220> pronouns

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
is to first check all verbs and pronouns

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.970 
is to first check all verbs and pronouns
in<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:42.880> sentence<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:44.050> make<00:02:44.260> sure<00:02:44.500> they<00:02:44.680> match

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
in the sentence to make sure they match

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.790 
in the sentence to make sure they match
the<00:02:45.340> subject<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> sentence

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.090 

and<00:02:48.940> that's<00:02:49.940> because<00:02:50.390> Mervin<00:02:51.230> pronoun<00:02:51.710> errors

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
and that's because Mervin pronoun errors

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.450 
and that's because Mervin pronoun errors
are<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:52.820> common
