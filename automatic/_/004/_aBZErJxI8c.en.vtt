00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.600
 [Laboratory at 220 miles above ground] 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.800
 [International Space Station] 

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.522
 Everything about space is risky. 

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:24.857
 It is a very harsh environment. 

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.927
 Nevertheless, we have a laboratory where humans can 

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.996
 Enrich their knowledge, conduct their scientific experiments, 

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:31.864
 Learn more about space 

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.224
 And how to avoid its risks. 

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.937
 International Space Station 

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:41.541
 Now moving in space at 17500 speed 

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.242
 Miles per hour. It is surrounded by 

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.745
 In the vacuum, I was struck 

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:47.980
 Any equipment, you lose 

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.583
 Compress the air inside. 

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:53.152
 When the sun meets, its temperature rises to 160 degrees, 

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:56.088
 When the weather is cold, the temperature drops to minus 50 degrees. 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.458
 This station has given us the first opportunity to get to know 

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.195
 Long-term life in space. 

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:05.703
 Ie how you can live and work in space. 

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.235
 Scientists usually conduct more than 200 experiments 

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.870
 In the International Space Station 

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:14.540
 At what time. We have now begun 

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.142
 In drawing scientific conclusions. 

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:18.778
 We found it well worth the trouble of fatigue. 

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:21.747
 What we're doing at Boeing for the International Space Station, 

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.251
 Is to play the role of support engineers. We are working to ensure 

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.553
 Performance of the International Space Station 

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.822
 To do its best, giving the spacemen 

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.325
 The ability to stay there is healthy and not to worry about 

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.027
 Maintenance and repairs performed on different parts of the station. 

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.596
 But can use their full time to conduct their scientific experiments 

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:40.333
 The idea of ​​an experiment has been initiated 

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.301
 To the minds of NASA officials and wanted to embody them 

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.303
 At the International Space Station, 

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.305
 Boeing will be assigned the confirmation function 

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.609
 From being safely completed at the space station 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.477
 And the possibility of their use by spacemen. 

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:54.080
 We are trying our best to simplify those processes 

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:57.517
 In order to expedite the transfer of experiments to the space station. 

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:00.152
 One experiment showed that viruses 

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.088
 Interact differently in space. When they go out 

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:03.689
 From the field of earth gravity, become 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.124
 Much more dangerous. 

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.793
 This is what scientists are given on the ground 

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.096
 Ability to identify ways to make those viruses 

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.064
 Less serious because the gene marker 

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.600
 himself. So that they could then develop vaccines. 

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.669
 They are now interested in vaccines that can be used as an antidote 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.871
 For example, Salmonella bacteria, which infected 

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:22.575
 Hundreds and thousands of people around the world. 

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:26.579
 They are also interested in the gold-resistant metastasis of methicillin, the meat-eating bacteria virus, 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.347
 If any, are effective 

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.483
 To cure these problems from the results that 

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.218
 I got it at the International Space Station, 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.487
 It would be a benefit to all. 

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:36.255
 No laboratory has ever been established 

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:37.790
 Such as the International Space Station. 

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.659
 I am really proud to be 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.461
 A member of the team that created this ability 

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.764
 Which is unique in the history of mankind. 

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:46.332
 We have taken the best of bright minds 

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.301
 We made something I think it was 

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:50.124
 Will actually help humanity.
