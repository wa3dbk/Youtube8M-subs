00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.470
 Hello 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.050
 I'll tell you now 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.050
 how to shoot correctly 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.769
 So 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.879
 in past lessons of puglia lion like too 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.529
 run correctly 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.409
 pralno seeking that is speed 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:22.239
 I'll give the gate 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.209
 how to combine it all 

00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:26.390
 together 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.300
 m to start we need to learn 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.449
 n 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.060
 shoot at the pillars 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.860
 Yes, the club from the analysis of the place but still 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.490
 will have him 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.610
 do that is study a little bit 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.630
 so 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.220
 this is the beginning 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.250
 and here's how the goat runs the cancer project 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.130
 in short 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.739
 This is the beginning 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.750
 but what will happen after according 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 eg 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.520
 patent 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.030
 and so that he would 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.060
 going from here 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
 here's knocking down the pillars in this way 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.300
 in general, in theory 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.300
 need to play let's say shooting 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.560
 we need to allow sweets 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.800
 body quote percentage 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.030
 here he is 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.810
 so nab anna flee let's go to the left 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.530
 side over here 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.670
 we need so with a sight print from 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.670
 him a little bit but a little bit 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.860
 Well, I have literally Jesse Meter 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.650
 the more pink the percentage is further needed 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.820
 shift sight 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.410
 here for example if you 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.920
 something like a peak 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.780
 we don't know there 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.550
 even 54 you can see that he 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.770
 and weak 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.930
 even if h 4 that is already 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.930
 we need to shift me literally a centimeter 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.010
 maybe even smaller 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.720
 if both players are peeling 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.250
 download need to sate the meter by two 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.770
 far away 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.480
 there we can achieve the desired results 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.589
 but here 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.589
 he drag you need to run very much and 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.899
 very confusing very confusing 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:21.859
 let's say year 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.859
 charge jump at all 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.089
 is impossible 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:27.249
 oh I can't help but leapfrog 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.489
 canola so and so 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.150
