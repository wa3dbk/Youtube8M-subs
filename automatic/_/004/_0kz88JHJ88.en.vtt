00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.920
 this was given to me by the president of 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.790
 Honduras 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.349
 milledge and I tell you micheletti please 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.420
 ask the question quickly because I have 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.310
 reports during of official cards 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.480
 what do you think about the media but 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.610
 the media are useless 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.810
 neither the means nor the realities nor the 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.550
 struggles I think that only with the means of 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.440
 communication you believe that I am 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.320
 being of rebellion follow the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.579
 rebellion or call us to rebellion that 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.769
 It does not concern me because I have not been 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.570
 given the number to call the made 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.859
 that you go through all the channels 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.409
 I'm going to thank something journalist 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.510
 of a question seems and I can not go 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.780
 by all channels and had to go by 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.789
 a single channel the fast channel 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.100
 official and think about putting fines not 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.260
 only fines but malts because the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.909
 people have many sales officials and 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.179
 the cable channels will have to pass 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.400
 good chain this type of chains or not 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.630
 it happens in a chain that's not my problem the 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.720
 problem would be if a race happens 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.170
 but how is it but 18 carat 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.850
 officials eliminate the good opinion 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.130
 I do not know whether to eliminate opinion if they put 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.070
 the opinion if seek the opinion to me what 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.590
 What interests me is your opinion is true 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.970
 camera will be the 240 stations I insist on 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.550
 that has to stop when I do my 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.160
 question and only exaggerated you to 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.110
 say that we are going to close 240 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.890
 stations but if they are going to close how many 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.410
 are 239 do not you think there are too many 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.390
 official media gentlemen of a fault 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.010
 of respect as what official means if 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.020
 this gentleman had a report out a 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.229
 official medium but we are 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.390
 official full official for 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.729
 please go to the point let's get down to business 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.890
 but I'm going to the point I promise you that 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.180
 I'll get to the point until tomorrow morning 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.180
 tomorrow until tomorrow 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:04.210
 the official who did not win it the 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:08.140
 'duck' approach of the body but 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:13.050
 now it's a very useful now down but 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.050
 the other
