10.1 inch quad-core a 31 tablet and at

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.999 
10.1 inch quad-core a 31 tablet and at
the<00:00:26.580> top<00:00:26.789> here<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.140> know<00:00:31.199> novo<00:00:31.769> 9

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the top here we have the I know novo 9

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.190 
the top here we have the I know novo 9
spark<00:00:32.870> also<00:00:33.870> known<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> firewire<00:00:35.360> okay<00:00:36.360> so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
spark also known as the firewire okay so

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.220 
spark also known as the firewire okay so
i<00:00:37.879> was<00:00:38.879> able<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.210> run<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.719> antutu<00:00:40.530> benchmark

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
i was able to run the antutu benchmark

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:52.189 
i was able to run the antutu benchmark
and<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.469> results<00:00:48.140> ok<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.180> fry<00:00:51.660> touch

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and we have results ok so the fry touch

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:03.500 
and we have results ok so the fry touch
10<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:54.020> 1280<00:00:55.020> 68<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.840> 12<00:00:58.289> 8<00:00:58.590> 68<00:00:59.010> and<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:02.510> spark

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
10 is 1280 68 so 12 8 68 and the spark

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:13.890 
10 is 1280 68 so 12 8 68 and the spark
is<00:01:04.489> 94<00:01:05.489> 2<00:01:05.519> 9

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.670 

check<00:01:14.470> out<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.740> chart

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.420 

so<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.490> fighters<00:01:22.820> sin<00:01:23.090> does<00:01:23.270> have<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:27.430> better

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
so the fighters sin does have a better

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:40.030 
so the fighters sin does have a better
benchmark

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.880 

we<00:01:41.040> also<00:01:41.190> did<00:01:43.970> benchmark<00:01:44.970> another<00:01:45.659> benchmark

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.109 

it's<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.220> nenem<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.870> naina<00:01:52.110> mark<00:01:53.119> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it's the nenem then the naina mark and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.870 
it's the nenem then the naina mark and
it's<00:01:55.080> here<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.650> one<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.160> I<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.580> on<00:01:56.700> this

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
it's here on this one and I see on this

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.820 
it's here on this one and I see on this
one<00:01:57.240> spark<00:02:02.000> well<00:02:03.000> there<00:02:03.150> it<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.410> okay<00:02:04.410> so<00:02:04.470> for

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
one spark well there it is okay so for

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.960 
one spark well there it is okay so for
the<00:02:04.890> dynamic<00:02:05.040> let's<00:02:05.430> check<00:02:05.580> out<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.700> score

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
the dynamic let's check out the score

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:21.800 
the dynamic let's check out the score
the<00:02:06.090> Nano<00:02:06.270> mark<00:02:06.540> two

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:38.259 

ok<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:25.620> another<00:02:25.800> mark<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:26.430> got<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:32.569> 58.8<00:02:36.920> for<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
ok so another mark we got a 58.8 for the

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:55.070 
ok so another mark we got a 58.8 for the
five<00:02:39.269> touch<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.540> 10<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:50.239> for<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:54.030> was<00:02:54.239> no

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
five touch to 10 and for the that was no

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:06.809 
five touch to 10 and for the that was no
benign<00:02:55.380> spark<00:02:55.739> it's<00:02:56.000> 23.3<00:03:03.380> ok

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.479 

so<00:03:07.659> the<00:03:08.049> fight<00:03:08.379> attend<00:03:08.709> all<00:03:08.829> so<00:03:08.980> has<00:03:09.159> a<00:03:09.189> higher

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
so the fight attend all so has a higher

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:19.050 
so the fight attend all so has a higher
nano<00:03:10.090> mark<00:03:10.359> to<00:03:10.629> score<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.530> again<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:18.189> fighters

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
nano mark to score so again the fighters

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:29.000 
nano mark to score so again the fighters
ten<00:03:19.209> is<00:03:19.359> 58.8<00:03:20.109> and<00:03:22.319> no<00:03:23.319> one<00:03:23.469> else<00:03:23.590> Parviz<00:03:24.120> 23.3

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.509 

and<00:03:31.319> people<00:03:32.319> want<00:03:32.469> to<00:03:32.590> see<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.799> gps<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:35.519> gps

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
and people want to see the gps the gps

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.409 
and people want to see the gps the gps
is<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.819> same<00:03:37.060> on<00:03:37.239> both<00:03:37.269> units<00:03:38.189> it's<00:03:39.189> a<00:03:39.459> google

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
is the same on both units it's a google

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:45.449 
is the same on both units it's a google
navigation<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:42.750> i<00:03:44.219> thought<00:03:45.219> that<00:03:45.370> i<00:03:45.430> had

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
navigation and i thought that i had

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.470 
navigation and i thought that i had
shown<00:03:45.849> this<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.949> in<00:03:47.949> part<00:03:48.730> two<00:03:48.939> of<00:03:48.969> both<00:03:49.299> these

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
shown this in in part two of both these

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.209 
shown this in in part two of both these
reviews<00:03:49.959> but<00:03:51.239> we<00:03:52.239> have<00:03:52.359> the<00:03:52.510> westin<00:03:53.019> hotel<00:03:53.980> in

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:54.219 
reviews but we have the westin hotel in

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:59.929

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.550 

so<00:04:00.939> we're<00:04:01.090> getting<00:04:01.540> driving<00:04:01.989> information

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
so we're getting driving information

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.360 
so we're getting driving information
right<00:04:02.709> now<00:04:02.739> director<00:04:03.609> ins<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:09.209> flytouch<00:04:10.209> 10

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
right now director ins so flytouch 10

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.089 
right now director ins so flytouch 10
there<00:04:12.370> are<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.579> results<00:04:13.739> follow<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.919> route

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
there are the results follow the route

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.939 
there are the results follow the route
so<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:15.430> gives<00:04:15.549> you<00:04:18.209> sexy<00:04:19.209> searching<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:19.780> GPS<00:04:20.199> so

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
so it gives you sexy searching a GPS so

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:27.830 
so it gives you sexy searching a GPS so
yeah<00:04:21.159> it's<00:04:21.549> it<00:04:22.530> see<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.650> blue<00:04:23.800> button<00:04:24.009> there

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840

so this is where we're going and then if

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.860 
so this is where we're going and then if
we<00:04:30.490> were<00:04:30.669> driving<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.150> would<00:04:31.360> tell<00:04:31.570> us<00:04:31.690> how<00:04:31.840> to
