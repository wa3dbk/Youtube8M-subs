00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.240
 but I'm a fan and we're not here in a 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.219
 special chapter or good this is a 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.110
 special video only because I was 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.209
 thinking about the drawing contest 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.430
 who did little and the truth is that I did not 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.140
 I would like this to go halfway 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.900
 I would like very much to finish it over all 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.029
 because she asked me for help to choose 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.949
 the finalist curiously already had 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.199
 chosen four finalists and I had to 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.119
 choose the winner and I was watching the 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.660
 finalists folder and we have 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.130
 decided is talking with hair scary that 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.250
 we have to finish this we have 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.930
 that we can not leave this halfway and 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.680
 that the baby would have wanted to deliver 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.110
 those awards 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 I know that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.450
 she was very very very dear to do 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 this contest so then together airs 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.400
 dear we have decided to determine it she 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.710
 will give us the prizes and for the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.030
 support that has given will give the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.770
 awards to all the finalists were 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.900
 four finalists we did not simply 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.460

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.280
 very happy all guys appreciate these 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.400
 moments and then nothing does not surrender 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.400

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.650
 bolivar is a drawing that I know well that 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.510

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.800

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.930

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.980
 his drawings are very good 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 because it's a traditional technique if you 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.440
