00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
connect it to a power outlet but it's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.960 
connect it to a power outlet but it's
pretty<00:02:57.530> lightly<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.489> hell<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.849> lot

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.390 
pretty lightly and it's a hell of a lot
easier<00:02:59.000> than<00:02:59.870> bringing<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.470> monitor<00:03:00.890> like<00:03:01.130> that

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
easier than bringing a monitor like that

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.190 
easier than bringing a monitor like that
with<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.880> if<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.540> don't<00:03:02.630> want<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:02.930> do<00:03:03.049> that

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
then all you have to do is throw an HDMI

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.080 
then all you have to do is throw an HDMI
cable<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:06.080> your<00:03:06.290> Mac<00:03:06.410> Pro<00:03:06.739> bag<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.370> then<00:03:07.849> you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
cable in your Mac Pro bag and then you

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.759 
cable in your Mac Pro bag and then you
can<00:03:08.209> connect<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.599> pretty<00:03:08.780> much<00:03:08.870> any<00:03:09.140> TV<00:03:09.560> let's
