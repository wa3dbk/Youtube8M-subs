a<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.329> good<00:00:33.510> product<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:35.730> cuts

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
a really good product but it cuts

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.060 
a really good product but it cuts
through<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> grease<00:00:36.750> very<00:00:37.350> fast<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.920> you're

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
through the grease very fast so you're

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.130 
through the grease very fast so you're
not<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:39.149> much<00:00:39.390> slip<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
not going to get as much slip on the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.549 
not going to get as much slip on the
glass<00:00:40.410> there's<00:00:41.129> maybe<00:00:41.460> something<00:00:41.910> else<00:00:42.559> also

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
glass there's maybe something else also

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.549 
glass there's maybe something else also
the<00:00:44.190> downside<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.149> particular<00:00:45.690> product

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the downside of this particular product

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.299 
the downside of this particular product
is<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.120> very<00:00:48.180> very<00:00:48.840> frothy

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
is that it can get very very frothy

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.529 
is that it can get very very frothy
although<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.449> bit

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
although you can just use a little bit

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.639 
although you can just use a little bit
less<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:52.140> course<00:00:52.520> in<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.789> water<00:00:54.350> but<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> can

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
less of course in your water but it can

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
less of course in your water but it can
get<00:00:55.770> very<00:00:55.829> cranky<00:00:56.489> seem<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.180> leave<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> lot<00:00:57.750> of

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
will happen is that it will tend to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.449 
will happen is that it will tend to
leave<00:02:34.819> a<00:02:34.849> lot<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.379> directions<00:02:36.379> marks<00:02:37.190> on<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
glass etc but again if you're the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.670 
glass etc but again if you're the
beginning<00:02:39.829> it<00:02:40.220> won't<00:02:40.459> matter<00:02:40.640> too<00:02:40.880> much<00:02:41.680> but

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
beginning it won't matter too much but

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.770 
beginning it won't matter too much but
that<00:02:42.860> could<00:02:43.069> be<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.220> good<00:02:43.370> idea<00:02:43.569> I'm<00:02:44.569> going<00:02:44.720> to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
that could be a good idea I'm going to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.479 
that could be a good idea I'm going to
do<00:02:44.870> another<00:02:45.049> video<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:46.069> really

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
do another video on that so really

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.830 
do another video on that so really
