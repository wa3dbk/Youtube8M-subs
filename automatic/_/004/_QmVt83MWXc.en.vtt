00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.870
 so hello to all so we find ourselves 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.800
 for the second part of the joystick 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.660
 gold so here that's it I'm riding them and where 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.900
 so 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:19.800
 so I'm going to you this is so 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.449
 went like these have flat so there he 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.609
 there are a lot of fingerprints because 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.300
 it is if you chrome and as I could you 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.769
 say it in the previous video 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.560
 I have two things to tell you 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.489
 this hull 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.129
 so how to say 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.500
 so that's a copy rejection was 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.219
 not done by official stalin was 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.020
 not done by microsoft and suddenly I 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.320
 had a lot of problems at the level of 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.690
 parts assembly 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.820
 that is to say that the pad 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.520
 directional 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:02.789
 there was a bad contact at the level 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:08.640
 triggers lb and rb at the level of 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:11.630
 switches so the lb market hurts so 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.610
 I had to make some modifications thinking 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.850
 we had a little switch on one side 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.689
 and put everything back in layers 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.180
 plastic 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.299
 So I had to go down welding 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.909
 plastic so it took me pretty much 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.369
 two and a half hours to go up 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:34.229
 only this planet so that's 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:37.439
 really very very very hot I you 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.049
 do not buy it except if 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.000
 you know you really well I 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.630
 do not recommend buying this kind of 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.180
 hull on the internet because really 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.240
 it's really not easy to climb 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.649
 personally I do not know if I'm going 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.909
 do it again for customers because 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:01.080
 it's really not easy so here we go 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.990
 so I had it go too 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:10.259
 so here I go yes so I'm going to you 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:12.120
 say for cash there is how to say 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.620
 I put rechargeable batteries so at 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.920
 rechargeable start that are also 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.120
 fat than normal batteries it's them 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 have the same characteristics 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.750
 then they got stuck in 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.770
 because the diameter inside 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.420
 was not the same so it was not 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.470
 not very so it's pretty annoying 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.230
 to remove a fact so that's it 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.690
 preferred to take another battery cover 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.230
 so this manna is there is a 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.540
 this is one of my controllers has expressed 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.160
 if the gamer 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.540
 I bought a little while ago that it's 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.380
 rapid fire is here that a 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.110
 I preferred to do the demo 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.070
 take hiding 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.590
 just before showing you 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.570
 I will do a demonstration or 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:11.310
 rather a comparison between the two 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:12.450
 joysticks that is to say look at it so 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.120
 that in red 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.110
 good that it changes nothing at all 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.030
 because I took a red led kit 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.989
 so there you can see the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.640
 separation between the four led then 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.850
 that I showed you on the joystick 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.850
 gaulle 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.980
 there we really do not play the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.420
 light signals are really not 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.460
 separated and it's not at all the same 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.180
 made it still pretty good 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:55.660
 but it's not because awesome what 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:58.540
 here but if for the price it's 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.610
 not bad what huh must be between kim 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.060
 has about 20 euros for for a 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.540
 shell like that it's dirty and reasonable 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.180
 for what it is after I was expecting 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.970
 really better but good 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.100
 so here it was really so you 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.500
 will not do a demo on the console 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.680
 because it is she has exactly the 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.500
 same characteristics as a normal m 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.440
 that I see I do not see the interest so 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.370
 so here it was to show the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.919
 assembled joystick then see what she 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.260
 gave and then that's what 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.900
 personally I find it gives a 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.970
 pretty good a pretty good rendering without talking 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.350
 of the technical context it is well 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.900
 after that for sure I saw do some 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.300
 changes at the parts level so 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:56.080
 here I put you the cash for that 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:05:02.500
 gives you a made a good record so 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.240
 so here after so before the front of 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:10.080
 bring it to my client 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:13.510
 I will clean it with a dry cloth 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.390
 which will allow the painting to 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.830
 not leave because to know if you 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.830
 have this kind of joystick the crazy 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:24.030
 annette clean it quite regularly 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:30.070
 because his airlock very quickly 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:32.980
 so here's after it's a choice to make 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:37.240
 so here to clean if that you 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.910
 interest you must never hold the 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.160
 joystick and then take the rag from 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.570
 two ends so it's a little rag 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.060
 take it diagonally or it's a big 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.650
 cloth take it like me not me ya 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.510
 not so big but that's enough for 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:55.510
 get to the middle of the controller 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:06:07.570
 so here is so to clean it 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:09.100
 must make little rounds playa already 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.280
 better rendering 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.210
 as you can see so here we put 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.650
 to listen I think I'll end up on 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:22.300
 the top and then so that's what 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.140
 really to tell you it's not 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.150
 a joystick 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.280
 Finally a gamepad shell to buy 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.320
 for for oneself and to go up alone 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.490
 except if you are talented that you 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.530
 know someone who can help you 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.370
 yes but otherwise it's really not 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.110
 all practical to ride so here we go 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.050
 listen I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.270
 I have well present and that and that 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.190
 maybe I answered your 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.810
 questions you ask before buying this 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:51.550
