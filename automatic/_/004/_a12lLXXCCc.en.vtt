we had a couple of drinks and then we

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450 
we had a couple of drinks and then we

used these breathalyzers to test them
out<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:12.000> accurate<00:01:12.210> they<00:01:12.689> were<00:01:12.750> now

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
out to see how accurate they were now

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.600 
out to see how accurate they were now
one<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> things<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.130> should<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.430> noted

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
one of the things that should be noted

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
one of the things that should be noted
is<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.060> between<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.990> drink<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> time

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
is that between the drink and the time

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.170 
is that between the drink and the time
in<00:01:17.130> which<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> blow<00:01:17.670> into<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> breathalyzer

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
in which you blow into the breathalyzer

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.870 
in which you blow into the breathalyzer
you<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.500> wait<00:01:19.680> about<00:01:19.890> 15<00:01:20.430> or<00:01:20.549> 20<00:01:20.580> minutes

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you have to wait about 15 or 20 minutes

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.969 
you have to wait about 15 or 20 minutes
otherwise<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.659> will<00:01:21.780> throw<00:01:22.020> off<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.439> results

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
otherwise it will throw off the results

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.190 
otherwise it will throw off the results
so<00:01:23.460> obviously<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.420> purposes<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
so obviously for the purposes of this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.670 
so obviously for the purposes of this
review<00:01:25.820> we're<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:26.939> able<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.439> show<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.650> of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that timeframe but between every time

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.840 
that timeframe but between every time
that<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.560> drank<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.159> every<00:01:32.340> time<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.549> we

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that we drank and every time that we

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.630 
that we drank and every time that we
used<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.600> breathalyzers<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.829> waited<00:01:35.280> twenty

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
used the breathalyzers we waited twenty

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.859 
used the breathalyzers we waited twenty
minutes<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.180> you're<00:01:36.390> gonna<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
minutes so you're gonna see that

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
minutes so you're gonna see that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
three ounces or three drinks and amber

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.220 
three ounces or three drinks and amber
started<00:02:38.400> with<00:02:38.579> one<00:02:38.819> ounce<00:02:39.000> or<00:02:39.299> wandering<00:02:39.989> I

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
started with one ounce or wandering I

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.289 
started with one ounce or wandering I
tried<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.769> breath<00:02:40.950> o<00:02:41.069> meter<00:02:41.250> breeze<00:02:41.669> first

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
tried the breath o meter breeze first

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.030 
tried the breath o meter breeze first
and<00:02:42.689> that<00:02:42.900> spit<00:02:43.290> back<00:02:43.439> what<00:02:43.680> appeared<00:02:43.919> to<00:02:43.980> be

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
and that spit back what appeared to be

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.459 
and that spit back what appeared to be
accurate<00:02:44.519> numbers<00:02:44.819> point<00:02:45.060> zero<00:02:45.389> two<00:02:45.540> for

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
accurate numbers point zero two for

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.770 
accurate numbers point zero two for
three<00:02:46.650> drinks<00:02:47.129> I<00:02:47.310> then<00:02:47.790> tried<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.329> plug-in

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
three drinks I then tried the plug-in

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.240 
three drinks I then tried the plug-in
version<00:02:49.079> of<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.290> breath<00:02:49.500> o<00:02:49.680> meter<00:02:49.889> and<00:02:50.159> that

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
version of the breath o meter and that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.129 
version of the breath o meter and that
also<00:02:50.430> seems<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.209> fairly<00:02:51.419> accurate<00:02:51.540> point

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
also seems to be fairly accurate point

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.409 
also seems to be fairly accurate point
zero<00:02:52.379> three<00:02:52.859> for<00:02:53.400> three<00:02:53.609> drinks<00:02:53.969> and<00:02:54.120> then

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
zero three for three drinks and then

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.240 
zero three for three drinks and then
lastly<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.019> backtrack<00:02:55.500> mobile<00:02:55.889> which<00:02:56.010> ended

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
lastly the backtrack mobile which ended

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.550 
lastly the backtrack mobile which ended
up<00:02:56.310> being<00:02:56.370> seemingly<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.329> most<00:02:57.540> accurate<00:02:57.930> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
up being seemingly the most accurate and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.129 
up being seemingly the most accurate and
it<00:02:58.949> spit<00:02:59.219> back<00:02:59.400> point<00:02:59.609> zero<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.150> two<00:03:00.599> for<00:03:00.989> three

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
it spit back point zero to two for three

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.319 
it spit back point zero to two for three
drinks<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.159> was<00:03:02.280> Amber's<00:03:02.699> turn<00:03:03.000> and

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
drinks and then it was Amber's turn and

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.420 
drinks and then it was Amber's turn and
she<00:03:04.199> tried<00:03:04.439> the<00:03:04.469> breath<00:03:04.799> o<00:03:04.949> meter<00:03:05.129> breeze

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
she tried the breath o meter breeze

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.270 
she tried the breath o meter breeze
first<00:03:06.000> as<00:03:06.299> well<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.810> her<00:03:07.439> results<00:03:07.769> came<00:03:08.219> back

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
first as well and her results came back

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.369 
first as well and her results came back
zero<00:03:08.879> so<00:03:09.299> there<00:03:09.510> was<00:03:09.629> obviously<00:03:09.959> some<00:03:10.199> sort<00:03:10.290> of

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
zero so there was obviously some sort of

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.069 
zero so there was obviously some sort of
problem<00:03:10.829> going<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.189> there<00:03:11.489> point<00:03:12.389> zero<00:03:12.689> one

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
problem going on there point zero one

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.509 
problem going on there point zero one
with<00:03:13.409> one<00:03:13.620> drink<00:03:13.889> for<00:03:13.919> the<00:03:14.099> breath<00:03:14.280> or<00:03:14.400> meter

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
plug in and then point zero one three

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.759 
plug in and then point zero one three

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
for the backtrack mobile I had two more

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.099 
for the backtrack mobile I had two more
drinks<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.310> amber<00:03:20.699> had<00:03:20.879> one<00:03:21.180> more<00:03:21.389> drink<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.079> I

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
drinks and amber had one more drink so I

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.409 
drinks and amber had one more drink so I
was<00:03:22.439> up<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.680> five<00:03:22.919> drinks<00:03:23.310> getting<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.150> point

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
was up to five drinks getting a point

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.979 
was up to five drinks getting a point
zero<00:03:24.720> three<00:03:25.109> seven<00:03:25.379> with<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.799> backtrack<00:03:26.489> and

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
zero three seven with the backtrack and

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.039 
zero three seven with the backtrack and
then<00:03:27.989> getting<00:03:28.530> point<00:03:29.069> zero<00:03:29.430> two<00:03:29.810> with<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
then getting point zero two with the

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.020 
then getting point zero two with the
breath<00:03:31.439> o<00:03:31.620> meter<00:03:31.829> breeze<00:03:32.220> which<00:03:32.549> obviously

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
breath o meter breeze which obviously

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.539 
breath o meter breeze which obviously
wasn't<00:03:33.239> probably<00:03:33.810> accurate<00:03:34.439> and<00:03:34.709> then<00:03:35.250> point

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
wasn't probably accurate and then point

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.059 
wasn't probably accurate and then point
zero<00:03:35.879> three<00:03:36.209> one<00:03:36.239> with<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.199> breath<00:03:37.709> o<00:03:37.889> meter

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
zero three one with the breath o meter

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.339 
zero three one with the breath o meter
which<00:03:38.669> was<00:03:38.909> showing<00:03:39.239> fairly<00:03:39.569> consistent<00:03:40.169> and

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
which was showing fairly consistent and

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.369 
which was showing fairly consistent and
good<00:03:40.560> results<00:03:41.449> amber<00:03:42.449> at<00:03:42.599> two<00:03:42.780> drinks<00:03:43.169> was

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
good results amber at two drinks was

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.199 
good results amber at two drinks was
showing<00:03:43.739> nearly<00:03:44.159> the<00:03:44.280> same<00:03:44.519> intoxication

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
showing nearly the same intoxication

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.899 
showing nearly the same intoxication
levels<00:03:45.659> that<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:45.840> was<00:03:46.199> at<00:03:46.500> five<00:03:47.280> drinks<00:03:47.639> which

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
levels that I was at five drinks which

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.249 
levels that I was at five drinks which
makes<00:03:48.150> sense<00:03:48.359> because<00:03:48.540> obviously<00:03:48.810> she's<00:03:49.229> a

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
makes sense because obviously she's a

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:50.569 
makes sense because obviously she's a
lot<00:03:49.439> smaller<00:03:49.799> than<00:03:50.009> I<00:03:50.129> am

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
lot smaller than I am

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.999 
lot smaller than I am
so<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:51.389> time<00:03:51.659> Amber's<00:03:52.169> breath<00:03:52.590> plug<00:03:52.859> in

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
so this time Amber's breath plug in

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.499 
so this time Amber's breath plug in
breath<00:03:53.220> o<00:03:53.340> meter<00:03:53.549> should<00:03:53.790> only<00:03:54.000> point<00:03:54.209> zero

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:54.509 
breath o meter should only point zero

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.270 
breath o meter should only point zero
two<00:03:54.750> four<00:03:55.019> two<00:03:55.139> drinks<00:03:55.500> which<00:03:55.680> was<00:03:55.829> probably

two four two drinks which was probably

two four two drinks which was probably
not<00:03:56.489> accurate<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.209> then<00:03:57.659> her<00:03:58.079> breath<00:03:58.409> amido

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
not accurate and then her breath amido

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.559 
not accurate and then her breath amido
breeze<00:03:59.040> results<00:03:59.549> showed<00:03:59.699> point<00:04:00.000> zero<00:04:00.299> two

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569

eight four two drinks which was probably

eight four two drinks which was probably
