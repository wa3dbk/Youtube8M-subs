a quarter I'm going to use a hinge for
the<00:02:43.350> roof<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:43.829> way<00:02:44.069> we<00:02:44.250> could<00:02:44.340> have

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
the roof so that way we could have

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
the roof so that way we could have
access<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.269> we<00:02:45.359> need<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.600> clean<00:02:45.780> anything<00:02:46.109> out

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260
