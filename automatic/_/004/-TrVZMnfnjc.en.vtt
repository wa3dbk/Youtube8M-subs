doing the mechanic from terraria now
this<00:00:14.160> was<00:00:14.700> definitely<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.809> hardest<00:00:16.250> one<00:00:17.250> that

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this was definitely the hardest one that

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.580 
this was definitely the hardest one that
I've<00:00:17.520> ever<00:00:17.550> done<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:19.230> was<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> most

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
I've ever done it's it was the most

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.099 
I've ever done it's it was the most
challenging<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.760> figure<00:00:21.060> out<00:00:21.210> how<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.930> was

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
challenging to figure out how I was

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.050 
challenging to figure out how I was
gonna<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.619> especially<00:00:23.430> because<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
gonna do this especially because of the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.720 
gonna do this especially because of the
hair<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.830> fact<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.250> she's<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> female

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
hair and the fact that she's a female

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.140 
hair and the fact that she's a female
but<00:00:27.439> anyway<00:00:28.439> let's<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.340> get<00:00:29.490> started<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
but anyway let's just get started and I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.810 
but anyway let's just get started and I
spent<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> little<00:00:30.689> bit<00:00:30.810> more<00:00:30.900> later<00:00:31.700> so<00:00:34.820> first

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
spent a little bit more later so first

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.450 
spent a little bit more later so first
off<00:00:36.090> go<00:00:37.050> ahead<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.410> create<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.710> character<00:00:38.010> just

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
off go ahead and create a character just

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.520 
off go ahead and create a character just
like<00:00:39.000> always<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.809> was<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:42.989> hardest

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
like always and so this was the hardest

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.299 
like always and so this was the hardest
part<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.129> hair<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.960> thought<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.710> best<00:00:46.950> one

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
part the hair so I thought the best one

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.729 
part the hair so I thought the best one
on<00:00:47.640> her<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.930> looked<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> best<00:00:49.230> was

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
on her the one that looked the best was

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.439 
on her the one that looked the best was
hair<00:00:50.100> 19<00:00:50.870> now<00:00:52.730> she's<00:00:53.730> got<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.030> kind<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.360> an
