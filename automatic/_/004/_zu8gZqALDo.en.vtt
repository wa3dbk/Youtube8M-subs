00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
environment because it's a future we

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.420 
environment because it's a future we
don't<00:01:51.260> know<00:01:51.380> for<00:01:51.560> sure<00:01:51.619> how<00:01:52.040> things<00:01:52.250> will

all the six mega trends that we

relevant to to our sport we have a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.270 
relevant to to our sport we have a
particular<00:03:16.049> connection<00:03:16.349> with<00:03:16.709> youth<00:03:16.980> of

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
particular connection with youth of

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.550 
particular connection with youth of
today<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:17.940> generational<00:03:18.569> change<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.079> very

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
today so generational change is very

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.089 
today so generational change is very

relevant to us and being able to adapt

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.430 
relevant to us and being able to adapt
and<00:03:23.099> be<00:03:23.129> flexible<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:24.810> what<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.079> needs<00:03:25.260> of

and be flexible to to what the needs of

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.649 
and be flexible to to what the needs of
today's<00:03:25.889> society<00:03:26.129> is<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.790> guess<00:03:27.269> we're<00:03:27.420> right

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
today's society is I guess we're right

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:28.729 
today's society is I guess we're right
now<00:03:27.840> we're<00:03:28.049> actually<00:03:28.109> going<00:03:28.409> through<00:03:28.680> a

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
now we're actually going through a

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.240 
now we're actually going through a
process<00:03:29.519> ahead<00:03:29.909> of<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.409> 2012<00:03:31.409> Olympic<00:03:32.220> Games

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
process ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.539 
process ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games
thinking<00:03:32.849> about<00:03:33.060> our<00:03:33.590> 2016<00:03:34.590> strategic<00:03:35.280> plans

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
thinking about our 2016 strategic plans

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.110 
thinking about our 2016 strategic plans
so<00:03:35.879> I<00:03:36.120> guess<00:03:36.569> is<00:03:37.370> it'll<00:03:38.370> be<00:03:38.459> quite<00:03:38.700> important

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
so I guess is it'll be quite important

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.240 
so I guess is it'll be quite important
for<00:03:39.239> us<00:03:39.329> to<00:03:39.359> ensure<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.109> as<00:03:40.470> we<00:03:40.920> look<00:03:41.099> at

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
for us to ensure that as we look at

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.509 
for us to ensure that as we look at
these<00:03:41.400> trends<00:03:42.530> we<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.739> some<00:03:44.010> some

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
these trends we have some some

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.670 
these trends we have some some
strategies<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.239> place<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.319> deal<00:03:46.530> with

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
strategies in place to to deal with

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.699 
strategies in place to to deal with
those<00:03:46.859> not<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.480> 2016<00:03:48.480> but<00:03:48.690> but<00:03:49.290> well<00:03:49.530> be

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
those not just 2016 but but well be

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.650 
those not just 2016 but but well be
armed<00:03:50.040> it's<00:03:50.699> vital<00:03:51.180> because<00:03:51.329> i<00:03:51.419> think<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
armed it's vital because i think the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.580 
armed it's vital because i think the
australian<00:03:52.019> sports<00:03:52.079> commission<00:03:52.260> are

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
australian sports commission are

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.110 
australian sports commission are
probably<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.949> only<00:03:52.980> people<00:03:53.430> who<00:03:53.519> can<00:03:53.639> do<00:03:53.879> so

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
probably the only people who can do so

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.909 
probably the only people who can do so
and<00:03:54.359> it<00:03:54.780> touches<00:03:55.049> upon<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.620> different

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
and it touches upon the different

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.740
