bit<00:00:42.230> of<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:42.650> silver<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.370> just<00:00:44.090> draw<00:00:44.390> a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
bit of this silver and just draw a

bit of this silver and just draw a
single<00:00:45.860> sort<00:00:46.100> of<00:00:46.190> swipe<00:00:46.670> across<00:00:47.120> my<00:00:47.660> nail<00:00:47.840> and

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
single sort of swipe across my nail and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.840 
single sort of swipe across my nail and
it's<00:00:48.320> not<00:00:48.860> going<00:00:49.040> to<00:00:49.130> be<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.280> real<00:00:49.580> large<00:00:50.450> amount

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
it's not going to be a real large amount

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.220 
it's not going to be a real large amount
because<00:00:52.850> it's<00:00:53.090> just<00:00:53.300> going<00:00:53.540> to<00:00:53.600> be<00:00:53.690> just<00:00:53.990> a

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
because it's just going to be just a

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.990 
because it's just going to be just a
little<00:00:54.560> extra<00:00:56.950> interesting<00:00:57.950> contrast<00:00:58.640> for

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
little extra interesting contrast for

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.190 
little extra interesting contrast for
underneath<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.900> stamping<00:01:00.440> part<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:01.460> nail

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
underneath the stamping part of the nail

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.499 
underneath the stamping part of the nail
so<00:01:03.200> you<00:01:03.290> can<00:01:03.470> see<00:01:03.650> that<00:01:03.830> there<00:01:04.129> it's<00:01:04.970> very<00:01:05.089> very

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
so you can see that there it's very very

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.390 
so you can see that there it's very very
quick<00:01:05.869> there<00:01:06.140> doesn't<00:01:06.380> have<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.560> be<00:01:06.710> an<00:01:06.979> exact

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
quick there doesn't have to be an exact

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.270 
quick there doesn't have to be an exact
line<00:01:07.730> or<00:01:08.120> mark<00:01:08.150> in<00:01:08.660> fact<00:01:08.900> this<00:01:09.050> one<00:01:09.290> here<00:01:09.680> sort

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
line or mark in fact this one here sort

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.310 
line or mark in fact this one here sort
of<00:01:10.340> fades<00:01:10.610> here<00:01:10.910> at<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.120> end<00:01:11.300> but<00:01:11.870> that's<00:01:12.080> okay

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
of fades here at the end but that's okay

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.230 
of fades here at the end but that's okay
