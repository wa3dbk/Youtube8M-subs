00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
in their galaxy s2 cases so here we have

extended battery on the GSM model and
this<00:01:20.880> fits<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.360> fine<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.470> well

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.179 
this fits just fine on that one as well
as<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.369> regular<00:01:23.909> gsm<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.860> take<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.040> look

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
as the regular gsm so if we take a look

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.469 
as the regular gsm so if we take a look
at<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.340> back<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.240> camera

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
at the back you can see the camera

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.530 
at the back you can see the camera
cutout<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.049> perfect<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.740> contoured<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.329> see

cutout is perfect and contoured you see

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.359 
cutout is perfect and contoured you see
this<00:01:30.630> actually<00:01:30.930> has<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.140> raised<00:01:31.920> Ridge

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
this actually has a little raised Ridge

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.069 
this actually has a little raised Ridge
which<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:32.939> nice<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.720> protects

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
which is really nice because it protects

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.920 
which is really nice because it protects
it<00:01:34.259> when<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> place<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.979> screen<00:01:35.220> side<00:01:35.460> down<00:01:35.930> it

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
it when you place it screen side down it

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.109 
it when you place it screen side down it
also<00:01:37.079> has<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.680> nice<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.159> cutout<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:39.060> the

secondary microphone and one thing I

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.069 
secondary microphone and one thing I
want<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.000> actually<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.630> quality<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
nice little line that goes around it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.850 
nice little line that goes around it

just shows off the phone so once again

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.350 
just shows off the phone so once again
in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.130> back<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.939> i<00:01:59.969> said<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
in the back you can see like i said the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.499 
in the back you can see like i said the
glossy<00:02:00.869> cover<00:02:01.159> it's<00:02:02.159> not<00:02:02.310> too<00:02:02.549> bad<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.299> does

glossy cover it's not too bad it does

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.819 
glossy cover it's not too bad it does
get<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.719> little<00:02:03.899> bit<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> scratches<00:02:04.710> but

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
get a little bit of scratches but

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.530 
get a little bit of scratches but
nothing<00:02:04.890> too<00:02:05.280> major<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.090> model<00:02:06.390> right

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
nothing too major and this model right

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.300 
nothing too major and this model right
here<00:02:06.600> doesn't<00:02:07.110> get<00:02:07.200> any<00:02:07.320> fingerprints<00:02:07.799> but

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
here doesn't get any fingerprints but

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.680 
here doesn't get any fingerprints but
like<00:02:08.429> i<00:02:08.550> said<00:02:08.580> some<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.090> other<00:02:09.209> ones<00:02:09.450> will

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
like i said some of the other ones will

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.960 
like i said some of the other ones will
you<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.800> see<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.069> sgp<00:02:11.489> logo<00:02:11.730> right<00:02:11.940> there

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
you can see the sgp logo right there

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.740 
you can see the sgp logo right there
which<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.360> very<00:02:12.569> subtle<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> liked<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
which is very subtle so I liked the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.330 
which is very subtle so I liked the
done<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.170> they<00:02:14.350> do<00:02:14.410> include<00:02:14.740> their<00:02:14.950> branding

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
done that they do include their branding

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.820 
done that they do include their branding
but<00:02:15.460> it's<00:02:15.640> not<00:02:15.790> very<00:02:15.940> noticeable<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.770> my

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
but it's not very noticeable one of my

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.110 
but it's not very noticeable one of my
favorite<00:02:18.160> cutouts<00:02:18.460> actually<00:02:18.730> they<00:02:18.820> cut<00:02:19.000> out

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
favorite cutouts actually they cut out

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.180 
favorite cutouts actually they cut out
for<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.660> speakers<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.320> can<00:02:20.350> see<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:20.830> cut<00:02:21.100> up

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
for the speakers you can see it's cut up

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.190 
for the speakers you can see it's cut up
perfectly<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.240> very<00:02:22.540> rounded<00:02:23.050> and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
perfectly it's very rounded and

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.990 
perfectly it's very rounded and
contoured<00:02:23.710> so<00:02:24.250> they've<00:02:24.370> done<00:02:24.490> a<00:02:24.520> terrific<00:02:24.760> job

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
contoured so they've done a terrific job

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.390 
contoured so they've done a terrific job
on<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.890> towards<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.950> bottom<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.250> can<00:02:27.310> see

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
on that towards the bottom you can see

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.280 
on that towards the bottom you can see
the<00:02:27.580> three<00:02:27.850> separate<00:02:28.150> cutout<00:02:28.450> tonus<00:02:28.900> for<00:02:29.170> the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
the three separate cutout tonus for the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.020 
the three separate cutout tonus for the
headphone<00:02:29.650> jack<00:02:29.680> which<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.160> ample<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:30.880> you'll

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
headphone jack which is ample so you'll

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.360 
headphone jack which is ample so you'll
have<00:02:31.150> any<00:02:31.330> issues<00:02:31.690> with<00:02:31.810> any<00:02:31.959> headphones<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
have any issues with any headphones the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.830 
have any issues with any headphones the
main<00:02:33.580> microphone<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:34.180> actually<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.510> little<00:02:34.600> bit

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
main microphone is actually a little bit

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.570 
main microphone is actually a little bit
off<00:02:34.959> as<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.350> can<00:02:35.500> see<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:35.980> it's<00:02:36.100> not<00:02:36.250> centered

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
off as you can see so it's not centered

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.710 
off as you can see so it's not centered
right<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.120> doesn't<00:02:37.390> affect<00:02:37.600> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
right but it doesn't affect the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.570 
right but it doesn't affect the
performance<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.530> then<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.250> have<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> really

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
performance and then you have a really

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.270 
performance and then you have a really
nice<00:02:39.790> cut<00:02:40.060> out<00:02:40.209> for<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.840> micro<00:02:41.500> USB<00:02:41.860> charger

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
nice cut out for the micro USB charger

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.850 
nice cut out for the micro USB charger
so<00:02:42.490> no<00:02:42.670> issues<00:02:42.940> on<00:02:43.120> there<00:02:43.590> towards<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.620> front

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
so no issues on there towards the front

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.710 
so no issues on there towards the front
I<00:02:44.980> have<00:02:45.100> an<00:02:45.190> sgp<00:02:45.610> flex<00:02:45.910> screen<00:02:46.209> shield<00:02:46.480> and

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
I have an sgp flex screen shield and

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.479 
I have an sgp flex screen shield and
this<00:02:47.110> does<00:02:47.320> not<00:02:47.500> bubble<00:02:47.709> any<00:02:47.980> screen<00:02:48.280> shield

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
this does not bubble any screen shield

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.910 
this does not bubble any screen shield
you<00:02:49.420> also<00:02:49.630> have<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.810> very<00:02:50.020> slight<00:02:50.320> rim<00:02:50.650> all

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
you also have a very slight rim all

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.620 
you also have a very slight rim all
around<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.550> side<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.120> when<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.390> place<00:02:52.600> a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
around the side so when you place a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.720 
around the side so when you place a
screen<00:02:53.050> side<00:02:53.290> down<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:54.160> can<00:02:54.310> see<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.610> it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
screen side down you can see that it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.430 
screen side down you can see that it
lifts<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.209> up<00:02:55.239> off<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.720> table<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.260> don't

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
lifts it up off the table so you don't

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.870 
lifts it up off the table so you don't
have<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.650> worry<00:02:56.830> about<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.100> so<00:02:57.670> if<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.790> take

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
have to worry about that so if you take

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.010 
have to worry about that so if you take
a<00:02:57.940> look<00:02:58.060> at<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.239> case<00:02:58.360> when<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.600> side<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.870> can

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
a look at the case when the side you can

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.170 
a look at the case when the side you can
see<00:02:59.050> just<00:02:59.410> how<00:02:59.560> thin<00:02:59.800> it<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.580> TP<00:03:00.970> use<00:03:01.150> a

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.000 
see just how thin it is so that TP use a
very<00:03:01.720> thin<00:03:01.810> material<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.620> won't<00:03:02.800> add<00:03:02.980> much

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
very thin material so it won't add much

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.070 
very thin material so it won't add much
bulk<00:03:03.550> or<00:03:03.820> weight<00:03:03.880> onto<00:03:04.300> your<00:03:04.420> device<00:03:04.570> which<00:03:04.959> is

bulk or weight onto your device which is

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.320 
bulk or weight onto your device which is
always<00:03:05.260> good<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.530> see<00:03:05.860> down<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.970> sides<00:03:07.180> you

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
always good to see down the sides you

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.780 
always good to see down the sides you
can<00:03:07.450> see<00:03:07.600> these<00:03:07.780> TPU<00:03:08.410> buttons<00:03:08.830> for<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.580> power

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
can see these TPU buttons for the power

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.240 
can see these TPU buttons for the power
and<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.150> volume<00:03:10.420> they're<00:03:11.290> pretty<00:03:11.500> average<00:03:11.770> so

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
and the volume they're pretty average so

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.250 
and the volume they're pretty average so
they<00:03:12.430> do<00:03:12.489> click<00:03:13.090> but<00:03:13.540> they<00:03:13.690> are<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.870> little<00:03:14.050> bit

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
they do click but they are a little bit

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.870 
they do click but they are a little bit
mushy<00:03:14.470> but<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.190> still<00:03:15.430> get<00:03:15.550> some<00:03:15.730> nice

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
mushy but you still get some nice

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.699 
mushy but you still get some nice
responsiveness<00:03:16.450> out<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.840> them<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.140> same

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
responsiveness out of them and same

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.470 
responsiveness out of them and same
thing<00:03:17.920> goes<00:03:18.100> for<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.400> volume<00:03:18.730> up<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.030> down<00:03:19.090> so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
thing goes for the volume up and down so

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.420 
thing goes for the volume up and down so
no<00:03:20.049> major<00:03:20.230> issues<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:20.769> there<00:03:20.980> but<00:03:21.160> they're<00:03:21.280> not

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
no major issues on there but they're not

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.190 
no major issues on there but they're not
the<00:03:21.610> best<00:03:21.730> button<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.239> I've<00:03:22.360> seen<00:03:22.660> so

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
the best button that I've seen so

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.660 
the best button that I've seen so
overall<00:03:23.500> guys<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.830> definitely<00:03:24.130> recommend<00:03:24.340> this

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
overall guys I definitely recommend this

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.280 
overall guys I definitely recommend this
case<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.180> ordinary<00:03:25.390> user<00:03:25.810> who<00:03:26.019> doesn't

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
case to the ordinary user who doesn't

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.600 
case to the ordinary user who doesn't
need<00:03:26.380> much<00:03:26.590> in<00:03:26.769> terms<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:27.130> drop<00:03:27.400> protection

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
need much in terms of drop protection

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.699 
need much in terms of drop protection
like<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:28.450> said<00:03:28.630> this<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.930> pretty<00:03:29.200> thin<00:03:29.470> case

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
like I said this is a pretty thin case

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.380 
like I said this is a pretty thin case
it<00:03:30.400> offers<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.760> pretty<00:03:31.030> good<00:03:31.150> scratch

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
it offers a pretty good scratch

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.729 
it offers a pretty good scratch
protection<00:03:31.750> just<00:03:31.989> because<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.410> covers<00:03:32.530> the

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
protection just because it covers the

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.620 
protection just because it covers the
back<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.340> sides<00:03:33.580> but<00:03:34.269> if<00:03:34.390> you<00:03:34.480> were<00:03:34.600> to

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
back and the sides but if you were to

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.120 
back and the sides but if you were to
drop<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.080> you'll<00:03:35.260> probably<00:03:35.440> see<00:03:35.709> some<00:03:35.860> crack

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
drop this you'll probably see some crack

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.830 
drop this you'll probably see some crack
on<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.459> actual<00:03:36.700> glass<00:03:36.910> or<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.299> plastic

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
on the actual glass or the plastic

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.080 
on the actual glass or the plastic
because<00:03:38.080> it<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.320> pretty<00:03:38.530> same<00:03:38.769> material<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:39.519> at

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
because it is pretty same material so at

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.000 
because it is pretty same material so at
1699<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.930> definitely<00:03:41.290> can't<00:03:41.470> go<00:03:41.620> wrong<00:03:41.799> and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
1699 you definitely can't go wrong and

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.960 
1699 you definitely can't go wrong and
pairing<00:03:42.310> this<00:03:42.430> up<00:03:42.549> with<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.730> screen

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
pairing this up with the screen

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.340 
pairing this up with the screen
