00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.920
 graduated with being 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.920
 a new concept in poultry breeding 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.059
 no start-up or fattening stages 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.689
 self-adjustment of the food level to the needs of the animal 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.439
 no need to manually intervene in the pancakes 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.079
 without physical barriers for the animal 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.329
 observe the telescopic movement of the trap 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.120
 As the conveyor raise its height the hopper gradually restricts 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.120
 the amount of feed 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.740
 between the need for abundant food of the chick in its early days and the 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.370
 adequate level in the rest of the breeding there is a progressive reduction of 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.500
 the amount 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.360
 available with two plates of different depths according to the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.500
 driving preferences 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.530
 forever 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.690
 with a filling and distribution a food report 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.750
 guaranteeing easy access 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.750
 the gradual system reduces the handling work 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.070
 adjusting the level of feed depending on the type of food and animal a single 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 time 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.450
 this recording corresponds to a complete aging of 47 days after 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.570
 shoulder and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.800
 the system receives the chicks with the hoppers fully supported on the ground 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.020
 what supposes abundance of food 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 easy location and access to the feed 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.370
 the most critical moment is the start the quick identification of the food 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.390
 and the drink is the vital to guarantee the best growth curve 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.990
 gradually and as the chicken grows we will act on the lathe 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.990
 and we will start adjusting the level of feed 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.350
 as the coj we have cable the hopper is restricting the level of feed 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.999
 the feed adjustment is a very soft 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.859
 gradual 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.859
 at the same rate as the growth of birds 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.749
 in other systems now there would be a traumatic change 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.839
 they go from the abundance of feed to the restriction of it 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.619
 in the gradual system the change is imperceptible 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.219
 from this moment the feed level will be the same for the rest of 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.169
 the upbringing 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.459
 fresh and frequent food among newbies 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.040
 The control hopper with double safety stop guarantees the reliability of 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.040
 the whole system 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.069
 in front of the rush of the animals the cd hoppers guaranteeing the absence 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.799
 of injuries in the carcass 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.970
 thanks to its low center of gravity 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.970
 the hopper quickly recovers its verticality 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:08.409
 Haro anti-waste reduces the possibility of animals throwing 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.669
 I think 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.789
 Allows simultaneous access of two birds love gate opening 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:31.789
 a simple turn 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:36.469
 allows the opening of the hoppers to carry out a deep cleaning 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.289
 finish the breeding 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:42.149
 The system is a sturdy one and is made of resistant materials 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.139
 has a full range of heifer feeder systems and has 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.019
 automated is in general 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.739
 fruit of 25 years of experience together with the dispute
