 3fm 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.770
 as our cell coordinator in the studio 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.760
 then it is either extremely good news or 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.590
 it is completely wrong 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.180
 but in this case it is good news 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.820
 because we want it with good afternoon sauce 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.400
 hi good afternoon you go 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.109

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.900
 first of all the most important thing 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.720
 we do it all this year 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.779
 well then go this year to focus on 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.390
 fighting the year childish stupid 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.800
 actually unnecessary child mortality 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.020
 consequences of diarrhea 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.930
 it does n't sound good but that is 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.410
 It also doesn't die yearly unnecessarily 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.290
 around 800,000 children even more 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.060
