able to give people a little gift for
Christmas<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.170> didn't<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:04.710> realize

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
Christmas and I didn't really realize

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.410 
Christmas and I didn't really realize
why<00:02:05.310> people<00:02:05.579> would<00:02:05.670> want<00:02:05.700> makeup<00:02:06.090> for

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
why people would want makeup for

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.580 
why people would want makeup for
Christmas<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:06.960> then<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.229> thought<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.560> know

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
Christmas but then I thought you know

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.010 
Christmas but then I thought you know
what<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.009> didn't<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.310> my<00:02:08.520> 50%<00:02:09.209> off<00:02:09.660> my<00:02:09.840> own

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
what if I didn't get my 50% off my own

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.930 
what if I didn't get my 50% off my own
makeup<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.590> would<00:02:10.739> probably<00:02:10.950> love<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.640> get<00:02:11.760> make

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.290 
makeup I would probably love to get make
it<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.209> Christmas<00:02:12.569> because<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:12.930> one<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.170> the
