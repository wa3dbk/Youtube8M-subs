00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello friend such are you are lettuces and today 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.540
 I bring you a new way for micra 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.700
 this time we bring the chest of the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.960
 experience and what this gives us 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.820
 very good gives us two kinds of 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.390
 of chests to keep our 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.980
 experience and it's worth we have them here one 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.289
 of gold and another is of valley 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.430
 the character are very simple they are worth 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:37.060
 does obsidian is worth a pyramid two 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.450
 ideas and half two gold and a chest worth 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.980
 loses dieter ending is done with 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 obsidian a chest of n 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.180
 and two diamond 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.730
 and now let's see the difference between 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.580
 one and between one and another let's run 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.920
 the two chests 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.050
 and it's very very simple it 's very useful to 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.440
 use vale for example this what 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.440
 we put here 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.659
 and we have our councilors and the other 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.170
 both here we will not leave it in the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.170
 Inventory 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.540
 as we can see if we click click with 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.380
 the right button on top of the mod over 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.340
 of 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.439
 of the chest opens us this is worth that 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.030
 we can this is the experience we're going 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.829
 to leave me for example I have 34 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.740
 experience and I'll leave the 50 by 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.230
 hundred percent we put that in 50 per 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.350
 hundred 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.280
 and we give it to keep it after we 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.870
 will remove half and already according to the grades 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.080
 we have that will take us more or less 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.980
 ok then it 's very simple and for 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.750
 withdraw we give 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.980
 It has 50 42 and a bar 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.980
 and everything is removed 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:03.820
 if we withdraw two dollars then 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:07.780
 let's see if we put it here we put 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.110
 100 50% worth putting 50 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.650
 hundred we give you to conserve is worth and 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.110
 we have the 25 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.939
 and now how does it work like this works 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.220
 which is normal that is simpler than 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.790
 character and all the subjects and then 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.519
 we have the one of linden vale is of the ende 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.510
 it's also the same, we say 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.350
 50 percent is worth we give to 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.050
 keep 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.640
 they put us 17 we are left 17 they speak 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.890
 so 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.290
 the one from where the let's say does the function 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.800
 with a cost of between normal only what 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.370
 it happens that it is only for the experience 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.760
 we go here we put that 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.890
 and here we keep here and here we put 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.930
 the rest of the questions that we have left 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.050
 and it tells us that we have 17 in another chest 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.420
 it's worth keeping everything 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.420
 if we go to the other chest 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.290
 jumping jumping and if we give here 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.170
 we will see that we have 25 percent if 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.150
 we give you to withdraw 100 and we remove 95 and 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.370
 already in the other chest we do not have it 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.660
 as if it were a chest to sell normal 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.750
 but only for the experience 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.070
 if we give him we see that we do not have the bullet 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.470
 that we have removed it in the other thing 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.840
 then this I already tell you that it works 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.120
 as if it were a normal ender chest and 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.520
 current you have seen that it is 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.400
 quite pretty useful for the series 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.250
 our to do in our bad series 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.560
 What do you do? 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.120
 It's good to not be losing losing 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.520
 the experience continuously every time 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.020
 that kill us malbec bonarda guys this 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.150
