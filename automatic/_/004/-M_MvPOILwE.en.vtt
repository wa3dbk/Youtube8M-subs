00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 today we are planning to film that you see in your life in that section a camera that my 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.990
 head did not exist 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.739
 is a camera that was small that will allow us to say 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:11.790
 very very fast because it's a movie that was made with a limited budget 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.669
 but at the same time 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.609
 that had an optimal image quality in all that there are options but 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:17.390
 here 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.410
 large bed that is going to end or shortly after when and at the same time as the camera 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.410
 it's very cumbersome because they cite me in addition to the dunedin camera 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.060
 nobody seemed to have arrived on Saturday that there had to be some 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.399
 some trick that something had to fail in that process because it was three 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.370
 days in a professional photo camera recording was going to have a 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.529
 quality nin if you look like that 5 millimeter martyr in us 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.450
 we shoot the whole movie connect with this camera a totally style 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.490
 would like to program is the people filming guerrilla but get a 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.840
 very result 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.780
 elegant swine in the debate a museographic result a result that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.630
 it did not look like a big movie digital Venice cinema a movie filmed the 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.740
 cinema and in this case in digital cinema producing in organized society 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.850
 that the camera works like a professional photo camera then 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.830
 a form of the first half of the photo camera one has the speed 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.470
 of the diaphragm hand some vultures order the camera as they want 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.910
 besides this he has great esteem and four blocks in the next session 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.660
 the ftse 100 British the guardian says Canadian lowe's that he has the cinema and the 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.659
 eighth seeded 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.170
 it's downright amazing with a budget remove reduced then 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.170
 percent because the camera that a revolution of a revolution because 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.540
 now there are no more excuses 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.170
 to pass the round
