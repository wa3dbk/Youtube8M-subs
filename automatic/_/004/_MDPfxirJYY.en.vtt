of the facade of the building and we
have<00:00:38.059> all<00:00:38.269> this<00:00:38.420> busy<00:00:38.840> stuff<00:00:39.109> down<00:00:39.350> here<00:00:39.620> but

have all this busy stuff down here but
you<00:00:39.859> can<00:00:39.980> see<00:00:40.129> how<00:00:40.309> it's<00:00:40.519> real<00:00:40.820> dark<00:00:41.269> compared

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109

you can see how it's real dark compared
to<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.350> rest<00:00:42.559> of<00:00:42.769> the<00:00:42.859> shot<00:00:43.070> which<00:00:43.280> is

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
to the rest of the shot which is

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.330 
to the rest of the shot which is
brighter<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:44.320> naturally<00:00:45.320> our<00:00:45.530> eyes<00:00:45.769> are<00:00:46.129> want

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
brighter and naturally our eyes are want

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.729 
brighter and naturally our eyes are want
to<00:00:46.460> look<00:00:46.609> at<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.879> brighter<00:00:47.210> areas<00:00:47.510> so<00:00:48.500> that's

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
to look at the brighter areas so that's

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.450 
to look at the brighter areas so that's
a<00:00:48.890> way<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.129> minimize<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.359> distractions<00:00:50.690> and

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
a way you minimize the distractions and

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.459 
a way you minimize the distractions and
maximize<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:53.120> place<00:00:53.719> where<00:00:53.960> you<00:00:54.050> want<00:00:54.260> the

dark<00:01:21.830> over<00:01:22.100> here<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:22.790> i'm<00:01:23.120> wondering<00:01:23.390> if<00:01:23.690> you

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
dark over here but i'm wondering if you

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.090 
dark over here but i'm wondering if you
could<00:01:23.960> work<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.350> scene<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:24.830> see<00:01:24.950> if<00:01:25.040> you

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
could work this scene and see if you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.720 
could work this scene and see if you
could<00:01:25.220> get<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.400> more<00:01:26.030> compelling<00:01:26.360> shot<00:01:27.610> this<00:01:28.610> is

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
could get a more compelling shot this is

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.070 
could get a more compelling shot this is
a<00:01:28.790> great<00:01:29.030> shot<00:01:29.240> this<00:01:29.480> looks<00:01:29.720> like<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:29.990> was

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
a great shot this looks like it was

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.170 
a great shot this looks like it was
tonemapped<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:31.130> that<00:01:31.280> means<00:01:31.490> like<00:01:31.760> it's<00:01:32.060> an

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
tonemapped and that means like it's an

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.650 
tonemapped and that means like it's an
HDR<00:01:32.570> image<00:01:33.050> so<00:01:33.470> it's<00:01:33.860> really<00:01:34.070> nice<00:01:34.370> I<00:01:34.880> like<00:01:35.510> the

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
HDR image so it's really nice I like the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.050 
HDR image so it's really nice I like the
colors<00:01:36.050> very<00:01:36.500> warm<00:01:36.920> we<00:01:37.520> have<00:01:37.640> some<00:01:37.790> cooler

contrasting<00:01:41.060> colors<00:01:41.420> very<00:01:42.230> well<00:01:42.560> done<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:43.010> mean

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190

no wind at all there's barely a ripple

no wind at all there's barely a ripple
on<00:01:56.300> this<00:01:56.450> water<00:01:56.720> it's<00:01:57.320> really<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.710> nice<00:01:57.950> nice

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
on this water it's really a nice nice

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.000 
on this water it's really a nice nice
shot<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.450> only<00:01:59.660> thing<00:01:59.900> i<00:02:00.050> could<00:02:00.110> suggest<00:02:00.620> i

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
shot the only thing i could suggest i

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.620 
shot the only thing i could suggest i
like<00:02:01.220> heaven<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.760> Sun<00:02:02.000> right<00:02:02.240> in<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.390> middle

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
like heaven the Sun right in the middle

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.080 
like heaven the Sun right in the middle
and<00:02:02.900> this<00:02:03.290> shot<00:02:03.560> because<00:02:04.040> it's<00:02:04.340> balancing<00:02:04.940> the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
and this shot because it's balancing the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.640 
and this shot because it's balancing the
shot<00:02:05.330> with<00:02:05.570> some<00:02:05.750> boats<00:02:05.960> over<00:02:06.290> here<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.590> a

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
shot with some boats over here and a

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.759 
shot with some boats over here and a
boat<00:02:06.830> over<00:02:06.980> here<00:02:07.370> but<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:08.569> stuff<00:02:09.319> over<00:02:09.739> here

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
boat over here but this stuff over here

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.860 
boat over here but this stuff over here
I'm<00:02:10.759> wondering<00:02:11.209> if<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.390> could<00:02:11.599> try<00:02:11.810> to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
I'm wondering if you could try to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.930 
I'm wondering if you could try to
recompose<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.590> shot<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.310> still<00:02:13.610> keep<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
recompose the shot and still keep the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.580 
recompose the shot and still keep the
Sun<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.390> middle<00:02:14.660> but<00:02:14.810> try<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.080> minimize

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
Sun in the middle but try to minimize

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.170 
Sun in the middle but try to minimize
this<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.950> little<00:02:16.250> more

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
this a little more

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.470 
this a little more
because<00:02:18.180> it's<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.440> does<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:20.250> not<00:02:20.490> bad<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.239> mean

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
because it's it does it's not bad I mean

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.120 
because it's it does it's not bad I mean
it<00:02:21.599> kind<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.900> adds<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.260> little<00:02:22.380> scale<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.099> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
it kind of adds a little scale to the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.729 
it kind of adds a little scale to the
shot<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.700> little<00:02:23.880> bit<00:02:24.090> more<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.569> but<00:02:25.530> i'm

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
shot a little bit more and but i'm

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.650 
shot a little bit more and but i'm
wondering<00:02:25.890> if<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.760> i'd<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.239> see<00:02:27.510> it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
wondering if you just i'd like to see it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.160 
wondering if you just i'd like to see it
like<00:02:28.590> with<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.730> part<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.330> not<00:02:30.630> this

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
like with just this part and not this

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.530 
like with just this part and not this
part<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.709> see<00:02:32.370> what<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.640> looks<00:02:32.819> like<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
part and see what it looks like so that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.990 
part and see what it looks like so that
comes<00:02:33.750> down<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.140> work<00:02:34.319> in<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.590> scene<00:02:35.000> maybe

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
comes down to work in the scene maybe

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.850 
comes down to work in the scene maybe
it'll<00:02:36.209> work<00:02:36.420> maybe<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.989> won't<00:02:37.170> maybe<00:02:37.560> it'll<00:02:37.800> be

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
it'll work maybe it won't maybe it'll be

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.979 
it'll work maybe it won't maybe it'll be
better<00:02:37.980> maybe<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.790> won't<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.330> gotta<00:02:39.510> give

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
better maybe it won't so you gotta give

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.210 
better maybe it won't so you gotta give
a<00:02:40.020> shot<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.590> try<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:42.500> some<00:02:43.500> very<00:02:43.769> small<00:02:43.980> shot

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
a shot and try it some very small shot

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.890 
a shot and try it some very small shot
it's<00:02:44.370> hard<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.670> see<00:02:44.819> but<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.180> very<00:02:45.360> cool<00:02:45.720> what

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
it's hard to see but it's very cool what

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.720 
it's hard to see but it's very cool what
we<00:02:46.019> did<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.650> same<00:02:46.890> thing<00:02:46.920> as<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.550> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
we did here is the same thing as in the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.059 
we did here is the same thing as in the
flatiron<00:02:48.269> building<00:02:48.360> Claude<00:02:49.260> did<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.950> could

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
flatiron building Claude did you could

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.040 
flatiron building Claude did you could
see<00:02:50.250> he<00:02:50.489> wants<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:50.910> look<00:02:51.030> here<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.569> at<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
sky and that's the bride area so the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.870 
sky and that's the bride area so the
church<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.840> sky<00:02:55.110> or<00:02:55.140> light<00:02:55.880> everything

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
church in the sky or light everything

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.199 
church in the sky or light everything
else<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.180> pretty<00:02:57.390> dark<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:58.739> are<00:02:59.280> eyes<00:02:59.489> don't

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209

drift<00:03:00.900> over<00:03:01.110> here<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.799> look<00:03:02.400> at<00:03:02.549> something

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
drift over here and look at something

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.940 
drift over here and look at something
maybe<00:03:03.420> perhaps<00:03:03.840> ugly<00:03:04.319> over<00:03:04.530> here<00:03:04.680> because<00:03:04.769> we

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
maybe perhaps ugly over here because we

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.680 
maybe perhaps ugly over here because we
can't<00:03:05.160> really<00:03:05.370> see<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.610> but<00:03:05.819> we<00:03:06.390> have<00:03:06.540> this

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
can't really see it but we have this

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.559 
can't really see it but we have this
path<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.650> helps<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.580> leading<00:03:08.910> line<00:03:09.180> helps

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
path that helps is a leading line helps

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.809 
path that helps is a leading line helps
lead<00:03:09.720> your<00:03:09.930> throat<00:03:10.200> through<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.830> pitcher<00:03:11.010> to

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
lead your throat through the pitcher to

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.300 
lead your throat through the pitcher to
the<00:03:11.900> brighter<00:03:12.900> church<00:03:13.350> in<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.680> brighter<00:03:13.920> sky

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
the brighter church in the brighter sky

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.930 
the brighter church in the brighter sky
and<00:03:14.580> it's<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.000> really<00:03:15.269> nice<00:03:15.480> shot<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.760> nice

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940

shot too I like it the this you know
light<00:03:21.930> looks<00:03:22.650> like<00:03:22.769> it's<00:03:22.950> coming<00:03:23.250> from<00:03:23.280> over

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.920 
light looks like it's coming from over
here<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.940> everything's<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.600> little<00:03:24.720> bit

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
here and everything's a little bit

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.500 
here and everything's a little bit
backlit<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.100> it's<00:03:26.370> kind<00:03:26.609> of<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.820> tough<00:03:27.060> exposure

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
backlit so it's kind of a tough exposure

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.610 
backlit so it's kind of a tough exposure
to<00:03:27.780> do<00:03:27.959> we<00:03:28.380> do<00:03:28.560> have<00:03:28.769> this<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.840> tree<00:03:31.320> or

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.729 
work the scene and eliminate this
because<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.640> just<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:40.260> know<00:03:40.380> many

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
because that you just you know many

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.680 
because that you just you know many
times<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.160> say<00:03:41.370> we<00:03:41.549> need<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> foreground<00:03:42.239> element

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
times I say we need a foreground element

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.960 
times I say we need a foreground element
a<00:03:42.780> shot<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.769> foreground<00:03:44.130> element<00:03:44.579> has<00:03:44.790> to

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
a shot but the foreground element has to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.880 
a shot but the foreground element has to
add<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> shot<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.989> can't<00:03:46.200> distract<00:03:46.650> from

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
add to the shot it can't distract from

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.880 
add to the shot it can't distract from
the<00:03:47.070> shot<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.840> case<00:03:49.079> this<00:03:49.320> isn't<00:03:49.739> you

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
the shot so this case this isn't you

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.830 
the shot so this case this isn't you
know<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:50.010> beautiful<00:03:50.310> bush<00:03:51.000> or<00:03:51.329> anything<00:03:51.690> that

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
know a beautiful bush or anything that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.720 
know a beautiful bush or anything that
like<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:52.530> at<00:03:52.680> least<00:03:52.799> not<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.250> time<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.700> year

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
like that at least not this time of year

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.240 
like that at least not this time of year
so<00:03:54.390> we<00:03:54.570> want<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.810> eliminate<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.650> or<00:03:55.829> minimize

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
so we want to eliminate that or minimize

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.620 
so we want to eliminate that or minimize
it<00:03:56.519> so<00:03:56.730> I'm<00:03:56.820> wondering<00:03:56.940> if<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.269> could<00:03:57.450> work

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
it so I'm wondering if you could work

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.250 
it so I'm wondering if you could work
the<00:03:57.840> scene<00:03:58.109> and<00:03:58.350> get<00:03:58.829> rid<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.100> this<00:03:59.310> bush<00:04:00.260> it's

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
the scene and get rid of this bush it's

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.809 
the scene and get rid of this bush it's
a<00:04:01.319> really<00:04:01.530> nice<00:04:01.709> portrait<00:04:02.130> very<00:04:02.430> well<00:04:02.609> done

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
a really nice portrait very well done

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.009 
a really nice portrait very well done
now<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.090> looks<00:04:03.180> like<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.480> was<00:04:03.540> one<00:04:03.780> light

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
now it looks like it was one light

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.140 
now it looks like it was one light
coming<00:04:04.470> from<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.799> direction<00:04:04.859> now<00:04:05.790> many

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
coming from this direction now many

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.789 
coming from this direction now many
times<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.600> mentioned<00:04:07.019> in<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.230> critiques<00:04:07.590> if

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
times I mentioned in the critiques if

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.890 
times I mentioned in the critiques if
you're<00:04:07.980> photographing<00:04:08.400> men<00:04:09.090> one<00:04:09.510> light<00:04:09.750> is

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
you're photographing men one light is

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.870 
you're photographing men one light is
good<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.290> get<00:04:10.470> these<00:04:10.590> shadows<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:11.609> shows

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
good you get these shadows and it shows

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.449 
good you get these shadows and it shows
like<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:12.870> know<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.560> wrinkles<00:04:13.980> on<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.190> man's

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
like you know the wrinkles on a man's

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.909 
like you know the wrinkles on a man's
skin<00:04:14.819> typically<00:04:15.780> for<00:04:15.900> women<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.500> don't<00:04:16.620> want

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
skin typically for women you don't want

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.740 
skin typically for women you don't want
that<00:04:17.130> now<00:04:17.190> she's<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:17.669> young<00:04:18.000> lady<00:04:18.180> she<00:04:18.450> doesn't

that now she's a young lady she doesn't

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.969 
that now she's a young lady she doesn't
really<00:04:18.840> have<00:04:18.959> wrinkles<00:04:19.470> she's<00:04:19.650> got<00:04:19.799> nice

really have wrinkles she's got nice

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.500 
really have wrinkles she's got nice
dimples<00:04:20.250> though<00:04:20.639> so<00:04:20.850> you're<00:04:20.970> showing<00:04:21.239> off<00:04:21.389> her

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
dimples though so you're showing off her

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.880 
dimples though so you're showing off her
dimples<00:04:21.900> but<00:04:22.650> we<00:04:23.039> do<00:04:23.160> have<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.430> weird<00:04:23.789> shadow

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
dimples but we do have this weird shadow

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.780 
dimples but we do have this weird shadow
coming<00:04:25.890> over<00:04:26.190> in<00:04:26.310> here<00:04:26.669> it's<00:04:27.570> very<00:04:27.930> odd

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
coming over in here it's very odd

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.450 
coming over in here it's very odd
um<00:04:29.150> kind<00:04:29.600> of<00:04:29.690> like<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.840> triple<00:04:30.380> shadow<00:04:30.740> as<00:04:31.190> you

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
um kind of like a triple shadow as you

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.490 
um kind of like a triple shadow as you
can<00:04:31.580> see<00:04:31.760> very<00:04:32.060> dark<00:04:32.390> right<00:04:33.080> under<00:04:33.350> her

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
can see very dark right under her

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.840 
can see very dark right under her
nostril<00:04:34.010> then<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.220> gets<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.430> little<00:04:34.580> lighter

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
nostril then it gets a little lighter

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.480 
nostril then it gets a little lighter
than<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.150> little<00:04:35.450> lighter<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:36.190> her<00:04:37.190> eye<00:04:37.400> socket

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
than a little lighter and her eye socket

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.600 
than a little lighter and her eye socket
down<00:04:38.210> here<00:04:38.480> is<00:04:38.570> real<00:04:38.780> dark<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:39.770> what<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.370> would

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
down here is real dark so what I would

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.550 
down here is real dark so what I would
suggest<00:04:40.760> on<00:04:41.240> this<00:04:41.480> shot<00:04:41.690> is<00:04:41.930> if<00:04:42.140> you<00:04:42.290> had<00:04:42.620> a

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
suggest on this shot is if you had a

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.960 
suggest on this shot is if you had a
reflector<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:46.280> put<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.490> over<00:04:46.670> here<00:04:46.880> it

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
reflector and you put it over here it

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.550 
reflector and you put it over here it
doesn't<00:04:47.120> have<00:04:47.330> to<00:04:47.450> be<00:04:47.480> a<00:04:47.600> huge<00:04:47.900> reflector<00:04:48.440> you

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
doesn't have to be a huge reflector you

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.340 
doesn't have to be a huge reflector you
know<00:04:48.650> 36<00:04:49.040> inch<00:04:49.490> round<00:04:50.090> reflector<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:50.900> just

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
know 36 inch round reflector and just

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.380 
know 36 inch round reflector and just
reflected<00:04:51.920> some<00:04:52.130> of<00:04:52.220> this<00:04:52.310> light<00:04:52.640> back<00:04:53.030> into

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
reflected some of this light back into

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.570 
reflected some of this light back into
the<00:04:53.690> her<00:04:53.840> face<00:04:54.140> over<00:04:54.500> here<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:55.160> would<00:04:55.340> still

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
the her face over here you would still

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.020 
the her face over here you would still
have<00:04:55.820> this<00:04:56.090> side<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:57.500> same<00:04:57.770> exposure<00:04:58.310> in<00:04:58.760> his

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
have this side the same exposure in his

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.240 
have this side the same exposure in his
bright<00:04:59.360> but<00:04:59.900> this<00:05:00.080> would<00:05:00.350> just<00:05:00.500> be<00:05:00.620> luke

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
bright but this would just be luke

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.310 
bright but this would just be luke
softening<00:05:02.060> up<00:05:02.180> these<00:05:02.330> shadows<00:05:02.810> a<00:05:02.840> little<00:05:03.200> bit

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
softening up these shadows a little bit

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.990 
softening up these shadows a little bit
and<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.830> think<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.190> would<00:05:04.310> really<00:05:04.550> help<00:05:04.760> the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
and I think it would really help the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.150 
and I think it would really help the
shot<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:05.750> also<00:05:05.930> would<00:05:06.350> help<00:05:06.590> separate<00:05:07.040> her

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
shot it also would help separate her

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.800 
shot it also would help separate her
hair<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.460> little<00:05:07.670> bit<00:05:07.790> on<00:05:08.000> this<00:05:08.240> side<00:05:08.510> from<00:05:08.780> the

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
hair a little bit on this side from the

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.010 
hair a little bit on this side from the
background<00:05:09.380> which<00:05:09.980> I<00:05:10.190> think<00:05:10.400> would<00:05:10.520> help<00:05:10.670> too

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
background which I think would help too

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.450 
background which I think would help too
because<00:05:12.020> she's<00:05:12.200> wearing<00:05:12.500> dark<00:05:12.860> blouse<00:05:13.160> and

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
because she's wearing dark blouse and

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.300 
because she's wearing dark blouse and
she<00:05:13.550> has<00:05:13.670> dark<00:05:13.850> hair<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.450> do<00:05:14.930> like<00:05:15.320> this<00:05:15.680> effect

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
she has dark hair I do like this effect

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.180 
she has dark hair I do like this effect
here<00:05:16.700> these<00:05:17.630> may<00:05:18.380> be<00:05:18.410> Christmas<00:05:18.980> lights

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
here these may be Christmas lights

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.130 
here these may be Christmas lights
hanging<00:05:19.460> back<00:05:19.790> here<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.270> they're<00:05:20.990> probably

just<00:05:21.470> tiny<00:05:21.890> little<00:05:22.220> lights<00:05:22.550> but<00:05:23.180> when<00:05:23.360> you're

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
just tiny little lights but when you're

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.470 
just tiny little lights but when you're
focusing<00:05:24.200> close<00:05:24.530> in<00:05:24.950> those<00:05:25.910> drop<00:05:26.270> out<00:05:26.450> of

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
focusing close in those drop out of

aperture<00:05:30.980> to<00:05:31.610> they'll<00:05:31.910> just<00:05:32.240> become<00:05:32.660> round

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
aperture to they'll just become round

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.340 
aperture to they'll just become round
you<00:05:34.550> know<00:05:34.670> kind<00:05:34.970> of<00:05:35.120> blurs<00:05:35.480> and<00:05:35.510> it's<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.170> real

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
you know kind of blurs and it's a real

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.080 
you know kind of blurs and it's a real
nice<00:05:36.500> effect<00:05:36.950> and<00:05:37.220> it's<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:37.700> really<00:05:37.880> nice

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
nice effect and it's a really nice

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.740 
nice effect and it's a really nice
portrait<00:05:38.570> I<00:05:39.730> like<00:05:40.730> the<00:05:40.880> shot<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.150> lot<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.570> this

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
portrait I like the shot a lot to this

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.420 
portrait I like the shot a lot to this
another<00:05:42.080> one<00:05:42.290> though<00:05:42.530> we<00:05:42.740> got<00:05:42.890> this<00:05:43.100> kind<00:05:43.370> of

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
another one though we got this kind of

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.710 
another one though we got this kind of
bleeding<00:05:43.640> in<00:05:43.880> I<00:05:44.030> don't<00:05:44.210> think<00:05:44.420> this<00:05:44.660> is

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
bleeding in I don't think this is

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.890 
bleeding in I don't think this is
anywhere<00:05:45.380> near<00:05:45.440> is<00:05:46.360> obnoxious<00:05:47.360> as<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:47.720> one

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
anywhere near is obnoxious as the one

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.430 
anywhere near is obnoxious as the one
earlier<00:05:48.880> but<00:05:49.880> again<00:05:50.630> if<00:05:50.780> you<00:05:50.900> could<00:05:51.050> work<00:05:51.230> this

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
earlier but again if you could work this

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.250 
earlier but again if you could work this
scene<00:05:51.770> and<00:05:52.070> try<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.460> maybe<00:05:53.360> eliminate<00:05:53.840> this

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
scene and try to maybe eliminate this

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.640 
scene and try to maybe eliminate this
but<00:05:54.860> this<00:05:55.040> one<00:05:55.280> isn't<00:05:55.490> as<00:05:55.760> bad<00:05:55.940> it's<00:05:56.270> a<00:05:56.990> little

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
but this one isn't as bad it's a little

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.130 
but this one isn't as bad it's a little
more<00:05:59.380> unobtrusive<00:06:00.380> let's<00:06:00.680> put<00:06:00.860> it<00:06:00.950> that<00:06:01.010> way

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
more unobtrusive let's put it that way

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.780 
more unobtrusive let's put it that way
this<00:06:03.140> is<00:06:03.230> a<00:06:03.290> great<00:06:03.530> shot<00:06:03.830> I<00:06:04.040> really<00:06:04.460> like<00:06:04.640> the

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
this is a great shot I really like the

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.260 
this is a great shot I really like the
shot<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:06.100> Claude<00:06:07.100> could<00:06:07.310> easily<00:06:07.820> took<00:06:08.030> this

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
shot and Claude could easily took this

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.000 
shot and Claude could easily took this
shot<00:06:08.480> without<00:06:08.720> a<00:06:08.930> man<00:06:09.230> in<00:06:09.260> it<00:06:09.560> without<00:06:09.860> a

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
shot without a man in it without a

person<00:06:10.520> in<00:06:10.640> the<00:06:10.730> shot<00:06:10.970> but<00:06:11.570> I<00:06:11.600> think<00:06:12.050> and<00:06:12.260> I<00:06:12.650> you

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
person in the shot but I think and I you

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.250 
person in the shot but I think and I you
know<00:06:12.950> guys<00:06:13.100> know<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.460> harp<00:06:14.000> on<00:06:14.150> it<00:06:14.210> a<00:06:14.450> lot<00:06:14.600> that<00:06:15.020> a

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
know guys know I harp on it a lot that a

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.230 
know guys know I harp on it a lot that a
lot<00:06:15.560> of<00:06:15.740> times<00:06:16.010> on<00:06:16.280> these<00:06:16.460> landscape<00:06:17.000> shots

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
lot of times on these landscape shots

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.330 
lot of times on these landscape shots
you<00:06:17.780> should<00:06:17.990> have<00:06:18.170> a<00:06:18.200> person<00:06:18.740> in<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:18.950> shot<00:06:19.160> it

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
you should have a person in the shot it

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.840 
you should have a person in the shot it
helps<00:06:19.670> add<00:06:20.800> some<00:06:21.800> interest<00:06:22.070> to<00:06:22.340> the<00:06:22.430> shot<00:06:22.640> and

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
helps add some interest to the shot and

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.390 
helps add some interest to the shot and
I<00:06:23.270> think<00:06:23.510> in<00:06:23.630> this<00:06:23.750> case<00:06:23.810> it<00:06:24.230> did<00:06:24.470> having<00:06:25.310> the

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
I think in this case it did having the

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400 
I think in this case it did having the
man<00:06:25.580> here<00:06:25.820> just<00:06:26.000> makes<00:06:26.210> it<00:06:26.330> I<00:06:26.540> mean<00:06:27.170> you<00:06:27.290> can

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
man here just makes it I mean you can

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.020 
man here just makes it I mean you can
think<00:06:27.530> of<00:06:27.680> a<00:06:27.770> story<00:06:28.070> like<00:06:28.370> it's<00:06:28.550> mysterious

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
think of a story like it's mysterious

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.990 
think of a story like it's mysterious

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
if you guys don't be afraid to have

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.980 
if you guys don't be afraid to have
people<00:06:52.690> in<00:06:52.780> your<00:06:52.840> landscapes<00:06:54.150> I'm<00:06:55.150> sure<00:06:55.450> well

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
people in your landscapes I'm sure well

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.600 
people in your landscapes I'm sure well
I<00:06:56.020> would<00:06:56.290> suggest<00:06:56.440> if<00:06:56.830> I<00:06:56.950> was<00:06:57.100> at<00:06:57.250> the<00:06:57.280> scene

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
I would suggest if I was at the scene

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.180 
I would suggest if I was at the scene
that<00:06:58.060> you<00:06:58.180> take<00:06:58.419> a<00:06:58.450> shot<00:06:58.720> without<00:06:59.350> the<00:06:59.800> man<00:07:00.010> in

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
that you take a shot without the man in

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.250 
that you take a shot without the man in
there<00:07:00.370> then<00:07:01.030> take<00:07:01.270> another<00:07:01.300> one<00:07:01.720> with<00:07:01.930> the<00:07:02.080> man

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
there then take another one with the man

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.440 
there then take another one with the man
in<00:07:02.290> there<00:07:02.560> and<00:07:02.980> maybe<00:07:03.190> one<00:07:03.669> will<00:07:03.880> talk<00:07:04.150> to<00:07:04.210> you

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
in there and maybe one will talk to you

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.879 
in there and maybe one will talk to you
more<00:07:04.690> than<00:07:04.750> the<00:07:04.990> other<00:07:05.139> so<00:07:05.470> you'll<00:07:05.620> get<00:07:05.740> an

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:05.889 
more than the other so you'll get an

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.370 
more than the other so you'll get an
idea<00:07:06.250> you<00:07:06.490> know<00:07:06.610> maybe<00:07:06.820> without<00:07:07.540> any<00:07:07.900> person

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380 
idea you know maybe without any person

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.100 
idea you know maybe without any person
in<00:07:08.500> there<00:07:08.740> to<00:07:09.669> you<00:07:09.790> looks<00:07:10.180> more<00:07:10.510> compelling

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110 
in there to you looks more compelling

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.110 
in there to you looks more compelling
but<00:07:11.620> then<00:07:11.800> again<00:07:11.919> maybe<00:07:12.220> with<00:07:12.490> the<00:07:12.639> person<00:07:13.000> it

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
but then again maybe with the person it
