 Hello people, welcome. 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.800

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.680
 and professor of strategy contest 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.500
 The goal in this video is to explain in 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.539
 few words the operation of our 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.700

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.969

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.840
 war 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.079
 you need to overcome thousands of 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.190
 candidates to achieve their approval 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:51.970
 but I see this is a mission that is 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.090
 fully within its reach and strategy 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.900
 competitions expect you to help a lot with 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.390
 that 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.310
 the methodology of the tender strategy is 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.800
 quite differentiated 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.939
 I will explain why the courses 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.750
 strategy are know per cent focused on 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.939
 edital all of which are inscribed are called 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.009
 pdf courses 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:19.329
 in them the teacher addresses all the content 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.350
 application in your competition 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:25.990
 the extent and depth required 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.979
 so that you do very well in the day 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.090
 of the test 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:34.180
 the material developed during the course 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.110
 which guarantees the permanent updating of 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.909
 content 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.060
 in addition to several of our courses 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.310
 we will also have free video lessons 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.530
 it is not all the courses that will have the 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.960
 video lessons but in several of our 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.960
 courses we will also have this 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.900
 methodology that we hope 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.650
 contribute even more to increasing the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.200
 dynamism of the teaching-learning relationship 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.470
 we must not forget our 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.189

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.400
