00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.240 

I<00:00:07.780> got<00:00:08.780> my<00:00:08.930> jug<00:00:09.170> here<00:00:09.379> and<00:00:09.530> I<00:00:09.590> got<00:00:09.710> quite<00:00:10.010> a<00:00:10.040> bit

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
I got my jug here and I got quite a bit

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.129 
I got my jug here and I got quite a bit
of<00:00:10.340> volume<00:00:10.519> I<00:00:10.789> need<00:00:10.910> to<00:00:11.030> of<00:00:11.330> liquid<00:00:11.750> I<00:00:11.840> need<00:00:12.019> to

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
of volume I need to of liquid I need to

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.350 
of volume I need to of liquid I need to
add<00:00:12.320> to<00:00:12.530> this<00:00:12.650> thing<00:00:12.830> to<00:00:12.950> cover<00:00:13.180> cover<00:00:14.180> all

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
add to this thing to cover cover all

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.390 
add to this thing to cover cover all
these<00:00:14.480> circuit<00:00:15.469> cards<00:00:15.710> here<00:00:15.860> this<00:00:16.040> time<00:00:16.189> so<00:00:16.369> I

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
these circuit cards here this time so I

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:25.049 
these circuit cards here this time so I
want<00:00:16.580> to<00:00:16.640> recycle<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:22.000> from<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:23.149> last<00:00:23.390> pot

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:25.059 
want to recycle the from the last pot

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.490 
want to recycle the from the last pot
because<00:00:26.059> it<00:00:26.210> probably<00:00:26.450> have<00:00:26.809> some<00:00:27.020> active

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
because it probably have some active

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.459 
because it probably have some active
pipe<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.099> forecasters<00:00:28.730> doing<00:00:29.059> it<00:00:29.180> and<00:00:29.930> as

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:30.469 
pipe the forecasters doing it and as

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:34.209 
pipe the forecasters doing it and as
well<00:00:31.930> copper<00:00:32.930> chloride<00:00:33.320> does<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:33.710> good<00:00:33.890> solvent

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
well copper chloride does a good solvent

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.780 
well copper chloride does a good solvent
for<00:00:34.550> copper<00:00:35.090> anyway<00:00:35.980> so<00:00:36.980> all<00:00:37.070> I<00:00:37.190> need<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:37.640> add

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
for copper anyway so all I need to add

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.590 
for copper anyway so all I need to add
is<00:00:38.030> a<00:00:38.059> little<00:00:38.300> bit<00:00:38.480> little<00:00:40.240> little<00:00:41.240> -<00:00:41.390> so

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
is a little bit little little - so

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:50.110 
is a little bit little little - so
hydrochloric<00:00:42.140> acid<00:00:42.700> is<00:00:43.700> this<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:49.730> probably

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
hydrochloric acid is this and probably

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.060 
hydrochloric acid is this and probably
just<00:00:50.240> a<00:00:50.300> shot<00:00:50.510> of<00:00:50.630> water<00:00:50.780> will<00:00:51.440> be<00:00:51.560> sufficient

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
just a shot of water will be sufficient

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.440 
just a shot of water will be sufficient
to<00:00:52.130> raise<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:52.550> level<00:00:52.700> as<00:00:53.120> needed<00:00:55.420> there<00:00:56.420> I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
to raise the level as needed there I

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.850 
to raise the level as needed there I
think<00:00:59.450> if<00:00:59.600> I<00:00:59.750> should<00:01:00.020> Diggle<00:01:00.410> that<00:01:00.530> around

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
think if I should Diggle that around

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.920 
think if I should Diggle that around
it's<00:01:01.190> gonna<00:01:01.250> be<00:01:01.489> hot<00:01:01.670> enough<00:01:01.790> anyway<00:01:02.210> the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's gonna be hot enough anyway the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.179 
it's gonna be hot enough anyway the
other<00:01:03.050> thing<00:01:03.230> it<00:01:03.380> add<00:01:03.560> is<00:01:03.770> just<00:01:03.950> some<00:01:04.040> regular

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
other thing it add is just some regular

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.100 
other thing it add is just some regular
hydrogen<00:01:04.850> peroxide<00:01:05.030> just<00:01:05.720> regular

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
hydrogen peroxide just regular

but<00:02:35.900> we<00:02:36.380> don't<00:02:36.560> want<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.739> lose<00:02:36.860> any<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.160> these

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
but we don't want to lose any of these

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.380 
but we don't want to lose any of these
fragments<00:02:37.850> either<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.940> that's<00:02:40.940> why<00:02:41.120> we<00:02:41.239> feel

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
fragments either so that's why we feel

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.729 
fragments either so that's why we feel

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
noticed about some of these cards that I

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.000 
noticed about some of these cards that I
have<00:03:56.550> what<00:03:57.550> I<00:03:57.580> can<00:03:57.790> tell<00:03:58.740> underneath<00:03:59.740> the

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
layer of copper that appears to be

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.400 
layer of copper that appears to be
plated<00:04:10.000> with<00:04:10.090> gold<00:04:10.120> all<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.780> way<00:04:10.930> through<00:04:11.230> and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
plated with gold all the way through and

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.760 
plated with gold all the way through and
through<00:04:11.590> on<00:04:11.710> these<00:04:11.860> cards<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:13.170> these<00:04:14.170> cars<00:04:14.530> may

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
through on these cards so these cars may

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.640 
through on these cards so these cars may
have<00:04:14.800> an<00:04:15.190> awful<00:04:15.790> lot<00:04:16.000> of<00:04:16.150> gold<00:04:16.390> on<00:04:16.570> them<00:04:16.750> but<00:04:17.530> it

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
have an awful lot of gold on them but it

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.979 
have an awful lot of gold on them but it
takes<00:04:17.799> an<00:04:17.890> awful<00:04:17.980> long<00:04:18.370> time<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.670> digest<00:04:19.270> as

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
takes an awful long time to digest as

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.110 
takes an awful long time to digest as
you<00:04:20.080> can<00:04:20.230> see<00:04:20.410> though<00:04:20.730> it<00:04:21.730> kind<00:04:21.910> of<00:04:21.940> has<00:04:22.090> to

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
you can see though it kind of has to

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.320 
you can see though it kind of has to
because<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:22.570> plastic<00:04:22.990> protects<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.740> copper

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
because the plastic protects the copper

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.670 
because the plastic protects the copper
it<00:04:25.330> kind<00:04:25.540> of<00:04:25.570> has<00:04:25.690> digests<00:04:26.320> from<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.530> edge<00:04:26.650> and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
it kind of has digests from the edge and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.730 
it kind of has digests from the edge and
work<00:04:27.040> its<00:04:27.250> way<00:04:27.370> in<00:04:28.290> he's<00:04:29.290> made<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.470> lot<00:04:29.710> of

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
work its way in he's made a lot of

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.090 
work its way in he's made a lot of
progress<00:04:30.220> here<00:04:31.620> there's<00:04:32.620> still<00:04:32.710> quite<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:33.010> bit

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
progress here there's still quite a bit

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.050 
progress here there's still quite a bit
left<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.550> go<00:04:35.010> so<00:04:36.010> some<00:04:36.340> of<00:04:36.370> these<00:04:36.460> cards<00:04:36.760> just

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
left to go so some of these cards just

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.000 
left to go so some of these cards just
have<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.270> digest<00:04:37.690> for<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.900> really<00:04:38.110> long<00:04:38.230> time<00:04:38.290> um

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
have to digest for a really long time um

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.850 
have to digest for a really long time um
Wow<00:04:39.550> there<00:04:40.330> could<00:04:40.480> be<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.600> lot<00:04:41.050> of<00:04:41.080> gold<00:04:41.500> on<00:04:41.710> it

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
Wow there could be a lot of gold on it

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.730 
Wow there could be a lot of gold on it
some<00:04:41.980> of<00:04:42.010> these<00:04:42.130> cards<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:43.350> sure<00:04:44.350> wouldn't<00:04:44.590> want

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
some of these cards I sure wouldn't want

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
some of these cards I sure wouldn't want
to<00:04:44.800> sell<00:04:45.010> these<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:46.180> scrap<00:04:46.900> dealer<00:04:47.760> because

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
to sell these to a scrap dealer because

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.010 
to sell these to a scrap dealer because
they<00:04:49.000> probably<00:04:49.210> want<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.630> know<00:04:49.750> how<00:04:49.900> much

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
they probably want to know how much

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.650
