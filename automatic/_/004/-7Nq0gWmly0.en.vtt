00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.510
 hello good day my name is daniel 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.510
 mitsanski 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.440
 today repair 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.920
 in a part of me 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.920
 full of ignorance of my body 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.910
 I realized that I knew my body 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:37.600
 through an object 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.600
 an inanimate object the mirror 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:46.380
 the mirror is two-dimensional the three 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.800
 dimensions is an optical illusion 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.200
 but beyond that there are parts of me 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.370
 body that I do not know because the mirror 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.370
 it does not allow me to see 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.250
 after intrigued by this I found another 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.370
 mirror 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.300
 the look of the others 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.540
 what we think we see from our 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.820
 body 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.760
 and the ambiguity of that look because 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.420
 for some of us we can be attractive and 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.420
 for others not 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:27.190
 then I pose the challenge 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.790
 to reconnect with my own geography 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.659
 with my own border 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.390
 and for that 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.560
 and towards the world 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.970
 inside 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.310
 for him from there 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.850
 be an observer without judging me 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.850
 d 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.810
 in my body and how my body molds 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.810
 to my own energy to my essence 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:06.280
 As if I feel good, I look good 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:09.729
 then the straits disappeared 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.729
 of the adjectives 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.260
 ugly 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.490
 and on the other side to feel each part 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.200
 of my body 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.200
 and I began to realize 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.050
 what does the eyes mean the ears the skin 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.210
 it's a difficult road 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.880
 I propose to try 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.340
 in the life 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.460
 nothing is achieved if you do not try 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.980
 and in that search 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:53.940
 rediscover your travel companion 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.330
 a kind traveling companion your body 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.390
 a companion that adapts to your 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.650
 needs 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.329
 and without a doubt 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.329
 you will feel comfortable in it 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.530
 do not
