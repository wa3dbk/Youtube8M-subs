00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.440
Hi! 
Jakob,
Unisport WebTV!

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.120
Today is the big Premier, -

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.260
- because I will be reviewing 
this bad boy -

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.180
- it is the Nike Premier -

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.380
- which is Nike's shot a classic boot,
but with modern features.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.500
Nike Premier will be going head to head, 
 with the boot icon from 1979 -

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.000
- which is the Adidas' Copa Mundial -

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.040
- and the question now is; 
is the Nike Premier a worthy contender?

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.860
Find out today, 
when I give you my verdict of the boot here.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.840
Let's see what happens, 
let's dive into it.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.820
Ohh and it is a modern classic, 
so let's get some colour!

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.800
There we are, 
let's go!

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.520
One of the things 
that many people connect with 
classic boots -

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.540
- is one central area -

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.840
- which is comfort.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.960
This is naturally also where Nike
 have focused the most 
on the Premier.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.640
The upper is entirely made of leather, -

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.420
- on the nose it is 
Nike's finest kangaroo leather, -

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.760
- which is just 1,6 mm thick.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.640
From the midfoot and back to the heel, 
it is instead goats leather -

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.080
- and this leather, 
especially on the nose, 
means you get an awesome fit.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.100
It wraps itself around your foot -

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.000
- and almost feels like 
butter to step into, 
so you get a very personal fit -

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.100
- another thing that helps regarding the boot fits,
is Nike's new last, -

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.480
- which is called X1.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.200
This new last 
resembles the one found on 
the Hypervenom -

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.520
- which means the boot is a little wide, -

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.600
- and has a low and pointy nose, -

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.340
- all this means it follows the foots curvatures very well.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.660
Another thing I take note of
 is the boots sizing, -

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.640
- because it may feel a little tight to begin with.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.460
I'm usually a size 40 
and did also pick a size 40 in the Premier -

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.620
- and it did take quite
 a lot of breaking in, 
before I got the optimal fit -

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.420
- so if you want a little room to move in your boots, 
then consider going half a size up.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.020
In other words, 
the Nike Premier is a dream to wear -

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.380
- and most importantly the comfort is so good that even my grandfather would love it -

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.980
- and yes, that is praise.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.020
Top grades from here!

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.600
If we flip the boot around and look at the sole -

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.600
- then there's no doubt this is a boot inspired by the classics.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.180
The sole is white 
and it has these trademark black, conical studs -

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.360
- which help both comfort and maneuverability.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.360
These studs do work quite well, 
when you need to turn, -

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.140
- because these round studs do move easily through the ground, -

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.500
- but as you have probably noticed 
the Premier doesn't have very long studs -

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.880
- and this does mean
that you don't get a very aggressive acceleration -

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.220
- even though it has these 
jagged teeth,
 at the front of the sole -

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.100
- and to be honest, 
it doesn't do a great deal -

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.860
- not much effect from them.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.300
The sole itself is made from plastic TPU -

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.100
- and Nike have made the sole, 
so the front foot is quite flexible -

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.960
- while the midfoot is a little more stiff.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.220
This gives good stability when you need it -

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.440
- while you below the front foot have a bit more freedom to move.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.480
All in all the soleplate works 
well on the Nike Premier -

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.800
- it does what it has to, 
but no more than that.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.140
When it comes to play with the ball, 
classic boots have to be elegant -

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.560
- something the Nike Premier luckily is.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.120
This kangaroo leather nose, 
gives a soft, dampening feel with the ball -

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.740
- and I felt like doing small elegant touches,
when I was wearing these -

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.740
- but at the same time, 
the upper is just 1,6 mm thick -

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.780
- and this means you can feel 
quite a lot of what you're doing 
with the ball -

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.300
- and this is an interesting combination of the classic and the modern, 
which I quite like.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.140

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.740
Striking the ball with the Nike Premier, 
is also a joy -

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.860
- especially seeing as though
 the nose and last is so low,
you can really get under the ball.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.760
I do however think the sole lacks a little stiffness, 
so you don't get as much force in your shots -

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.680
- and it does feel like you lose some power,  
because the front foot is so flexible.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.760
Luckily not of great concern.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.700
All in all, 
the Nike Premier is a joy around the ball -

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.920
- no nonsense -

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.000
- and you get that soft feel with the ball, 
as you would expect.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.760
I'm definitely a fan.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.200
It's time for the final verdict of the Nike Premier.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.600
I have to quickly conclude
 that this is one of the 
most comfortable boots on sale -

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.720
- but what sets this apart from the rest, 
is this modern last -

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.140
- as well as the fact, 
that it only weighs 245 grams, -

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.380
- which is exceptional,
 for a boot this comfortable.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.400
All in all, 
Nike have found room for a lot of quality in this boot -

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.600
- and when you then consider how little this costs, -

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.820
- then I just have to give it the thumbs up
and declare myself impressed.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.200
I would also go for the Nike Premier, 
over the Copa Mundial, 
simply because it weighs less -

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.240
- and because of this streamlined last.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.440
This was just what I think, -

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.400
- what about you? 
tell me in the comment-section down below.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.420
Which is best - Premier, or Copa Mundial.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.320
now you're there anyway,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.940
- and get more awesome football video's.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.820
This is all from me, 
I'm off to play some more in my Nike Premier -

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.120
- see you soon, 
Cheeeeeerio!

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.120
BOOF!
