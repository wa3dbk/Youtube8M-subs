notice on this one the copper spot the
copper<00:00:59.730> stain<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:01.050> pandas<00:01:01.379> head<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
copper stain on the pandas head this is

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.119 
copper stain on the pandas head this is
very<00:01:02.910> common<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:04.199> early<00:01:04.350> pandas<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
very common I'm not early pandas and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.510 
very common I'm not early pandas and
they<00:01:05.820> believe<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.330> attributed<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
they believe it's attributed to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.850 
they believe it's attributed to
impurities<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> air<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.630> mint<00:01:09.860> which

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
impurities in the air in the mint which

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
impurities in the air in the mint which
caused<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> coins<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.820> react<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.840> form<00:01:12.869> these

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
caused the coins to react and form these

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.649 
caused the coins to react and form these
copper<00:01:13.619> spots<00:01:16.280> here's<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> 1985<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.509> one

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
copper spots here's the 1985 this is one

copper spots here's the 1985 this is one
of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> highest<00:01:18.900> mintages<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.549> the

notice the mint marked this is one of

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.660 
notice the mint marked this is one of
the<00:01:39.600> few<00:01:39.689> coins<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.020> carries<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> mint<00:01:40.500> mark

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
the few coins that carries a mint mark

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.420 
the few coins that carries a mint mark
and<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.210> an<00:01:42.329> S<00:01:43.009> there's<00:01:44.009> two<00:01:44.310> different

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and this is an S there's two different

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.670 
and this is an S there's two different
mints<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.970> s<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.360> Y<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.500> made

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
mints the s and the Y that this was made

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.980 
mints the s and the Y that this was made
in<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.280> they're<00:01:47.490> differentiated<00:01:48.240> by<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> S<00:01:48.750> or

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
in so they're differentiated by the S or

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.289 
in so they're differentiated by the S or
the<00:01:49.020> Y<00:01:49.229> Inglot<00:01:49.590> mark<00:01:49.799> there's<00:01:50.520> also<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.820> proof

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the Y Inglot mark there's also a proof

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.160 
the Y Inglot mark there's also a proof
coin<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.689> carries<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> pea<00:01:52.290> mint<00:01:52.350> mark<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.930> Y

I<00:05:50.560> guess<00:05:51.340> that<00:05:51.490> originally<00:05:51.850> the<00:05:51.940> government's

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
I guess that originally the government's

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.910 
I guess that originally the government's
intention<00:05:52.690> was<00:05:52.870> to<00:05:52.900> take<00:05:53.290> one<00:05:53.470> design<00:05:53.770> and

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
intention was to take one design and

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.620 
intention was to take one design and
stick<00:05:54.100> with<00:05:54.250> it<00:05:54.400> for<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.610> rest<00:05:54.640> of<00:05:54.910> the<00:05:55.000> the

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
stick with it for the rest of the the

stick with it for the rest of the the

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
painter series but collectors don't want

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.850

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
that they want the changing designs and

a<00:06:06.610> little<00:06:06.820> bit<00:06:06.940> better<00:06:07.060> date<00:06:07.360> because<00:06:07.720> less<00:06:07.930> of

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
a little bit better date because less of

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.420 
a little bit better date because less of
them<00:06:08.230> are<00:06:08.350> sold<00:06:08.560> so<00:06:08.800> it's<00:06:08.920> a<00:06:08.980> little<00:06:09.070> bit<00:06:09.250> rarer

almost every coin since uh oh four and
here's<00:07:13.690> the<00:07:13.780> 2008<00:07:14.320> the<00:07:14.470> newest<00:07:14.740> one<00:07:16.590> so<00:07:17.590> that

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:17.770 
here's the 2008 the newest one so that

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.290 
here's the 2008 the newest one so that
is<00:07:17.920> the<00:07:18.100> Panda<00:07:18.430> series<00:07:18.790> for<00:07:19.270> the<00:07:19.480> gold<00:07:20.130> the

is the Panda series for the gold the

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.200 
is the Panda series for the gold the
missus<00:07:22.300> delayed<00:07:22.630> again<00:07:22.840> the<00:07:24.210> different

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
missus delayed again the different

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.380 
missus delayed again the different
denominations<00:07:26.160> within<00:07:27.160> each<00:07:27.460> date<00:07:27.760> are<00:07:28.150> all

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.390 
denominations within each date are all

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.780 
denominations within each date are all
identical<00:07:28.990> designs<00:07:29.350> so<00:07:30.160> this<00:07:30.340> will<00:07:30.490> look<00:07:30.640> the

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790 
identical designs so this will look the

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.670 
identical designs so this will look the
same<00:07:30.820> and<00:07:31.150> a<00:07:31.240> half<00:07:31.390> ounces<00:07:31.780> a<00:07:31.840> dozen<00:07:32.230> to<00:07:32.290> 1/10

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
same and a half ounces a dozen to 1/10

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.350 
same and a half ounces a dozen to 1/10
ounce<00:07:32.920> and<00:07:33.280> then<00:07:33.700> the<00:07:33.760> world<00:07:33.880> is<00:07:34.000> named<00:07:34.180> in<00:07:34.300> a

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 
ounce and then the world is named in a

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.660 
ounce and then the world is named in a
twentieth<00:07:34.840> once's<00:07:35.140> a<00:07:35.170> dozen<00:07:35.560> of<00:07:35.650> one<00:07:35.680> ounce<00:07:35.920> so

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:36.670 
twentieth once's a dozen of one ounce so

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.280 
twentieth once's a dozen of one ounce so
the<00:07:36.700> design<00:07:37.090> doesn't<00:07:37.390> change<00:07:37.570> only<00:07:37.900> the<00:07:38.080> size

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.290 
the design doesn't change only the size

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.830 
the design doesn't change only the size
changes<00:07:38.800> these<00:07:39.670> are<00:07:39.820> the<00:07:39.910> work<00:07:40.000> again<00:07:40.120> -<00:07:40.420> 1/10

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 
changes these are the work again - 1/10

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.380 
changes these are the work again - 1/10
ounce<00:07:41.050> coins<00:07:41.860> I've<00:07:42.700> got<00:07:42.850> some<00:07:43.000> one<00:07:43.120> ounce<00:07:43.240> and

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
we're gonna show those in another video
