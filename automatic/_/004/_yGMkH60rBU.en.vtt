00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.210
 start my diego palm trick 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.500
 with the concealer this is a trick in 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.029
 holy or sinful theme on the occasion of 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.369
 of the film output 50 shades of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.350
 gray building just tapping the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.000
 my concealer around the whole area 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.660
 in short, to cover the eyes 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.440
 dark circles then all the various pimples 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.970
 imperfections and so on and so on 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.180
 then he passed to the foundation this a 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:43.940
 liquid foundation and spread it with the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.640
 my usual flat foundation brush 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.040
 los smoke for good near the ears e 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.239
 then along the whole line 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.239
 hair and towards the neck 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.420
 and then I fix it with the transparent powder 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.760
 like this figure because it's very light and 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.760
 you almost don't really feel a pleasure 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.430
 in short, applying it then passed to 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.430
 checker still yes because I use it as 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:32.390
 base and then spread it on the eyelid 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.300
 mobile on the fixed one then from mine 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.520
 palette precisely with shades of gray 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.250
 I'm going to get the lightest gray and 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.650
 I spread it over the entire eyelid 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.630
 staking it this way and then 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.310
 always from the same spoon with a 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.100
 another polito brush I'm going to take the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.729
 white and spread it on the inside corner 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.660
 just in front of the gray and then I bring it 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.850
 also up towards the eyebrow 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.400
 then it turned to dark gray almost 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.110
 almost black and very very dark and so 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.510
 I apply with the pen brush in 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.480
 this way on the outside 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.680
 of the eye and then slightly too 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.160
 along the lower lash line 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.820
 but always on the outside I connect 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.630
 the two lines in quotation marks and then I go to 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.850
 put some color too 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.880
 then within the fold 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.950
 I'm going to concentrate most of the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.290
 color on the outside corner and then with a 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.480
 clean gradient brush I go to 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.340
 blending all this is a trick 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.410
 precisely where it is very necessary to blend 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.510
 the smoky eyes are thus made 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.660
 arm yourself with a few brush must 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.760
 blend a lot and then once I have it 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.310
 finished I am satisfied with the result 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.440
 I take the black pencil and I lay in 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.890
 very very thin way at the beginning 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.850
 of the line and then I go along with 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.670
 break it outwards 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.310
 dressing a little also along the lashes 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.049
 lower I'm trying but not to color 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.250
 the internal rhyme that in this trick 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.830
 I want to leave 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.720
 natural so I bring the color so 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.500
 very thin to the inside corner e 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.140
 then with the first brush the one has 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.570
 as soon as I go to blend it all with the 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.220
 brush with another clean brush 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.220
 I go instead to apply the illuminant 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.320
 I always use the white of the palette and then 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.350
 inevitable inevitable false eyelashes 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.079
 because I have to do extensions and then 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.739
 I'm using fake eyelashes a lot 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.079
 here we are and then switched to mascara 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.540
 transform this brand new mascara e 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.389
 I spread it very black and spread it out 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.100
 precisely on my natural eyelashes below 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:51.320
 the fake ones and along the lower lashes 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.540
 then a plus came to the plus 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.000
 pink is very very clear extremely 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.549
 natural and opaque you know that I prefer 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.739
 the matte blush so this is a color 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.470
 that is making me a lot of picket 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.109
 on the cheeks this way and then the 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.389
 lipstick is the turn of lipstick and ho 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.459
 chosen this rose is boyfriend is a lot 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.459
 clear but not excessively so 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.440
 it is natural, it is not too much 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.180
 clear sometimes you scold me because you don't 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.340
 like when I wear lipsticks too 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.440
 clear this truly beautiful pink 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.570
 to combine with a smoky eye but also to 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.910
 a natural makeup for the eyes and then 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.770
 I'm going to fill my eyebrows 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.930
 so all the spaces just go 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.930
 color them with the eyebrow pencil 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.200
 and then with the other part of the pencil 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.980
 where is this little brush I go to 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:46.170
 comb with cd eyebrows and smudge 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:48.600
 also doing so the pencil then I go 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.390
 to wet the light hair a little 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.420
 discoli back comb I go to 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.670
 always add a little bit of gel 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.290
 combing them one back 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.700
 extremely simple combing that 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.980
 for Valentine's Day in seemed ideal 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.180
 because in my opinion it is very very sexy 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.910
 easy to make 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:12.210
 I'm going to apply a bit of lacquer to it 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:13.530
 fixing everything and flying this is the 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.840
 full makeup i hope you like it 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.610

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.110
