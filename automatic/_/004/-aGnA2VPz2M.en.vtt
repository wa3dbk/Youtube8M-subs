00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 very good kids one man I had two and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.049
 well I bring you the news I am 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
 here on the beach of la concha de san 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.599
 sebastián and good news that makes 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.340
 Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday, March 5 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 prowling a whale by the coast of san 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.449
 sebastián and well then today on this beach 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.660
 from here on this beach the beach of 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.150
 shell has been found the whale 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.070
 dead good as you can see all 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.349
 those people who are there and piled up 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.840
 are modeling the whale are 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.399
 curious and others are seeing between 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.829
 those who good, well, it's gone too 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.500
 to take some photos and get some 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.210
 video then well because it 's one thing 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.879
 spectacular not being able to see an animal 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.460
 from so close even in this 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.129
 been dead then for the poor animal 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.960
 Surely it is said that it could 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.219
 be sick because he was very thin 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.559
 the animal is a whale whale 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.420
 common is worth and is one is the second 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.050
 largest whale in the world after 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.989
 the blue whale and this animal has 16 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.640
 more than 16 meters long and weighs about 20 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.850
 tons approximately not yet 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.920
 know sex 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.350
 not even good the reasons for the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.659
 death as we already say then possibly 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.630
 either because she is sick because 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.630
 He was very thin but good until 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.060
 do not perform the necropsy because it is not 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.009
 will know nothing else will be known because it could 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.170
 be in perfect condition and that 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.110
 simply the fact of ending up stranded in 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.670
 the beach has killed him already 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.759
 that these animals good for the weight 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.340
 they have already said good in this 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.799
 case they are 20 tons as the living 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.600
 out of the water it oppresses the lungs and 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.869
 I could calmly have died for 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.569
 suffocation good are shelled from the body 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.679
 by means of two large tonnage cranes 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.350
 will wait for it to rise the tide 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.610
 so it will be retired this morning 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.380
 and three good opportunities arise 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.899
 bury it, incinerate it or take it to a 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.060
 dump directly though there is already 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.340
 some museum in asturias that has 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.229
 interested in the animal and it could be 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.470
 taken there although they need some 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.450
 special permits well then nothing else 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.459
 I leave you with these photos of the whale is 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.120
 say that if there are any curious that 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.690
 follow 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.180
 to see to see the animal as it can 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.280
 doing it can come here to the beach of 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.840
 the shell in san sebastián and returns 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.760
 animal that is still stranded 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.110
 in the sand the only thing that will have to be 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.870
 give a little hurry because as I have 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.940
 said before the tide is rising is 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.610
 starting to rise and this very morning 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.690
 will be in the body a greeting and 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.690
 until the next kids
