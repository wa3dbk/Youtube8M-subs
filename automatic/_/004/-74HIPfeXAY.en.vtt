to Las Vegas my family and I we recently
moved<00:03:17.950> actually<00:03:18.950> only<00:03:19.250> been<00:03:19.340> renting<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.730> place

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
moved actually only been renting a place

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.390 
moved actually only been renting a place
for<00:03:20.120> about<00:03:20.180> three<00:03:20.810> weeks<00:03:20.860> idiot<00:03:21.860> so<00:03:21.980> far<00:03:22.160> I

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
for about three weeks idiot so far I

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.890 
for about three weeks idiot so far I
mean<00:03:22.940> so<00:03:23.090> far<00:03:23.240> but<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.480> feel<00:03:23.600> like<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.780> haven't

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
mean so far but I feel like I haven't

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.480 
mean so far but I feel like I haven't
really<00:03:24.080> actually<00:03:24.260> lived<00:03:24.710> here<00:03:24.830> yet<00:03:25.070> it's<00:03:25.370> just

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
really actually lived here yet it's just

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.280 
really actually lived here yet it's just
been<00:03:25.610> so<00:03:25.820> busy<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.210> so<00:03:26.270> hectic<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.990> don't

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
been so busy and so hectic so I don't

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.540 
been so busy and so hectic so I don't
think<00:03:27.350> we're<00:03:27.560> really<00:03:27.770> fully<00:03:28.100> settle<00:03:28.460> down

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
think we're really fully settle down

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.040 
think we're really fully settle down
until<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.030> end<00:03:29.150> of<00:03:29.240> the<00:03:29.300> summer<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.780> then

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
until the end of the summer and then

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.420 
until the end of the summer and then
what<00:03:30.230> kind<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.380> see<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:31.070> far<00:03:31.250> I'm<00:03:31.400> liking

in January when it's a blizzard in
Minnesota<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:34.970> it's<00:03:35.300> 75<00:03:36.020> and<00:03:36.260> sunny<00:03:36.410> here<00:03:36.650> so

Minnesota and it's 75 and sunny here so

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.070 
Minnesota and it's 75 and sunny here so
um<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.640> as<00:03:37.700> far<00:03:37.850> as<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.090> me<00:03:38.240> versus<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.570> I

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
um and as far as the me versus you I

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.260 
um and as far as the me versus you I
mean<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:39.920> lost<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.550> bunch<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:41.000> those

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270
