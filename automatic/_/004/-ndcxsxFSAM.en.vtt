recently<00:00:52.780> we<00:00:52.989> worked<00:00:53.230> through<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.530> data

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
recently we worked through a data

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.830 
recently we worked through a data
management<00:00:53.980> unit<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:54.970> this<00:00:55.390> lesson<00:00:55.630> is

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
management unit and this lesson is

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.440 
management unit and this lesson is
specifically<00:00:56.410> on<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.650> pictogram<00:00:57.450> students

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
specifically on the pictogram students

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.840 
specifically on the pictogram students
gathered<00:00:58.840> information<00:00:59.020> on<00:00:59.829> a<00:01:00.040> tally<00:01:00.430> chart

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
gathered information on a tally chart

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.400 
gathered information on a tally chart
and<00:01:01.030> then<00:01:01.210> recorded<00:01:01.720> it<00:01:01.840> on<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.050> smart<00:01:02.350> board

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
and then recorded it on the smart board

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.890 
and then recorded it on the smart board
I<00:01:02.830> use<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.460> page<00:01:03.670> recording<00:01:04.239> function<00:01:04.690> so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
I use the page recording function so

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.290 
I use the page recording function so
that<00:01:05.050> we<00:01:05.140> can<00:01:05.320> keep<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.920> data<00:01:06.160> on<00:01:06.580> as<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:06.910> smart

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
that we can keep the data on as a smart

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.280 
that we can keep the data on as a smart
board<00:01:07.479> file

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.260

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
students were able to come up and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.180 
students were able to come up and
interact<00:01:14.570> with<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.080> smart<00:01:15.380> board<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:16.070> the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
interact with the smart board and the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.710 
interact with the smart board and the
nice<00:01:16.370> thing<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:16.970> because<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.390> pictures

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
nice thing is that because the pictures

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.510 
nice thing is that because the pictures
came<00:01:17.900> from<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.230> gallery<00:01:18.620> they're<00:01:18.890> consistent

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
came from the gallery they're consistent

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.950 
came from the gallery they're consistent
throughout<00:01:19.790> all<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.390> lessons<00:01:20.780> and

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
throughout all of the lessons and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.930 
throughout all of the lessons and
students<00:01:21.590> don't<00:01:21.830> need<00:01:21.980> reminders<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.670> what

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
are then able to empathize get data into

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.950 
are then able to empathize get data into
a<00:01:36.990> picture<00:01:37.260> graph<00:01:37.610> using<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.720> smiley<00:01:39.720> face
