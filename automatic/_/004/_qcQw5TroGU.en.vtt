this<00:02:07.240> but<00:02:07.420> here<00:02:07.600> I<00:02:07.630> know<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.080> ground<00:02:08.319> is<00:02:08.500> let's

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
this but here I know the ground is let's

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.729 
this but here I know the ground is let's
go<00:02:09.310> bit<00:02:09.459> larger<00:02:09.929> again<00:02:10.929> push<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.350> across<00:02:11.410> as

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
go bit larger again push it across as

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.190 
go bit larger again push it across as
more<00:02:11.890> central<00:02:12.370> but<00:02:13.030> larger<00:02:13.750> still<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.140> there

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
more central but larger still and there

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.319 
more central but larger still and there
we<00:02:14.290> go<00:02:14.410> that's<00:02:14.560> perfect<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.640> we<00:02:15.760> know<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.120> city

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
we go that's perfect so we know the city

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.180 
we go that's perfect so we know the city

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
here we've got the HTML code so if we

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.099 
here we've got the HTML code so if we
just<00:02:26.110> highlight<00:02:26.709> all<00:02:26.920> this

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109

way putting a map onto a web page we

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.240 
way putting a map onto a web page we
should<00:03:35.790> then<00:03:35.970> save<00:03:36.239> have<00:03:37.049> any<00:03:37.260> website<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.010> so

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
should then save have any website and so

hopefully family and friends using this

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.039 
hopefully family and friends using this
then<00:03:41.040> find<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.489> ricoh<00:03:41.790> stadium<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.780> hope<00:03:42.930> this

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
then find the ricoh stadium so hope this

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.020 
then find the ricoh stadium so hope this
