00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.020
 ah 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.930
 hello mister good night here in what 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.579
 as the gene fluid the environment that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.900
 there was in the field between the background and the 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.900
 rest in the final result 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.629
 I think I'm not the one to 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.510
 to answer that question because 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.430
 from my point of view it is not valuable 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 I do not know to what degree he has been able to influence 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.510
 Because I have no idea 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.740
 congratulations for the victory 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.260
 I wanted to ask in the previous one you said 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.570
 that if he won the athletic porsche 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.309
 legally what do you think of 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.040
 his word after the goal nullified 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.840
 man chuquis had been to do that 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 you do not say you were legal 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.040
 I do not know 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.040
 I 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.900
 in the previous one you have to see how I said the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.900
 words and how then it gets 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.580
 then the best thing is that you listen to my 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.740
 press conference before a 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.090
 and then after hearing the words 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.090
 I have been right or wrong 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.140
 and I also believe 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.979
 that I will not value the performance of the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.320
 referee but I think there were actions that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.780
 they were maybe 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.180
 whistle differently in favor of 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.409
 villarreal also and if not then also 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.409
 you can check the video 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.030
 or you saw her some nights back here that 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.369
 he seems to have won in a house like 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.570
 this since May 2013 that made it 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.030
 He lost a match here in good home 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.380
 Independently of 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.300
 that this data is given 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.530
 I think good is statistical because 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.850
 I think the important thing 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.750
 is that we have won 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.390
 a rival of the best teams of 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.460
 europe and that these footballers 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.890
 they deserved but really that I know 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.660
 they deserved in the games we did 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.120
 this season against the teams 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.510
 great of our league or both 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.180
 ties that we harvest in Europe 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.740
 league against borussia we were very 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.400
 close to winning the club we throw three 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.470
 sticks and we lost an acceleration 84 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.240
 We lost 02 with Real Madrid in a 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.730
 match that I think could have been given to a 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.960
 result very very very different in the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.370
 minute 88 we were winning with 89 I think 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.370
 01 in seville 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.340
 and against evolution we could also win 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.310
 both parties always lacked that 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.630
 small dose of fortune success but 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.120
 the work that they had developed 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.040
 players in the field I think they were 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.630
 worthy in many of his matches 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.180
 have achieved a very different result 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.130
 to the harvested and I am very happy 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.560
 for them because they show us that 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.349
 we are a competitive team 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.590
 that we already knew inside but that what 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.740
 we endorse with a result 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.690
 favorable in a 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.330
 in great victory before a great 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.480
 rival 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.090
 marcelino good eight congratulations the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.250
 team despite the youth each 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.380
 passing day gives the feeling of 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.720
 have more maturity today has had again 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.270
 patience like in the last game of 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.920
 It ties a lot of patience good to see I think 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.620
 that the athletic madrid 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.040
 it came out tremendously intense and I think that 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.750
 the first 25 minutes dominated us not 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.810
 we were able to actually come out 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.080
 It seems that the first time we got to 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.090
 his area although we had in certain 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.310
 moments the ball but was unable not 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.020
 we were able to deepen because of 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.100
 good job, as always 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.930
 the atletico madrid 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.760
 I think it was about 25 minutes like this 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.650
 but that from there he went 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.239
 equaling a bit the match we had 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.920
 our arrivals in the final stretch of 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.440
 first time 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.900
 and then in second because I think there was 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.120
 for both of us we started very well 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.730
 we had some clear danger option 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.700
 then the athletic Madrid 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.970
 I think he had something over five there 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.160
 minutes where he squeezed us very much and 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.310
 then I think that party tended to 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.950
 match again but it's not the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.130
 feeling that we had I do not know if 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.840
 it caught me in front of us that we had the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.790
 possibility of endangering what already 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.670
 we had had some pretty option 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.450
 clear above all, then one two 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:59.330
 against one of being and chechi and fought that 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.180
 we do not hit the end well and then 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.100
 I think we scored a very good goal and 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.960
 that certifies a victory for us 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.600
 tremendously important above all and 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.730
 I insist again because I think this 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.890
 group deserved a victory against a 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.060
 large given the number of times that 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.060
 we were very close to achieving it
