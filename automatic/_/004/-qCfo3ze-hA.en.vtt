but also why you do the decision you may
so<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.209> work<00:02:30.420> with<00:02:30.569> that

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.140 

you<00:02:33.769> just<00:02:34.040> don't<00:02:34.220> have<00:02:34.370> all<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> tools<00:02:34.909> you

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
pretty rough and they sharpen one of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.449 
pretty rough and they sharpen one of
them<00:02:41.230> now<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.290> would<00:02:42.409> definitely<00:02:42.560> say<00:02:42.799> it's<00:02:42.890> one

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
them now I would definitely say it's one

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.670 
them now I would definitely say it's one
of<00:02:43.549> those<00:02:43.610> things<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:44.230> they<00:02:45.230> should

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
of those things that they should

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.350 
of those things that they should
definitely<00:02:46.159> look<00:02:46.340> into<00:02:46.489> making<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.209> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
definitely look into making it a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.619 
definitely look into making it a
prerequisite<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.500> being<00:02:49.069> over<00:02:49.430> 369<00:02:50.180> because

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
prerequisite to being over 369 because

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.220 
prerequisite to being over 369 because
it's<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:52.010> bottom<00:02:52.370> line<00:02:52.519> it's<00:02:52.760> not<00:02:52.910> about

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
it's the bottom line it's not about

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.360 
it's the bottom line it's not about
looking<00:02:54.230> good<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.560> fitrep<00:02:54.950> it's<00:02:55.129> about

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
looking good on the fitrep it's about

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
looking good on the fitrep it's about
the<00:02:55.489> knowledge<00:02:55.849> that<00:02:55.879> you're<00:02:56.090> going<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.299> in

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
the knowledge that you're going to in

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.390 
the knowledge that you're going to in
part<00:02:56.599> about<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> Marines<00:02:57.890> are<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.069> get<00:02:58.160> elite

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
part about the Marines are you get elite

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.690 
part about the Marines are you get elite
and<00:02:58.579> stuff<00:02:58.900> coming<00:02:59.900> here<00:03:00.260> you're<00:03:01.250> going<00:03:01.579> to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
and stuff coming here you're going to

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.390 
and stuff coming here you're going to
become<00:03:02.030> more<00:03:02.060> proficient<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:03.110> your<00:03:03.290> MOS<00:03:03.680> if

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
become more proficient in your MOS if

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.920 
become more proficient in your MOS if
you<00:03:04.730> don't<00:03:05.000> want<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.269> become<00:03:05.540> more<00:03:05.720> proficient

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
you don't want to become more proficient

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.690 
you don't want to become more proficient
in<00:03:06.290> your<00:03:06.500> MOS<00:03:06.890> then<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.310> probably<00:03:07.549> shouldn't

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
in your MOS then you probably shouldn't

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.540 
in your MOS then you probably shouldn't
be<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.180> infantry
