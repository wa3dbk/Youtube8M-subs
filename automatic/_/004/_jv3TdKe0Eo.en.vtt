 I lost 5 kilos 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.490
 Also Irasshaimasu I say I lost weight 15 kg at max but I'm Well 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:00.720
 That 's true though 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:06.020
 Like is it is the writing that I was successful the diet with the information that delivered brackets 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.960

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.910
 Because 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.180
 Thankfully, more than 1000 people succeeded in dieting with the information we used 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.340
 Good thing 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:22.300
 I think that there 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:23.810
 Also is it that I'm with a company in well all over the country to the people of that Kyushu but of Kyushu 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.130
 In person 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.770
 In the resort hotel, fitness club is bad among them 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.200
 there 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.100
 Well I'm sending information about the impact of too much university or such type guidance individually 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.220
 Doing 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:48.230
 What I used in it And then I myself 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:52.380
 Well put on the world of body building 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:58.980
 Well though is a lot of overseas I was out in several times tournament 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:01.560
 It is either a body fat of 10% of in front of the convention is to say that it is natural body beer as 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:08.070
 I 'm going to narrow down to a percentage 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:12.400
 There are still various ways to squeeze in that, but basically I pull out the rice 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:15.000
 And naturally become extreme and become a body builder to pull out the oil 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.680
 It is good to pull it out 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.900
 I'm doing up to what I said, but it's also clear that being healthy and honest 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:28.080
 I can not say 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:30.630
 Many of it is women in particular Eemaa men in order to lose weight the healthy Kedomo is including the person 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.910
 It is specifically what you should do 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:39.560
 We believe the Fu that I want continue to your story that 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.380
 Once saying this I easily Is because carbohydrate diet 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.680
 Ye 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:49.850
 If it is rice, bread or such sugar 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.060
 It is only said that you can eat vegetables as much 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.770
 It's not may be to eat only none meat even fish is basically 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.919
 That's why it continues 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:04.250
 The point is that diet not eat does not continue 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:06.990
 Why? It also it takes the stress in the spirit plane 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:11.190
 Muscle 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.370
 It is reduced by lack of protein 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:20.730
 It is where its results in basal metabolism has gone down 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:26.980
 It is the inside of the carbohydrate diet Torii life to you so firmly Masu will be referred to 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:27.310
 Gradually introduce a large rod from 5 to 10 kg lightly 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.550
 Hmm 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:35.969
 It can only be in the diet and it is through the training in the next 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.610
 It seems that I am doing that 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:42.379
 Last time that this 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:47.360
 It looks like around the arm in the best body channel This arm thickness 46 cm 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:48.500
 To I'm reading now 16.2cm I'm doing it is that I say way 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.590
 That's such a thing 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.340
 It is not very good to say to the general public though 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:01.169
 Because I do not ask 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:05.879
 Currently, men lose weight in visceral fat 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:11.039
 Woman dropped the risk of lifestyle-related disease or ticket of the upper arm 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:11.819
 It is aspiration , or what is the method of the back leader Yamao by the death of this back 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:17.729
 Firmly 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:20.220
 The fact that the First meal the next training in order to make the 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.070
 Is your story I 7 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.340
 I hope to start 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:31.190
 It is up to the real and lie now in the diet 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:33.610
