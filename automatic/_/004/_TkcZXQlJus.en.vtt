00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.620 
scored in the 90th minute to give us
that<00:01:23.070> win<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.610> five<00:01:24.060> foot<00:01:24.240> nine<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.600> his

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
that win but five foot nine is his

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.390 
that win but five foot nine is his
height<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.530> mentioned<00:01:25.560> before<00:01:25.890> guys<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
height so as I mentioned before guys I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.770 
height so as I mentioned before guys I
really<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.060> smaller<00:01:27.330> players<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
really do like smaller players and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.660 
really do like smaller players and
ultimate<00:01:28.080> team<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.979> move<00:01:29.130> faster<00:01:29.610> I

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
ultimate team they just move faster I

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.100 
ultimate team they just move faster I
just<00:01:29.880> think<00:01:30.030> they<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.360> into<00:01:30.570> crevices

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
just think they can get into crevices

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230 
just think they can get into crevices
that<00:01:31.229> most<00:01:31.829> normal<00:01:32.070> people<00:01:32.340> can't<00:01:32.670> or<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that most normal people can't or the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240 
that most normal people can't or the
taller<00:01:33.450> players<00:01:33.750> can't<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.200> Palacio<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.130> has

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
taller players can't so Palacio just has

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.120 
taller players can't so Palacio just has
that<00:01:35.460> exact<00:01:36.240> formula<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:36.960> me<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.229> TI<00:01:37.740> pace<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
that exact formula for me a TI pace and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.410 
that exact formula for me a TI pace and
then<00:01:38.250> being<00:01:38.400> small<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.729> his<00:01:38.880> right<00:01:39.090> foot<00:01:39.270> is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
then being small and his right foot is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.020 
then being small and his right foot is
his<00:01:39.600> prefer<00:01:39.900> foot<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.290> 90<00:01:40.890> ball<00:01:41.040> control<00:01:41.369> 92

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
his prefer foot so 90 ball control 92

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.149 
his prefer foot so 90 ball control 92

star schemas medium-low is very good a
high-low<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.920> obviously<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> best<00:02:08.610> guys<00:02:08.819> but

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
high-low is obviously the best guys but

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.550 
high-low is obviously the best guys but
medium<00:02:09.509> law<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.750> pretty<00:02:09.899> good<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.229> well<00:02:10.379> some

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
medium law is pretty good at well some

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.920 
medium law is pretty good at well some
91<00:02:10.950> acceleration<00:02:11.550> 88<00:02:12.360> reactions<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.870> then

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
91 acceleration 88 reactions and then

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.250 
91 acceleration 88 reactions and then
you<00:02:13.050> have

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you have

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.350 
you have
89<00:02:13.799> sprint<00:02:14.069> speed<00:02:14.189> he's<00:02:14.430> very<00:02:14.790> fast<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.269> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
89 sprint speed he's very fast on the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.030 
89 sprint speed he's very fast on the
ball<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:16.019> six<00:02:16.260> th<00:02:16.500> strength<00:02:16.739> right<00:02:16.860> there<00:02:16.920> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
ball and a six th strength right there I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.500 
ball and a six th strength right there I
definitely<00:02:17.489> think<00:02:17.700> he's<00:02:17.909> much<00:02:18.120> stronger<00:02:18.329> than

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
definitely think he's much stronger than

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.030 
definitely think he's much stronger than
that<00:02:18.659> you're<00:02:19.079> gonna<00:02:19.170> see<00:02:19.349> some<00:02:19.379> very<00:02:19.799> nice

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
clips of him kind of warding the

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.270
