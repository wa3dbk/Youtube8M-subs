Cleveland<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.239> one's<00:00:48.480> bigger<00:00:49.370> it's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
Cleveland is this this one's bigger it's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
Cleveland is this this one's bigger it's
a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.820> smaller<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.270> little<00:00:51.570> bit<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
a little smaller a little bit but it's a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250 
a little smaller a little bit but it's a
better<00:00:52.949> use<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.309> space<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.210> Cleveland's<00:00:55.050> kind

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
better use of space so Cleveland's kind

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.569 
better use of space so Cleveland's kind
of<00:00:55.350> chopped<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:56.010> these<00:00:56.129> little<00:00:56.309> rooms

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
of chopped up into these little rooms

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.029 
of chopped up into these little rooms
though<00:00:56.820> technically<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.260> little<00:00:58.739> smaller

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
though technically it's a little smaller

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.610 
though technically it's a little smaller
but<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.820> better<00:01:00.030> use<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.239> space<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.899> it's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
but it's a better use of space so it's

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
but it's a better use of space so it's
about<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> same<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
about the same really and what are the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.450 
about the same really and what are the
the<00:01:04.230> biggest<00:01:04.470> differences

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the biggest differences

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.790 
the biggest differences

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
there's the less roof leaks it's a more

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.410 
there's the less roof leaks it's a more
modern<00:01:17.280> building

modern building

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.179 
modern building
it's<00:01:20.060> it's<00:01:21.060> lit<00:01:21.420> better

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189

what<00:02:13.940> still<00:02:14.270> offers<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.630> challenge<00:02:15.560> factoring

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
what still offers a challenge factoring

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.270 
what still offers a challenge factoring
safety<00:02:16.700> into<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.000> all<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:18.709> know<00:02:18.800> nobody<00:02:19.130> wants

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
safety into it all you know nobody wants

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.960 
safety into it all you know nobody wants
to<00:02:19.430> get<00:02:19.580> hurt

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
to get hurt

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.360 
to get hurt
so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.360 

we<00:02:22.730> have<00:02:22.850> our<00:02:22.970> own<00:02:23.090> little<00:02:23.360> formula<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.380> then

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
we have our own little formula and then

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.640 
we have our own little formula and then
then<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.760> invited<00:02:26.030> some<00:02:26.300> pros<00:02:26.540> like<00:02:26.810> jeff

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
then I invited some pros like jeff

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.260 
then I invited some pros like jeff
lenosky<00:02:27.800> he<00:02:28.280> came<00:02:28.460> in<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.820> he<00:02:28.910> built<00:02:29.120> some

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
lenosky he came in and he built some

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.120 
lenosky he came in and he built some

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
lines in the expert section we're hoping

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.560 
lines in the expert section we're hoping
to<00:02:31.190> do<00:02:31.340> more<00:02:31.520> than<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:31.970> future<00:02:32.270> some<00:02:32.480> of

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
to do more than in the future some of

to do more than in the future some of
the<00:02:32.660> other<00:02:32.810> builders<00:02:33.710> we<00:02:34.930> are<00:02:35.930> thinking<00:02:36.260> about

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
the other builders we are thinking about

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.870 
the other builders we are thinking about
trying<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.830> figure<00:02:37.040> out<00:02:37.250> how<00:02:37.400> we<00:02:37.460> can<00:02:37.670> bring

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
trying to figure out how we can bring

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.000 
trying to figure out how we can bring
them<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.240> and<00:02:38.570> work<00:02:39.050> them<00:02:39.230> into<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.560> budget<00:02:39.890> to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
them in and work them into the budget to

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.500 
them in and work them into the budget to
bring<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.340> even<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.640> little<00:02:40.670> more<00:02:40.880> flavor<00:02:41.360> to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
bring it even a little more flavor to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.260 
bring it even a little more flavor to
the<00:02:41.660> place<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.170> make<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.680> more<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.820> entire

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
the place and make it more the entire

the place and make it more the entire

7<00:02:49.370> years<00:02:49.550> ago<00:02:49.640> right<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.810> then<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.500> guys<00:02:51.650> use

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
7 years ago right and then you guys use

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.460 
7 years ago right and then you guys use
the<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.520> summer<00:02:52.760> months<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.330> do<00:02:54.200> some

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
it cleaned up and then we kind of like

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.130 
it cleaned up and then we kind of like
flake<00:03:19.640> design<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.180> new<00:03:20.300> bike<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:20.840> like<00:03:20.960> we

designed<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.650> new<00:03:21.710> product<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.760> then<00:03:23.240> we

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
designed this new product and then we

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.720 
designed this new product and then we
have<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.510> big<00:03:23.780> party<00:03:24.200> when<00:03:24.350> we<00:03:24.470> reopen<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.130> we

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.550 
celebrate the fact that we get to ride
all<00:03:27.560> winter<00:03:27.890> right<00:03:28.640> on<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.239> how<00:03:30.200> big<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:30.530> it

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
all winter right on and how big is it

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.589 
all winter right on and how big is it
rectally<00:03:31.040> does<00:03:31.430> have<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.640> ton<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:31.970> lights<00:03:32.239> up

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599

probably<00:03:35.469> at<00:03:35.590> least<00:03:36.120> there's<00:03:37.120> like<00:03:37.390> 25<00:03:38.730> ticket

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
probably at least there's like 25 ticket

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.679 
probably at least there's like 25 ticket
jumpers<00:03:41.400> 25<00:03:42.400> mullets<00:03:43.150> which<00:03:43.359> is<00:03:43.510> like<00:03:43.659> a

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689

single-speed cross country style bike

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.500 
single-speed cross country style bike
and<00:03:46.180> then<00:03:46.749> there's<00:03:46.930> probably<00:03:47.349> 20<00:03:48.030> Mirko<00:03:49.030> BMX

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
and then there's probably 20 Mirko BMX

and then there's probably 20 Mirko BMX
planes<00:03:49.719> okay<00:03:50.879> what<00:03:51.879> is<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.209> percentage<00:03:52.900> of

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
planes okay what is the percentage of

BMX versus empty
I<00:03:56.230> would<00:03:56.530> say<00:03:56.739> it's<00:03:57.659> 70/30<00:03:58.659> in<00:03:59.500> favor<00:04:00.069> of<00:04:00.370> not<00:04:00.549> -

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
I would say it's 70/30 in favor of not -

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.770 
I would say it's 70/30 in favor of not -
oh<00:04:01.980> that's<00:04:02.980> good<00:04:03.249> for<00:04:03.489> us<00:04:03.519> what<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.599> the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
oh that's good for us what is the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.020 
oh that's good for us what is the
percentage<00:04:05.469> of<00:04:05.650> repeat<00:04:06.340> customer

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030

I<00:04:07.230> imagine<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.319> get<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.530> pretty<00:04:08.889> agree<00:04:09.700> I

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
I imagine you get a pretty agree I

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.300 
I imagine you get a pretty agree I
follow<00:04:10.569> I<00:04:10.810> don't<00:04:10.989> have<00:04:11.139> an<00:04:11.260> exact<00:04:11.680> statistic

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
follow I don't have an exact statistic

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.670 
follow I don't have an exact statistic
but<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:12.519> would<00:04:12.760> say<00:04:13.000> probably<00:04:13.469> eight<00:04:14.469> out<00:04:14.650> of
