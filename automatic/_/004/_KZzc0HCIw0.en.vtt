 Borloo network is supposed to be second tutorial 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.240
 Above all, Uhrig asked how it looks like on the SAIC block 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.809
 So percent on a dedicated server brings 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.849
 Anda CDU just percent Internet 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.619
 and 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.839
 then open 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.869
 LG or Google is made 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.789
 blockages 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.509
 so and then percent 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.119
 I can be here 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.119
 she gestured to call z go there 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.090
 and then you can get this documentation and indeed 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.730
 percent 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.040
 download hint blocked and 4 8 percent or save 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.160
 2 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.510
 to open 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.970
 so it is a few percentage on the iPad lures and that will be so 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.970
 made percent into the deal in the places sort of 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.869
 if the fat pitter and go 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.990
 though that's percent 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.870
 around c 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.690
 missing programmer 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.100
 sbm the maps 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.380
 Bomba the username and then made sure the tester was 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.100
 hardest on de sets to 9 9% on a partition 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330
 yes so I mean 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.850
 System disk does not last 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.730
 so and around 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.010
 the ground floor was for the kids 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
 CS stays and percent then easy 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.240
 checkered folder next to it would be a fame 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.400
 so did on and on Steam Tagblatt Catrin 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.750
 then you can of course still percent 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.830
 The conflict is about war 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.590
 cramming 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.610
 and other things that you associate with the competition with the scepter so 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.080
 For example, you can also get the courage or something like a fake 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.450
 everything as well then report groupwide also murder desire yet 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.450
 worked to start then we 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.159
 the thick pitter was 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.519
 and then percent 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.539
 Century goes back 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.219
 that was brave 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.019
 so start and then 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.019
 whose after contest JÃ¶rg f 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.869
 it takes Hermann h 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.869
 or 2 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.039
 so 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:28.989
 yes and then percentage PI many employers do not even own about 1200 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.419
 till 8 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.930
 Ad hoc 24 stops and is attractive 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.059

 Yes and 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:46.089
 LAN 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:48.049
 ever before Rappi 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.209
 it has changed therefore changed now 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.209
 so have to do it again 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.219
 Rank like that 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:03.999
 that's why we kick 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.719
 Poker distributes Pipa 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.549

 Kutschera wasted 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.739
 so 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.599
 and as you can see 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:21.519
 percent 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.520
 is the pressure on the stick and loses and 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.779

 Percent ratings come play expensive rebuild Euro I say make the best 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.449
 have more questions 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.860
 questionable instead of coming ground 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.120
 that is not necessary 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.660
