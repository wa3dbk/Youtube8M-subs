so to get started let's just take a look
at<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.859> right<00:00:29.070> hand<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.429> grip<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:31.289> most

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
at the right hand and grip the most

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.810 
at the right hand and grip the most
important<00:00:31.949> thing<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.369> notice<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.780> fulcrum

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
important thing to notice is the fulcrum

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.320 
important thing to notice is the fulcrum
so<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.240> people<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.230> use<00:00:37.440> this

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
so a lot of people like to use this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.150 
so a lot of people like to use this
thumb<00:00:39.330> and<00:00:39.630> forefinger<00:00:40.380> as<00:00:40.700> their<00:00:41.700> fulcrum

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
thumb and forefinger as their fulcrum

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.180 
thumb and forefinger as their fulcrum
this<00:00:44.160> middle<00:00:44.610> finger<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.210> thumb<00:00:45.620> is<00:00:46.620> also<00:00:47.040> an

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
this middle finger and thumb is also an

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.970 
this middle finger and thumb is also an
option<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.850> tend<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> use<00:00:48.630> this<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.990> lot<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.950> I

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
option I tend to use this a lot but I

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.890 
option I tend to use this a lot but I
kind<00:00:50.220> of<00:00:50.310> switch<00:00:50.550> back<00:00:50.790> and<00:00:51.000> forth<00:00:51.240> depending

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
kind of switch back and forth depending

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.960 
kind of switch back and forth depending
on<00:00:51.990> what<00:00:52.200> I'm<00:00:52.320> trying<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:53.880> you

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
want to do is pinch between the thumb

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.660 
want to do is pinch between the thumb
and<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.540> forefinger<00:00:58.010> at<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.100> place<00:00:59.430> that's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and the forefinger at a place that's

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.490 
and the forefinger at a place that's
going<00:00:59.790> to<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.060> the<00:01:00.510> fulcrum<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> stick

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
going to be the fulcrum and the stick

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.110 
going to be the fulcrum and the stick
and<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> fulcrum<00:01:02.280> means<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:02.970> this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and what the fulcrum means is that this

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.850 
and what the fulcrum means is that this
is<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> place<00:01:03.660> where<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> stick<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
is the place where the stick is going to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.350 
is the place where the stick is going to
get<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.129> most<00:01:05.309> rebound<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
get the most rebound and is going to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.640 
get the most rebound and is going to
have<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.630> best<00:01:07.340> balancing<00:01:08.340> point<00:01:09.470> with<00:01:10.470> this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
have the best balancing point with this

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.520 
have the best balancing point with this
right<00:01:10.920> handed<00:01:11.250> grip<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.240> fulcrum<00:01:12.810> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
right handed grip and this fulcrum you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.680 
right handed grip and this fulcrum you
can<00:01:13.740> pinch<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.670> first<00:01:15.000> joint<00:01:15.420> right<00:01:15.630> here

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
can pinch in this first joint right here

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.130 
can pinch in this first joint right here
and<00:01:16.640> really<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.760> a<00:01:17.820> nice<00:01:18.030> tight<00:01:18.510> grip<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:19.080> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
and really get a nice tight grip if you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.800 
and really get a nice tight grip if you
want<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:20.700> me<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> be<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> little<00:01:21.690> bit

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
want to for me I like to be a little bit

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
want to for me I like to be a little bit
more<00:01:21.930> relaxed<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.680> actually<00:01:22.980> kind<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.520> roll

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
more relaxed so I actually kind of roll

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.760 
more relaxed so I actually kind of roll
the<00:01:24.210> stick<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.480> little<00:01:24.600> bit<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.230> pinch<00:01:25.500> more

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the stick a little bit and I pinch more

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.420 
the stick a little bit and I pinch more
between<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:27.090> part<00:01:27.480> of<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:28.620> finger<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
between this part of the finger and the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.719 
between this part of the finger and the
thumb<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:31.080> now<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.710> does<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.370> creates

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
thumb and now what that does is creates

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.120 
thumb and now what that does is creates
a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.150> space<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.620> got<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> nice

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
a lot of space in here so you got a nice

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.360 
a lot of space in here so you got a nice
open<00:01:35.909> sound<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.840> nice<00:01:37.020> loose<00:01:37.409> grip<00:01:37.920> if

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
open sound and a nice loose grip if

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.830 
open sound and a nice loose grip if
you're<00:01:38.550> clamping<00:01:38.970> down<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.390> stick<00:01:39.630> too

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you're clamping down on the stick too

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.080 
you're clamping down on the stick too
much<00:01:40.110> you're<00:01:40.740> gonna<00:01:40.800> get<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.070> choke<00:01:41.370> sound<00:01:41.760> and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
much you're gonna get a choke sound and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
much you're gonna get a choke sound and
you're<00:01:42.270> also<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> tense<00:01:43.620> up<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.159> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you're also going to tense up here in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.039 
you're also going to tense up here in
your<00:01:44.430> arm<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.390> create<00:01:45.510> a<00:01:45.750> lot<00:01:46.020> of

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
your arm and this can create a lot of

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.550 
your arm and this can create a lot of
tension<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.909> damage<00:01:47.909> down<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.870> road<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.470> you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
tension and damage down the road so you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.410 
tension and damage down the road so you
might<00:01:49.710> want<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.280> avoid<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.270> pay

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
might want to avoid that and pay

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.120 
might want to avoid that and pay
attention<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:52.020> you're<00:01:52.170> doing<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.650> don't

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
attention to what you're doing and don't

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.360 
attention to what you're doing and don't
grip<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.790> stick<00:01:54.120> too<00:01:54.390> hard<00:01:55.130> once<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.280> have

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
grip the stick too hard once you have

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.399 
grip the stick too hard once you have
your<00:01:56.490> fulcrum<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.210> place<00:01:57.570> at<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:58.020> proper

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
your fulcrum in place at the proper

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.710 
your fulcrum in place at the proper
balancing<00:01:58.979> point<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> stick<00:01:59.700> which<00:02:00.570> is

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
balancing point of the stick which is

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.160 
balancing point of the stick which is
about<00:02:00.960> 1/3<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> way<00:02:01.830> through<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.250> stick

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
about 1/3 of the way through the stick

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.390 
about 1/3 of the way through the stick
you're<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.350> want<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> wrap<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.040> fingers

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
you're going to want to wrap the fingers

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.890 
you're going to want to wrap the fingers
around<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.119> don't<00:02:06.210> want<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.420> wrap<00:02:06.600> too

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
around and you don't want to wrap too

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.499 
around and you don't want to wrap too
hard<00:02:07.260> but<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.190> want<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.640> gently<00:02:09.179> wrap

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
hard but you want to just gently wrap

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.969 
hard but you want to just gently wrap
the<00:02:09.659> fingers<00:02:09.959> around<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:10.769> can

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the fingers around so that they can

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.099 
the fingers around so that they can
support<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.969> stick<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.450> they<00:02:12.719> can<00:02:12.900> also

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.109 
support the stick and they can also

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.860 
support the stick and they can also
distribute<00:02:13.769> some<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.400> workload<00:02:14.870> amongst

kind of approach another common grip is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.000 
kind of approach another common grip is
the<00:02:33.090> French<00:02:33.420> grip<00:02:33.720> which<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.440> where<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.800> roll

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the hand over a little bit and then

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.320 
the hand over a little bit and then
you're<00:02:37.230> getting<00:02:37.380> more<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.860> thumb<00:02:38.190> up<00:02:38.400> type

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
of approach and this was generally used

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.590 
of approach and this was generally used
for<00:02:43.050> more<00:02:43.350> timpani<00:02:43.980> type<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.790> playing<00:02:45.060> but

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
wrapping around to support it this is a

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.400 
wrapping around to support it this is a
really<00:06:11.220> brief<00:06:11.460> overview<00:06:12.120> on<00:06:12.150> grips<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:12.930> you

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
really brief overview on grips and you

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.350 
really brief overview on grips and you
can<00:06:13.560> learn<00:06:13.770> a<00:06:14.070> lot<00:06:14.370> more<00:06:14.430> about<00:06:14.669> these<00:06:15.120> by

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
can learn a lot more about these by

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.029 
can learn a lot more about these by
studying<00:06:15.720> with<00:06:15.900> a<00:06:15.930> teacher<00:06:16.199> and<00:06:16.590> check<00:06:16.770> it<00:06:16.919> out

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
studying with a teacher and check it out

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.219 
studying with a teacher and check it out
maybe<00:06:17.580> the<00:06:17.820> fresh<00:06:18.030> approach<00:06:18.360> to<00:06:18.599> snare<00:06:18.870> drum

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
maybe the fresh approach to snare drum

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.260 
maybe the fresh approach to snare drum
so<00:06:19.919> I<00:06:19.949> would<00:06:20.220> highly<00:06:20.520> recommend<00:06:20.550> checking

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
so I would highly recommend checking

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.580 
so I would highly recommend checking
some<00:06:21.539> of<00:06:21.570> these<00:06:21.720> things<00:06:21.930> out<00:06:22.139> and<00:06:22.169> spending

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
some of these things out and spending

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.070 
some of these things out and spending
some<00:06:22.680> time<00:06:22.740> there's<00:06:23.520> no<00:06:23.729> real<00:06:23.970> right<00:06:24.419> way<00:06:24.780> or

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
some time there's no real right way or

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.900 
some time there's no real right way or
wrong<00:06:25.110> way<00:06:25.349> to<00:06:25.680> do<00:06:25.889> any<00:06:26.070> of<00:06:26.250> this<00:06:26.460> it's<00:06:26.760> all

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
wrong way to do any of this it's all

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.969 
wrong way to do any of this it's all
about<00:06:27.120> what<00:06:27.360> works<00:06:27.630> for<00:06:27.780> you<00:06:28.139> so<00:06:28.620> you'll<00:06:28.800> see<00:06:28.949> a

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
about what works for you so you'll see a

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.260 
about what works for you so you'll see a
lot<00:06:29.190> of<00:06:29.220> people<00:06:29.520> playing<00:06:29.970> with<00:06:30.150> different

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
them so experiment try different things

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.130 
them so experiment try different things
and<00:06:36.900> figure<00:06:37.080> out<00:06:37.229> what<00:06:37.500> works<00:06:37.620> for<00:06:37.800> you
