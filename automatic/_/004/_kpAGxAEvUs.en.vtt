294 kit from on Frodo and here it is
it's<00:00:11.710> the<00:00:11.920> most<00:00:12.280> robust<00:00:12.880> system<00:00:13.870> in<00:00:14.080> the<00:00:14.500> 290

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
it's the most robust system in the 290

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.849 
it's the most robust system in the 290
series<00:00:15.400> it's<00:00:15.730> all<00:00:16.000> aluminum<00:00:16.409> made<00:00:17.409> in<00:00:17.560> Italy

series it's all aluminum made in Italy
the<00:00:18.189> whole<00:00:18.369> system<00:00:18.820> here<00:00:19.089> and<00:00:19.269> let's<00:00:20.259> just

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
the whole system here and let's just

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.899 
the whole system here and let's just
take<00:00:20.619> a<00:00:20.679> look<00:00:20.919> first<00:00:21.189> at<00:00:21.489> the<00:00:22.199> three<00:00:23.199> section

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:23.909

ahead and bring those back in or we can
just<00:00:33.640> quick<00:00:33.789> release<00:00:34.090> one<00:00:34.539> single<00:00:34.989> stage<00:00:35.230> if

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
just quick release one single stage if

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.130 
just quick release one single stage if
we<00:00:35.530> want<00:00:35.739> to<00:00:35.920> very<00:00:36.579> very<00:00:36.670> easily<00:00:37.059> put<00:00:37.989> that

we want to very very easily put that
back<00:00:38.350> on<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.620> table<00:00:39.870> now<00:00:40.870> there<00:00:41.260> are<00:00:41.500> little

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
back on the table now there are little

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.250 
back on the table now there are little
latches<00:00:42.489> here<00:00:42.820> at<00:00:43.149> the<00:00:43.359> top<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.840> system

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
latches here at the top of the system

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.939 
latches here at the top of the system
and<00:00:44.679> if<00:00:45.190> I<00:00:45.339> just<00:00:45.670> take<00:00:46.300> this<00:00:46.359> leg<00:00:46.839> in<00:00:47.079> I<00:00:47.320> can

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
and if I just take this leg in I can

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.119 
and if I just take this leg in I can
adjust<00:00:48.579> those<00:00:48.850> latches<00:00:49.120> I<00:00:49.600> can<00:00:50.260> fully<00:00:50.589> extend

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
adjust those latches I can fully extend

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.639 
adjust those latches I can fully extend
this<00:00:51.309> out<00:00:51.579> so<00:00:52.329> I<00:00:52.359> can<00:00:52.570> get<00:00:52.719> extremely<00:00:53.469> low

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
this out so I can get extremely low

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.060 
this out so I can get extremely low

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
tripod I have an adjustable column if I

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.090 
tripod I have an adjustable column if I
extend<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.720> all<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.110> way<00:01:38.200> up<00:01:38.230> and<00:01:38.650> extend

extend that all the way up and extend

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.590 
extend that all the way up and extend
the<00:01:39.220> legs<00:01:39.460> all<00:01:39.730> the<00:01:39.760> way<00:01:39.880> up<00:01:40.000> in<00:01:40.330> this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
the legs all the way up in this

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.810 
the legs all the way up in this
configuration<00:01:40.960> we're<00:01:41.710> getting<00:01:42.040> up<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.550> about

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
configuration we're getting up to about

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.910 
configuration we're getting up to about
70<00:01:43.450> 71<00:01:43.900> inches<00:01:44.230> off<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.830> ground<00:01:46.920> payload

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
70 71 inches off of the ground payload

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.700 
70 71 inches off of the ground payload
capacity<00:01:48.550> about<00:01:49.300> 11<00:01:49.900> pounds<00:01:50.350> with<00:01:50.500> this

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
capacity about 11 pounds with this

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.370 
capacity about 11 pounds with this
system<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.340> really<00:01:52.090> really<00:01:52.300> flexible<00:01:52.630> now<00:01:53.170> one

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
system so really really flexible now one

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.230 
system so really really flexible now one
other<00:01:53.470> thing<00:01:53.620> this<00:01:54.130> center<00:01:54.430> column<00:01:54.700> here<00:01:55.120> is

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
other thing this center column here is

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.930 
other thing this center column here is
reversible<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:56.560> we<00:01:56.710> want<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.010> use<00:01:57.190> this<00:01:57.430> system

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
reversible so we want to use this system

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.260 
reversible so we want to use this system
for<00:01:58.390> things<00:01:58.600> like<00:01:58.690> macro<00:01:59.200> work<00:01:59.470> and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
for things like macro work and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.760 
for things like macro work and
when<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.659> those<00:02:00.810> legs<00:02:01.109> all<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.469> down

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
when we get those legs all the way down

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.469 
when we get those legs all the way down
if<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.070> want<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.399> some<00:02:02.609> really<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.270> low

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
if we want to do some really really low

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.569 
if we want to do some really really low
angle<00:02:03.810> shots<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.740> reverse<00:02:05.039> this<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.490> with

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
angle shots we can reverse this and with

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.399 
angle shots we can reverse this and with
a<00:02:05.640> three-way<00:02:06.030> head<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.509> makes<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.869> very<00:02:07.079> very

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
a three-way head that makes it very very

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.469 
a three-way head that makes it very very
simple<00:02:07.859> so<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> center<00:02:09.269> column

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
simple so here we have the center column

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.900 
simple so here we have the center column
reversed<00:02:09.929> great<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.560> macro<00:02:10.950> work<00:02:11.190> we're<00:02:11.700> also

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
reversed great for macro work we're also

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.479 
reversed great for macro work we're also
taking<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.660> tripod<00:02:13.140> itself<00:02:13.440> these<00:02:13.950> two<00:02:14.220> legs

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
taking the tripod itself these two legs

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.580 
taking the tripod itself these two legs
are<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.849> first<00:02:15.000> position<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:16.050> one's<00:02:16.379> in

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
are in the first position this one's in

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.190 
are in the first position this one's in
the<00:02:16.680> second<00:02:17.129> gives<00:02:17.700> us<00:02:17.879> maximum<00:02:18.200> flexibility

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
the second gives us maximum flexibility

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.530 
the second gives us maximum flexibility
when<00:02:19.440> we're<00:02:19.560> shooting<00:02:19.890> with<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.160> system

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
when we're shooting with this system

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.940 
when we're shooting with this system
tons<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.810> tons<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.110> stuff<00:02:22.379> that<00:02:22.530> we<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:22.769> do

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
tons and tons of stuff that we can do

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.620 
tons and tons of stuff that we can do
with<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.610> 294<00:02:24.239> kit<00:02:24.540> from<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.379> frog
