 boil a couple of minutes in sweet syrup 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.609
 two parts sugar and one part water 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.920
 if you are not a supporter of sugar substitutes 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.080
 worth their cluster of mischief by this you mess up 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.930
 dish want to make an exception and 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.300
 make it sugar you need

 send everything to the blender bowl 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.520
 you can cook a little while 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.620
 back up by the way try a minimum 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.840
 You can immediately determine how much 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.079
 sugar you need to torpedoes not 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.730
 turned out very sweet add here 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.730
 little nickname 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.160
 alcohol will make the dessert taste a little bit 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.160
 richer than a little lemon juice 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.450
 nasty bones and sugar to taste 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.970
 weapons at the ready 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.000
 check to keep the whole number 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.000
 cubes 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.040
 Sorbet can be stored in ceramic 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.380
 dishes from 10 to 14 days 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.200
 but for so long hide it yummy 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.250
 crimes after three hours of his 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.250
 can be served 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.250
 in the meantime, the sorbet will be in my freezer 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.580
 cooking time will appear 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.490
 main course my guests are from ted and 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.399
 so you want to cook for them not 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.369
 what is seemingly simple and us 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.369
 Zelenka I think it might be chicken but 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:14.170
 with a secret this secret is smoked bacon i 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.170
 add it a little bit where piquancy 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.140
 main course i will cook chicken fillet 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.140
 with bacon to start fillets need to be washed 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.250
 fillet will be much tastier if before 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.689
 cooking it dry with a napkin 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.180
 for this procedure 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.219
 peppermint thanks in on tender and crisp 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.189
 a crust of our filled 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:45.040
 make beautiful even bits of lumps 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:48.209
 you can feed the neighbors to there meat 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.209
 be sure to salt 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.750
 interface and wrap slices of bacon 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.450
 bacon meat with layers of fat from the side 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.060
 parts back of the carcass first its salts 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.239
 then smoked high-calorie others 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.709
 our ingredients are low calorie 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.870
 optimal balance of calories in general 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.819
 set off so that the bacon slices are not 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.700
 collapsed the process of cooking them 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.980
 need to wind up culinary thread what is 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.340
 culinary vit goes for you probably 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.400
 also 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.019
 so we will use there usually 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.819
 the process is not very simple but interesting 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:29.459
 poison long thread fold it in half 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.870
 find both ends and double down 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:38.340
 tie a knot at one end 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.890
 loop the finger and twist 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.280
 the most interesting at the end and . will twist 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:49.220
 itself obtained almost culinary thread 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.750
 you need to wrap the fillet in bacon 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.730
 our fillet will be prepared in two stages 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.019
 first I'll fry it a little on 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.739
 dota 2 frying pan 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.500
 and then bake in the oven for another 10-12 minutes 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.209
 first I will prepare the oven for you 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.209
 will need 180 degrees 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.640
 do not forget to get something later 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:15.650
 don't do like that heated pan 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.430
 add a little sunflower oil and 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.430
 send our meat there 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.480
 fry until concrete 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.480
 a crust will appear 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.740
 so that the meat is not the butt top menu bed 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.800
 his 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.690
 guests from cooking foil yet 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.340
 it will reduce your work you don't have to 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:47.530
 wash pan flavor is already divine 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.530
 carefully lay out the fillet on the foil and 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.920
 send in the oven 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.270
 remember 10 and 12 minutes 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.389
 will it not 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.080
 and while the fillet is cooked I will make a salad 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.729
 for salad I'll take Peking cabbage and 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:15.699
 Bulgarian pepper red and yellow 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:15.699
 colors as if cut into thin straws 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:28.269
 until I cook myself, I donâ€™t like that 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:32.019
 parts of the door most 

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:32.019
 nasty little bones 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.140
 only three ingredients and the salad is very 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.210
 juicy and beautiful vegetables can be cut 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.880
 any way convenient for you 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.360
 I like some neat little 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.830
 slices salad is almost ready you need it 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.870
 salt a little pepper and add 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.300
 olive oil before do a little 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.580
 later before serving the main guests so as not to 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.600
 juice stack last detail of my dinner 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.600
 ginger lemonade 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.070
 he will need some lemon juice 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.770
 if you have a difference just divide 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.930
 lemon in two and squeeze the juice 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:18.070
 Sorry I wo n't wake up so I 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.070
 peel lemons 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.940
 finely chopped 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.940
 grind blender 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.770
 to get the juice, you can filter 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.770
 the resulting mass through a sieve 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:48.759
 if the mass is dense enough take 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.639
 scoop and help lemon help 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:53.039
 lemon, add our lemonade a little bit 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:56.970
 spice 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.970
 ginger can not peel 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:01.560
 heat up some water in the pot 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:13.280
 when water boils pour into it 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.280
 lemon juice 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:34.199
 ginger and 200 grams of sugar give lemonade 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.680
 brew for another 5 minutes but not longer 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:39.300
 chamber can give bitterness 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.310
 when lemonade needed it 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.000
 pour some other capacity 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.000
 through a sieve 

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.500
 let it cool and put a fridge 

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.500
 about an hour 

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:05.719
 and
