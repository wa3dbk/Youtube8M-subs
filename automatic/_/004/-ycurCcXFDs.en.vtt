00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
I'd be careful for those ones because
obviously<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.480> at<00:01:03.600> long<00:01:03.750> range

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
obviously they can get you at long range

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.750 
obviously they can get you at long range

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
but this was a very fun mission to try

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.730 
but this was a very fun mission to try
it<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.939> especially<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.900> again<00:01:07.470> some

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740

B's<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.360> did<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:09.900> an

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
B's and what we did is that I'm an

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
insane first person and treated it like

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.420 
insane first person and treated it like
maybe<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> nazi<00:01:13.590> zombies<00:01:13.979> type<00:01:14.159> thing

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
maybe like a nazi zombies type thing

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.340 
maybe like a nazi zombies type thing
this<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.390> fun<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.720> play<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.229> did

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this was really fun to play and I did

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.530 
this was really fun to play and I did
enjoy<00:01:16.500> playing<00:01:16.860> into<00:01:17.220> zombies<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.820> did<00:01:18.330> have

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
enjoy playing into zombies I did have

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.990 
enjoy playing into zombies I did have
the<00:01:18.750> settings<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> was<00:01:19.860> fast<00:01:20.189> because

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the settings so that it was fast because

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.359 
the settings so that it was fast because
I<00:01:21.030> feel<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.650> your<00:01:23.040> weapon

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
I feel that if you have all your weapon

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.890 
I feel that if you have all your weapon
from<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> beginning<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.150> too<00:01:24.299> easy<00:01:24.330> because

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
from the beginning it's too easy because

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.990 
from the beginning it's too easy because
you<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.369> use<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.759> soul

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you know you can just use all your soul

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090 
you know you can just use all your soul
rifles<00:01:27.420> RPGs<00:01:27.990> things<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
rifles RPGs things like that so I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
rifles RPGs things like that so I
recommend<00:01:29.729> putting<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.000> force<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.780> then

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
recommend putting on force because then

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.660 
recommend putting on force because then
it<00:01:31.049> gives<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> pistol<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> gives<00:01:32.549> you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
it gives you a pistol and it gives you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.880 
it gives you a pistol and it gives you
more<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.170> zombies<00:01:34.170> theme<00:01:34.380> from<00:01:34.680> Call
