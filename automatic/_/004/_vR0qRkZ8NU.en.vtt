00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
using so far um peas definitely got a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.819 
using so far um peas definitely got a
lot<00:00:32.430> more<00:00:32.489> kick<00:00:32.820> than<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.149> didn't<00:00:33.360> mw2<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
lot more kick than it didn't mw2 but a

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.119 
lot more kick than it didn't mw2 but a
scar<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.540> now<00:00:36.719> more<00:00:37.469> extended<00:00:37.829> mag

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
scar with this now more extended mag

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.530 
scar with this now more extended mag
compared<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> mw2<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.719> lot<00:00:40.050> better<00:00:41.149> mp5<00:00:42.149> it

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
compared to mw2 is a lot better mp5 it

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.540 
compared to mw2 is a lot better mp5 it
definitely<00:00:43.350> feels<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.280> call<00:00:44.460> of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
definitely feels a bit like the call of

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.540 
definitely feels a bit like the call of
duty<00:00:44.579> 4<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:45.180> oh<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.899> say<00:00:46.050> totally<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:46.890> it

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
duty 4 on oh and say totally but it

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.020 
duty 4 on oh and say totally but it
definitely<00:00:47.789> there's<00:00:48.270> resemblance<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
definitely there's resemblance and the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.410 
definitely there's resemblance and the
was<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.420> 16<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.410> one<00:00:52.620> sniper<00:00:53.149> l16<00:00:54.149> nameless

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
was it the 16 a one sniper l16 nameless

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.549 
was it the 16 a one sniper l16 nameless
night<00:00:54.600> where<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.780> can't<00:00:55.020> remember<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.410> now

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
night where I can't remember right now

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.560 
night where I can't remember right now
but<00:00:55.920> that's<00:00:56.610> definitely<00:00:56.820> goes<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> lot<00:00:57.360> like

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
but that's definitely goes a lot like

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.000 
but that's definitely goes a lot like
that<00:00:57.600> 40<00:00:58.399> like<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> lot<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:02.399> maps<00:01:02.699> there<00:01:04.010> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
guess they're all right the maps off the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.960 
guess they're all right the maps off the
top<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:08.760> head<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.540> our<00:01:09.990> bootleg

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970

village and underground though I'd say

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.109 
village and underground though I'd say
my<00:01:25.500> biggest<00:01:25.650> gripe<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.670> game<00:01:26.880> right

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
my biggest gripe about the game right

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.410 
my biggest gripe about the game right
now<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.340> server<00:01:29.340> connection<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:30.090> least<00:01:30.299> on

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
now is the server connection at least on

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.980 
now is the server connection at least on
ps3<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.200> been<00:01:31.439> really<00:01:32.070> bad<00:01:32.340> lately<00:01:32.400> or<00:01:33.329> it's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
ps3 it's been really bad lately or it's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.780 
ps3 it's been really bad lately or it's
not<00:01:34.170> lately<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.619> since<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> game<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.610> came

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
not lately but since the game just came

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.670 
not lately but since the game just came
out<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.299> been<00:01:36.479> bad<00:01:36.750> since<00:01:36.810> released<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
out but it's been bad since released I

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.840 
out but it's been bad since released I
took<00:01:38.369> me<00:01:38.579> forever<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.240> into<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> game<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.590> me

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
took me forever to get into a game to me

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.690 
took me forever to get into a game to me
like<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.290> 15<00:01:43.680> minutes<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> actually<00:01:44.250> get

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
like and the 15 minutes to actually get

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.800 
like and the 15 minutes to actually get
into<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.030> game<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:47.070> other<00:01:47.270> kind<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.420> big<00:01:48.540> thing

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
into a game the other kind of big thing

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660 
into a game the other kind of big thing
is<00:01:49.049> I've<00:01:49.500> been<00:01:49.619> seeing<00:01:49.920> some<00:01:50.130> frame<00:01:50.430> with

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
is I've been seeing some frame with

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.300 
is I've been seeing some frame with
great<00:01:50.909> problems<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.899> guess<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.740> might<00:01:53.130> be

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
great problems I guess that might be

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.819 
great problems I guess that might be
because<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> lag<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.560> it's<00:01:55.560> definitely

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
because of the lag but it's definitely

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.810 
because of the lag but it's definitely
pretty<00:01:56.130> annoying<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.700> deal<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:58.049> for

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
pretty annoying to deal with as for

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.660 
pretty annoying to deal with as for
killstreaks<00:02:00.820> they're<00:02:02.280> pretty<00:02:03.280> good<00:02:03.430> yeah

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
killstreaks they're pretty good yeah

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.760 
killstreaks they're pretty good yeah
actually<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.450> air<00:02:04.570> support<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.290> definitely

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
actually the air support it's definitely

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.090 
actually the air support it's definitely
really<00:02:05.920> good<00:02:07.380> doesn't<00:02:08.380> really<00:02:08.500> matter<00:02:08.740> that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
really good doesn't really matter that

I can't really make a judgment call as
far<00:03:30.760> as<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:31.000> goes<00:03:31.060> but<00:03:31.829> based<00:03:32.829> on<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.250> size

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
far as that goes but based on the size

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.590 
far as that goes but based on the size
and<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.760> maps<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:35.760> don't<00:03:36.760> know<00:03:36.850> if<00:03:36.970> it'll<00:03:37.120> be<00:03:37.209> a

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
and the maps I don't know if it'll be a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.530 
and the maps I don't know if it'll be a
huge<00:03:38.049> problem<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:39.640> map<00:03:39.880> right<00:03:40.090> here<00:03:40.120> don't

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
huge problem this map right here don't

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.210 
huge problem this map right here don't
definitely<00:03:41.140> has<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.440> lot<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.560> stuff<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:41.950> hide

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
definitely has a lot of stuff to hide

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.430 
definitely has a lot of stuff to hide
behind<00:03:42.400> which<00:03:42.820> is<00:03:43.110> kind<00:03:44.110> of<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.260> problem<00:03:44.769> I

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
behind which is kind of a problem I

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.990 
behind which is kind of a problem I
guess<00:03:47.440> there's<00:03:47.890> definitely<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.310> few<00:03:48.610> camping

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
guess there's definitely a few camping

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.140 
guess there's definitely a few camping
spots<00:03:49.299> per<00:03:49.660> man<00:03:49.870> but<00:03:50.459> for<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.579> most<00:03:51.730> part<00:03:51.880> I'd

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
spots per man but for the most part I'd

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.500 
spots per man but for the most part I'd
say<00:03:52.360> they're<00:03:52.739> pretty<00:03:53.739> good<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.370> can

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
say they're pretty good and you can

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.990 
say they're pretty good and you can
easily<00:03:55.510> pick<00:03:55.959> out<00:03:56.140> all<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.470> spots<00:03:56.760> let's<00:03:57.760> say

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
easily pick out all the spots let's say

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.280 
easily pick out all the spots let's say
another<00:03:58.269> thing<00:03:58.360> worth<00:03:58.660> mentioning

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
another thing worth mentioning

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.160 
another thing worth mentioning
is<00:03:59.439> the<00:04:00.159> gun<00:04:00.760> proficiencies<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.750> had

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
is the gun proficiencies I had

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.660 
is the gun proficiencies I had
originally<00:04:02.950> not<00:04:03.340> really<00:04:05.400> given<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.430> much

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
originally not really given that much

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.290 
there's a lot of people that have had
the<00:05:02.020> game<00:05:02.199> already<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:02.860> know<00:05:03.610> how<00:05:03.760> to<00:05:03.789> use<00:05:03.940> the

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
the game already and know how to use the

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.080 
the game already and know how to use the
method<00:05:04.659> go<00:05:05.080> about<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.530> maps<00:05:05.740> but<00:05:06.580> you<00:05:06.909> don't

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.240 
method go about the maps but you don't
yet<00:05:07.360> so<00:05:07.659> it's<00:05:07.930> better<00:05:08.139> to<00:05:08.409> keep<00:05:08.590> it<00:05:08.830> more

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
yet so it's better to keep it more

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.330 
yet so it's better to keep it more
cautious<00:05:09.789> than<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.120> is<00:05:10.270> to<00:05:10.930> go<00:05:11.199> guns<00:05:11.830> blazing

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
cautious than it is to go guns blazing

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.279 
cautious than it is to go guns blazing
