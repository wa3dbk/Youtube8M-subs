can tell they are foldable so this is

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.540 
can tell they are foldable so this is
what<00:02:24.660> they<00:02:24.750> look<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.170> very<00:02:25.680> very<00:02:25.800> nice<00:02:26.190> high

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
gloss look very sleek and you've also

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.970 
gloss look very sleek and you've also
got<00:02:29.580> noise<00:02:30.270> cancellation<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.380> here<00:02:31.620> as<00:02:31.740> well

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
got noise cancellation in here as well

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.920 
got noise cancellation in here as well
which<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.220> absolutely<00:02:32.910> great<00:02:33.210> so<00:02:33.780> that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
which is absolutely great so that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.330 
which is absolutely great so that
basically<00:02:34.110> means<00:02:34.380> guys<00:02:34.770> if<00:02:34.950> you're<00:02:35.070> not<00:02:35.160> sure

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
basically means guys if you're not sure

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.250 
basically means guys if you're not sure
what<00:02:35.460> noise<00:02:35.610> cancellation<00:02:36.330> means<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.780> it

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
what noise cancellation means is that it

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.930 
what noise cancellation means is that it
takes<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.590> noise<00:02:37.770> from<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> outside<00:02:38.460> world

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
takes a noise from the outside world

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.120 
takes a noise from the outside world
it<00:02:39.210> basically<00:02:39.990> directs<00:02:40.470> different<00:02:40.890> sound

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
it basically directs different sound

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.040 
it basically directs different sound
waves<00:02:41.340> into<00:02:41.700> your<00:02:41.850> ear<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.600> sounds<00:02:42.990> like

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
waves into your ear so it sounds like

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.110 
waves into your ear so it sounds like
you<00:02:43.560> can't<00:02:43.800> hear<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.520> outside<00:02:44.880> world

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
you can't hear the outside world

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.340 
you can't hear the outside world
basically<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.960> nice<00:02:46.080> bit<00:02:46.320> of

basically so it's a nice bit of
technology<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.100> here<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.880> let's<00:02:48.030> take<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.210> look

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
technology in here so let's take a look

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.000 
technology in here so let's take a look

just<00:04:06.480> generally<00:04:06.960> audio<00:04:07.500> quality<00:04:07.940> so<00:04:08.940> these

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
just generally audio quality so these

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.420 
just generally audio quality so these
range<00:04:09.390> for<00:04:09.630> around<00:04:09.840> about<00:04:10.020> 65<00:04:10.830> pounds<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.340> the
