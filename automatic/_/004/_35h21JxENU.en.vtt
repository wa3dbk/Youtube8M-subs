well is if I just pull up this one if

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.930 
well is if I just pull up this one if
you<00:01:59.590> remember<00:01:59.920> this<00:01:59.950> one<00:02:00.280> from<00:02:00.400> a<00:02:00.520> couple<00:02:00.820> of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
you remember this one from a couple of

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.330 
you remember this one from a couple of
months<00:02:01.060> ago<00:02:01.590> let<00:02:02.590> me<00:02:02.650> find<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.980> on<00:02:03.100> button

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
months ago let me find the on button

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.140 
months ago let me find the on button
here<00:02:03.700> there<00:02:04.420> we<00:02:04.660> go<00:02:04.870> no<00:02:05.140> that's<00:02:05.440> not<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:06.150> maybe

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
here there we go no that's not it maybe

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.669 
here there we go no that's not it maybe
this<00:02:07.330> one's<00:02:07.540> not<00:02:07.690> charged<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.560> is

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
this one's not charged so this is

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.510 
this one's not charged so this is
actually<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.190> acer<00:02:09.700> liquid<00:02:10.420> s1<00:02:10.869> so<00:02:11.800> this<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.220> a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
actually the acer liquid s1 so this is a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.960 
actually the acer liquid s1 so this is a
5.7<00:02:13.320> inch<00:02:14.320> phablet<00:02:14.680> from<00:02:15.040> answer<00:02:15.340> also

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
5.7 inch phablet from answer also

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.270 
5.7 inch phablet from answer also
running<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.420> MediaTek<00:02:17.020> processor<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.160> can

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
running a MediaTek processor so you can

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.250 
running a MediaTek processor so you can
see<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.490> acer<00:02:19.000> has<00:02:19.030> maintained<00:02:19.720> basically

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
see that acer has maintained basically

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.470 
see that acer has maintained basically
the<00:02:20.410> same<00:02:20.590> size<00:02:20.920> profile<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.760> let's<00:02:22.270> check

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
the same size profile and let's check

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.580 
the same size profile and let's check
out<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.660> thickness<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:25.200> basically<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.410> same

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
out the thickness and basically the same

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.860 
out the thickness and basically the same
thickness<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.310> their<00:02:27.970> tablet<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.630> other

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
thickness on their tablet or other

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.460 
thickness on their tablet or other
fabulous<00:02:29.170> sorry<00:02:29.770> even<00:02:30.340> though<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:30.760> one<00:02:31.000> is

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
fabulous sorry even though this one is

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.620 
fabulous sorry even though this one is
5.7<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.680> one<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.040> six<00:02:33.550> inches<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.420> now<00:02:34.540> if

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
5.7 in this one is six inches so now if

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.740 
5.7 in this one is six inches so now if
we<00:02:34.750> bring<00:02:35.200> up<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:36.070> xperia<00:02:36.580> z<00:02:36.820> ultra<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:37.630> can

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
we bring up the xperia z ultra you can

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.210 
we bring up the xperia z ultra you can
see<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:37.930> there<00:02:38.200> definitely<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.770> height

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
see that there definitely is a height

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.210 
see that there definitely is a height
difference<00:02:39.250> there<00:02:40.060> but<00:02:40.810> all<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:41.920> all<00:02:42.010> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
difference there but all in all the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.199 
difference there but all in all the
thickness<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.680> different<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.670> the

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
thickness is different and so is the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.970 
thickness is different and so is the
width<00:02:46.600> let's<00:02:46.959> just<00:02:47.050> stuck<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.590> top<00:02:47.800> so

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
width let's just stuck that on top so

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.430 
width let's just stuck that on top so
you<00:02:48.040> can<00:02:48.130> see<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.489> little<00:02:48.700> bit<00:02:48.790> clearer<00:02:49.440> so

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
you can see that a little bit clearer so

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.640 
you can see that a little bit clearer so
there<00:02:50.590> we<00:02:50.800> go<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.360> z<00:02:52.660> ultra<00:02:53.020> definitely<00:02:53.470> is

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
there we go so the z ultra definitely is

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.150 
there we go so the z ultra definitely is
a<00:02:53.890> much<00:02:54.400> bigger<00:02:54.730> device<00:02:55.330> but<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.380> also<00:02:56.620> is<00:02:56.800> a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
a much bigger device but it also is a

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.759 
a much bigger device but it also is a
lot<00:02:57.640> thinner<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.350> has<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.530> been<00:02:59.620> a

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
lot thinner so this has just been a

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.470 
lot thinner so this has just been a
quick<00:03:00.010> look<00:03:00.160> at<00:03:00.280> what<00:03:00.310> acer<00:03:00.730> has<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:01.060> offer<00:03:01.239> it

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
quick look at what acer has to offer it

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.960 
quick look at what acer has to offer it
