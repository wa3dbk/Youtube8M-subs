but<00:00:16.500> let's<00:00:16.680> start<00:00:16.920> with<00:00:17.070> an<00:00:17.190> easy<00:00:17.369> one<00:00:17.580> up<00:00:18.300> here

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
but let's start with an easy one up here

in the 39 this happens to be an m5 I

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.670 
in the 39 this happens to be an m5 I
think<00:00:20.939> they're<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.689> same<00:00:21.720> probably<00:00:22.500> the

goes to it here there's a sensor that
lives<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.840> sticks<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.260> when<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
lives right here it sticks up when you

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.110 
lives right here it sticks up when you
close<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> hood<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.460> hits<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> top<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
close the hood it hits the top of the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.910 
close the hood it hits the top of the
hood<00:00:45.270> pushes<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> down<00:00:45.840> well<00:00:46.260> maybe<00:00:46.710> those

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
hood pushes it down well maybe those

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
hood pushes it down well maybe those
contacts<00:00:47.430> become<00:00:47.789> brittle<00:00:48.120> something<00:00:48.480> goes

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
contacts become brittle something goes

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.209 
contacts become brittle something goes
wrong<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:49.050> them<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.800> needs<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.100> be

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
wrong with them and it needs to be

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
wrong with them and it needs to be
replaced<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.120> cheap<00:00:51.360> part<00:00:51.719> -<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.230> easy

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
replaced it's a cheap part - really easy

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.670 
replaced it's a cheap part - really easy
to<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.100> could<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.579> unplug<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.680> plugging

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
to do you could just unplug it plugging

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
to do you could just unplug it plugging
and<00:00:55.860> unplugging<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.520> wire<00:00:56.670> from<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> just

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and unplugging the wire from it you just

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.260 
and unplugging the wire from it you just
pull<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.050> pull<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.680> sensor

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
pull this and pull it out of the sensor

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.610 
pull this and pull it out of the sensor
that<00:01:00.270> will<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> same<00:01:00.750> thing<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.410> then

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
that will do the same thing but then

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.959 
that will do the same thing but then
you're<00:01:01.770> lacking<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.280> piece<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.609> hardware<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you're lacking the piece of hardware and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.090 
you're lacking the piece of hardware and
any<00:01:03.300> security<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.140> does<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.409> fact<00:01:04.439> add<00:01:04.860> so

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
any security that it does in fact add so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
any security that it does in fact add so

the outside driver's side of the car the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.420 
the outside driver's side of the car the
way<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.930> think<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:34.799> kind<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.040> lay<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.250> in

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
way I think we just kind of lay it in

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
way I think we just kind of lay it in
like<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.850> give<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> push

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
like this give it a push

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.990 
like this give it a push
and<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.409> snaps<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.979> now<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.729> easy<00:01:38.759> as

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and it snaps in now it's as easy as

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
and it snaps in now it's as easy as
connecting<00:01:39.509> our<00:01:39.659> wire<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.439> should<00:01:40.710> be

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
connecting our wire and we should be

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.190 
connecting our wire and we should be
