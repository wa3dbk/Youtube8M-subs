 probably 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.450
 just here is the recession period 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.940
 use all the possibilities that 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 have auto manufacturers 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.780
 auto components to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.420
 invest in production in the future 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.840
 production in order after 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.080
 how will the rise of production 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.440
 be prepared for this and compete on 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.990
 the market 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.310
 AvtoVAZ is in the future to rise and is clearly ready 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.770
 about it and work with suppliers 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.810
 and as a result, the release of a completely new 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.940
 products including Alliance and Renault 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.539
 nissan new concepts new level 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.430
 quality example for peers 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.950
 I would like to emphasize our strengths 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.619
 parties we have beautiful people we have 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.020
 beautiful engineers we play very 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.450
 important role in the alliance is nissan 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.000
 It is obvious that the Samara region in the future 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.610
 will be multi clusters we revive 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.090
 brand fret and we hope you want 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.920
 be part of this automotive success 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.810
 multi cluster of Samara region is much 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.490
 more real than development 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.440
 special economic zones , coupled with measures 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.610
 state support makes the region 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.619
 extremely attractive to 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.110
 car component manufacturers from around 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.130
 world and it is clear that the key measures 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.500
 support is a recycling program 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.500
 and is now discussing the extension of the program 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.180
 disposal for another three years by the Ministry of Industry such 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.410
 I suggest a measure of hope that at the beginning 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.870
 December will be made appropriate 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.000
 the solution for us is certainly very 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.980
 important because today in the falling 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.860
 in the marketplace it supports significant 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.440
 way 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.610
 and the car manufacturer all 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.340
 technological chain that is 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.200
 suppliers speaking other measures 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.130
 support in the queue pen is 640 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.570
 ministry decree 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.790
 industry and commerce 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.970
 which allows you to compensate part 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.560
 interest rate which 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.000
 pay our loan providers 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.890
 who take on technological 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.870
 rearmament is interesting that many 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.909
 manufacturers state support measures 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.829
 not in a hurry to take advantage including 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.640
 this problem is to be solved during 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.650
