out everything is very precise and

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.819 
out everything is very precise and
overall<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.659> will<00:02:00.869> offer<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> decent

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
overall this will offer you a decent

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.440 
overall this will offer you a decent
level<00:02:02.130> protection<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.909> due<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.299> fact

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
level protection but due to the fact

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.569 
level protection but due to the fact
that<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:03.869> plastic<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.770> probably<00:02:05.130> will<00:02:05.250> crack

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
that it's plastic it probably will crack

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.920 
that it's plastic it probably will crack
if<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.850> drop<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.210> from<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.420> certain<00:02:06.689> distance

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
if you drop it from a certain distance

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.260 
if you drop it from a certain distance
take<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> look<00:02:08.069> at<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> top<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.759> also<00:02:08.970> gives<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
take a look at the top it also gives you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.420 
take a look at the top it also gives you
a<00:02:09.360> nice<00:02:09.509> exposed<00:02:10.080> layout<00:02:10.500> moving<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
a nice exposed layout moving on to the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.950 
a nice exposed layout moving on to the
camera<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.450> cutout<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.930> very<00:02:13.260> very<00:02:13.470> wide

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
camera here the cutout is very very wide

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.360 
camera here the cutout is very very wide
think<00:02:14.080> they<00:02:14.170> tried<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.470> play<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.680> safe<00:02:14.920> here<00:02:15.190> so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
think they tried to play it safe here so

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.620 
think they tried to play it safe here so
they<00:02:15.490> made<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.790> camera<00:02:16.090> cut<00:02:16.240> out<00:02:16.360> nice<00:02:16.600> and

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
they made the camera cut out nice and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.510 
they made the camera cut out nice and
wide<00:02:16.870> able<00:02:17.710> to<00:02:17.800> take<00:02:17.950> your<00:02:18.100> pictures<00:02:18.490> and

flash with no issues as does have a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.460 
flash with no issues as does have a
black<00:02:20.860> liner<00:02:21.190> around<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.730> camera<00:02:21.940> cut<00:02:22.210> out

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
black liner around the camera cut out

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.900

moving along the side here once again
this<00:02:25.120> case<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.540> very<00:02:25.810> thin<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.230> doesn't<00:02:26.500> add

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
this case is very thin it doesn't add

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.170 
this case is very thin it doesn't add
much<00:02:26.710> bulk<00:02:27.280> at<00:02:27.460> all<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.000> like<00:02:28.150> a

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
much bulk at all it's just like a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.150 
much bulk at all it's just like a
plastic<00:02:28.510> snap<00:02:28.960> on<00:02:29.140> case<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:29.830> goes<00:02:30.010> on

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
plastic snap on case that just goes on

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.950

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
significant level of protection but it

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.710 
significant level of protection but it
gives<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.880> good<00:02:34.090> level<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.360> scratch

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
gives you a good level of scratch

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.390
