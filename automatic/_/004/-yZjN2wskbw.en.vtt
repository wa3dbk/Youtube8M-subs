00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

a<00:00:00.060> third<00:00:00.420> base<00:00:00.599> on<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.380> map<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:01.680> very

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
a third base on this map is very

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.220 
a third base on this map is very
difficult<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.490> take<00:00:02.669> because<00:00:03.510> it's<00:00:03.870> got<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.080> be

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
difficult to take because it's got to be

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.740 
difficult to take because it's got to be
far<00:00:05.220> away<00:00:05.460> don't<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.060> really<00:00:06.270> close<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.540> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
far away don't is really close to the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.570 
far away don't is really close to the
action<00:00:07.020> as<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.200> mean<00:00:07.740> anybody<00:00:07.980> come<00:00:08.250> this<00:00:08.400> way

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
action as I mean anybody come this way

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.000 
action as I mean anybody come this way
they<00:00:08.730> can<00:00:08.760> just<00:00:09.000> kill<00:00:09.240> attack<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.110> base<00:00:10.349> now

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
they can just kill attack this base now

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.860 
they can just kill attack this base now
I<00:00:11.040> think<00:00:11.400> what<00:00:11.580> Chuck<00:00:12.000> knees<00:00:12.269> here<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.660> some

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
I think what Chuck knees here is some

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.660 
I think what Chuck knees here is some
lettuce<00:00:13.139> worms<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.590> will<00:00:13.799> be<00:00:13.950> very<00:00:14.219> good<00:00:14.519> as

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
lettuce worms that will be very good as

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.250 
lettuce worms that will be very good as
that<00:00:14.700> they<00:00:14.969> can<00:00:15.150> just<00:00:15.299> go<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.660> anywhere<00:00:15.990> and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
that they can just go in anywhere and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.650 
that they can just go in anywhere and
going<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.740> very<00:00:16.859> effective<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.420> now

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
going to be very effective and so now

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.000 
going to be very effective and so now

meal is so fast and there are so many

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.760 
meal is so fast and there are so many
Marines<00:01:45.570> right<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.020> these<00:01:46.170> guys<00:01:46.350> not

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
Marines right now so these guys not

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.920 
Marines right now so these guys not
going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.759> able<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.420> much<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
going to be able to do that much at the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990 
going to be able to do that much at the
moment<00:01:49.110> may<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:49.950> coming<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.369> here<00:01:50.399> killing<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
moment may be coming in here killing a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.450 
moment may be coming in here killing a
missile<00:01:51.270> turret<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.600> killing<00:01:51.899> some<00:01:52.020> SUVs<00:01:52.460> but

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
missile turret and killing some SUVs but

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.399 
missile turret and killing some SUVs but
they<00:01:54.119> probably<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.659> need<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> guard<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.229> as

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
they probably do need to guard this as

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.719 
they probably do need to guard this as
that<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:55.619> are<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> come<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.250> soon<00:01:56.490> here

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
that they are going to come in soon here

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.090 
that they are going to come in soon here
now<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.899> think<00:01:57.930> he<00:01:58.170> should<00:01:58.380> check<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
now I really I think he should check you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.039 
now I really I think he should check you
can<00:01:59.130> actually<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.790> know<00:01:59.880> borrow<00:02:00.719> these

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
can actually just you know borrow these

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.200 
can actually just you know borrow these
these<00:02:01.649> paintings<00:02:01.890> over<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.880> put<00:02:03.119> them

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
these paintings over here and I put them

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.109 
these paintings over here and I put them
on<00:02:03.299> auto<00:02:03.540> auto<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:04.530> borough<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.610> when<00:02:06.000> two

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
just melt away the Marines but I haven't

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.850 
just melt away the Marines but I haven't
seen<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.289> actually<00:02:10.679> used<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.099> any<00:02:11.250> actual

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
seen that actually used in any actual

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.620 
seen that actually used in any actual
games<00:02:12.070> what<00:02:12.610> it's<00:02:12.820> going<00:02:13.000> on<00:02:13.120> with<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.360> drops

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
games what it's going on with this drops

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.630 
games what it's going on with this drops
in<00:02:13.810> one<00:02:13.990> drop<00:02:14.200> ship<00:02:14.350> with<00:02:14.500> one<00:02:14.710> marine<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.490> in

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
in one drop ship with one marine is in

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.290 
in one drop ship with one marine is in
the<00:02:15.760> red<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.830> these<00:02:17.950> guys<00:02:18.190> direct<00:02:18.940> they

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the red so and these guys direct they

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.450 
the red so and these guys direct they
are<00:02:19.420> actually<00:02:19.600> going<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.960> go<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.130> could<00:02:21.310> try

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
are actually going to go to I could try

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.790 
are actually going to go to I could try
to<00:02:21.520> secure<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.090> expansion<00:02:22.630> as<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.110> he<00:02:23.410> does

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
to secure this expansion as the he does

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.950 
to secure this expansion as the he does
oh<00:02:24.340> he<00:02:24.640> does<00:02:24.850> know<00:02:25.030> his<00:02:25.180> skin<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.510> must<00:02:25.780> have

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
oh he does know his skin and must have

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.810 
oh he does know his skin and must have
scanned<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.920> maybe<00:02:27.340> they're<00:02:27.550> gonna<00:02:27.640> move

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
scanned it so maybe they're gonna move

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.790 
scanned it so maybe they're gonna move
towards<00:02:28.210> this<00:02:28.300> expansion<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.290> take<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.590> out

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
towards this expansion and take this out

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.860 
towards this expansion and take this out
and<00:02:30.190> what's<00:02:31.000> with<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.270> pattern<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.750> guess

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
and what's with this pattern I guess

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.590 
and what's with this pattern I guess
that's<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.140> ground<00:02:32.410> pattern<00:02:32.710> from<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.040> area

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
that's the ground pattern from that area

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.390 
that's the ground pattern from that area
so<00:02:34.600> there's<00:02:35.050> only<00:02:35.170> three<00:02:35.650> drones<00:02:35.860> mining<00:02:36.280> here

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
so there's only three drones mining here

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.850 
so there's only three drones mining here
is<00:02:36.460> not<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> big<00:02:37.330> not<00:02:38.080> too<00:02:38.290> big<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.590> loss<00:02:38.740> i

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
is not a big not too big of a loss i

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.440 
is not a big not too big of a loss i
guess<00:02:38.890> but<00:02:39.160> still<00:02:39.370> it's<00:02:39.640> not<00:02:39.880> good<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.090> have

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
guess but still it's not good to have

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.090 
guess but still it's not good to have
this<00:02:40.630> base<00:02:40.840> taken<00:02:41.140> down<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.680> I'm<00:02:41.890> arranged

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
this base taken down and I'm arranged

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.470 
this base taken down and I'm arranged
i'll<00:02:42.280> stay<00:02:42.490> me<00:02:42.610> up<00:02:42.700> I'm<00:02:42.790> gonna<00:02:42.940> take<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.270> down

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
i'll stay me up I'm gonna take this down

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.750 
i'll stay me up I'm gonna take this down
really<00:02:43.780> really<00:02:44.050> really<00:02:44.230> fast<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:45.550> lot<00:02:45.730> of

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
really really really fast and a lot of

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.130 
really really really fast and a lot of
the<00:02:45.940> little<00:02:46.120> puzzling<00:02:46.450> come<00:02:46.630> out<00:02:46.780> but<00:02:46.959> at<00:02:47.080> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
the little puzzling come out but at the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.020 
the little puzzling come out but at the
Maurice<00:02:47.380> are<00:02:47.500> just<00:02:47.650> gonna<00:02:47.770> run<00:02:48.010> away<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.910> the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
Maurice are just gonna run away and the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.640 
Maurice are just gonna run away and the
brooding<00:02:49.300> is<00:02:49.420> going<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.660> die<00:02:49.840> fairly<00:02:50.380> soon

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
brooding is going to die fairly soon

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.820 
brooding is going to die fairly soon
here<00:02:51.000> yeah<00:02:52.000> there<00:02:52.300> we<00:02:52.450> go<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:52.840> dead<00:02:53.080> so

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
here yeah there we go to this dead so

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.710 
here yeah there we go to this dead so
but<00:02:54.550> actually<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.940> mute<00:02:55.150> are<00:02:55.330> coming<00:02:55.570> here

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.870 
we'll see how he can actually turn it
around<00:03:23.830> I<00:03:23.980> don't<00:03:24.040> know<00:03:24.190> if<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.370> got<00:03:24.459> it's

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
around I don't know if you got it's

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.009 
around I don't know if you got it's
going<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.209> be<00:03:25.299> able<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.660> turn<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:25.959> around

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
going to be able to turn it around

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.860 
going to be able to turn it around
unless<00:03:26.769> all<00:03:27.160> these<00:03:27.430> banks<00:03:27.880> do<00:03:28.299> their<00:03:28.450> job<00:03:28.690> and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
unless all these banks do their job and

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.259 
unless all these banks do their job and
melt<00:03:29.380> away<00:03:29.530> all<00:03:29.860> these<00:03:30.010> Marines<00:03:30.430> if<00:03:31.000> that

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
melt away all these Marines if that

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.720 
melt away all these Marines if that
happens<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.900> definitely<00:03:32.500> India<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:33.160> mean<00:03:33.610> this

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
happens and definitely India I mean this

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.539 
happens and definitely India I mean this
force<00:03:34.000> can<00:03:34.120> take<00:03:34.570> down<00:03:34.769> anything<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:36.160> the

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
force can take down anything that the

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.570 
force can take down anything that the
that<00:03:37.090> dinner<00:03:37.510> should<00:03:37.690> have<00:03:37.840> but<00:03:38.080> I<00:03:38.320> think<00:03:39.100> it's

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
that dinner should have but I think it's

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.460 
that dinner should have but I think it's
going<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.760> be<00:03:39.850> very<00:03:39.880> crucial<00:03:40.630> as<00:03:40.750> what<00:03:41.350> these

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
going to be very crucial as what these

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.590 
going to be very crucial as what these
paintings<00:03:41.860> can<00:03:42.070> do<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.400> ran<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.060> really<00:03:43.450> think

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
paintings can do and ran I really think

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.479 
paintings can do and ran I really think
right<00:03:43.840> now<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.230> he<00:03:44.769> oh<00:03:44.890> my<00:03:45.100> goodness

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
right now that he oh my goodness

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.720 
right now that he oh my goodness
another<00:03:45.880> like<00:03:46.840> 15<00:03:47.709> billion<00:03:47.950> or<00:03:48.280> more<00:03:48.400> fitting

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
another like 15 billion or more fitting

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.070 
another like 15 billion or more fitting
at<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.850> same<00:03:49.000> time<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.390> really<00:03:49.900> think<00:03:49.959> the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
at the same time I really think the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.630 
at the same time I really think the
Overlord<00:03:50.560> would<00:03:50.739> be<00:03:50.830> pretty<00:03:51.280> good<00:03:51.400> right<00:03:51.519> now

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
Overlord would be pretty good right now

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.860 
Overlord would be pretty good right now
I<00:03:52.019> they<00:03:53.019> can<00:03:53.170> drop<00:03:53.440> into<00:03:53.709> oh<00:03:54.130> my<00:03:54.730> god<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.660> over

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.640 
boy can't drop in those into the marine
really<00:03:57.850> easily<00:03:58.360> so<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.570> expression<00:03:59.110> is<00:03:59.410> done

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
just so you know I mean check did a

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.870 
just so you know I mean check did a
really<00:04:50.770> good<00:04:50.890> job<00:04:50.950> with<00:04:51.100> those<00:04:51.310> paintings<00:04:51.580> and

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
really good job with those paintings and

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.550 
really good job with those paintings and
with<00:04:52.270> an<00:04:52.390> attack<00:04:52.660> it's<00:04:52.900> just<00:04:53.050> that<00:04:53.230> he<00:04:53.380> did<00:04:53.530> not

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
with an attack it's just that he did not

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.400 
with an attack it's just that he did not
have<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.910> army<00:04:55.240> count<00:04:55.510> I<00:04:55.720> mean<00:04:55.870> his<00:04:55.990> army<00:04:56.290> was

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
have the army count I mean his army was

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.680 
have the army count I mean his army was
way<00:04:56.620> behind<00:04:56.830> on<00:04:57.220> the<00:04:57.670> army<00:04:57.910> count<00:04:58.120> so<00:04:58.450> that<00:04:58.600> is

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
way behind on the army count so that is

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.450 
way behind on the army count so that is
why<00:04:58.870> he<00:04:59.110> could<00:04:59.380> not<00:04:59.410> hold<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.800> lot<00:04:59.950> but<00:05:00.130> if<00:05:00.280> that

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
why he could not hold a lot but if that

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.670 
why he could not hold a lot but if that
army<00:05:00.730> can<00:05:00.880> was<00:05:01.000> even<00:05:01.270> he<00:05:01.780> would<00:05:01.930> I<00:05:02.050> would<00:05:02.590> think

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
army can was even he would I would think

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.660 
army can was even he would I would think
he<00:05:02.830> would<00:05:02.920> definitely<00:05:03.250> won<00:05:03.400> that<00:05:03.550> battle

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
he would definitely won that battle

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.700 
he would definitely won that battle
easily<00:05:04.180> because<00:05:04.930> those<00:05:05.080> billions<00:05:05.440> killed

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
easily because those billions killed

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.470 
easily because those billions killed
