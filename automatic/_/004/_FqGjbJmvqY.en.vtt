to you folks is because it's extremely

accurate the only real downside of using

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.180 
accurate the only real downside of using
this<00:02:38.940> weapon<00:02:39.209> would<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.750> reload<00:02:40.079> time

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
this weapon would be the reload time

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.710 
this weapon would be the reload time
clucking<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.280> at<00:02:41.370> 2.4<00:02:42.090> seconds<00:02:42.510> when<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
clucking in at 2.4 seconds when the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.110 
clucking in at 2.4 seconds when the
weapon<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.110> dry<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.500> 1.9<00:02:44.160> seconds<00:02:44.849> when<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
weapon is dry and 1.9 seconds when the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.869 
weapon is dry and 1.9 seconds when the
weapon<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:45.810> still<00:02:46.140> chambered<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.920> again<00:02:47.549> it's

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
weapon is still chambered and again it's

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.880 
weapon is still chambered and again it's
all<00:02:48.150> really<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.810> matter<00:02:49.079> of<00:02:49.230> getting<00:02:49.379> used<00:02:49.560> to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
all really a matter of getting used to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.250 
all really a matter of getting used to
it<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.250> think<00:02:50.790> about<00:02:50.879> where<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.629> when<00:02:52.049> to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
it and think about where and when to

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.380 
it and think about where and when to
reload<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.519> would<00:02:53.670> recommend<00:02:53.910> using<00:02:54.180> this

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
reload and I would recommend using this

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.059 
reload and I would recommend using this
thing<00:02:54.660> with<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> silencer<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.769> great
