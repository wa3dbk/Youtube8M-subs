00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.970
 hello very good everyone i'm cristian 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.079
 everything knows me as a logo and was part of 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.739
 of the team of exist 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.630
 in this video I will show you what is my 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.960
 role within the team that is tip of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.530
 throw more you'll know more like / 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.270
 fryer as aymar noel 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.280
 the one that makes you the first descent of 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.739
 enter the sites 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.670
 We can teach details and tips that 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.260
 I think they are going to serve us this does not want 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.690
 to say that it is the best thing to 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.490
 player has his way of playing not his 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.370
 playing style 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.850
 and good to start teaching how 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.130
 enter the sites and start good 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.250
 first of all my role is a role that 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:08.270
 many talks that play a lot 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:12.140
 much much mod m hs are many 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.000
 pistols warning for example falling and to the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.490
 have on the road can play a lot with 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 the blow in my case well with a almost 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.340
 rifles and guns well let's start as 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.350
 enter to enter the sites there are people 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.140
 that goes insane without looking at the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.500
 typical sites and we go to the first 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.320
 lighthouse you always have to enter 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.540
 in hai na dowry that there will be a 7 always 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.370
 we must point out the typical places by 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.440
 example here there is always usually a 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.700
 pretty in this position 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.770
 here is also going to see a blow is 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.870
 here in you that there is also a whopper and 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.760
 always then you have to go 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.530
 be careful of the angles 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.630
 imagine that you always see the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.720
 position prepared in accordance with 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.480
 careful opening the space angles 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.500
 where can I see 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.210
 of the game everything is worth 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.120
 good to enter anything because these the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.150
 studs and poke 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.290
 and after around here then in 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.840
 this smoke that covers tickets 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.010
 and open around here so they kill you from that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.860
 zone 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.900
 according to water who jungle 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.390
 who judge in jungle if you go by the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.069
 when I think I killed you 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.230
 pointing then you can get up here 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.510
 go opening little by little from this 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.540
 position you see your head 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.459
 enter at home to enter a house 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.210
 position multiplicas the cts is put 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.360
 it was here 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.670
 in this corner then you can come 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.160
 over here and throw this flash 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.250
 and you that you back and you can 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.250
 kill 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:00.390
 then it turns then flash 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.390
 the footsteps 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:10.060
 to enter to see or not to enter instead of not 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.060
 It has a lot that is a corridor 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.790
 wayne in career that comes to this part 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.329
 and you can enter the time stop 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.329
 this smoke 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.950
 that way 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.080
 that is for all trucks and opening 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.459
 little by little the angles as instant 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.110
 always pointing 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.550
 imagine that having a cts where are you going to 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.680
 point to be prepared 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.680
 prepared and go little by little 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.280
 to go down here by rats for 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.650
 underground then 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.540
 this position is very likely to go to 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.270
 do because a lot of people usually come by 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.800
 old equipment 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:54.940
 the old and around here russia well then for 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.530
 here with the button with the mouse 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.540
 on the secondary button of the mouse 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.540
 hold down has dragged down 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.520
 and that 's because of scratching 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.520
 in agreement 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.900
 more details more details as we see 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.590
 a very important factor of this course 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.239
 fumes since they usually leave gaps in 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.519
 which you can see and the rival does not 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.120
 example 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.699
 in the arch this afternoon and they are already playing 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.700
 much to be in one hit whatever 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.320
 you can throw this smoke 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.800
 they're here 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.800
 fences 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.550
 as you see leaves a gap you see us leave us 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.139
 a gap then was altered slight 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.139
 while the terrat and does not see you 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.949
 then you stay here aiming for 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.949
 behind 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.900
 more examples of how we all are but 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.200
 for example here the link this is very 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.200
 good 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.249
 this smoke for the two teams that touch 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.379
 many rats 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.959
 by subway this is very good because 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.409
 because you throw that one just throw away 

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:16.529
 you throw here 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:19.009
 and you see them while they do not you 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:19.009
 you can see 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.120
 and well there's more we're an old man here 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.340
 also one 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.350
 good there are many teams that what 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:35.630
 they throw badly usually fall down here and leave that 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.570
 hollow yes you can play with those fumes 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.350
 in case that also and more ones and 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.000
 Well now I hope 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.590
 I hope you liked this video 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.740
 these little tips because I have 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:53.270
 served and if you have any questions 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.270
 something in the next video 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.570
 and forget us to follow the networks 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.560
 social labels I have observed to 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.560
 all thanks for the video
