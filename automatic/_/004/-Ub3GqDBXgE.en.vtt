00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.650
 what are the benefits of pumped 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.440
 pumped up 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.470
 Well, it is as if not well, not that pumped up in 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:29.860
 Generally correctly said 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:32.949
 Yes, all very often when asked a question 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.640
 here is a double film or double layer 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:39.309
 film 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:45.909
 meaning not the film itself which 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:47.670
 has two layers this is two layers of linen then 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:54.039
 there are two canvases 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:57.940
 who put one on the bottom at the edges 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:00.459
 recorded a special clip that is 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.219
 when we leave step faces will be very 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:08.640
 what clip is clearly visible and what it is 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:13.770
 pumped up and then let's say the air is blown 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.960
 figuratively the air mattress turns out 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.469
 let's say the thickness of this mattress is on average 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.340
 it turns out about 35 centimeters across 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:29.259
 Square is not only different sides of the dome 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.350
 the same thing means it gives it gives 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.429
 Well, first of all, it is savings in 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.520
 heating but up to 50 percent due 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:44.320
 what can you 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:48.310
 save on heating those swings 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.219
 there are sudden changes in temperature with 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.869
 that this volume let it be sunny 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:57.909
 the day is not sunny it has its 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:02.549
 the temperature he warmed up as usually 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:08.229
 it gives very good ground 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:10.989
 when this volume heats up and let's say 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.120
 the sun sets naturally comes 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:19.060
 night and cold time of day this volume 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:24.700
 so quickly does not cool as with a single 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:30.160
 film that is figuratively 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.980
 take on the street 10 degrees inside 20 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.190
 degrees so that the difference in 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:42.879
 temperature or they caught up must 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:48.340
 go somewhere order well 8-10 hours at 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:52.079
 this temperature difference if 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:57.750
 frosty that is if it is winter time 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:03:02.470
 there will be at least 4 degrees maximum 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:07.420
 if we say there is no heating and greenhouse 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.410
 Worth and sunny days can very clearly 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.560
 declare and say that the ground 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.690
 will never freeze to death 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.709
 that is, if you use inside yet 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.790
 additionally some arches on the beds and 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.510
 cover 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.560
 the most ordinary thin film then 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.830
 have experience worldwide experience this way 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.140
 away from the cold and frost 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:43.170
 let's say cultures like sorrel 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.170
 Parsley in general, without heating can be 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:04:00.720
 grow and get a certain 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:04:03.900
 harvest all year round Well of course it 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.560
 have here shown at the very beginning of my 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.800
 performances 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.630
 the fan that pumps them 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.200
 like fans 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:16.799
 usually rise as much as possible 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.870
 up or the air is taken 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:25.410
 top why in order to reach 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:30.920
 temperature differences and it says 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.920
 that when the air comes in and there is a difference 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:41.960
 in temperatures and in such greenhouses with them 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.870
 never lies ie he immediately 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.160
 melts and moves away unlike those 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:56.940
 who with single film and still want 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:05:00.720
 immediately say there is a utopian opinion on 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.900
 about the fact that if we make a film 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.500
 double the one that we do as well 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.720
 figuratively 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.550
 people tell us 2 ceiling or more 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:16.230
 of which we will be saved and the temperature will be 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:19.050
 completely different temperature 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.530
 other but such a difference as with inflatable 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.110
 film you never reach two 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.650
 reasons and still have any problems 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.870
 the film which is fixed inside it 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.500
 Naturally it will be with holes that is 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.210
 and and trees in order to screw 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:41.000
 there is no air movement 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:46.470
 waiting for two layers and the most important he 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.569
 does not move as we say methodically 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.500
 blowing it and that is a fan 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:55.440
 pumps it with a difference and there with 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.199
 some kind of amplitude in time which 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.300
 one is not such a large amplitude that is 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.000
 there is always movement of movement 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:08.250
 air another moment at that film 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:13.550
 which 2 ceiling do have one more 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:17.370
 Moisture accumulates there. 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:25.139
 let's say the air that goes there 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:26.610
 there it turns out let's say condensate and you 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.419
 face two problems at once 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:33.889
 the first problem is condensate on 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:38.159
 the main film which falls out and 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:41.580
 just simply drowns the second film and on 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:43.889
 as if we would like it or not to 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.130
 2 films the same appears 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:51.860
 condensate due to the fact that the difference in 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:55.110
 there is no such temperature on the bottom film 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.500
 so that is pumped too 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.620
 condensate but for this we use 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.990
 film which 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.960
 anti drop called or anti-fog 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:10.470
 or one more that is, there are a number of 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.950
 This suggests that the water does not hang it 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:16.200
 just she just rolls outlines 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.680
 captive let's say greenhouses are visible 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:23.000
 that is, the form itself, well, that is, everything is there 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.000
 as if clear
