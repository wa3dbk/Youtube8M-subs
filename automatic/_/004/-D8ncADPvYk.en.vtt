00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 It's change, no, no, no, no, no. 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.340
 no work in that area for the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.590
 reallocating the subject 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.259
 for this reason and even thinks that the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.360
 municipality is the decision taken in that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.330
 I am the municipality there is not always 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.740
 received in a respectful manner for 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.630
 who took no action with 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.119
 relation to this and that was the conclusion 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.480
 arrived because the fixation 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.760
 of a fight she is not the administrator 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 who will pay for that song 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.510
 who pays is the public coffers 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.120
 whereas citizens 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.420
 for this reason there was a need to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.840
 to rethink the decision made so that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.600
 to make a decision that goes down 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.390
 effectiveness to this anticipation of guardianship 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.730
 granted that the issue of reallocation 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.129
 of camelos, which is the question of the beginning of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.500
 I restore then what I am doing 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.770
 I'm taking part in the administration. 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.469
 to manage the issue of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.700
 the restoration of the general square flowers 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.970
 because there are processes to study 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.479
 technician but so far has not silenced anything 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.330
 with regard to the restoration of the square there are 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.460
 manifestations in the records of technicians 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.820
 that was removed was the sidings 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.570
 placed the material that isolated the square 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.850
 in order to avoid being the boat vs new 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.579
 occupations but this was disregarded 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.360
 the deceased municipality has placed 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.060
 without any criterion without hearing 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.579
 the technical staff so what made me 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.680
 I'm intervening in this situation, I'm 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.280
 determining that he is acquainted with 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.700
 are withdrawn and that they are 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.070
 replaced 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.680
 if applicable pursuant to guidance 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.680
 gold 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.070
 for the restoration and also in this 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.860
 boy today a decision contained well 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.800
 for me is not an easy decision but I 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.860
 I was given a deadline for final exit 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.970
 of the camelos that until the 10 of May in 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.970
 2014 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.660
 if they do not leave until that date 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.570
 after that it goes out somehow as 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.840
 focus the eyes they got out of there by force 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.209
 and light talked to your antone frame 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.459
 the representative cold canoes 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:27.910
 he said klink is she actually stayed 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.160
 he was surprised by the decision and that 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.250
 I was disappointed but I would like to 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.810
 tell the street vendors that this 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.300
 Magistrate whenever they are a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.120
 worry about the work they do 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.300
 unfortunately before all the southern 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.810
 situations is in the way it comes 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.170
 happening 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.790
 there was a need for an intervention 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.830
 different that until then had been 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.820
 taken because if there is no decision 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.610
 but so durango being taken 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.340
 I do not believe he leaves me there. 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.410
 I do not believe it is reallocated in 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.390
 so there was a need to give 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.390
 effectiveness of the decision taken so far
