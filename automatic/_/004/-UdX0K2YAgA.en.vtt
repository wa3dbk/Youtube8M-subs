his<00:03:06.940> powers<00:03:07.300> are<00:03:07.450> not<00:03:07.510> dwindling<00:03:08.020> or<00:03:08.200> starting

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
his powers are not dwindling or starting

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.430 
his powers are not dwindling or starting
to<00:03:08.620> become<00:03:08.800> mortal<00:03:09.220> slowly<00:03:10.290> basically<00:03:11.290> this

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
to become mortal slowly basically this

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.740 
to become mortal slowly basically this
theory<00:03:11.770> breaks<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.220> down<00:03:12.340> into<00:03:12.400> he<00:03:13.360> loses<00:03:13.630> his

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
theory breaks it down into he loses his

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.020 
theory breaks it down into he loses his
power<00:03:13.930> slowly<00:03:14.410> over<00:03:14.680> time<00:03:14.800> after<00:03:15.490> he<00:03:15.580> is<00:03:15.670> freed

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
power slowly over time after he is freed

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.030 
power slowly over time after he is freed
and<00:03:16.270> becomes<00:03:16.780> mortal<00:03:17.260> becomes<00:03:17.380> human<00:03:17.740> again

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
and becomes mortal becomes human again

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.820 
and becomes mortal becomes human again
and<00:03:18.220> that's<00:03:18.940> why<00:03:19.270> now<00:03:20.260> I'm<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.560> show<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.710> couple

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
and that's why now I'm a show a couple

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.530 
and that's why now I'm a show a couple
pictures<00:03:21.100> right<00:03:21.340> now<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.030> last<00:03:22.270> scene

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
pictures right now of the last scene

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.470 
pictures right now of the last scene
where<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.400> genie<00:03:24.670> is<00:03:24.910> seen<00:03:25.240> with<00:03:25.360> the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
where the the genie is seen with the

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.230 
where the the genie is seen with the
bottle<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.260> yep<00:03:26.530> got<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.160> lamp<00:03:27.670> excuse<00:03:28.060> me<00:03:28.150> at

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
bottle and yep got the lamp excuse me at

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.570 
bottle and yep got the lamp excuse me at
the<00:03:28.300> bottle<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:29.290> he<00:03:29.500> asked<00:03:29.770> Aladdin<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.250> to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
the bottle and he asked Aladdin is to

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.730 
the bottle and he asked Aladdin is to
rub<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.060> see<00:03:31.240> if<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.390> still<00:03:31.630> works<00:03:31.660> but<00:03:32.170> by

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
rub it and see if it still works but by

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.530 
rub it and see if it still works but by
doing<00:03:32.800> that<00:03:33.040> he's<00:03:33.280> not<00:03:33.550> he's<00:03:33.940> not<00:03:33.970> absorbed

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
doing that he's not he's not absorbed

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.360 
doing that he's not he's not absorbed
back<00:03:34.660> into<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:35.170> lamp<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:35.590> he<00:03:35.680> knows<00:03:35.860> that<00:03:36.190> he

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
back into the lamp so he knows that he

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.310 
back into the lamp so he knows that he
is<00:03:36.400> freed<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.210> as<00:03:37.600> soon<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:37.870> he<00:03:37.930> does<00:03:38.050> that<00:03:38.110> he

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
is freed and as soon as he does that he

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.340 
is freed and as soon as he does that he
shakes<00:03:38.680> hands<00:03:39.550> with<00:03:39.580> it<00:03:39.880> with<00:03:40.210> Aladdin<00:03:41.200> and

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
shakes hands with it with Aladdin and

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.980 
shakes hands with it with Aladdin and
and<00:03:41.980> led<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.760> left<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.120> time<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.660> lamp<00:03:43.840> is

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
and led the left this time the lamp is

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.740 
and led the left this time the lamp is
still<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.590> suit<00:03:45.490> I<00:03:45.610> can't<00:03:45.850> say<00:03:45.970> this<00:03:46.090> the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
still in a suit I can't say this the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.230 
still in a suit I can't say this the
lamp<00:03:46.990> is<00:03:47.140> still<00:03:47.530> in<00:03:47.740> Aladdin's<00:03:48.550> hands<00:03:48.850> when<00:03:49.209> he

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
lamp is still in Aladdin's hands when he

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.480 
lamp is still in Aladdin's hands when he
shakes<00:03:49.540> his<00:03:49.630> hands<00:03:50.050> but<00:03:50.500> take<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.830> look<00:03:50.980> at<00:03:51.220> this

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
shakes his hands but take a look at this

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.000 
shakes his hands but take a look at this
picture<00:03:51.850> right<00:03:52.240> after<00:03:52.690> that<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.140> lamp<00:03:53.860> has

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
picture right after that the lamp has

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.100 
picture right after that the lamp has
disappeared<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:54.760> appears<00:03:55.330> that<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.750> genie

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
disappeared it appears that the genie

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.350 
disappeared it appears that the genie
took<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.650> lamp<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.100> flew<00:03:57.610> off<00:03:57.820> never<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.240> be

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
took the lamp and flew off never to be

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.160 
took the lamp and flew off never to be
seen<00:03:58.540> again<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:59.110> that<00:03:59.709> is<00:03:59.950> why<00:04:00.220> um<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:02.110> know

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
seen again and that is why um you know

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.290 
seen again and that is why um you know
the<00:04:02.230> lamp<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:02.740> not<00:04:02.920> seen<00:04:03.220> again<00:04:03.250> until<00:04:03.670> you

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
the lamp is not seen again until you

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.570 
the lamp is not seen again until you
know<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.660> merchant<00:04:05.320> who<00:04:05.530> was<00:04:06.100> actually<00:04:06.340> the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
know the merchant who was actually the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.650 
know the merchant who was actually the
very<00:04:06.760> beginning<00:04:07.090> movie<00:04:07.240> but<00:04:07.390> is<00:04:07.480> actually

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
very beginning movie but is actually

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.330 
very beginning movie but is actually
after<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.410> events<00:04:08.740> you<00:04:08.770> see<00:04:08.980> at<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.100> last

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
after the events you see at the last

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.940 
after the events you see at the last
scene<00:04:09.610> that's<00:04:10.600> why<00:04:10.990> he<00:04:11.260> has<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.560> lamp<00:04:11.770> because

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
scene that's why he has the lamp because

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.880 
scene that's why he has the lamp because
the<00:04:12.850> genie<00:04:13.150> took<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.540> lamp<00:04:13.750> then<00:04:14.080> became<00:04:14.860> the

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
the genie took the lamp then became the

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.190 
the genie took the lamp then became the
merchant<00:04:15.490> that<00:04:15.670> is<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.910> theory<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.359> it's

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
merchant that is the theory and it's

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.510 
merchant that is the theory and it's
actually<00:04:17.320> really<00:04:17.650> kind<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:18.010> cool<00:04:18.250> it's

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
actually really kind of cool it's

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.440 
actually really kind of cool it's
actually<00:04:18.730> kind<00:04:18.850> of<00:04:18.880> more<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.120> deeper

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
actually kind of more the deeper

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.729 
actually kind of more the deeper
theories<00:04:19.720> I've<00:04:19.810> actually<00:04:19.959> ever<00:04:20.200> heard<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.709> I

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
theories I've actually ever heard and I

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.440 
theories I've actually ever heard and I
thought<00:04:21.520> was<00:04:21.640> really<00:04:21.820> interesting<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:22.300> share

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
thought was really interesting to share

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.520 
thought was really interesting to share
with<00:04:22.570> you<00:04:22.630> guys<00:04:22.690> so<00:04:22.870> I'd<00:04:23.020> love<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.350> hear<00:04:23.440> you
