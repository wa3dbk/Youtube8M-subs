00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.800 
then when I do that the bounding box
surrounds<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:37.670> it's<00:02:37.790> easier<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.120> move<00:02:38.270> so<00:02:38.630> use

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
surrounds so it's easier to move so use

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.060 
surrounds so it's easier to move so use
