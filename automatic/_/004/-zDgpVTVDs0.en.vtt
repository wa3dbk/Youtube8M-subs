guess whatever you wants you know he

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.749 
guess whatever you wants you know he
basically<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.050> gave<00:02:10.289> date

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
basically just gave date

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.330 
basically just gave date
a<00:02:10.789> free<00:02:11.780> control<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.260> his<00:02:12.349> body<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:13.159> guess

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
a free control of his body and I guess

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.699 
a free control of his body and I guess
it's<00:02:13.370> interesting<00:02:14.150> seeing<00:02:14.720> his<00:02:15.140> abilities

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709

it's interesting seeing his abilities
and<00:02:16.010> his<00:02:16.730> techniques<00:02:17.209> like<00:02:17.360> he<00:02:17.569> would<00:02:17.720> be

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
and his techniques like he would be

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.380 
and his techniques like he would be
probably<00:02:18.500> i<00:02:18.920> want<00:02:19.159> to<00:02:19.250> say<00:02:19.430> very<00:02:19.640> clumsy<00:02:20.239> with

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
probably i want to say very clumsy with

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.970 
probably i want to say very clumsy with
it<00:02:20.569> but<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.900> same<00:02:21.110> time<00:02:21.290> really<00:02:21.680> destructive

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
it but the same time really destructive

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.190 
it but the same time really destructive
because<00:02:22.340> if<00:02:23.030> he<00:02:23.209> keeps<00:02:23.329> on<00:02:23.510> doing<00:02:23.659> that<00:02:23.840> huge

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
because if he keeps on doing that huge

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.289 
because if he keeps on doing that huge
heart<00:02:24.590> bomb<00:02:24.769> attack<00:02:25.099> thing<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.579> just<00:02:26.030> imagine

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
heart bomb attack thing and just imagine

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.569 
heart bomb attack thing and just imagine
that<00:02:26.480> without<00:02:26.900> at<00:02:27.079> NSA<00:02:27.500> could<00:02:28.069> potentially

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
that without at NSA could potentially

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.430 
that without at NSA could potentially
destroy<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.970> whole<00:02:29.090> like<00:02:29.440> destroy

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
destroy the whole like destroy

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.110 
destroy the whole like destroy
everything<00:02:30.829> and<00:02:31.040> out<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.340> 10<00:02:31.489> say<00:02:31.670> from<00:02:32.000> this

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
everything and out of 10 say from this

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.580 
everything and out of 10 say from this
point<00:02:32.269> i<00:02:32.450> think<00:02:32.480> i'll<00:02:32.810> attend<00:02:33.019> say<00:02:33.170> this

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
point i think i'll attend say this

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.899 
point i think i'll attend say this
overpowered<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.930> guess<00:02:36.620> that's<00:02:37.549> that's

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
overpowered and I guess that's that's

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.940 
overpowered and I guess that's that's
cool<00:02:38.209> like<00:02:38.510> um<00:02:38.750> we<00:02:39.230> do<00:02:39.349> see<00:02:39.530> something<00:02:39.799> to

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
cool like um we do see something to

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.949 
cool like um we do see something to
force<00:02:40.189> a<00:02:40.310> safe<00:02:40.640> as<00:02:40.909> we<00:02:41.030> don't<00:02:41.180> not<00:02:41.329> not<00:02:41.450> Sasuke

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
force a safe as we don't not not Sasuke

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.789 
force a safe as we don't not not Sasuke

there's certain power level where you

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.619

are<00:03:27.169> I<00:03:27.620> guess<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:28.250> know<00:03:28.340> it's<00:03:28.879> that's<00:03:29.449> cool

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
are I guess you know it's that's cool

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.170 
are I guess you know it's that's cool
that's<00:03:29.900> cool<00:03:30.049> pretty<00:03:30.379> cool<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:31.000> it's<00:03:32.000> pretty

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
that's cool pretty cool and it's pretty

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.319 
that's cool pretty cool and it's pretty
interesting<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.720> was<00:03:32.810> actually<00:03:32.930> thinking<00:03:33.079> I

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
interesting I was actually thinking I

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.819 
interesting I was actually thinking I
analogized<00:03:35.329> that<00:03:35.629> as<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:36.139> were<00:03:36.319> poking<00:03:36.739> on

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
analogized that as it were poking on

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.159 
analogized that as it were poking on
because<00:03:37.129> in<00:03:37.310> Pokemon<00:03:37.760> Brown<00:03:38.510> is<00:03:38.810> actually

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
because in Pokemon Brown is actually

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.650 
because in Pokemon Brown is actually
effective<00:03:39.530> against<00:03:39.709> electric<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.480> with<00:03:41.480> this

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
effective against electric and with this

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.629 
effective against electric and with this
we<00:03:41.720> see<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.079> little<00:03:42.319> flopped<00:03:42.769> around<00:03:42.980> because

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
we see a little flopped around because

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.460 
we see a little flopped around because
now<00:03:44.000> electric<00:03:44.599> is<00:03:44.780> actually<00:03:45.079> affected<00:03:45.379> to

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
now electric is actually affected to

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.819 
now electric is actually affected to
ground<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.099> in<00:03:47.000> Pokemon<00:03:47.650> electric<00:03:48.650> there's

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
ground and in Pokemon electric there's

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.180 
ground and in Pokemon electric there's
nothing<00:03:49.160> around<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.819> know<00:03:49.910> it's<00:03:50.480> really<00:03:50.660> cool
