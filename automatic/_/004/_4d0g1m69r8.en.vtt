Authority<00:01:35.880> which<00:01:36.180> means<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> be

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
Authority which means you have to be

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.950 
Authority which means you have to be
extra<00:01:37.560> sensitive<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.280> pedals<00:01:38.700> as

compared<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.110> daily<00:01:40.439> copter<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.850> will

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
compared to a daily copter so that will

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.730 
compared to a daily copter so that will
make<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.720> students<00:01:43.140> work<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.439> little<00:01:43.530> bit

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
make the students work a little bit

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130 
make the students work a little bit
harder<00:01:43.799> other<00:01:44.729> things<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> turbine<00:01:45.930> has

harder other things like the turbine has

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.679 
harder other things like the turbine has
a<00:01:46.200> bit<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.560> lag<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> person<00:01:48.119> helicopter

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
a bit of a lag so a person helicopter

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
a bit of a lag so a person helicopter
like<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> class<00:01:49.500> soon<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.979> touch<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
like a class soon as you touch the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.730 
like a class soon as you touch the
throttle<00:01:50.549> these<00:01:50.880> ribs<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> turbine<00:01:52.560> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
throttle these ribs with the turbine it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.800 
throttle these ribs with the turbine it
needs<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.100> spool<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.549> first<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.540> small

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
needs to spool up first so it's small

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
needs to spool up first so it's small
things<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> student<00:01:55.860> will<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
things that the student will have to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.539 
things that the student will have to
also<00:01:57.600> bear<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.079> mind<00:01:58.290> when<00:01:58.469> fly<00:01:58.710> which<00:01:59.369> we

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
also bear in mind when fly which we

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.490 
also bear in mind when fly which we
could<00:01:59.790> say<00:02:00.450> maybe<00:02:00.810> makes<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> little<00:02:01.320> bit

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
could say maybe makes it a little bit

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.780 
could say maybe makes it a little bit
more<00:02:01.710> difficult<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.369> fly<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.630> his<00:02:03.810> career

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
more difficult to fly but in his career

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.999 
more difficult to fly but in his career
90%<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.850> his<00:02:06.000> real<00:02:06.840> jobs<00:02:07.229> are<00:02:07.560> gonna<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.890> on

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.160 
90% of his real jobs are gonna be on
turbine<00:02:08.369> machines<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
turbine machines and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.199 
turbine machines and
to<00:02:09.619> deal<00:02:09.800> with<00:02:09.830> those<00:02:10.130> factors<00:02:10.580> anyway<00:02:11.180> I

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
to deal with those factors anyway I

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.089 
to deal with those factors anyway I
chose<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.780> farmer<00:02:12.349> because<00:02:12.770> it's<00:02:12.920> the

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
chose the the farmer because it's the

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.250 
chose the the farmer because it's the
the<00:02:13.340> cheapest<00:02:13.670> Alec<00:02:13.849> up<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.120> that's<00:02:15.020> far<00:02:15.200> in

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
the cheapest Alec up to that's far in

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.380 
the cheapest Alec up to that's far in
South<00:02:15.410> Africa<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:15.980> although<00:02:16.849> it's<00:02:17.060> non<00:02:17.209> tab

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
South Africa and although it's non tab

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.900 
South Africa and although it's non tab
certified<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.989> hours<00:02:18.380> do<00:02:18.709> count<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.040> for

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
certified the hours do count and for

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.630 
certified the hours do count and for
your<00:02:20.030> commercial<00:02:20.630> turbine<00:02:21.290> time<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.610> I

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
your commercial turbine time and so I

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.339 
your commercial turbine time and so I
need<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.360> turbine<00:02:23.660> hours<00:02:23.930> do<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.140> progress

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
need the turbine hours do you progress

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.580 
need the turbine hours do you progress
further<00:02:24.620> falada<00:02:25.069> but<00:02:25.700> how<00:02:26.030> does<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.630> form<00:02:27.080> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
further falada but how does it form the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.340 
further falada but how does it form the
machine<00:02:28.370> has<00:02:28.580> quite<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.300> lot<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.840> performance

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
machine has quite a lot of performance

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.830 
machine has quite a lot of performance
in<00:02:30.560> comparison<00:02:30.890> with<00:02:31.459> an<00:02:31.610> r22<00:02:32.150> for<00:02:32.360> example

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
in comparison with an r22 for example

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.380 
in comparison with an r22 for example
first<00:02:33.380> reason<00:02:33.860> being<00:02:33.890> it's<00:02:34.280> lighter<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:35.120> has

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
first reason being it's lighter and has

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.009 
first reason being it's lighter and has
more<00:02:35.600> power

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
more power

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.170 
more power
so<00:02:36.590> actually<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.250> South<00:02:37.400> Africa<00:02:37.819> we<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.030> can

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
so actually in South Africa we you can

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.790 
so actually in South Africa we you can
see<00:02:38.209> it's<00:02:38.480> very<00:02:38.690> hot<00:02:38.930> then<00:02:39.170> we<00:02:39.349> quite<00:02:39.590> high

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
see it's very hot then we quite high

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.340 
see it's very hot then we quite high
there<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.459> very<00:02:40.760> thin<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.510> helps<00:02:41.840> us<00:02:41.930> like<00:02:42.170> that

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
there is very thin it helps us like that

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.199 
there is very thin it helps us like that
we<00:02:42.590> still<00:02:43.100> obviously<00:02:43.489> have<00:02:43.670> our<00:02:43.760> limitations

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
we still obviously have our limitations

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.910 
we still obviously have our limitations
like<00:02:44.630> any<00:02:44.870> aircraft<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.530> these<00:02:45.709> conditions

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
like any aircraft in these conditions

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.490 
like any aircraft in these conditions
but<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.519> do<00:02:46.670> perform<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.330> lot<00:02:47.480> better<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.989> will

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
but we do perform a lot better I will

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.720 
but we do perform a lot better I will
definitely<00:02:48.890> recommend<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.340> helicopter

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
definitely recommend the helicopter

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.539 
definitely recommend the helicopter
because<00:02:50.440> there's<00:02:51.440> still<00:02:51.709> some<00:02:51.950> some<00:02:52.400> things

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
because there's still some some things

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.000 
because there's still some some things
do<00:02:52.819> to<00:02:53.120> sort<00:02:53.360> out<00:02:53.569> but<00:02:53.840> otherwise<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:54.890> quite

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
do to sort out but otherwise it's quite

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.890 
do to sort out but otherwise it's quite
a<00:02:55.100> nice<00:02:55.250> helicopter<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.790> fly<00:02:55.819> it's<00:02:56.450> just<00:02:56.750> not

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
a nice helicopter to fly it's just not

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.050 
a nice helicopter to fly it's just not
very<00:02:57.140> ideal<00:02:57.350> for<00:02:57.739> hot<00:02:58.040> temperatures<00:02:58.580> like

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
very ideal for hot temperatures like

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.600 
very ideal for hot temperatures like

today and and high altitudes but further

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.520

down<00:03:01.700> lower<00:03:02.510> altitude<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.080> would<00:03:03.170> be<00:03:03.290> just

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
down lower altitude it would be just

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.250 
down lower altitude it would be just
