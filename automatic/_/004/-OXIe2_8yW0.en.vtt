how to install it first thing you're
gonna<00:02:22.660> do<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.530> remove<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.490> nut<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> front

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
gonna do is remove the nut and the front

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.450 
gonna do is remove the nut and the front
of<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.840> regulator<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:29.340> you're<00:02:30.340> gonna

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
of the regulator like so you're gonna

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.220
