check out the light show oh yeah now in

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:22.949 
check out the light show oh yeah now in
this<00:02:21.700> next<00:02:21.970> clip<00:02:22.299> we're<00:02:22.569> going<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.720> take<00:02:22.900> a

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
this next clip we're going to take a

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.660 
this next clip we're going to take a
look<00:02:23.200> at<00:02:23.380> something<00:02:23.680> that's<00:02:23.980> actually<00:02:24.220> been

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
look at something that's actually been

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.120 
look at something that's actually been
around<00:02:24.940> since<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.660> lot<00:02:26.079> earlier<00:02:26.500> versions<00:02:27.010> of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
around since a lot earlier versions of

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.339 
around since a lot earlier versions of
battlefield<00:02:27.670> 3<00:02:27.790> which<00:02:28.569> really<00:02:28.870> begs<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
battlefield 3 which really begs the

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.130 
battlefield 3 which really begs the
question<00:02:29.860> why<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.670> still<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.299> bug<00:02:31.660> if

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
question why is it still a bug if

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.410 
question why is it still a bug if
they've<00:02:32.470> known<00:02:32.769> about<00:02:32.799> it<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.579> last<00:02:33.610> four

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
they've known about it for the last four

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.930 
they've known about it for the last four
generations<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.620> game<00:02:35.860> as<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.760> see

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
generations of the game as you can see

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.059 
generations of the game as you can see
right<00:02:37.090> there<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:37.780> collided<00:02:38.230> he's<00:02:38.680> going

really important when you're driving
that<00:03:03.370> tank<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:04.709> when<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.829> can<00:03:06.010> actually<00:03:06.489> hear

apparently we have hybrid tank

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.620 
apparently we have hybrid tank
electric-powered<00:03:14.070> we<00:03:14.490> hear<00:03:14.790> when

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
electric-powered we hear when

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.990

environmentally friendly people we're
going<00:03:18.390> green<00:03:18.600> check<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.680> out

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
going green check it out

once again yep no engine in this bad boy

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.640 
once again yep no engine in this bad boy
now<00:03:26.700> problem<00:03:27.060> number<00:03:27.390> two<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.080> battlefield

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
now problem number two is in battlefield

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.000 
now problem number two is in battlefield
3<00:03:28.770> they<00:03:29.310> had<00:03:29.780> ridiculously<00:03:30.780> huge<00:03:31.230> tracer

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
3 they had ridiculously huge tracer

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.850 
3 they had ridiculously huge tracer
rounds<00:03:32.490> so<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.270> battlefield<00:03:33.780> 4<00:03:33.870> they<00:03:34.470> fixed

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
rounds so in battlefield 4 they fixed

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.180 
rounds so in battlefield 4 they fixed
that<00:03:34.920> problem<00:03:35.490> by<00:03:35.640> making<00:03:36.090> invisible<00:03:36.570> bullets

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
that problem by making invisible bullets

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.070 
that problem by making invisible bullets
check<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.310> out<00:03:38.490> how<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.720> hell<00:03:39.870> are<00:03:39.900> you

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
check it out how in the hell are you

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.350 
check it out how in the hell are you
supposed<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.440> see<00:03:40.650> what<00:03:40.830> you<00:03:40.980> hitting<00:03:41.360> when

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
supposed to see what you hitting when

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.440 
supposed to see what you hitting when
the<00:03:42.840> tracer<00:03:43.830> rounds<00:03:44.250> start<00:03:44.580> non-existent

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
the tracer rounds start non-existent

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.350 
the tracer rounds start non-existent
check<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.290> out<00:03:46.520> where's<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.760> bollocks

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
check it out where's the bollocks

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.020 
check it out where's the bollocks
perhaps<00:03:49.140> I'm<00:03:49.350> shooting<00:03:49.740> blanks<00:03:50.010> but<00:03:50.850> then

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
perhaps I'm shooting blanks but then

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.400 
perhaps I'm shooting blanks but then
again<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.300> wouldn't<00:03:51.600> have<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> kid<00:03:51.990> if<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.290> were

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
again I wouldn't have a kid if that were

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.610 
again I wouldn't have a kid if that were
true<00:03:52.560> either<00:03:52.770> would<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.630> well<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.959> guess<00:03:55.440> you

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
true either would it well I guess you

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.230 
true either would it well I guess you
just<00:03:55.650> have<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.100> guess<00:03:56.370> where<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.820> bullet<00:03:57.120> drop

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
just have to guess where the bullet drop

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.750 
just have to guess where the bullet drop
is<00:03:57.570> actually<00:03:58.470> landing<00:03:58.950> there<00:03:59.370> used<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.700> be

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
is actually landing there used to be

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.699 
is actually landing there used to be
little<00:04:00.090> tracer<00:04:00.630> round<00:04:00.870> but<00:04:01.140> at<00:04:01.170> some<00:04:01.470> point

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
little tracer round but at some point

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.110 
little tracer round but at some point
during<00:04:01.890> this<00:04:02.130> match<00:04:02.370> they<00:04:02.640> completely

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
during this match they completely

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.090 
during this match they completely
disappeared<00:04:06.050> now<00:04:07.050> this<00:04:07.200> next<00:04:07.410> clip<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.890> guys

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
disappeared now this next clip you guys

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.740 
disappeared now this next clip you guys
already<00:04:08.490> saw<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:08.940> beginning<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.450> this

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
already saw in the beginning of this

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.530 
already saw in the beginning of this
video<00:04:10.110> but<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:10.830> warrants<00:04:11.490> taking<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:12.060> second

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
video but it warrants taking a second

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.290 
video but it warrants taking a second
look<00:04:13.310> apparently<00:04:14.310> in<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.790> world<00:04:15.030> of

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
look apparently in the world of

look apparently in the world of
battlefield<00:04:16.080> 4<00:04:16.820> gravity<00:04:17.820> does<00:04:18.030> not<00:04:18.209> seem<00:04:18.570> to

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
battlefield 4 gravity does not seem to

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.949 
battlefield 4 gravity does not seem to
exist<00:04:19.140> as<00:04:19.350> we<00:04:19.739> know<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:20.130> today<00:04:20.359> or<00:04:21.359> maybe<00:04:21.780> there

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
exist as we know it today or maybe there

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.510 
exist as we know it today or maybe there
was<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.109> giant<00:04:22.320> tentacle<00:04:22.770> creature<00:04:22.919> pulling

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
was a giant tentacle creature pulling

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.610 
was a giant tentacle creature pulling
him<00:04:23.669> up<00:04:23.820> there<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.270> particularly<00:04:24.840> like<00:04:25.290> how<00:04:25.560> the
