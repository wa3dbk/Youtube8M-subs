about this one so how much does it cost

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.240 
about this one so how much does it cost
it's<00:00:35.820> currently<00:00:36.180> 800<00:00:36.840> gems<00:00:37.050> exactly<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> same

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
it's currently 800 gems exactly the same

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.420 
it's currently 800 gems exactly the same
as<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.430> mining<00:00:38.820> pickles<00:00:39.290> which<00:00:40.290> may<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:40.980> may

as the mining pickles which may or may
not<00:00:41.570> be<00:00:43.129> warranted<00:00:44.129> I'll<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.700> honest<00:00:45.000> it's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
not be warranted I'll be honest it's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.069 
not be warranted I'll be honest it's
harvesting<00:00:46.230> sickle<00:00:47.539> whatever<00:00:48.539> either<00:00:48.809> way

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
harvesting sickle whatever either way

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.869 
harvesting sickle whatever either way
you're<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> run<00:00:50.250> out<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.399> charges

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you're not going to run out of charges

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.290 
you're not going to run out of charges
so<00:00:51.180> once<00:00:51.420> again<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:52.129> completely<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:54.120> one

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
so once again it's completely it's one

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
so once again it's completely it's one
of<00:00:54.390> those<00:00:54.449> items<00:00:54.660> where<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.829> don't<00:00:55.949> need<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of those items where you don't need to

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.580 
of those items where you don't need to
bother<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:57.059> look<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.660> you've<00:00:57.899> got<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> sickle

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
bother to look if you've got a sickle

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
bother to look if you've got a sickle
anymore<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.789> necessarily<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> power

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
anymore it's not necessarily a power

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.310 
anymore it's not necessarily a power
upgrade<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:03.120> play<00:01:03.359> guild<00:01:03.629> wars<00:01:03.840> 2<00:01:04.049> for

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
upgrade but if you play guild wars 2 for

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.830 
upgrade but if you play guild wars 2 for
years<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.589> come<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.519> may<00:01:05.820> end<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.119> saving<00:01:06.450> some

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
years to come you may end up saving some

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.870 
years to come you may end up saving some
money<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.350> transfer<00:01:07.830> gold<00:01:08.130> into<00:01:08.640> gems

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
money if you transfer gold into gems

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
money if you transfer gold into gems
maybe<00:01:09.810> maybe<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.750> does<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.960> thing<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.260> any

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
maybe maybe so does this thing have any

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.480 
maybe maybe so does this thing have any
shiny<00:01:14.070> effect<00:01:14.780> yes<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.020> does<00:01:16.259> viewer<00:01:16.590> yes<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
shiny effect yes it does viewer yes it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.480 
shiny effect yes it does viewer yes it
does<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.240> go<00:01:18.570> ahead<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.780> equipped<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
does so go ahead and equipped it as you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.380 
does so go ahead and equipped it as you
can<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:22.280> doesn't<00:01:23.280> look<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.430> shiny<00:01:24.090> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
can see it doesn't look that shiny I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.149 
can see it doesn't look that shiny I
guess<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:27.710> we've<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.570> nice<00:01:31.159> reaping

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
guess but we've got a nice reaping

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.380 
guess but we've got a nice reaping
animation<00:01:33.140> which<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.530> little<00:01:34.799> odd

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
animation which is a little odd

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.840 
animation which is a little odd
you're<00:01:37.390> basically<00:01:37.540> mining<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:44.170> if<00:01:44.470> we<00:01:44.650> can

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you're basically mining so if we can

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.520 
you're basically mining so if we can
avoid<00:01:45.850> these<00:01:46.150> reef<00:01:46.450> riders<00:01:46.900> as<00:01:47.080> much<00:01:47.380> as

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
avoid these reef riders as much as

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.260 
avoid these reef riders as much as
possible<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:49.000> may<00:01:49.180> also<00:01:49.360> notice<00:01:51.090> let's<00:01:52.090> get

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
possible you may also notice let's get

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:01.170 
possible you may also notice let's get
rid<00:01:52.510> of<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.720> reef<00:01:52.900> rider<00:01:59.640> southland<00:02:00.640> still<00:02:01.150> a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
rid of the reef rider southland still a

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.840 
rid of the reef rider southland still a
little<00:02:01.360> laggy<00:02:01.720> but<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.979> notice<00:02:03.340> if<00:02:03.550> you<00:02:03.610> look

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
little laggy but you notice if you look

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.240 
little laggy but you notice if you look
closely<00:02:04.270> at<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.600> passiflora<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.860> actually

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
closely at the passiflora you actually

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.940 
closely at the passiflora you actually
get<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.729> watery<00:02:07.540> animation<00:02:08.080> as<00:02:08.200> well<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:11.709> quite

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
get a watery animation as well not quite

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.650 
get a watery animation as well not quite
as<00:02:12.070> in-your-face<00:02:12.250> as<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.940> molten<00:02:13.270> pickaxe

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
as in-your-face as the molten pickaxe

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.040 
as in-your-face as the molten pickaxe
but<00:02:14.230> still<00:02:14.950> relatively<00:02:15.310> nice<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.880> don't<00:02:16.720> fully

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
but still relatively nice I don't fully

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.400 
but still relatively nice I don't fully
understand<00:02:17.560> why<00:02:17.770> we're<00:02:17.980> now<00:02:18.160> completely

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
understand why we're now completely

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.050 
understand why we're now completely
destroying<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.740> reaping<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.340> plan<00:02:21.550> instead

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
destroying and reaping the plan instead

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.530 
destroying and reaping the plan instead
of<00:02:22.209> just<00:02:22.360> picking<00:02:22.600> from<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.080> but<00:02:23.320> never<00:02:24.220> mind

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
of just picking from it but never mind

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.699 
of just picking from it but never mind
