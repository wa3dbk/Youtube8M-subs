00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.360
 some guys say the playboy tells you 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.400
 they say it's the fashion guy I think 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.070
 that when he signed the club he placed a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.439
 mirror in the locker room so you can look at yourself 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.240
 of every two times the manchester is 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.189
 you can see ronaldo's picture for all 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.839
 parts but the player does not come out much 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.939
 the city ​​however whenever you can 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.570
 he likes to behave like any 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.570
 other kids his age 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.680
 and would not leave Friday 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.850
 I could because I have a match on Saturday 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.840
 we all have to adapt to our 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.700
 lifetime 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.380
 in this case we go out when we can by 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.510
 example if I have a match on Saturday and 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.190
 I have the book on Sunday I can leave the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.270
 Saturday without problems I can go out to dinner 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.160
 or go to a bar 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.020

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.399
 and his friend Roger I are the managers 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.399
 to open them all 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.000
 It's scary many girls who send 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.070
 wedding rings it 's great that they had 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.330
 wedding rings and dress up as brides 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.460
 using 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.110

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.530

 receive letters from jamaica thailand 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.990
 Brazil is amazing 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.880
 the story of ronaldo's life is a 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.159
 example for all the children of the world 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.650
 it's good to have dreams and believe that you can 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.960
 come true in the place where everything 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.190
 Andorinha started all the children 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.190
 they want to be ronaldos 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.860
 and everyone dreams of getting what he has 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.899
 got Christian in his neighborhood of 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.580
 madeira as elsewhere the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.500
 dreams are the same for all your 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.039
 inhabitants all want to be like 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.039

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:26.550
 I would like to be like him 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.260
 you contreras a lot yes in which it seems not 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.410
 but I think it would come to have his style 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.450
 my career took him to this position 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.520
 liked it's great I also wanted 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.520

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.749

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.890
 how could a great coach like 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.379
 mourinho I think so and a mother never 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.780
 he is wrong about his children and 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:58.080
 imagine the role of father 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.260
 if he will be a great father and he will be very 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.260
 proud 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.640
 God has granted him a gift but we have 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.640
 shed many tears along the way 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.300
 and only his ambition and determination have 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.430
 made the dream come true 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.830
