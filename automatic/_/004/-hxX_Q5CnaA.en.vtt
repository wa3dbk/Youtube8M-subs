we started the company in my house we

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.669 
we started the company in my house we
didn't<00:00:18.420> have<00:00:18.539> enough<00:00:18.749> electric<00:00:19.140> power<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.589> the

didn't have enough electric power in the

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:20.870 
didn't have enough electric power in the
house<00:00:19.830> at<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.099> certain<00:00:20.339> point<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.609> only<00:00:20.730> had

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
house at a certain point we only had

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.720 
house at a certain point we only had
about<00:00:20.970> four<00:00:21.119> employees<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.829> but<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.579> already

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
about four employees then but we already

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.429 
about four employees then but we already
had<00:00:23.939> enough<00:00:24.210> computers<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.050> computer

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
had enough computers and computer

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.769 
had enough computers and computer
servers<00:00:25.919> who<00:00:26.519> had<00:00:26.669> to<00:00:26.789> string<00:00:27.210> these<00:00:27.390> big

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779

orange<00:00:28.109> electric<00:00:28.949> extension<00:00:29.579> cords<00:00:29.909> from

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:29.999 
orange electric extension cords from

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.669 
orange electric extension cords from
every<00:00:30.329> room<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> house<00:00:30.989> to<00:00:31.019> get<00:00:31.409> enough

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
every room in the house to get enough

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310 
every room in the house to get enough
power<00:00:32.150> into<00:00:33.150> the<00:00:33.239> room<00:00:33.390> where<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> office<00:00:34.079> was

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
power into the room where the office was

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.779 
power into the room where the office was
so<00:00:34.560> we<00:00:34.680> were<00:00:34.739> basically<00:00:35.100> all<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> circuit

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
so we were basically all the circuit

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.220 
so we were basically all the circuit
breakers<00:00:36.180> were<00:00:36.300> flipping<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.780> couldn't<00:00:37.050> plug

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
breakers were flipping we couldn't plug

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.439 
breakers were flipping we couldn't plug
a<00:00:37.289> vacuum<00:00:38.280> cleaner<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.760> anywhere<00:00:39.120> without

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
a vacuum cleaner in anywhere without

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:40.910 
a vacuum cleaner in anywhere without
flipping<00:00:39.690> all<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> circuit<00:00:40.379> breakers<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:40.769> we

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
flipping all the circuit breakers so we

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.590 
flipping all the circuit breakers so we
finally<00:00:41.219> had<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.519> move<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.910> real<00:00:42.149> office

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
finally had to move to a real office

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.090 
finally had to move to a real office
when<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.730> launched<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> store<00:00:45.350> we<00:00:46.350> made<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
when we launched the store we made a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 
when we launched the store we made a
very<00:00:47.640> early<00:00:48.059> mistake<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.260> my

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
very early mistake it's one of my

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.860 
very early mistake it's one of my
favorite<00:00:49.859> software<00:00:50.730> bugs<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.149> all<00:00:51.269> time

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
favorite software bugs of all time

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.319 
favorite software bugs of all time
we<00:00:52.109> found<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.649> customers<00:00:53.550> could<00:00:53.910> order<00:00:54.089> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
we found that customers could order a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.279 
we found that customers could order a
negative<00:00:55.199> quantity<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:56.219> books<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:58.140> would

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
negative quantity of books and we would

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.739 
negative quantity of books and we would
credit<00:00:58.620> their<00:00:58.859> credit<00:00:59.429> card<00:00:59.670> with<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.420> price

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
credit their credit card with the price

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.200 
credit their credit card with the price
and<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.079> assume<00:01:01.379> wait<00:01:02.280> around<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.820> them<00:01:02.999> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and I assume wait around for them to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.609 
and I assume wait around for them to
ship<00:01:03.449> us<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.899> books<00:01:05.150> we<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.990> fixed<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.409> one

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
ship us the books we we fixed that one

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.760 
ship us the books we we fixed that one
it's<00:01:08.250> fixed<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.869> we<00:01:09.869> made<00:01:10.259> a<00:01:10.290> bunch<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.619> other

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it's fixed and we made a bunch of other

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.289 
it's fixed and we made a bunch of other
mistakes<00:01:11.189> over<00:01:11.490> time<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:11.880> we've<00:01:11.970> learned<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
mistakes over time but we've learned a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.390 
mistakes over time but we've learned a

I remember you know they were probably

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
I remember you know they were probably
half<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.909> dozen<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.390> ten<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> us<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> company

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
is that you need to obsess over

like to start with customers and work

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.890 
like to start with customers and work
backwards<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:43.980> again<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.210> is<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.690> key

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
backwards and again that is the key

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.410 
backwards and again that is the key
thing<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.980> know<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.490> covers<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> lot<00:02:48.240> of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
thing that I know and it covers a lot of

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.690 
thing that I know and it covers a lot of
other<00:02:48.570> mistakes<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.290> you're<00:02:49.440> truly<00:02:50.010> obsessed

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
other mistakes if you're truly obsessed

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.090 
other mistakes if you're truly obsessed
over<00:02:51.090> customers<00:02:51.690> it'll<00:02:52.320> cover<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.650> lot<00:02:52.920> of

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
over customers it'll cover a lot of

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.170 
over customers it'll cover a lot of
errors<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:54.660> second<00:02:55.050> thing<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.320> know<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:59.180> invent

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
errors the second thing I know is invent

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.400 
errors the second thing I know is invent
it's<00:03:00.900> really<00:03:01.260> important<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.920> invent<00:03:03.410> anytime

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
it's really important to invent anytime

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.440 
it's really important to invent anytime
we<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.710> a<00:03:04.770> problem<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.700> never<00:03:05.940> accept

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
we have a problem we never accept

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.990 
we have a problem we never accept
either/or<00:03:06.870> thinking<00:03:07.410> we<00:03:08.280> try<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.610> figure<00:03:08.850> out

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
either/or thinking we try to figure out

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.900 
either/or thinking we try to figure out
a<00:03:09.330> solution<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:10.560> gets<00:03:10.890> both<00:03:11.220> things<00:03:11.580> and

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
a solution that gets both things and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.090 
a solution that gets both things and
that<00:03:12.660> often<00:03:12.960> requires<00:03:13.290> invention<00:03:13.800> but<00:03:13.920> you

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
that often requires invention but you

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.430 
that often requires invention but you
can<00:03:14.250> invent<00:03:14.580> your<00:03:14.790> way<00:03:14.970> out<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.360> any<00:03:15.690> box<00:03:16.080> if

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
can invent your way out of any box if

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.830 
can invent your way out of any box if
you<00:03:17.010> believe<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.700> can<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.240> what<00:03:18.690> we

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
you believe that you can and what we

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.720 
you believe that you can and what we
talk<00:03:19.050> about<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.440> inventing<00:03:19.980> on<00:03:20.130> behalf<00:03:20.490> of

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
talk about is inventing on behalf of

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.600 
talk about is inventing on behalf of
customers<00:03:21.140> it's<00:03:22.140> not<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.350> customer's<00:03:22.920> job<00:03:23.310> to

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
customers it's not a customer's job to

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.630 
customers it's not a customer's job to
invent<00:03:24.000> on<00:03:24.180> up<00:03:24.450> for<00:03:24.840> themselves<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:26.340> need<00:03:26.490> to

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
invent on up for themselves you need to

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.120 
invent on up for themselves you need to
listen<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.180> customers<00:03:27.720> it's<00:03:27.960> critical<00:03:28.440> if<00:03:29.010> you

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
listen to customers it's critical if you

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.620 
listen to customers it's critical if you
don't<00:03:29.340> listen<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.700> customers<00:03:29.970> who<00:03:30.390> will<00:03:30.480> go

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
don't listen to customers who will go

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.390 
don't listen to customers who will go
astray<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.620> they<00:03:31.770> won't<00:03:32.010> tell<00:03:32.250> you

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
astray but they won't tell you

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.610 
astray but they won't tell you
everything<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.210> so<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.660> need<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.930> invent<00:03:34.410> on

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
everything and so you need to invent on

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.280 
everything and so you need to invent on
their<00:03:34.770> behalf<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.910> focus<00:03:36.510> on<00:03:36.630> invention

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
their behalf and that focus on invention

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.530 
their behalf and that focus on invention
has<00:03:37.710> served<00:03:38.460> as<00:03:38.580> well<00:03:38.730> some<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.150> recent

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
has served as well some of the recent

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.310 
has served as well some of the recent
things<00:03:39.750> even<00:03:40.710> a<00:03:40.860> Kindle<00:03:41.760> not<00:03:42.660> just<00:03:42.900> Kendall

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
are things that we would have never

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.010 
are things that we would have never
gotten<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.940> if<00:03:48.090> we<00:03:48.210> didn't<00:03:48.450> have<00:03:48.540> an<00:03:48.690> inventive

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
culture but also those are kind of large

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.790 
culture but also those are kind of large
grain<00:03:51.720> things<00:03:52.080> but<00:03:52.230> there<00:03:52.380> are<00:03:52.440> small<00:03:52.770> things

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
grain things but there are small things

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.540 
grain things but there are small things
too<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.750> then<00:03:56.390> think<00:03:57.390> long<00:03:57.660> term<00:03:58.250> this<00:03:59.250> is

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
too and then think long term this is

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.080 
too and then think long term this is
really<00:04:00.300> critical<00:04:01.290> any<00:04:02.220> company<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:02.940> wants

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
to think long term and it's actually

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.620 
to think long term and it's actually
much<00:04:13.440> rarer<00:04:13.800> than<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.220> might<00:04:14.430> think<00:04:14.460> I<00:04:15.060> find

that most of the initiatives we

that most of the initiatives we

and seven year time frames really is
very<00:04:38.310> very<00:04:38.669> useful<00:04:39.830> for<00:04:40.830> us<00:04:41.009> and<00:04:41.280> it's

definitely one of the things that I know

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.209 
definitely one of the things that I know
it<00:04:44.340> requires<00:04:44.849> by<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.270> way<00:04:45.509> and<00:04:46.379> allows<00:04:46.740> a

inventions that we undertake may be if

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.339 
inventions that we undertake may be if
they're<00:04:54.030> disruptive<00:04:54.569> anyway<00:04:54.930> they<00:04:55.110> may<00:04:55.229> not

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
it's always been very important for us

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.709 
it's always been very important for us
to<00:04:59.340> think<00:04:59.610> long<00:04:59.819> term<00:04:59.849> so<00:05:00.330> that<00:05:00.449> we<00:05:00.539> can

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
to think long term so that we can

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.140 
to think long term so that we can

we think we're right then we continue if

we think we're right then we continue if
we<00:05:20.879> think<00:05:21.090> we're<00:05:21.240> wrong<00:05:21.449> if<00:05:21.659> we're<00:05:21.810> criticized

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
we think we're wrong if we're criticized

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.540 
we think we're wrong if we're criticized
about<00:05:22.469> something<00:05:22.889> we<00:05:22.979> think<00:05:23.099> we're<00:05:23.279> wrong<00:05:23.370> we

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
about something we think we're wrong we

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.200 
about something we think we're wrong we
change<00:05:23.879> it<00:05:24.060> we<00:05:24.539> fix<00:05:25.050> it<00:05:25.259> so<00:05:25.860> it's<00:05:26.610> important<00:05:27.090> to

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
change it we fix it so it's important to

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.580 
change it we fix it so it's important to
really<00:05:27.360> think<00:05:27.479> about<00:05:27.900> those<00:05:28.110> things<00:05:28.319> but

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
really think about those things but

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.019 
really think about those things but
never<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:29.189> buckle<00:05:30.029> to<00:05:30.240> sort<00:05:30.509> of<00:05:30.770> kind<00:05:31.770> of

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
never to buckle to sort of kind of

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.670 
never to buckle to sort of kind of
standard<00:05:33.029> kinds<00:05:33.509> of<00:05:33.599> pressures<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.319> come<00:05:34.500> on

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
standard kinds of pressures that come on

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.649 
standard kinds of pressures that come on
that<00:05:34.860> really<00:05:35.039> for<00:05:35.370> short-term<00:05:36.000> thinking<00:05:36.479> and

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
that really for short-term thinking and

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.110 
that really for short-term thinking and
it's<00:05:37.169> a<00:05:37.289> huge<00:05:37.650> competitive<00:05:38.250> advantage<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.819> be

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
it's a huge competitive advantage to be

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.969 
it's a huge competitive advantage to be
able<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.360> think<00:05:39.629> long<00:05:39.870> term<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.319> you<00:05:40.710> get<00:05:40.860> to

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
able to think long term and you get to

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.200 
able to think long term and you get to
serve<00:05:41.190> customers<00:05:41.520> much<00:05:42.000> better<00:05:42.349> all<00:05:43.349> right

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
serve customers much better all right
