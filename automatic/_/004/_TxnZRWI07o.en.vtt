00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.840
 Hard disk drive

 It is wd garden tsutsuya 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.000
 I bought 3 terabytes of 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.150

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.590

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:55.450
 It's been around 2 months, but 8256 is a built-in ssd 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.600
 After all video editing 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.890
 As soon as you are 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.760
 It's become filled 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.720
 I wonder if it will transfer data here 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:14.440
 I bought a backup too 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.940
 I ca n't get a backup because I don't want to take it 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.550
 I think I will take it 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.750
 Some 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.190
 th 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.860
 Of course there were product candidates 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.720
 First of all 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.190
 In the manner of about Keller in place but is a good tan even in the Well List 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.190
 Of course the price is cheap 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.030
 Well portable 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.750
 It is a guy that power does not need separately by type 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.750
 usb 3.0 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.229
 Than I say the sun 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.960
 Among them, squeeze some of them and the price is cheap 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.790
 Here 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.290
 I bought it 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.510
 Wearing on 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.050
 It is better to take power separately from the outlet 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.350
 Oh Kedomo more cheap is I have a full course 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.679
 The good I portable little 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.560
 Tax in the in the did not'm supposed 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.360
 I think that is quite cheap 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.620
 In the model of Ekko 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.849
 10,000 in raw computer 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.849
 I wondered if it was about 3000 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.490
 Pop 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.900
 Product was with Yes 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.600
 Such an introductory meeting 3 to say 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.090
 3.0 The main body 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.780
 it's here 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.510
 Yeah have in 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.659
 With the guy I bought 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.689
 iodata cherry maybe hard disk 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.950
 Well, even though I'm thinking here but I know 1 temple 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.950
 Comparing the size here 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.470
 From here 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.160
 Is it a sense of one degree larger? 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.450
 After all the weight is quite heavy 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.900
 Because it is a schedule 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.980
 I wonder if it contains 82 pieces 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.980
 I think for a moment 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:17.380
 The surface is 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:17.380
 It feels like a matte black? Here is a port of usb 3.0, otherwise 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.640
 There is nothing 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.440
 By say 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:31.350
 Basically 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:36.720
 As we plan to use as storage place of moving picture data or photograph data 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:42.460
 Because good even Well portable so does not mean Tteyuu use in leave and is always 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:45.840
 Is better, of course, power is something if you want to much Well know Panashi was attached to another 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.950
 'M not so well but will do good for the hard disk 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.950
 I think it's good 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:56.670
 Well I 'm singing that Mac sun 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:02.220
 Well, I think that I do not need to separate this side though 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:09.040
 It 's nice to say that it is written well so it's 3 terabytes 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:11.790
 It Well 240 hours large amount that's moving image data and 500,000 songs a 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.800
 The photograph is 400,000 yen 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.389
 Well normally you Yes to 1 times 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:26.260
 who is but error is I think that there is no need to look to use a building PC 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.150
 This time a little with a margin tried to kera models 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.190
 Yes 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.630
 Well after all the say usb 3.0 is about 10 times as compared to 2.0 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.240
 Speed is 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.910
 Than say different 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.930
 Yes, this is a point I can't remove too. 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.490
 I don't know 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.610
 There are thunderbolt compatible r disks 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.430
 It was good though 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.850
 It is expensive for orders of magnitude 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.970
 So I gave up this time 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.460
 It was the type of usb 3.0 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:06.020
 Yes, so the impact 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.979
 An introduction to portable digital hard disk drive of western digital 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.979
 Well then
