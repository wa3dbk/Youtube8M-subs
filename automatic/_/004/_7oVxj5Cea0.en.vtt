actually<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.079> yourself<00:01:52.590> as<00:01:52.799> well<00:01:52.970> so

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
let's see if I'm actually able to use my

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.179 
let's see if I'm actually able to use my
alphabets<00:01:56.969> correctly<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.619> doesn't<00:01:58.920> look

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
alphabets correctly and I doesn't look

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.429 
alphabets correctly and I doesn't look
like<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.490> am<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.240> uh<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.930> go<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.350> I'm

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
called default build and what I've done

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.949 
called default build and what I've done
is<00:02:07.770> put<00:02:08.610> all<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.970> items<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.599> whatever

is put all of the items in whatever
order<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.619> prefer<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.370> these<00:02:11.879> particular

groups

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.590 
groups
and<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:14.070> looks<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.550> way<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.730> saw<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.210> in<00:02:15.390> the

what you have to do is just leave it as

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.630 
what you have to do is just leave it as
any<00:02:27.630> mode<00:02:27.900> because<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:28.770> think<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.190> doesn't<00:02:29.370> work

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
any mode because I think it doesn't work

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.340 
any mode because I think it doesn't work
if<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.940> try<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.240> select<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.720> mode<00:02:30.900> currently

if you try and select the mode currently

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.380 
if you try and select the mode currently
but<00:02:31.950> then<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.250> need<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.580> push<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.270> little

I'm not sure what what happens if you
create<00:02:43.320> new<00:02:43.470> builds<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.800> haven't<00:02:44.040> actually

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
create new builds I haven't actually

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.070 
create new builds I haven't actually
done<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.210> main<00:02:45.390> thing<00:02:45.570> I'm<00:02:45.720> concerned

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
not really going to go into detail

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.320 
not really going to go into detail
because<00:02:56.460> I<00:02:56.610> don't<00:02:56.760> want<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.940> make<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.180> video

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
because I don't want to make this video

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
very long but I just wanted to show that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.850 
very long but I just wanted to show that
it's<00:03:00.360> actually<00:03:00.480> very<00:03:01.290> simple<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.830> just

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
it's actually very simple you just

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.140 
it's actually very simple you just
essentially<00:03:02.580> drag<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.060> items<00:03:03.360> over<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:05.150> what

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
essentially drag the items over and what

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.440 
essentially drag the items over and what
I<00:03:06.180> also<00:03:06.450> have<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:07.350> case<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.740> need<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
I also have in case I need it is the the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.540 
I also have in case I need it is the the
items<00:03:09.840> window<00:03:10.320> from<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.920> League<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.220> Legends

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
items window from the League of Legends

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.790 
items window from the League of Legends
website<00:03:12.000> pulled<00:03:12.330> up<00:03:12.510> if<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:13.290> know<00:03:13.380> for<00:03:13.650> some

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
website pulled up if you know for some

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.350 
website pulled up if you know for some
reason<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:14.070> need<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.220> look<00:03:14.400> at<00:03:14.580> like<00:03:14.760> what<00:03:14.790> items

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
reason I need to look at like what items

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.750 
reason I need to look at like what items
building<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.780> what<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:17.250> might<00:03:17.430> help<00:03:17.580> you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
building to what and that might help you

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.600 
building to what and that might help you
out<00:03:17.790> as<00:03:18.090> well<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.950> take<00:03:20.100> care<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.400> that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
out as well to to to take care of that

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.640 
out as well to to to take care of that
so<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.540> actually<00:03:21.660> very<00:03:21.959> simple<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.440> just

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
so it's actually very simple you just

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.010 
so it's actually very simple you just
drag<00:03:23.040> over<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.340> items<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:23.970> then<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.930> know

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
drag over the items and then you know

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.350 
drag over the items and then you know
you<00:03:25.110> can<00:03:25.470> create<00:03:26.160> whatever<00:03:26.550> builds<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.120> want

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
you can create whatever builds you want

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.449
