00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.630 
the world about what has been our past
yes<00:01:58.290> we've<00:01:58.560> had<00:01:58.710> some<00:01:58.950> good<00:01:59.159> things<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.520> happen

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
yes we've had some good things to happen

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.090 
yes we've had some good things to happen
in<00:01:59.850> our<00:01:59.970> past<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:00.990> think<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.070> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
in our past but I think that it is a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.850 
in our past but I think that it is a
state<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.549> being<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> drug<00:02:04.259> addict<00:02:04.649> for

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
state of being like a drug addict for

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.429 
state of being like a drug addict for
America<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.460> act<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.570> racism's<00:02:07.290> are

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
America to act like the racism's are

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.219 
America to act like the racism's are
never<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.770> part<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.429> our<00:02:08.989> historical<00:02:09.989> and

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
never a part of our historical and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.020 
never a part of our historical and
social<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.370> end<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:11.610> don't<00:02:11.730> think<00:02:11.940> we<00:02:12.000> should

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
social the end I don't think we should

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.670 
social the end I don't think we should
deny<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.510> either<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.019> I<00:02:13.079> think<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.380> should<00:02:13.530> be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
deny it either but I think it should be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.830 
deny it either but I think it should be
