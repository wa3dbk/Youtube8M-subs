 previous I saw him in the gringa community 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.690
 or Canadian probably 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.270
 there are many doctors in English 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.910
 Canadians 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.130
 of English community of book tube is 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.500
 a translation and I bring them here is 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.110
 called the desert island are five 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.980
 categories and then let's start 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.470
 first it is a book to reread I want 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.620

 I'm going to have it I hope so as I already 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.620
 had said in the first book such I think 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.989
 I like it because there are many aspects 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.910
 to analyze chose political sos 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.800
 social things well good 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.469
 It would be a very good option to reread and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 make the second book that you have not 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.239

 with these details that you can feel 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.740
 what it says 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.659

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:43.569
 images all this when you come across 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.569
 with the words for the first time 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.720
 for example here all these are images 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.120
 of the clock hugo and the first words 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.430
 that there are so that they continue what 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.350
 the images told us you start to 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.880
 read where the images stay 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.010
 the images return and the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.380
 words I am a very nice number and I have 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.180
 I really want to read it when I put the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.590
 ready for the book will be when I put 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.330
 all the answers still did not have it 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.840
 I have not read it because I'm reading 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.840
 other things like the second book 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.830
 as well as the second the third is a 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.850
 book series grip 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:27.740
 yesterday you eat it from two novels that have been 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.390
 left or going to serve and be in scads 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.120
 are two of the four novels of the 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.040
 others are broken stories and also this one or 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.010
 well what is inside this one is 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.290
 superador of families and not only 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.510
 a series of very interesting books 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.910
 but it is entertaining smart and 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.190
 has all these parts well almost over 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.690
 Sherlock and his way of being that I 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.880
 they like it a lot and I think that's why I 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.800
 like the series so much and that's why 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.620
 obviously in this commit there are many 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.730
 other series that I like but I thought 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.700
 I do not know why that first question 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.409

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:10.730
 the first book I read yesterday I love this one 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:13.970
 it's from a school library but I 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.090

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.060
 small is 186 pages is very small 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.370

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.379

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.470
