00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that's what I've seen online when I do

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.420 
that's what I've seen online when I do
our<00:00:44.070> research<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:44.940> one<00:00:45.510> scoop<00:00:45.899> has

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
our research on it but one scoop has

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
our research on it but one scoop has
nearly<00:00:47.430> 400<00:00:48.090> grams<00:00:48.390> milligrams<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.469> caffeine

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
never took a pre-workout with this one I

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.200 
never took a pre-workout with this one I
would<00:01:19.680> suggest<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.490> starting<00:01:20.939> off<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
would suggest not starting off with a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
would suggest not starting off with a
full<00:01:21.479> scoop<00:01:21.810> though<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.650> could<00:01:22.799> probably<00:01:22.950> be

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
full scoop though you could probably be

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.270 
full scoop though you could probably be
you'd<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.090> fine<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.930> quarter<00:01:25.439> scoop<00:01:25.799> yeah

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you'd be fine with a quarter scoop yeah

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.399 
you'd be fine with a quarter scoop yeah
it's<00:01:26.549> best<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.180> sense<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:27.840> stimulants

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it's best if you sense of two stimulants

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
it's best if you sense of two stimulants
but<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.650> you've<00:01:28.799> been<00:01:28.920> taking<00:01:29.130> jack<00:01:29.610> or<00:01:29.850> c4

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
but if you've been taking jack or c4

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.140 
but if you've been taking jack or c4
before<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.930> mean<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.070> could<00:01:32.369> go<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.880> one

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
before I mean you could go with the one

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.600 
before I mean you could go with the one
scoop<00:01:33.530> but<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.650> probably<00:01:34.890> still<00:01:35.220> better<00:01:35.520> off

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
scoop but you probably still better off

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.149 
scoop but you probably still better off
