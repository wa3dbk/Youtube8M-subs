00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 in this tutorial we will show you how 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.210
 change or hide your ip address this 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.620
 it serves to be able to navigate in the web 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.389
 Anonymously 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.389
 if you are interested, keep watching this video 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.060
 but then to begin dear ones 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.789
 friends that are on their screens let's 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.230
 to go to a page just to be the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.570
 I will give the description of the video and 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.220
 that's what it's called see my bing.com gm and 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.870
 dot com 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.750
 and as you can see here its 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.870
 ip address and but you will say it is 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.030
 IP adress 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.579
 although it means good for what it does not 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.450
 know in ip direction means internet 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.790
 protocol 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.550
 and what that means is the protocol 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.950
 internet or that each computer every 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.670
 cellular whatever it is you have when you have 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.219
 internet access 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.859
 this when you connect to the internet 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.360
 system or the internet gives a number 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.000
 specified 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.840
 of address several numbers are 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.840
 really like 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:16.030
 with 12-13 digits then that number 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.280
 each computer has one and never but 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.750
 they can never be the same or a 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.150
 computer has that same number and 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.700
 another also not that is impossible there is a 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.570
 good mistake then that 's the address 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.360
 good ip then we stop talking and 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.300
 we are going to download the application that is going to 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.710
 hide the ip address and that is here 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.130
 they will go to www 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.280
 point by project.org that can be 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.290
 leave in the description of the video and here 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.420
 they are really going to choose in this little 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.380
 menu if it appears in English 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.719
 Manent be Spanish 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.030
 I do not know if they speak Italian or German 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.520
 French whatever but I in this case 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.670
 double Spanish 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.179
 then we are going to give you the button 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.179
 discharge 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.740
 a small window will appear like this 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.040
 They keep and install it as I do not 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.050
 they install it because this really only 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.690
 is a package that is extracted good when 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.340
 have extracted and I for example 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.890
 bleach is to bring it here I already have 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.410
 installed and we click here and you 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.530
 we click right sorry we give double 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.920
 click and start this control panel to 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.530
 load 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.540
 If you have this as root 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.450
 quiet what this is doing for 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.780
 control is useful by authenticating 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.410
 found that this page and authenticated 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.080
 and transmitting an ip address or better 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.540
 known as encrypting the address 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.000
 ip this what will do this then 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.319
 this usually takes a bit then 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.799
 let's do this a little faster 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.780
 and this little ok when this appears 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.659
 small symbol as of a leaf or 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.370
 onion I do not know what this then they 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.519
 it will appear that you have already connected to the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.739
 thor network and momentarily every one 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.620
 a minute later this page will appear 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.140
 that was congratulation is your browser and 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.940
 is configured for a sector 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.590
 and let's play if it's true if we changed 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.990
 the direction of pp for schumacher to the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.990
 same page that already no dot com 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.530
 and we have changed the ip address 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.569
 then as they saw it could already be changed 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.700
 the ip address then 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.530
 the advantage of changing the 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.670
 IP adress 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.830
 when to change your ip address 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.080
 the only advantage of exclusive for 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.540
 example if you come in guatemala and 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.370
 Nicaragua will be able to access 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.860
 Pages that are blocked in your country 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.739
 for example to put a small example 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.970
 on youtube there is this page that calls 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.370
 on youtube.com 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.040
 partners that is only enabled 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.319
 for countries of mexico argentina de usa 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.180
 so the advantage is that if you 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.790
 come other countries are going to be able to apply 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.069
 for a partner project for example 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.390
 in this case and you logically 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.700
 they have to have their account enough 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.550
 view if you have a lot of 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.489
 subscribers and so on then you can 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.500
