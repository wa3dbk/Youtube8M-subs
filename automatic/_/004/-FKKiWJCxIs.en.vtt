00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
so right here I plugged up these two sub

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.450 
so right here I plugged up these two sub
holes<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.200> noisy<00:01:25.460> with

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
holes because it's kind of noisy with

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
holes because it's kind of noisy with
some<00:01:26.700> pool<00:01:26.880> noodle<00:01:27.180> foam<00:01:27.360> I'm<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> plug

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
some pool noodle foam I'm going to plug

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
some pool noodle foam I'm going to plug
these<00:01:28.259> up<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.590> realest<00:01:28.860> cover<00:01:29.070> plugs<00:01:29.369> I'm

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
these up with realest cover plugs I'm

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.789 
these up with realest cover plugs I'm
thinking<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.259> take<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:31.590> real

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
thinking just so I can take it out real

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.780 
thinking just so I can take it out real
quick<00:01:31.829> because<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.340> can't<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:32.640> take

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
quick because you can't really take

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.170 
quick because you can't really take
these<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.770> yeah<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.549> only<00:01:35.759> downside

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
these out but yeah the only downside

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.120 
these out but yeah the only downside
right<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.689> they're<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:37.049> noisy<00:01:37.439> but

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
right now is they're really noisy but

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.149 
right now is they're really noisy but
that's<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.700> an<00:01:38.820> easily<00:01:39.299> fixed<00:01:39.750> problem<00:01:40.159> then

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that's like an easily fixed problem then

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.350 
that's like an easily fixed problem then
we<00:01:41.250> got<00:01:41.430> pedal<00:01:41.909> holder<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.729> got<00:01:45.890> tank<00:01:46.890> well
