fun<00:00:17.820> thing<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.029> they<00:00:18.210> did<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.510> only<00:00:18.960> give<00:00:19.109> us

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
fun thing that they did is only give us

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.080 
fun thing that they did is only give us
one<00:00:19.500> spawn<00:00:19.830> point<00:00:20.070> which<00:00:20.250> means<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.609> all<00:00:20.820> of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
one spawn point which means that all of

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.730 
one spawn point which means that all of
our<00:00:21.240> my<00:00:21.449> units<00:00:21.779> spawn<00:00:22.020> there<00:00:22.260> which<00:00:22.410> already

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
our my units spawn there which already

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.290 
our my units spawn there which already
makes<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.220> kind<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.490> epic<00:00:23.670> feeling<00:00:23.939> they<00:00:24.119> are

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
makes the kind of epic feeling they are

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.359 
makes the kind of epic feeling they are
capturing<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.140> do<00:00:25.560> not<00:00:25.680> need<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.949> focus<00:00:26.130> on

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
capturing that I do not need to focus on

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.019 
capturing that I do not need to focus on
that<00:00:26.550> at<00:00:26.760> all<00:00:28.490> now<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.820> where<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that at all now this is where it

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.410 
that at all now this is where it
branches<00:00:30.150> off

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.069 

oh<00:00:37.220> now<00:00:38.220> it's<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:39.920> I<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
oh now it's going I like the the

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.500 
oh now it's going I like the the
lighting<00:00:43.079> effects<00:00:43.440> though<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.449> for<00:00:45.449> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
lighting effects though for the for the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:55.080 
lighting effects though for the for the
mod

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.580 

there<00:00:56.090> are<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.240> lot<00:00:56.390> of<00:00:56.420> command<00:00:57.080> posts<00:00:57.350> I<00:00:57.410> think

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
there are a lot of command posts I think

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.400 
there are a lot of command posts I think
that's<00:00:57.710> kind<00:00:57.890> of<00:00:57.920> fun<00:00:58.720> some<00:00:59.720> corridors<00:01:00.140> are

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
that's kind of fun some corridors are

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.620 
that's kind of fun some corridors are
also<00:01:00.559> kind<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.130> long<00:01:01.550> which<00:01:02.239> means<00:01:02.480> that

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
also kind of long which means that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.750 
also kind of long which means that
they're<00:01:02.750> dangerous<00:01:02.900> but<00:01:03.610> rewarding<00:01:04.610> because

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
they're dangerous but rewarding because

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.200 
they're dangerous but rewarding because
they<00:01:05.000> flank<00:01:05.300> really<00:01:05.540> well<00:01:09.700> which<00:01:10.700> is<00:01:10.880> good<00:01:11.030> for

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
they flank really well which is good for

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.760 
they flank really well which is good for
balance<00:01:11.630> because<00:01:11.930> that<00:01:12.110> means<00:01:12.260> that<00:01:12.440> you<00:01:12.740> have

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
balance because that means that you have

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.650 
balance because that means that you have
a<00:01:12.890> high<00:01:13.070> chance<00:01:13.340> of<00:01:13.550> taking<00:01:13.760> over<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.180> for

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
a high chance of taking over a for

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.290 
a high chance of taking over a for
example<00:01:14.960> knowing<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.590> enemy<00:01:16.340> command<00:01:17.030> post

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
example knowing that enemy command post

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.469 
example knowing that enemy command post
but<00:01:18.640> because<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.790> takes<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:20.150> long<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.300> get

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
but because it takes so long to get

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.420 
but because it takes so long to get
there<00:01:20.660> if<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:20.930> get<00:01:21.080> killed<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.770> know<00:01:21.890> the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
there if you get killed you know the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.340 
there if you get killed you know the
chance<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:22.790> get<00:01:22.910> killed<00:01:23.119> is<00:01:23.270> higher<00:01:23.450> and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
chance that you get killed is higher and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.080 
chance that you get killed is higher and
you<00:01:24.470> need<00:01:24.619> longer<00:01:25.130> whoa<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:26.060> go<00:01:26.180> back<00:01:26.390> there

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
you need longer whoa to go back there

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.790 
you need longer whoa to go back there
which<00:01:29.090> means<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.509> reward<00:01:29.840> risk<00:01:30.170> ratio

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
which means that the reward risk ratio

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.440 
which means that the reward risk ratio
is<00:01:31.100> pretty<00:01:31.880> good<00:01:33.490> as<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:34.550> can<00:01:34.670> see<00:01:34.850> it<00:01:35.060> for<00:01:35.240> six

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
is pretty good as you can see it for six

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.020 
is pretty good as you can see it for six
you<00:01:35.540> can<00:01:35.570> flank<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.680> from<00:01:36.920> two<00:01:37.100> points<00:01:37.520> oh<00:01:37.670> my

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
you can flank that from two points oh my

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:54.450 
you can flank that from two points oh my
god<00:01:39.100> whoa<00:01:40.100> okay<00:01:43.330> bitch

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.020 

I<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:57.040> too<00:01:57.190> that<00:01:57.400> they<00:01:57.549> have<00:01:57.729> all<00:01:57.880> these

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
I like it too that they have all these

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.130 
I like it too that they have all these
secluded<00:01:58.650> chambers<00:01:59.650> with<00:01:59.860> closing<00:02:00.130> doors

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
secluded chambers with closing doors

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.120 
secluded chambers with closing doors
feels<00:02:02.140> like<00:02:02.290> an<00:02:02.380> individual<00:02:02.890> fight<00:02:03.310> for<00:02:04.210> every

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
feels like an individual fight for every

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.910 

this<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.700> definitely<00:02:42.120> one<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.420> cooler

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
this is definitely one of the cooler

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.020 
this is definitely one of the cooler
quarter<00:02:43.920> base<00:02:44.129> maps<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.640> played<00:02:44.879> in<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
quarter base maps that I played in a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.030 
quarter base maps that I played in a
long<00:02:45.150> while<00:02:46.040> it's<00:02:47.040> pretty<00:02:47.220> impressive<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:49.040> if

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
long while it's pretty impressive and if

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.339 
long while it's pretty impressive and if
you<00:02:50.660> let's<00:02:51.660> see<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.810> don't<00:02:51.989> know<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
you let's see I don't know if the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.610 
you let's see I don't know if the
assassin<00:02:52.950> will<00:02:53.190> be<00:02:53.310> good<00:02:53.610> for<00:02:54.530> there's<00:02:55.530> an

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
assassin will be good for there's an

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.559 
assassin will be good for there's an
apparently<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.459> AI<00:02:56.610> does<00:02:57.030> not<00:02:57.209> know<00:02:57.420> how<00:02:57.540> to

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
apparently the AI does not know how to

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.390 
apparently the AI does not know how to
repay<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> assassin<00:02:58.349> but<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.099> is<00:02:59.250> one<00:02:59.370> of

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
repay the assassin but this is one of

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.309 
repay the assassin but this is one of
those<00:02:59.580> long<00:02:59.940> map<00:03:00.239> with<00:03:00.450> long<00:03:00.660> corridors<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.200> was

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
those long map with long corridors I was

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.320 
those long map with long corridors I was
talking<00:03:01.560> about<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.040> wait<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.970> minute<00:03:03.000> am<00:03:03.269> I

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
talking about so wait a minute am I

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.160 
talking about so wait a minute am I
still<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.810> right<00:03:04.410> way<00:03:04.560> think<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.400> am<00:03:06.170> so

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
still going to right way think I am so

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.050 
still going to right way think I am so
the<00:03:07.290> chance<00:03:07.500> for<00:03:07.650> getting<00:03:07.739> killed<00:03:08.069> here<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.400> no

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
the chance for getting killed here is no

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.300 
the chance for getting killed here is no
pretty<00:03:09.330> high

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
pretty high

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.530 
pretty high
long<00:03:11.310> distance<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:11.760> snipers<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.299> take<00:03:12.420> you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
long distance so snipers can take you

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.150 
long distance so snipers can take you
out<00:03:12.569> easily<00:03:15.260> they<00:03:16.260> have<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.410> lot<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.769> warning

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
out easily they have a lot of warning

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.890 
out easily they have a lot of warning
time<00:03:17.370> if<00:03:17.610> they<00:03:17.730> play<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.480> know<00:03:18.569> against

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
time if they play with you know against

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.870 
time if they play with you know against
humans<00:03:19.319> with<00:03:19.470> mics<00:03:22.880> but<00:03:23.880> if<00:03:24.799> you<00:03:25.799> capture<00:03:26.400> that

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:54.430 

-<00:03:44.569> oh<00:03:45.250> my<00:03:46.250> god<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.459> died<00:03:46.760> no<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:53.720> girl<00:03:53.840> shut<00:03:54.230> gun

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
huh shut gun might actually be very

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.930 
huh shut gun might actually be very
useful<00:03:57.200> here<00:03:58.060> longer

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.550 

very<00:04:04.940> well<00:04:05.180> played<00:04:05.360> ball<00:04:05.600> so<00:04:05.750> with<00:04:05.870> AI<00:04:05.990> and<00:04:06.440> I

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
very well played ball so with AI and I

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.640 
very well played ball so with AI and I
just<00:04:06.680> doing<00:04:06.860> a<00:04:06.890> good<00:04:07.040> job<00:04:08.230> it's<00:04:09.230> not<00:04:09.319> letting

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
just doing a good job it's not letting

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:27.980 
just doing a good job it's not letting
me<00:04:09.740> flank<00:04:10.069> easily<00:04:10.520> so<00:04:11.120> that's<00:04:11.240> great

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.850 

you<00:04:28.990> know<00:04:29.110> they're<00:04:29.259> taking<00:04:29.560> over<00:04:29.740> six<00:04:31.860> but

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
you know they're taking over six but

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.740 
you know they're taking over six but
like<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.190> said<00:04:33.340> now<00:04:33.430> we<00:04:33.490> can<00:04:33.639> hold<00:04:33.880> my<00:04:34.180> god<00:04:34.509> is<00:04:34.720> a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
like I said now we can hold my god is a

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.580 
like I said now we can hold my god is a
big<00:04:35.139> room

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
big room

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:48.180 
big room
Wow<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:36.009> is<00:04:36.100> free<00:04:36.280> epic<00:04:45.990> well<00:04:47.039> that<00:04:48.039> is

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
Wow it is free epic well that is

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.790 
Wow it is free epic well that is
something<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:48.520> didn't<00:04:48.759> expect<00:04:49.710> though<00:04:50.710> of

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
something I didn't expect though of

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.490 
something I didn't expect though of
course<00:04:50.860> it<00:04:51.789> already<00:04:52.210> shows<00:04:52.509> kind<00:04:52.960> of<00:04:53.050> on<00:04:53.199> the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
course it already shows kind of on the

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:05.640 
course it already shows kind of on the
map<00:04:54.490> that's<00:04:54.699> a<00:04:54.850> big<00:04:55.000> room<00:05:04.259> but<00:05:05.259> I<00:05:05.320> guess<00:05:05.500> that

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
map that's a big room but I guess that

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.080 
map that's a big room but I guess that
is<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.340> hold<00:05:06.789> fast<00:05:07.150> for<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:09.610> droids

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
is the the hold fast for the droids

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.589 
is the the hold fast for the droids
because<00:05:11.910> it<00:05:12.910> will<00:05:13.090> be<00:05:13.210> very<00:05:13.599> difficult<00:05:14.009> for

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
because it will be very difficult for

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.830 
because it will be very difficult for
the<00:05:16.599> clones<00:05:16.930> to<00:05:18.240> actually<00:05:19.240> conquer<00:05:19.690> that

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
the clones to actually conquer that

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.710 
the clones to actually conquer that
since<00:05:20.830> there<00:05:21.430> are<00:05:21.580> in<00:05:21.759> the<00:05:21.849> same<00:05:22.090> room<00:05:22.300> to

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
since there are in the same room to

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.100 
since there are in the same room to
spawn<00:05:23.199> points<00:05:24.030> which<00:05:25.030> means<00:05:25.240> that<00:05:25.479> if<00:05:25.690> you<00:05:25.720> try

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
spawn points which means that if you try

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.810 
spawn points which means that if you try
to<00:05:26.169> capture<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.889> command<00:05:27.220> post<00:05:27.370> you<00:05:28.300> will<00:05:28.479> have

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
to capture a command post you will have

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.909 
to capture a command post you will have
enemies<00:05:30.820> spawning<00:05:31.150> all<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.659> time<00:05:31.900> since<00:05:32.620> even

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
enemies spawning all the time since even

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.909 
enemies spawning all the time since even
though<00:05:33.220> you<00:05:33.960> made<00:05:34.960> like<00:05:35.199> the<00:05:35.320> command<00:05:35.620> post

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
though you made like the command post

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.570 
though you made like the command post
white<00:05:36.810> right<00:05:37.810> like<00:05:37.960> neutral<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:39.310> still

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
white right like neutral that still

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.250 
white right like neutral that still
means<00:05:39.760> that<00:05:39.820> they<00:05:40.240> spawn<00:05:40.539> in<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.810> same<00:05:41.020> room

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
means that they spawn in the same room

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
means that they spawn in the same room
because<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.860> other<00:05:42.449> spawn<00:05:43.449> point<00:05:44.280> which

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
because of the other spawn point which

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.960 
because of the other spawn point which
is<00:05:45.370> kind<00:05:45.550> of<00:05:45.580> interesting

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
is kind of interesting

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.010 
is kind of interesting
but<00:05:46.780> we<00:05:47.080> are<00:05:47.229> winning<00:05:47.409> this<00:05:47.530> very<00:05:48.099> easily<00:05:49.020> so

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
but we are winning this very easily so

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.409 
but we are winning this very easily so
this<00:05:50.229> is<00:05:50.409> a<00:05:50.639> definitely<00:05:51.639> recommendation<00:05:52.330> I

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
this is a definitely recommendation I

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.450 
this is a definitely recommendation I
bet<00:05:52.810> a<00:05:52.990> lot<00:05:53.380> of<00:05:53.470> fun

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
bet a lot of fun

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.420 
bet a lot of fun
oh<00:05:54.810> no<00:05:55.810> it's<00:05:55.960> not<00:05:56.110> look<00:05:56.710> look<00:05:56.860> look<00:05:57.280> they

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
oh no it's not look look look they

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.700 
oh no it's not look look look they
actually<00:05:57.759> spawn<00:05:58.000> in<00:05:58.120> here<00:05:58.330> oh<00:05:58.509> that<00:05:59.470> gives<00:05:59.560> it

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
actually spawn in here oh that gives it

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.480 
actually spawn in here oh that gives it
actually<00:06:00.009> a<00:06:00.039> little<00:06:00.190> bit<00:06:00.310> of<00:06:00.370> strategy

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
actually a little bit of strategy

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.499 
actually a little bit of strategy
because<00:06:03.490> you<00:06:03.580> can<00:06:03.729> try<00:06:04.030> and<00:06:04.150> capture<00:06:04.300> this

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
because you can try and capture this

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.350 
because you can try and capture this
first<00:06:04.840> then<00:06:05.320> place<00:06:05.560> snipers<00:06:06.150> those<00:06:07.150> snipers

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
first then place snipers those snipers

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.240 
first then place snipers those snipers
well<00:06:08.699> they<00:06:09.699> kind<00:06:10.090> of<00:06:10.240> have<00:06:10.449> an<00:06:11.440> okay<00:06:11.860> vision

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
well they kind of have an okay vision

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.210 
well they kind of have an okay vision
over<00:06:12.460> there<00:06:12.610> over<00:06:12.759> the<00:06:12.909> room

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.590 

no<00:06:19.220> I<00:06:19.250> think<00:06:19.370> it<00:06:19.580> will<00:06:19.639> be<00:06:19.760> smartest<00:06:20.210> to<00:06:20.389> have

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
no I think it will be smartest to have

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.990 
no I think it will be smartest to have
the<00:06:20.830> final<00:06:21.830> assault<00:06:22.100> on<00:06:22.280> the<00:06:22.580> big<00:06:22.790> room

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
the final assault on the big room

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.550 
the final assault on the big room
instead<00:06:23.240> of<00:06:23.300> this<00:06:23.479> quarter<00:06:23.840> because

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
instead of this quarter because

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.379 
instead of this quarter because
otherwise<00:06:24.770> you<00:06:25.040> get<00:06:25.190> that<00:06:25.310> 300<00:06:25.910> scenario<00:06:26.300> you

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
otherwise you get that 300 scenario you

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.740 
otherwise you get that 300 scenario you
know<00:06:26.510> where<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:28.400> enemy<00:06:28.699> where<00:06:29.150> the<00:06:29.419> corridor

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
know where the enemy where the corridor

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.600 
know where the enemy where the corridor
is<00:06:29.840> so<00:06:30.050> tight<00:06:30.350> that<00:06:30.380> the<00:06:30.800> enemy<00:06:31.040> only<00:06:31.160> needs<00:06:31.430> to

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
is so tight that the enemy only needs to

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.450 
is so tight that the enemy only needs to
put<00:06:31.790> a<00:06:31.820> few<00:06:32.210> droidekas<00:06:32.540> or<00:06:33.260> something<00:06:33.620> to<00:06:33.770> stop

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
put a few droidekas or something to stop

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.360 
put a few droidekas or something to stop
your<00:06:34.760> entire<00:06:35.000> army<00:06:35.449> because<00:06:35.919> your<00:06:36.919> whole<00:06:37.100> army

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
your entire army because your whole army

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.370 
your entire army because your whole army
cannot<00:06:37.580> actually<00:06:37.970> fit<00:06:38.360> through<00:06:39.260> at<00:06:39.530> once<00:06:41.380> but

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
cannot actually fit through at once but

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.870 
cannot actually fit through at once but
