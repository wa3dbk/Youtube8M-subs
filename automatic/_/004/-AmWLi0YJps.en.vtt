for school breakfasts that there's a big

obesity problem and people are concerned
that<00:01:03.840> providing<00:01:04.350> extra<00:01:04.710> calories<00:01:05.189> could<00:01:05.549> make

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
that providing extra calories could make

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
that providing extra calories could make
things<00:01:05.880> worse<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.479> terms<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.810> obesity<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
things worse in terms of obesity and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.399 
things worse in terms of obesity and
there's<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.400> other<00:01:08.520> nutritional<00:01:09.030> outcomes

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
there's some other nutritional outcomes

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
there's some other nutritional outcomes
so<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.740> was<00:01:10.950> motivated<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.340> look<00:01:11.520> at<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so I was motivated to look at this to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
so I was motivated to look at this to
see<00:01:12.360> whether<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.049> was<00:01:13.170> true<00:01:13.380> whether<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.920> if

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
see whether it was true whether there if

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.620 
see whether it was true whether there if
you<00:01:14.159> look<00:01:14.280> at<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> broad<00:01:14.729> set<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> official

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
you look at a broad set of official

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
you look at a broad set of official
outcomes<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.470> are<00:01:16.650> hard<00:01:16.890> nutritional

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
outcomes really are hard nutritional

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.920

outcomes<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.790> worse<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> seems

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
outcomes really worse because it seems

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.600 
outcomes really worse because it seems
counterintuitive<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:20.040> you'd<00:01:20.189> expect<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
counterintuitive but you'd expect that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.800 
counterintuitive but you'd expect that
the<00:01:20.820> school<00:01:21.060> breakfast<00:01:21.420> would<00:01:21.540> improve

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the school breakfast would improve

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.899 
the school breakfast would improve
outcomes<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.369> wanted<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:23.850> if

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
outcomes and and I wanted to see if

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.520 
outcomes and and I wanted to see if
there<00:01:24.060> really<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.390> statistical<00:01:25.080> evidence<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
there really is statistical evidence to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
there really is statistical evidence to
support<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.939> general<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> problem

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
support that but in general the problem

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.030 
support that but in general the problem
with<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> early<00:01:28.140> literature<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.920> they

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
with the early literature is that they

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.569 
with the early literature is that they
