him<00:01:08.380> we're<00:01:08.500> back<00:01:08.649> when<00:01:08.800> I<00:01:08.890> played<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.220> user

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
him we're back when I played the user

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.160 
him we're back when I played the user
three<00:01:09.970> for<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.310> 3-4<00:01:12.670> defense<00:01:13.539> so<00:01:13.840> let's<00:01:14.020> go

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
three for the 3-4 defense so let's go

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.630 
three for the 3-4 defense so let's go
ahead<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.440> reviewing<00:01:14.890> for<00:01:15.160> those<00:01:15.340> that<00:01:15.580> are

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
ahead and reviewing for those that are

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.130 
ahead and reviewing for those that are
strangling<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.270> fence<00:01:16.509> if<00:01:16.660> you<00:01:16.750> want<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:17.020> get

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
strangling the fence if you want to get

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.230 
strangling the fence if you want to get
them<00:01:17.289> or<00:01:17.950> if<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.190> don't<00:01:18.399> want<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.700> get<00:01:18.910> them<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
them or if you don't want to get them I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.570 
them or if you don't want to get them I
think<00:01:22.240> it<00:01:23.110> might<00:01:23.289> be<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.500> little<00:01:23.770> comparable<00:01:24.430> to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
think it might be a little comparable to

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.710 
think it might be a little comparable to
the<00:01:24.670> all<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:26.410> all-rookie<00:01:26.830> team<00:01:27.720> haha

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
the all the all-rookie team haha

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.529 
the all the all-rookie team haha
clinton-dix<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:30.460> unless<00:01:30.729> let's<00:01:31.270> look<00:01:31.360> at<00:01:31.479> the

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
clinton-dix but unless let's look at the

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.359 
clinton-dix but unless let's look at the
stats<00:01:31.780> real<00:01:31.990> quick<00:01:32.259> so<00:01:32.860> we<00:01:33.009> looked<00:01:33.160> at<00:01:33.280> the

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
stats real quick so we looked at the

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:50.359 
stats real quick so we looked at the
free<00:01:33.580> safety<00:01:33.789> final<00:01:34.330> edition<00:01:42.300> final<00:01:43.300> edition

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.529 

probably<00:01:51.369> lower<00:01:51.550> down<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.910> little<00:01:52.209> bit<00:01:52.360> for

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
probably lower down a little bit for

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:53.940 
probably lower down a little bit for
anybody<00:01:52.869> okay<00:01:53.229> they<00:01:53.349> only<00:01:53.440> got<00:01:53.619> one<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:53.890> the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
anybody okay they only got one on the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.980 
anybody okay they only got one on the
block<00:01:54.160> okay

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
block okay

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.390 
block okay
so<00:01:56.990> let's<00:01:57.200> see<00:01:57.320> right<00:01:57.500> now<00:01:57.530> he's<00:01:57.830> going<00:01:58.040> for

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
so let's see right now he's going for

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.470 
so let's see right now he's going for
about<00:01:58.580> 83<00:01:59.300> k<00:01:59.510> which<00:01:59.750> I<00:02:00.080> think<00:02:00.950> Eric<00:02:01.190> well<00:02:01.490> maybe

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
about 83 k which I think Eric well maybe

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.830 
about 83 k which I think Eric well maybe
the<00:02:02.660> 98<00:02:03.020> card<00:02:03.290> should<00:02:03.530> be<00:02:03.740> around<00:02:04.570> 70<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.660> 80

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
the 98 card should be around 70 to 80

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.690 
the 98 card should be around 70 to 80
kada<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.470> seems<00:02:06.680> about<00:02:06.860> right<00:02:06.980> for<00:02:07.370> me<00:02:07.520> I

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
kada that seems about right for me I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.300 
kada that seems about right for me I
would<00:02:08.270> say<00:02:08.360> 70<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.750> 80<00:02:08.960> k<00:02:09.170> alright<00:02:10.070> so<00:02:10.280> right

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
would say 70 to 80 k alright so right

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.670 
would say 70 to 80 k alright so right
off<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.670> bat<00:02:10.790> we<00:02:11.570> see<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.990> man<00:02:12.170> defensive

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.210 
safeties so I don't think this Court is
just<00:04:21.890> good<00:04:22.190> as<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:24.380> all-rookie<00:04:27.220> haha

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.200 
disparity and how I claim this can jump
I<00:04:32.180> think<00:04:32.720> this<00:04:32.810> card<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.140> mainly<00:04:33.350> for<00:04:34.210> just

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
I think this card is mainly for just

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.120 
I think this card is mainly for just
four<00:04:35.360> runs<00:04:35.540> report<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.200> wouldn't<00:04:36.920> want<00:04:37.010> to

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.740 
you really need somebody tall that can
jump<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.370> kind<00:04:46.580> of<00:04:46.640> man<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:46.820> middle<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.570> get

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
jump to kind of man that middle and get

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.600 
jump to kind of man that middle and get
to<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:47.960> ball<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:48.320> mean<00:04:48.470> if<00:04:48.560> he<00:04:48.620> jumps<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:49.160> think

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
to the ball I mean if he jumps I think

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.610 
to the ball I mean if he jumps I think
it's<00:04:49.700> really<00:04:49.820> good<00:04:50.000> for<00:04:50.150> jumping<00:04:50.450> routes<00:04:50.630> but

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
it's really good for jumping routes but

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.470 
it's really good for jumping routes but
I<00:04:51.890> don't<00:04:52.400> know<00:04:52.520> that<00:04:52.730> that<00:04:53.240> height

I don't know that that height

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.090 
I don't know that that height
disadvantage<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:54.170> not<00:04:54.290> being<00:04:54.470> able<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.830> jump

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
disadvantage and not being able to jump

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.430 
disadvantage and not being able to jump
kinda<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.760> not<00:04:56.450> only<00:04:56.510> that<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.990> catch<00:04:57.290> in

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
kinda and not only that the catch in

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.530

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
traffic and spent catch a kind of low so

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.960 
traffic and spent catch a kind of low so
my<00:04:59.840> verdict<00:05:00.680> is<00:05:00.860> if<00:05:01.190> I<00:05:01.310> would<00:05:01.490> buy<00:05:01.610> him<00:05:01.790> out
