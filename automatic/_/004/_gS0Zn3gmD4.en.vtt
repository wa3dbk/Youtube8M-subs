00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
the only problem right now is the lack

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.520 
the only problem right now is the lack
of<00:02:15.670> content<00:02:16.150> there<00:02:16.720> are<00:02:16.840> companies<00:02:17.290> making

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.140 
videos especially in the porn industry
and<00:02:19.870> for<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.350> sake<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.620> research<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.459> tested<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
and for the sake of research I tested it

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.210 
and for the sake of research I tested it
out<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.690> definitely<00:02:23.410> won't<00:02:23.500> replace<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.070> real

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
out it definitely won't replace the real

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.400 
out it definitely won't replace the real
thing<00:02:24.519> but<00:02:25.150> it's<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.330> lot<00:02:25.510> more<00:02:25.690> immersive<00:02:25.989> as

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
thing but it's a lot more immersive as

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.320 
thing but it's a lot more immersive as
fun<00:02:27.070> as<00:02:27.250> all<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.549> this<00:02:27.670> sounds<00:02:28.060> there<00:02:28.180> are<00:02:28.299> a

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
fun as all of this sounds there are a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.940 
fun as all of this sounds there are a
few<00:02:28.510> things<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.870> do<00:02:28.930> want<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.380> mention<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
few things I do want to mention the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.620 
few things I do want to mention the
first<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.610> images<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.120> videos<00:02:31.450> are

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
first is that the images and videos are

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.750 
first is that the images and videos are
very<00:02:31.900> pixelated<00:02:32.170> even<00:02:33.130> though<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.340> phone<00:02:33.580> is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
very pixelated even though the phone is

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.390 
very pixelated even though the phone is
using<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.180> quad<00:02:34.450> HD<00:02:34.480> display<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.830> R<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.100> one<00:02:36.280> of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
using a quad HD display the R is one of

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.680 
using a quad HD display the R is one of
those<00:02:36.489> things<00:02:36.820> that<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.030> need<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.239> very<00:02:37.600> high

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
those things that you need a very high

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.840 
those things that you need a very high
res<00:02:38.140> screen<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.650> get<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.799> very<00:02:39.010> good<00:02:39.190> quality<00:02:39.370> so

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
res screen to get a very good quality so

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.670 
res screen to get a very good quality so
I<00:02:40.299> thought<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.660> would<00:02:40.780> never<00:02:40.930> say<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.500> I

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
I thought I would never say this but I

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.099 
I thought I would never say this but I
can't<00:02:42.130> wait<00:02:42.280> till<00:02:42.489> smartphones<00:02:42.970> get<00:02:43.120> 4k<00:02:43.630> or

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
can't wait till smartphones get 4k or

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.990 
can't wait till smartphones get 4k or
even<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.470> K<00:02:44.799> displays

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
even a K displays

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.130 
even a K displays
second<00:02:46.330> thing<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.510> want<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.750> mention<00:02:46.900> is<00:02:47.110> that
