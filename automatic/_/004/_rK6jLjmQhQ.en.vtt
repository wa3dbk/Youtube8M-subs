design<00:03:36.530> it's<00:03:36.770> pretty<00:03:37.010> much<00:03:37.160> flat<00:03:37.490> there<00:03:37.790> and

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
design it's pretty much flat there and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.820 
design it's pretty much flat there and
as<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.630> can<00:03:38.780> see<00:03:38.810> at<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.020> bottom<00:03:39.200> you're

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
as you can see at the bottom you're

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.730 
as you can see at the bottom you're
opened<00:03:40.130> up<00:03:40.250> all<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.610> way<00:03:40.730> your<00:03:40.970> bezel<00:03:41.180> is

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
opened up all the way your bezel is
