jalapeno<00:03:10.590> peppers<00:03:11.100> do<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.880> little<00:03:12.030> quick<00:03:12.210> wash

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
jalapeno peppers do a little quick wash

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.620 
jalapeno peppers do a little quick wash
and<00:03:13.050> then<00:03:13.710> all<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.010> do<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.940> start<00:03:14.970> from<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
and then all I do is I start from the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.700 
and then all I do is I start from the
small<00:03:15.930> end<00:03:16.140> up<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:17.100> carefully<00:03:18.350> slice<00:03:19.350> all

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
small end up and I carefully slice all

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.730 
small end up and I carefully slice all
the<00:03:19.890> way<00:03:20.010> at<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.250> center<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:22.050> sure<00:03:22.080> not<00:03:22.320> to

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
the way at the center but be sure not to

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.610 
the way at the center but be sure not to
cut<00:03:22.980> off<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:24.000> stem<00:03:24.510> because<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:25.140> provides<00:03:25.530> a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
cut off the stem because that provides a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.500 
cut off the stem because that provides a
really<00:03:25.920> nice<00:03:26.130> little<00:03:26.970> Brook<00:03:27.210> when<00:03:27.390> you're

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
really nice little Brook when you're

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.660 
really nice little Brook when you're
trying<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.780> batter<00:03:27.990> these<00:03:28.320> babies<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.250> when

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
trying to batter these babies and when

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.560 
trying to batter these babies and when
you're<00:03:29.790> trying<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.120> eat<00:03:30.330> them<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:32.360> then<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.390> just

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
you're trying to eat them so then I just

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.340 
you're trying to eat them so then I just
give<00:03:34.500> them<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.680> couple<00:03:34.860> little<00:03:35.190> slice<00:03:35.730> inside

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
give them a couple little slice inside

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.670 
give them a couple little slice inside
and<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:38.640> trick<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.060> need<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.810> clean<00:03:40.080> out<00:03:40.320> these

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and the trick is need to clean out these

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.050 
and the trick is need to clean out these
seeds<00:03:41.750> zoom<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.900> on<00:03:42.960> me<00:03:43.350> here<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> little<00:03:43.800> bit<00:03:44.060> it

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
seeds zoom in on me here a little bit it

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.550 
seeds zoom in on me here a little bit it
is<00:03:45.300> super<00:03:45.830> important<00:03:46.830> that<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.220> remove<00:03:47.760> all

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
is super important that you remove all

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.100 
is super important that you remove all
seeds<00:03:49.670> being<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.940> season<00:03:51.300> chefs<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.840> we<00:03:51.960> are

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
seeds being the season chefs that we are

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.780 
seeds being the season chefs that we are
in<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.350> kitchen<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.860> know<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.670> probably

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
in the kitchen I know that you probably

in the kitchen I know that you probably
all<00:03:54.390> are<00:03:54.630> fully<00:03:54.930> aware<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.800> main<00:03:55.950> source

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
all are fully aware that the main source

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.460 
all are fully aware that the main source
of<00:03:56.370> heat<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.880> jalapeno<00:03:57.210> pepper<00:03:57.540> comes<00:03:58.200> from

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
of heat and a jalapeno pepper comes from

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.230 
of heat and a jalapeno pepper comes from
the<00:03:58.560> seeds<00:03:58.800> so<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.370> want<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.700> make<00:03:59.760> sure<00:03:59.850> that

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
heat from those seeds the first time I

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.499 
heat from those seeds the first time I
made<00:04:16.660> these<00:04:16.870> I<00:04:17.729> can't<00:04:18.729> really<00:04:18.910> remember<00:04:19.090> if<00:04:19.419> I

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
made these I can't really remember if I

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.810 
made these I can't really remember if I
did<00:04:19.539> that<00:04:19.780> or<00:04:20.109> not<00:04:20.259> but<00:04:20.289> later<00:04:20.709> on<00:04:20.829> when<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.699> was

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
did that or not but later on when I was

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.790 
did that or not but later on when I was
in<00:04:21.970> bed<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.630> tips<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.169> my<00:04:23.229> fingers<00:04:23.590> were

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
in bed that tips and my fingers were

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.340 
in bed that tips and my fingers were
burning<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.419> couldn't<00:04:25.660> really<00:04:25.870> figure<00:04:26.110> out

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
burning and I couldn't really figure out

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.469 
burning and I couldn't really figure out
what<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.740> was<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.490> then<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.639> remembered<00:04:28.210> i<00:04:28.330> had

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
what it was and then I remembered i had

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.340

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
our cheese filling okay so I've got my

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.040 
our cheese filling okay so I've got my
low-fat<00:04:42.340> Philadelphia<00:04:43.060> Cream<00:04:43.300> Cheese<00:04:43.360> I

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
low-fat Philadelphia Cream Cheese I

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.870 
low-fat Philadelphia Cream Cheese I
decided<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.680> go<00:04:44.770> with<00:04:44.860> low-fat<00:04:45.130> because<00:04:45.699> this

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
decided to go with low-fat because this

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.120 
decided to go with low-fat because this
is<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.060> deep-fried<00:04:46.750> treat<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.800> thought<00:04:48.070> maybe

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
is a deep-fried treat so I thought maybe

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.520 
is a deep-fried treat so I thought maybe
we<00:04:48.580> could<00:04:48.610> take<00:04:49.210> away<00:04:49.419> some<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.020> guilt<00:04:50.320> by

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
we could take away some of the guilt by

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.189 
we could take away some of the guilt by
using<00:04:50.740> us<00:04:51.070> they<00:04:52.060> use<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.240> whole<00:04:52.570> container<00:04:52.840> of

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
using us they use a whole container of

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.469 
using us they use a whole container of
this<00:04:53.590> it's<00:04:54.430> easiest<00:04:54.789> if<00:04:54.970> it's<00:04:55.150> at<00:04:55.270> room

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
this it's easiest if it's at room

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:56.969 
this it's easiest if it's at room
temperature<00:04:56.050> obviously<00:04:56.620> because<00:04:56.830> we're

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
temperature obviously because we're

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.890 
temperature obviously because we're
going<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.160> have<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.400> match<00:04:58.060> all<00:04:58.419> of<00:04:58.570> this<00:04:58.690> up
