hi<00:00:14.860> this<00:00:15.640> is<00:00:15.850> a<00:00:15.880> rotten<00:00:16.630> bearing<00:00:17.200> that<00:00:17.410> I<00:00:17.440> just

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
hi this is a rotten bearing that I just

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.730 
hi this is a rotten bearing that I just
finished<00:00:18.940> designing<00:00:19.360> and<00:00:19.869> printing<00:00:20.230> with

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
finished designing and printing with

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.100 
finished designing and printing with
open<00:00:21.130> s<00:00:21.250> CAD<00:00:21.550> and<00:00:22.240> what<00:00:23.140> it<00:00:23.260> is<00:00:23.410> is<00:00:23.860> it's<00:00:24.160> a

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
open s CAD and what it is is it's a

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.250 
open s CAD and what it is is it's a
partial<00:00:26.110> sphere<00:00:27.990> inside<00:00:28.990> and<00:00:29.349> out<00:00:29.860> of<00:00:29.980> shell

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
partial sphere inside and out of shell

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.369 
partial sphere inside and out of shell
where<00:00:32.460> there's<00:00:33.460> a<00:00:33.580> hole<00:00:33.850> in<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.420> in<00:00:35.110> the

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
where there's a hole in the in the

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.080 
where there's a hole in the in the
sphere<00:00:35.650> and<00:00:35.980> there's<00:00:36.340> a<00:00:36.430> hole<00:00:36.640> in<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:36.940> end

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
sphere and there's a hole in the end

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.570 
sphere and there's a hole in the end
through<00:00:37.690> so<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.110> can<00:00:38.199> be<00:00:38.290> mounted<00:00:38.440> on<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.830> on<00:00:39.520> a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
through so it can be mounted on a on a

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.049 
through so it can be mounted on a on a
rod<00:00:39.879> some<00:00:40.360> kind<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:42.220> sphere<00:00:42.520> moves

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
rod some kind and the sphere moves

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.180 
rod some kind and the sphere moves
around<00:00:43.480> freely<00:00:44.140> so<00:00:44.470> you<00:00:44.559> can<00:00:44.710> see<00:00:44.890> I<00:00:44.920> can

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
around freely so you can see I can

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.369 
around freely so you can see I can
rotate<00:00:45.430> it<00:00:45.760> all<00:00:45.820> around<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:46.479> it<00:00:46.629> turns<00:00:46.989> and

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
rotate it all around and it turns and

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.439 
rotate it all around and it turns and
and<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:49.360> sticks<00:00:49.690> on<00:00:49.870> some<00:00:50.140> points<00:00:50.559> but<00:00:51.449> yeah

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
and it sticks on some points but yeah

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.840 
and it sticks on some points but yeah
it's<00:00:52.870> right<00:00:53.050> for<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.350> first<00:00:53.589> try<00:00:53.769> and<00:00:54.519> it<00:00:54.699> could

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
it's right for a first try and it could

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.369 
it's right for a first try and it could
be<00:00:55.000> improved<00:00:55.330> by<00:00:55.540> just<00:00:55.750> standing<00:00:56.080> around<00:00:56.140> the

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
be improved by just standing around the

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.700 
be improved by just standing around the
edges<00:00:56.710> which<00:00:57.460> which<00:00:58.089> you<00:00:58.540> would<00:00:58.690> be<00:00:58.900> free<00:00:59.650> to

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
edges which which you would be free to

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.430 
edges which which you would be free to
do<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:03.190> show<00:01:03.400> you<00:01:03.900> for<00:01:04.900> example<00:01:04.960> I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
do and I can show you for example I

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.240 
do and I can show you for example I
printed<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.380> 3d<00:01:08.680> printed<00:01:09.010> rod

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
printed a a this is a 3d printed rod

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.789 
printed a a this is a 3d printed rod
yeah<00:01:09.610> I<00:01:09.880> can<00:01:10.810> put<00:01:11.500> that<00:01:11.710> in<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.490> end<00:01:12.610> so<00:01:13.799> now

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
yeah I can put that in the end so now

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.969 
yeah I can put that in the end so now
it's<00:01:14.950> mounted<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:17.200> application<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:17.830> was

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
it's mounted and the application I was

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.400 
it's mounted and the application I was
interested<00:01:18.280> in<00:01:18.640> for<00:01:19.330> this<00:01:19.750> type<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:19.990> bearing

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
interested in for this type of bearing

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.720 
interested in for this type of bearing
is<00:01:20.910> if<00:01:21.910> you<00:01:22.120> have<00:01:22.300> a<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:24.100> you<00:01:24.280> want<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.550> move

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
is if you have a if you want to move

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.590 
is if you have a if you want to move
something<00:01:24.790> with<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.240> servo<00:01:25.690> motor<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:27.240> mm<00:01:28.240> you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
something with a servo motor and mm you

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.900 
something with a servo motor and mm you
might<00:01:28.780> want<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.380> move<00:01:29.620> something<00:01:30.610> like<00:01:30.730> this

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
might want to move something like this

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.470 
might want to move something like this
up<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:31.300> down<00:01:31.480> and<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:32.110> can<00:01:32.140> mount<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:33.480> the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
up and down and you can mount the the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.520 
up and down and you can mount the the
wrought<00:01:34.660> iron<00:01:34.690> bearing<00:01:35.230> yeah<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:40.540> you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
wrought iron bearing yeah and then you

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.000 
wrought iron bearing yeah and then you
can<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.370> servo<00:01:42.640> motor<00:01:42.730> can<00:01:43.210> move<00:01:43.780> this<00:01:44.020> arm<00:01:44.650> up

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
can the servo motor can move this arm up

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.770 
can the servo motor can move this arm up
and<00:01:45.220> down<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:46.800> we<00:01:47.800> see<00:01:48.010> that<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:49.420> part<00:01:49.720> here

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
and down and we see that this part here

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.170 
and down and we see that this part here
moves<00:01:50.230> as<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.620> side<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.850> rod<00:01:52.030> end

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
moves as the side and the rod end

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.270 
moves as the side and the rod end
bearing<00:01:52.510> can<00:01:52.690> accommodate<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.410> and<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:54.160> can

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
bearing can accommodate that and it can

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.190 
bearing can accommodate that and it can
also<00:01:54.430> accommodate<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.640> other<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.780> other<00:01:58.900> any

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
also accommodate the other the other any

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.990 
also accommodate the other the other any
other<00:01:59.290> motion<00:01:59.800> there<00:01:59.920> might<00:02:00.070> be<00:02:00.100> in<00:02:00.460> Judah

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
other motion there might be in Judah

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.170 
other motion there might be in Judah
misalignment<00:02:01.750> or<00:02:01.960> or<00:02:02.560> whatever<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.970> moves

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
misalignment or or whatever and it moves

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.290 
misalignment or or whatever and it moves
really<00:02:04.800> quite<00:02:05.800> freely<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:06.670> can<00:02:06.790> see<00:02:07.000> I<00:02:07.030> can

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
really quite freely you can see I can

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.670 
really quite freely you can see I can
rotate<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:08.140> around<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.679> moves<00:02:08.830> nicely<00:02:10.680> and

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
rotate that around and moves nicely and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.619 
rotate that around and moves nicely and
the<00:02:12.040> design<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.720> fully<00:02:13.720> customizable<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:15.629> uses

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
the design is fully customizable so uses

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.410 
the design is fully customizable so uses
parameters<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.379> can<00:02:17.680> adjust<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.849> to<00:02:19.120> fit

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
parameters so you can adjust it to fit

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.800 
parameters so you can adjust it to fit
whatever<00:02:19.900> your<00:02:20.709> application<00:02:20.830> might<00:02:21.430> be

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.100 

mmm<00:02:26.190> once<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.340> printed<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.849> initially<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.959> was

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
mmm once I printed it initially it was

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.160 
mmm once I printed it initially it was
stuck<00:02:29.709> together<00:02:31.379> but<00:02:32.379> I<00:02:33.569> I'm<00:02:34.569> not<00:02:34.750> sure<00:02:34.780> what

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
stuck together but I I'm not sure what

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.059 
stuck together but I I'm not sure what
the<00:02:35.260> best<00:02:35.440> way<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.959> get<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:38.319> fear<00:02:38.620> on

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
the best way to to to get this fear on

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.790 
the best way to to to get this fear on
the<00:02:39.190> inside<00:02:39.489> freeze<00:02:39.849> but<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:40.480> just<00:02:41.019> used<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.470> set

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the inside freeze but I just used a set

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.000 
the inside freeze but I just used a set
of<00:02:41.920> adjustable<00:02:42.190> pliers<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:43.500> held<00:02:44.500> onto<00:02:44.680> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
of adjustable pliers and held onto the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.850 
of adjustable pliers and held onto the
the<00:02:45.700> end<00:02:45.849> of<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> shell<00:02:46.360> here<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.870> then<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.590> put

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
the end of the shell here and then I put

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.789 
the end of the shell here and then I put
a<00:02:48.360> allen<00:02:49.360> key<00:02:49.569> through<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.170> hole<00:02:50.319> here<00:02:50.620> and

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
a allen key through the hole here and
