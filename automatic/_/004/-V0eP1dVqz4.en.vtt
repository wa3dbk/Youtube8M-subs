00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
go well we realized a while later there

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.920 
go well we realized a while later there
was<00:04:37.110> blind<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:38.280> was<00:04:38.430> actually<00:04:38.820> blind<00:04:39.210> from<00:04:39.810> the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
was blind it was actually blind from the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.719 
was blind it was actually blind from the
swelling<00:04:40.169> on<00:04:40.380> its<00:04:40.530> brain<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.160> made<00:04:41.310> it<00:04:41.460> blind

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
swelling on its brain and made it blind

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.170 
swelling on its brain and made it blind
and<00:04:42.590> now<00:04:43.590> it's<00:04:43.830> not<00:04:44.039> blind<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.610> can<00:04:44.729> see<00:04:44.940> pretty

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
and now it's not blind it can see pretty

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.629 
and now it's not blind it can see pretty
well<00:04:51.770> we<00:04:52.770> haven't<00:04:52.919> named<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.310> yet<00:04:53.370> we<00:04:53.580> don't

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
well we haven't named it yet we don't

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.010 
well we haven't named it yet we don't
want<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.880> get<00:04:53.970> too<00:04:54.120> attached<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:54.690> so<00:04:54.840> you

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
want to get too attached to it so you

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.969 
want to get too attached to it so you
might<00:04:55.169> end<00:04:55.200> up<00:04:55.410> releasing<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.460> is<00:04:56.669> wild<00:04:57.270> I

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
might end up releasing it it is wild I

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.260 
might end up releasing it it is wild I
mean<00:04:58.979> legitimately<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.729> doesn't<00:05:00.030> seem<00:05:00.240> that

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
mean legitimately it doesn't seem that

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.850 
mean legitimately it doesn't seem that
wild<00:05:00.630> right<00:05:00.750> now<00:05:00.780> I'm<00:05:01.080> making<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.590> little<00:05:01.770> bit

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
wild right now I'm making a little bit

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.230 
wild right now I'm making a little bit
of<00:05:02.010> fun<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.520> but<00:05:04.130> um<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.729> wild<00:05:05.970> rabbit

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.370 
and we probably will end up having to
release<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:09.630> at<00:05:09.720> some<00:05:09.870> point<00:05:11.870> but<00:05:12.870> right<00:05:13.200> now
