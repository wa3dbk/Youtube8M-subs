00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.680 

I<00:00:52.310> think<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:52.820> would<00:00:52.970> make<00:00:53.270> huge<00:00:53.780> difference<00:00:54.350> to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
I think it would make huge difference to

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.720 
I think it would make huge difference to
become<00:00:56.690> Muslim<00:00:56.960> 88<00:00:57.320> working<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.370> Japanese

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
become Muslim 88 working in a Japanese

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.120 
become Muslim 88 working in a Japanese
restaurant<00:00:58.760> or<00:00:59.300> working<00:00:59.630> out<00:00:59.750> already

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
restaurant or working out already

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.700 
restaurant or working out already
because<00:01:01.130> um<00:01:02.200> its<00:01:04.420> wine<00:01:05.420> is<00:01:05.750> originally<00:01:06.500> from

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
because um its wine is originally from

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.700 
because um its wine is originally from
old<00:01:07.610> world<00:01:08.060> which<00:01:08.270> is<00:01:08.300> France<00:01:08.990> Italy<00:01:09.440> Spain

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
old world which is France Italy Spain

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.950 
old world which is France Italy Spain
and<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:12.160> think<00:01:13.160> it's<00:01:13.790> something<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.660> do<00:01:14.780> much

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
and I think it's something to do much

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.170 
and I think it's something to do much
with<00:01:15.260> something<00:01:15.770> too<00:01:15.890> much<00:01:16.070> with<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.490> food<00:01:16.760> so

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
with something too much with the food so

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.690 
with something too much with the food so
in<00:01:17.720> terms<00:01:18.110> of<00:01:18.410> that<00:01:18.650> if<00:01:19.190> you<00:01:19.370> think<00:01:19.610> about

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
in terms of that if you think about

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.530 
in terms of that if you think about
Japanese<00:01:20.300> quizzing<00:01:20.810> it's<00:01:21.080> more<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:22.540> fusion

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
Japanese quizzing it's more of fusion

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.260 
Japanese quizzing it's more of fusion
thing<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:23.990> it's<00:01:24.200> more<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.710> new<00:01:25.580> thing<00:01:25.910> too

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
thing and it's more of new thing too

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.620 
thing and it's more of new thing too
much<00:01:26.450> wine<00:01:27.229> with<00:01:27.560> japanese<00:01:28.100> food<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:29.060> if<00:01:29.420> you

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
much wine with japanese food so if you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.210
