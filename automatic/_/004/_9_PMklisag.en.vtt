00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
lot because I came from Minnesota so I

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.870 
lot because I came from Minnesota so I

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
but I learned a lot more well this is

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.850 
but I learned a lot more well this is
our<00:02:34.060> first<00:02:34.239> banding<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.959> air<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.350> if<00:02:35.620> all

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
our first banding in the air and if all

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.490 
our first banding in the air and if all
goes<00:02:35.890> well<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:37.360> could<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> record<00:02:38.290> year

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
goes well we could have a record year

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.680 
goes well we could have a record year
for<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.130> number<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.610> nestlings<00:02:40.030> produced<00:02:40.540> by
