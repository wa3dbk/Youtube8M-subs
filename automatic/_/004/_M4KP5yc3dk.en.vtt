00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.609
 pegi 3 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.810
 my name is brian I come from plÃ©lan and 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.360
 I'm 16 years old I'm here because I have 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.789
 won a contest on facebook for 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.080
 go to the flatres mystery party you 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.880
 can you bring three of my friends 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.140
 contacted christopher stone and economy 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.710
 we have no debt what will happen 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.619
 today 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.440
 no we think that's it's happening it's at 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.360
 level of the gerland stadium during my 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.979
 free time I play fifa especially and 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.150
 often throw the matches but I 

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:40.040
 think for all football fans 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.059
 and all the fans of fifa this is the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.839
 ideal day 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.100
 we will gradually I think the 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:51.589
 less magical I thought I was 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.610
 the return to stadium and we are told we 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.680
 go on the pitch we saw the players 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.089
 to train we did some pictures and 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.089
 videos and it's awesome 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.420
 but so close together at as close to all 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.780
 the players wanted to see warm up 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.190
 it was 5 m 2 not realize in fact it 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.160
 was so happy France he enters 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.900
 in mode is passed on the giant screen 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.790
 I saw my head appear with marked 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.540
 my name is surprising when we 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.540
 is not at all to see that 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.990
 were also interviewed by ol tv 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.760
 it was a bit of a privilege too 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.570
 welcome manager already i think i know that 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.530
 a fervent supporter of mappy clos but 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.299
 what did you win today 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:38.320
 today I won an evening beat 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:39.190
 list and a so- called that was already 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.170
 your beautiful surprise 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.250
 frankly and prognosis for this match 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.380
 how do you see how you see them 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.479
 things to say to a beautiful 2 0 anyway 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.500
 we are witnessing a victory of lyon 1 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.820
 0 against Montpellier 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.560
 in fact this is the first time we 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.770
 a stadium it's a child for a 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.509
 first time it's magic 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.130
 oh yes it was really huge 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.509
 from beginning to end we had the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.820
 suspense from beginning to end 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.270
 we were invited to a hotel in Geneva 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.270
 was fatal 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.780
 not necessarily show but it 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.970
 speak we know he was very very 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.400
 happy 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.030
 g 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.030
 no 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.450
 jova in tripoli 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.680
 even in us 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.390
 and suddenly as it appeared from 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.980
 nowhere like that and we've already lived 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.330
 it's a program frankly it was 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.190
 a bit of an honor to see him here because 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.180
 that where he already marked earlier 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.180
 it's impressive 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.280
 I can not believe it's that 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.560
 really happened and the comice is 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.860
 come all this is amazing 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.860
