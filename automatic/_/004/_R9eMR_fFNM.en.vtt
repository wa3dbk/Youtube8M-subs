00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.629
 his soul is inside us 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.460
 over remember that later it will be two 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:47.140
 washers still below 1's so worth it and the second 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:50.550
 more would be interesting something pullers 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.550
 hooked with need to loosen it 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.610
 dough 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:16.750
 it is to find their hospital 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:19.740
 stolen us they don't know it 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.740
 runs the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:32.010
 so here is the shock absorber rack itself 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.110
 from bmw e34 it is connected together with 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:42.440
 hub here here here hub here 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:46.380
 from it comes the metal and now she herself stand 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.050
 as we see here is a nut under 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.119
 this nut 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.880
 if you unscrew it templ and dirt and 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.729
 says no dirt if u unscrew under 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.270
 it is a cartridge cartridge together 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.140
 here with this thing that is not necessarily 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:09.019
 you can simply buy the entire rack 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:14.010
 unscrew and buy a stand cartridge from us 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:18.209
 gas oil that is inside 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 shock absorber oil is not filled there 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:25.670
 oil there is a composition that each firm 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.840
 determines its like the secret of the company 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.930
 there is some kind of chemical yes 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.790
 maybe patented but many pour 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.040
 oils and nothing at all that's terrible in 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.160
 Generally and does not happen but the point is 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.200
 that in the gas-oil shock absorber them besides 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.980
 the oil itself is still gas and it 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.769
 unusual air nitrogen ie it 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:55.380
 pumps inside and it prevents 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.510
 oil from boiling when oil is 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.299
 under pressure how many know pressure 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.820
 increase the boiling point on her 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:07.260
 shifts more 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.470
 how would range that is under pressure during 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.980
 first pressure itself 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.970
 contributes and secondly also nitrogen 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.970
 many say inert gas 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.380
 what will happen if I command the air 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.270
 I honestly do not know seen how many 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.760
 people are somewhere in this area 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.790
 drill a hole 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.730
 but this is of course all on exploded 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.090
 the shock absorber drilled hole thread 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.210
 screw in nipple from risen tubeless 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.830
 they are sold in a store I recently bought 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.020
 you never know if you'll just do 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.970
 try maybe want them worth 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.290
 there are 15 rubles there instead of or somewhere 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.100
 you can on the road somewhere cheaper 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.050
 through this nipple pumped into 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.640
 shock absorber on any tire can 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:02.130
 pump nitrogen love but honestly i'm not 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.030
 I know how much this collective farm 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.390
 repair will 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.870
 and I do not know how this is arranged 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.300
 stand is possible even if here 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.980
 drill as I looked a bunch 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.549
 possibility to drill there is no access 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.470
 to my mustard in general now i will 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.680
 disconnect look I think it will be useful 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.060
 in all who repair yourself means something 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.830
 what's inside is here 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.180
 regret indiscriminately no longer do 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.270
 cleaned a little dirt 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.789
 and that's what came to be here I don't know 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:43.600
 visible or not a hole here it is 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:47.639
 when you clicked on it is clear that the oil starts 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.380
 even run out some 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.050
 In general, I will not even know how 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:05:14.310
 now repair or podvarivat 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:14.310
 either change the rack entirely went 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:37.440
 show saying don't know what often murid 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.650
 so that the very same club 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.840
 So 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.949
 probably some kind of need here 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:14.639
 puller of course does not move spreads 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.639
 you can watch 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:24.250
 removed age cartridge here inside 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:27.599
 m put it standing so well it means that 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.599
 what this rack looks like 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:39.819
 say inside it is a cartridge he 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:43.870
 smeared in oil but it's oil like me 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:45.430
 I understand it as the rain is oil but you need 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.919
 basically just to here 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:53.310
 nothing rusted here everything is not parsing on 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:59.710
 soldered that is this part entirely and 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:07:04.000
 completely changing repair it hardly 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:07.150
 Is it possible to put a new one back 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.229
 just as well pour oil 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:13.029
 stand itself so find Krishna waiting to clean 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:16.000
 inside if there's to be seen, I do not 

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:22.990
 I know there is no mouth, it's just like 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:29.259
 container from the hub 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:31.599
 and this part I do not know change or from 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:35.589
 still ride on this most likely 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:42.009
 will have to change is not where I got nothing 

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:44.289
 I can't really do it now 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:48.460
 I will try to solder a hole here 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:51.940
 oil is not leaving she is a hole 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:54.219
 Well, nothing is worse here. 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:57.069
 except that oil can sometimes be here 

00:07:54.219 --> 00:07:58.050
 flow out that it is still very top if 

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:02.159
 she was bottom 

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.159
 things would be much worse
