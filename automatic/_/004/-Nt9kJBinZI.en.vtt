braids out when you're taking out wings

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.650 
braids out when you're taking out wings
the<00:02:52.220> most<00:02:52.489> important<00:02:52.940> thing<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.330> make<00:02:53.600> sure

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
the most important thing is to make sure

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.720 
the most important thing is to make sure
you<00:02:53.930> do<00:02:54.080> tango<00:02:54.380> because<00:02:55.160> when<00:02:55.370> your<00:02:55.489> hair<00:02:55.700> is

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
you do tango because when your hair is

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.470 
you do tango because when your hair is
in<00:02:55.850> braids<00:02:56.350> what<00:02:57.350> happens<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.910> your<00:02:59.030> shedded

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
in braids what happens to your shedded

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.990 
in braids what happens to your shedded
hair<00:02:59.690> is<00:02:59.870> it<00:03:00.080> stays<00:03:00.440> with<00:03:00.980> its<00:03:01.250> trapped<00:03:01.730> within

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
hair is it stays with its trapped within

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.270 
hair is it stays with its trapped within
it<00:03:02.300> so<00:03:02.450> when<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:02.630> take<00:03:02.840> your<00:03:02.870> hair<00:03:03.019> out

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
it so when you take your hair out

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.160 
it so when you take your hair out
sometimes<00:03:04.280> you'll<00:03:04.459> see<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.760> right<00:03:05.050> where<00:03:06.050> the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
sometimes you'll see it right where the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.770 
sometimes you'll see it right where the
braid<00:03:06.410> was<00:03:06.910> sometimes<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.060> can<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.540> want

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
braid was sometimes you can so you want

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.300 
braid was sometimes you can so you want
to<00:03:08.840> make<00:03:08.870> sure<00:03:09.019> when<00:03:09.709> I<00:03:09.769> would<00:03:09.950> take<00:03:10.130> each

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
to make sure when I would take each

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.890 
to make sure when I would take each
braid<00:03:10.610> out<00:03:10.760> i<00:03:10.790> would<00:03:11.000> take<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.150> Deadman<00:03:11.569> brush

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
braid out i would take a Deadman brush

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.750 
braid out i would take a Deadman brush
and<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.200> would<00:03:12.350> just<00:03:12.470> pull<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.430> through<00:03:13.550> that

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
and I would just pull it through that

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.069 
and I would just pull it through that
section<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.269> remove<00:03:14.680> any<00:03:16.180> trap<00:03:17.180> shyt<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.810> here

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
section to remove any trap shyt it here

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.840 
section to remove any trap shyt it here
the<00:03:18.470> reason<00:03:18.739> why<00:03:18.829> that<00:03:19.070> is<00:03:19.190> important<00:03:19.700> is

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
the reason why that is important is

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.910 
the reason why that is important is
because<00:03:19.880> if<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.510> don't<00:03:21.290> do<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:21.890> just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
because if you don't do that you just

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.100 
because if you don't do that you just
take<00:03:22.250> all<00:03:22.370> your<00:03:22.519> braids<00:03:22.730> out<00:03:22.910> or<00:03:23.390> your<00:03:23.930> weave

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
take all your braids out or your weave

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.220 
take all your braids out or your weave
out<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:25.030> wash<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.450> have<00:03:26.600> seen<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.989> so<00:03:27.170> many

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
out and wash it I have seen it so many

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.430 
out and wash it I have seen it so many
times<00:03:27.579> where<00:03:28.579> we<00:03:29.329> make<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:29.690> down<00:03:29.930> there<00:03:30.140> here

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
times where we make it down there here

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.000 
times where we make it down there here
is<00:03:30.590> literally<00:03:31.100> mad<00:03:31.820> it<00:03:32.030> together<00:03:33.010> like

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
is literally mad it together like

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.150 
is literally mad it together like
literally<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.510> very<00:03:35.630> important<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:37.010> so

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
literally so it is very important and so

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.800 
literally so it is very important and so
before<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.610> wash<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.299> make<00:03:38.450> sure<00:03:38.600> you

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
before you wash it to make sure you

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.350 
before you wash it to make sure you
detangle<00:03:39.200> all<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.670> in<00:03:40.790> here<00:03:40.940> out<00:03:41.000> or
