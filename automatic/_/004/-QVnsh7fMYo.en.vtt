 so I'm going to accept any challenge of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.179

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.030
 of this great game that I love I'm 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.660
 waiting for this game since and since 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.420
 I had left the smash for wii I was already 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.510
 waiting for this is not true but it is 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.329
 incredible here and damage the box not 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.309
 matter friends the truth I'm super 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.719
 excited with this great game and well 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.000
 I will be uploading many 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.370
 gameplays mostly competitive online 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.620
 of that which is famous for the people who 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.149
 is very fond of this game are going to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.920
 see how you play with someone who 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.030
 really know how to play for the part of 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.089
 back comes all the game modes 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.369
 this game is 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.859
 have eight people play at the same 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.289
 obviously friends online time is not 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:14.090
 can because it would be super slow but with 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.920
 your friends if you have eight friends who 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.200
 have controls to play you will be able to 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.090
 play perfectly this game does not count 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.100
 with a story mode like the previous one 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.110
 but it's pretty good 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.850
 the graphics are very good and 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.009
 I've seen and I've seen it in action is 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.109
 incredible and good well here in the 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.549
 cover we see the characters at 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.440
 characteristic although I would have 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.510
 liked that wolf came out 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.320
 my favorite character from the previous 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.910
 game here is what we can see the box 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.470
 we have the disk that is quite 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.340
 striking the previous one was not so 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.720
 striking as this one is an album 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.520
 it's very good I really liked the design 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.200
 although I'm almost never going to see it 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.300

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.700

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.560

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.240
