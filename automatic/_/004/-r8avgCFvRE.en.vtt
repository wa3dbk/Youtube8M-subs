00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.750
 today this bulerÃ­a night that I think 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.150
 that I have done so a bit so 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.780
 informal in a video that is of almoraima 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.570
 I think 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.850
 and that many of you have told me 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.290
 because it teaches us that good side I 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.240
 I'm going to do a very household accounting 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:34.340
 very very slow it is worth seeing if you take 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.340
 conclusions worth I'll start 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.350
 ah 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.720
 Y 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.720
 here 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.530
 to 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 do not 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.200
 i 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.200
 Y 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.260
 well I think it played if it's slow and 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.600
 such to the eyes or is able to remove it or 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.590
 has that this is a minor starts with 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.030
 a relative doing this and then to 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.050
 from here a melody begins 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.050
 removing the corde vale 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.000
 I'm going to demand a little movement 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.090
 to make it look and then we cut a 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.290
 little bit of it that you're going to dominate and 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.290
 of the sun 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.280
 with the sun and this 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.640
 How are you 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.640
 two 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.610
 or 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.180
 Y 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.180
 no no 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.960
 returned to the beginning 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.050
 here we cut in a way because water 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.050
 look for the closing of the end 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.609
 now already maintaining this position 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.969
 chopped from the fourth touched to the third 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.969
 part 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.260
 no no 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.260
 i 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.670
 helped him rest in the fifth third 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.060
 fret from here we left from the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.060
 quarter 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.520
 the fourth 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.700
 already goes in the fifth with the fourth and the 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.700
 first finger 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.180
 sometimes not 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.040
 do not 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.040
 ah 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Heavens 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.959
 I'll do it slowly followed by a 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.959
 little bit faster 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.290
 i 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.610
 i 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.830
 ah 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.830
 i 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.810
 well let's let them go and see if 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:53.720
 you take out the bag and if you do yours and 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.720
 another one as I always say to the takeoff
