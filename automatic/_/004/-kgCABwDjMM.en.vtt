 intel core i5 processor required 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.710
 installation of an active cooling system 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.320
 which in turn led to an increase 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.610

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.040
 off the tablet behind the panel 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.200

 detect two perforation zones for

 cooling system air intake but 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.690
 the most interesting thing is reclining 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.069
 lid stand which is held on 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.959
 place using two magnets 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.970
 similar constructive solution is good 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.530
 known by microsoft surface tablet 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.329
 it allows you to use the tablet 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.650
 vertical mode without additional 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.239
 covers and docking stations 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.470
 the second advantage of such a scheme 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.750
 Bull advocates the rights of the design 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.280
 keyboard docking station that is not 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.500
 need to integrate a separate 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.060
 hinge retainer to the disadvantages include 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.879
 limited compared to classic 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.750
 laptops set of available tilt angles 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.549
 maximally limited designs 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.739
 cover minimum resistant 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.569
 designs but intermediate material 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.400
 and it became so too smooth 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.889
 cover base may include 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.660
 regardless of the rubber feet in our 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.400
 case with their thinly docking station attached to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.400
 a tablet with magnetic clips 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.310
 the docking station contains exclusively 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.169
 keyboard and touchpad 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.250
 no additional connectors or 2 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.049
 no battery here 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.150
 working panel is made of the same 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.250
 Bronze soft touch plastic that I 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.690
 tablet again, but the bottom 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.430
 part docking station almost posts 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.630
 trimmed with rubber that completely eliminates 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.630
 sliding on the table 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.610
 thanks to a flexible sound regret 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.440
 fixing a docking station can be used 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.510
 as a cover protecting the tablet display 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.220
 during transport while 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.840
 do not understand the tablet docking station 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.070
 After all, to keep kilogram she 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.349
 the unit is out of power 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.909
 tablet gigabyte beech with 1185 built on 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.820
 energy efficient intel core processor 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.800

 intel hd graphics 4000 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.120
 the amount of RAM can 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.349
 be 2 4 or 8 gigabytes and the capacity 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.380
 ssd 64 128 or 256 gigabyte dependencies 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.420
 from modification 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.690

 modem is offered optionally 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.360
 one of the main advantages of the tablet 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.750
 high - quality sensor for 11 6-inch 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.560

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.540
 points 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.330
 The brightness of the screen is adjustable from 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.700

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.780
 in 1 percent increments also available 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.460
 automatic adjustment from

 built-in battery capacity of the 39th 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.540
 hour tablet from worked for two hours in mode 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.490
 maximum load and 5 hours mode 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.190
 reading emulation in test 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.160
 configuration intel core i5 3330 7th 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.050
 4 gigabytes of RAM will give 8 gigabytes with a bend 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.160
 tablet showed the following results in 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.780
 actual benchmarks in the end gigabytes 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.460
 under the letter s 1185 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.500
 it is very productive about aroma 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.300
 windows tablet model in quality 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.520
 with screen and fast intel processor 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.110

 de garden quite allows you to use this 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.880
 model as the main working 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.880
 computer
