 television chain more knowing that 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.290
 never moving on to subjects of the selection 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.490
 merikangas as we know the ticket to 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.050
 the world is complicated in this 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.420
 Mexico moment is outside like that in 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.429
 direct qualification and you know how much 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.619
 money would be losing the federation 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.050
 Mexican football if the tricolor does not 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.250
 attends the 2014 World Cup the following 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.250
 note explains it clearly 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.960
 it is true today Mexico before disputing 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.329
 his remaining duels of the tie 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.750
 before panama and costa rica is out of 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.570
 world we know a situation 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.949
 extremely difficult and complex and we have 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.920
 thought and decided to ask the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.590
 professor be vÃ­ctor manuel vucetich that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.259
 is incorporated as technical director to the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.110
 national team to take us out 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.520
 of the problem in which we are the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.280
 sequels that would leave the absence of 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.840
 Mexico in Brazil would be disastrous 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.860
 economically speaking let's go for 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.660
 parts 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.060
 how much the Mexican federation generates 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.630
 football for every World Cup cycle the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.509
 answer is 250 million dollars from 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.130
 which 150 are used to maintain 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.560
 to the different categories 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.810
 national lesson but if the tri does not go to 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.159
 globally generated every four years 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.159
 It would be money thrown in the garbage 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.940
 now let's see what the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.950
 main sponsors of the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.640
 Mexican selection to appear in the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.170
 uniform 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.450
 adidas is the brand you saw at 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.630
 national team signed a contract 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.710
 until 2018 investing 80 million 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.170
 Dollars 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.620
 then cocacola signed from 2011 to 2018 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.320
 for 40.5 million dollars the bank 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.480
 Banamex paid 24 million dollars and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.870
 signed a contract that covers 2011 to 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.509
 2014 for the same period signed contract 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.340
 Movistar telephone company that paid 22 million 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.740
 of dollars while procter and 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.960
 gamble last sponsor at entry to 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.270
 Mexican selection project made a 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.360
 investment of about 20 million 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.930
 dollars let's add the femexfut of their 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.720
 major business partners has won 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.790
 150 points 5 million dollars has 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.740
 one that we insist can be a 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.170
 bad investment if mexico does not qualify 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.360
 in the world cup after between the the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.640
 ford a currency oils rose frank 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.280
 interjet crown gillette nature 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.290
 nutrition and bimbo generate at least 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.379
 another 140 million dollars 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.879
 it has cost us work to qualify there is no 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.230
 that make a really good analysis 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.709
 what happens because the tournaments 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.069
 Mexico I think that it is fulfilling in many 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.120
 international forums that are not 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.069
 eliminatory but we always go to bed 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.530
 jobs and I had to review well the 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.079
 processes to improve a lot I think the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:12.069
 mentality trust security and 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:14.170
 the passion of the player on the other hand that 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.819
 there is with the tourism sector in brazil 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.670
 I would be harmed if Mexico does not go to 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.400
 global the answer is yes should 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.439
 highly lacerated according to the bank 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.510
 Brazil's central office will be a little more than 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:28.150
 600 thousand tourists who enter the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.760
 country to witness the World Cup 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.939
 which at least 50,000 would come 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.310
 from mexico in other words one from each 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:37.720
 ten tourists would be Mexican and if 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.629
 our selection does not attend the fair 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.450
 World Cup would not enter Brazil 215 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.700
 million dollars that is close to the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.799
 7.2 percent of the total spill 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.799
 economic activity that is expected to be 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.130
 but without a doubt one of the most 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.630
 important and potential that the 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.820
 Mexican soccer in case the 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.620
 selection does not go to Brazil would be the 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.270
 prestige despite the fact that 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.220
 potentiated with obtaining the 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.100
 Olympic gold medal in london and that 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.420
 is currently being mistreated that 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.150
 prestige that has cost so much work 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.580
 in previous years reflect the rest of the 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.940
 world today does not have nor will it have the same 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.120
 value and the tricolor is not next 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.390
