00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.620
 if you have paint stocks at the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.590
 house you can reuse them for 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.340
 make bread crumbs 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:17.630
 so we'll take the bread and 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.630
 we are going to crush him 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:59.609
 we continue to mash well with 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:01:03.329
 hands and once it's done we 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.460
 let's go to the colander to 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.080
 recover that the bridge very much removed by 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.080
 the same occasion the big pieces 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600
 here 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.679
 and once it's done we have 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.920
 so on one side the big pieces and of 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.850
 the other side a breadcrumbs powder 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.850
 perfect 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.440
 thank you
