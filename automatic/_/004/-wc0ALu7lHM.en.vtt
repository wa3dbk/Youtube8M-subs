 the king roald who and sites call it 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.960
 of which the official such as a client s 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.870
 let's start with it first 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.129
 delete this nbc 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.699
 what you are going to do when you go on the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.750
 same place and then type your door 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.790

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.990
 toilets i the guy 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:11.340
 ok then sometimes you go to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.690
 then your pictures were ready then you now 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.479
 that open 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.590
 and then you go search with ctrl at night 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.400
 coordinates 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.369
 they will take you back to a server and 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:31.110
 3209 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:36.060
 3209 and first ate and you ate for 522 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.740
 so check the item id 100 character 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.490
 you just definitely see if you good 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.750

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.400
 search for the abcd you want to delete 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:02.790
 Sweden's idea also knows shot that way then go 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.620

 diks so click on save here 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.810
 then go to the compiler 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.250
 then you just restart everything to 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.640

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.270

 Plug it sent to where you want 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.130

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.390
 to what you because you will be you will 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.320

 Bet 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.250

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.890
 script and you never stand here 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.170

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.549
 so if you ever make a note 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.180
 for yourself but the easy but 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.769

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.579
 i 'm honest 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.489

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.370
 golf course to play and in 2007

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:10.169
 my eyes are harder to say 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:12.389
 preferably the simple version that 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.899
