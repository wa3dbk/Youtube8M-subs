manga so I went out into that and I
don't<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:26.910> know<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.689> there<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.019> to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050

don't really know what there is to
comment<00:00:28.560> about<00:00:28.740> because<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.340> pretty<00:00:29.580> much

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
comment about because it's pretty much

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.450 
comment about because it's pretty much
exactly<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.510> same<00:00:30.869> as<00:00:31.170> what<00:00:31.590> i<00:00:31.619> saw<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
exactly the same as what i saw in the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.200 
exactly the same as what i saw in the
enemy<00:00:32.790> or<00:00:33.390> changes<00:00:33.840> remain<00:00:34.079> from<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
enemy or changes remain from the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.000 
enemy or changes remain from the
live-action<00:00:36.210> movies<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.800> pretty

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
live-action movies but this is pretty

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.889 
live-action movies but this is pretty
much<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> storyboard<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.540> show<00:00:39.719> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
much like a storyboard for the show I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.530 
much like a storyboard for the show I
really<00:00:40.530> was<00:00:40.800> struggling<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.550> find<00:00:41.790> anything

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
really was struggling to find anything

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.729 
really was struggling to find anything
that<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.840> different<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:44.760> look<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.270> same

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
that was different the look was the same

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.279 
that was different the look was the same
pacing<00:00:46.739> more<00:00:47.039> or<00:00:47.100> less<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.430> same<00:00:48.200> even<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
pacing more or less the same even the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.049 
pacing more or less the same even the
beats<00:00:49.530> even<00:00:49.800> bits<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> dialogue<00:00:50.280> were<00:00:50.730> taking

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
beats even bits of dialogue were taking

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.850 
beats even bits of dialogue were taking
pretty<00:00:51.210> much<00:00:51.420> verbatim<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> great<00:00:52.440> work<00:00:52.680> I

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
pretty much verbatim it's a great work I

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
pretty much verbatim it's a great work I
mean<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.789> fact<00:00:54.030> probably<00:00:54.329> got<00:00:54.539> some<00:00:54.690> of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
mean it is in fact probably got some of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.680 
mean it is in fact probably got some of
the<00:00:54.840> best<00:00:55.520> drawings<00:00:56.520> I'm<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.180> pound<00:00:57.480> for

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
I've experienced so far just really

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.789 
I've experienced so far just really
slick<00:01:04.799> tight<00:01:05.280> polished<00:01:05.760> work<00:01:06.049> but<00:01:07.049> there's

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
slick tight polished work but there's

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.360 
slick tight polished work but there's
really<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.280> much<00:01:08.490> else<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> say<00:01:08.939> about<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
really not much else to say about this

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.080 
really not much else to say about this
except<00:01:11.370> that<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.090> inspired<00:01:12.600> me<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.230> go<00:01:14.190> find

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
