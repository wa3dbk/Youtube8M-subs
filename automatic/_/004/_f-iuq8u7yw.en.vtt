search and so forth so definitely some
nice<00:02:08.670> features<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:11.160> dragged<00:02:11.489> down

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
nice features with that you dragged down

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.100 
nice features with that you dragged down
from<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.970> top

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
from the top

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.050 
from the top
you<00:02:13.320> do<00:02:13.470> get<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.980> looks<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.610> said<00:02:14.880> once

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
you do get it looks like I said once

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
again very similar to galaxy s3 you know

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.880 
again very similar to galaxy s3 you know
with<00:02:18.060> all<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.510> different<00:02:19.080> topicals<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.710> have

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
the top from the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.120 
the top from the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in
the<00:02:23.670> settings<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:25.020> know<00:02:25.140> some<00:02:25.440> more<00:02:25.680> basic

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
the settings you know some more basic

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.250 
the settings you know some more basic
stuff<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.820> know<00:02:26.940> pretty<00:02:27.480> much<00:02:27.600> familiar

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
stuff that you know pretty much familiar

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.550 
stuff that you know pretty much familiar

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
as with all android devices but I think

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.990 
as with all android devices but I think
we're<00:02:31.710> really<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.460> know<00:02:32.580> what's<00:02:32.820> going<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the hand device and this was probably

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.190 
the hand device and this was probably
going<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.790> be<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.150> because<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.630> reality<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
going to be it because the reality is

where<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.600> know<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.750> definitely<00:03:04.200> go<00:03:04.470> check<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
where you know I definitely go check it

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.699 
where you know I definitely go check it
out<00:03:05.420> first<00:03:06.420> hand<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.930> see<00:03:07.110> if<00:03:07.230> it's<00:03:07.380> for<00:03:07.590> you

or<00:03:07.770> not<00:03:07.830> but<00:03:08.120> overall<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:10.620> know<00:03:10.770> it's

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
or not but overall I you know it's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.040 
or not but overall I you know it's
definitely<00:03:11.370> pretty<00:03:11.580> nice<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.360> also<00:03:12.690> show

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
definitely pretty nice and I also show

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.770 
definitely pretty nice and I also show
you<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.260> storage<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:15.030> won't<00:03:15.390> believe<00:03:15.600> no<00:03:15.750> it's

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
you the storage I won't believe no it's

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.650 
you the storage I won't believe no it's
about<00:03:15.989> four<00:03:16.380> gigs<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.770> storage<00:03:17.000> initially<00:03:18.000> but

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
about four gigs of storage initially but

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.220 
about four gigs of storage initially but
you<00:03:18.840> do<00:03:19.049> have<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.790> SD<00:03:20.790> card<00:03:21.060> capability<00:03:22.049> here

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
you do have the SD card capability here

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.729 
you do have the SD card capability here
on<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.330> left-hand<00:03:24.330> side<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.840> what<00:03:25.410> along

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
on the left-hand side and what along

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.740 
on the left-hand side and what along
with<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.010> volume<00:03:26.190> rocker<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.730> such<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.269> those

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
with the volume rocker and such so those

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.539 
with the volume rocker and such so those
are<00:03:27.900> some<00:03:27.930> other<00:03:28.200> some<00:03:28.560> good<00:03:28.769> highlights<00:03:29.220> ice

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
are some other some good highlights ice

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.270 
are some other some good highlights ice
cream<00:03:29.910> sandwich<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.660> probably<00:03:31.650> would<00:03:32.010> assume

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
cream sandwich I probably would assume

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.100 
cream sandwich I probably would assume
it<00:03:32.430> would<00:03:32.519> get<00:03:32.700> jelly<00:03:32.970> bean<00:03:33.239> but<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.959> know

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
it would get jelly bean but you know

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.410 
it would get jelly bean but you know
it's<00:03:34.290> kind<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.709> um<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.670> know<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:36.030> may<00:03:36.239> not

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
it's kind of um you know that may not

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.750 
it's kind of um you know that may not
happen<00:03:36.690> but<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.350> probably<00:03:37.860> would<00:03:38.310> guess<00:03:38.580> it

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
happen but I probably would guess it

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.300 
happen but I probably would guess it
would<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.959> know<00:03:40.110> just<00:03:40.410> based<00:03:40.799> on<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.070> fact

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
would you know just based on the fact

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.759 
would you know just based on the fact
that<00:03:41.459> um<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.720> know<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.049> phone<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.500> did

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
that um you know this phone just did

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.160 
that um you know this phone just did
come<00:03:44.010> out<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.549> but<00:03:45.360> on<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.480> yeah<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.930> know

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
come out so but on that yeah you know

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.110 
come out so but on that yeah you know
and<00:03:46.410> I'm<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.709> compared<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.370> another<00:03:47.430> device<00:03:47.850> not

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
and I'm a compared to another device not

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.850 
and I'm a compared to another device not
on<00:03:48.299> sprint<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.019> that's<00:03:49.380> really<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:50.630> Galaxy

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
on sprint and that's really the Galaxy

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.250 
on sprint and that's really the Galaxy
stellar<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.390> have<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.660> compare<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.140> this

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
stellar and I have to compare it to this

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.860 
stellar and I have to compare it to this
because<00:03:55.470> they're<00:03:55.709> literally<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.310> same

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
because they're literally the same
