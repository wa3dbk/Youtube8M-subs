00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
upside down which is hardly ideal but

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.149 
upside down which is hardly ideal but
something<00:01:46.079> that's<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.470> hard<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.920> tackle

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
something that's really hard to tackle

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
something that's really hard to tackle
because<00:01:47.640> where<00:01:48.030> else<00:01:48.060> would<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
because where else would you have the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.289 
because where else would you have the
cable<00:01:49.290> going<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.790> quite<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> large

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
cable going and this is quite a large

how<00:01:53.909> would<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.119> slot<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.750> through<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.049> base

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
how would you slot this through the base

how would you slot this through the base
of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.860> stand<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.540> really<00:01:57.810> nice<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.409> a

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
of the stand so it's really nice as a

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.770 
of the stand so it's really nice as a
stand<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.790> i<00:01:59.850> would<00:02:00.119> say<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.750> not

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
stand but i would say that it's not

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.410 
stand but i would say that it's not
really<00:02:01.259> practical<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.890> use<00:02:01.939> weist<00:02:02.939> your
