00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
that's the main trick is game to know

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.690 
that's the main trick is game to know
the<00:01:46.470> center<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> your<00:01:46.920> screen<00:01:47.040> what<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> looks

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the center of your screen what it looks

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.859 
the center of your screen what it looks
like<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.899> how<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.950> control

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
like what it is and how you can control

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.330 
like what it is and how you can control
the<00:01:51.869> rushing<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.439> when<00:01:52.710> people<00:01:52.829> rush<00:01:53.159> you

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the rushing like when people rush you

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
the rushing like when people rush you
that's<00:01:54.030> basically<00:01:54.659> papa

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that's basically papa

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.899 
that's basically papa
now<00:01:55.590> um<00:01:56.540> when<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> say<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.549> it's<00:01:59.549> hard<00:01:59.820> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
now um when I say like it's hard to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.350 
now um when I say like it's hard to
quickscope

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
quickscope

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480 
quickscope
I'm<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.689> gonna<00:02:00.869> lie<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.469> guys<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:02.189> very

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I'm not gonna lie to you guys it's very

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.850 
I'm not gonna lie to you guys it's very
hard<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.939> quickscope<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.869> um<00:02:04.079> very

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
hard to quickscope it is um very

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.059 
hard to quickscope it is um very
complicated<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.899> miss<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.200> shot

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
complicated because if you miss one shot

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.990 
complicated because if you miss one shot
it<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> life-or-death<00:02:08.819> situation

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it is a life-or-death situation

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.930 
it is a life-or-death situation
especially<00:02:09.750> if<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.200> an<00:02:10.319> AR<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.610> think<00:02:11.760> it's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
especially if it's an AR if I think it's

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.410 
especially if it's an AR if I think it's
all<00:02:12.060> permitted<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.870> will

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
all permitted you will

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.240 
all permitted you will
and<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.170> that's<00:02:14.440> just<00:02:14.560> how<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:14.920> you

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
and it just that's just how it is you

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.240 
and it just that's just how it is you
gotta<00:02:15.940> know<00:02:16.240> how<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.660> fast<00:02:16.960> reflexes<00:02:17.250> how

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
gotta know how to have fast reflexes how

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.250 
gotta know how to have fast reflexes how
the<00:02:18.310> quakes<00:02:18.730> go<00:02:18.970> boom<00:02:19.150> fast<00:02:19.420> what<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:20.020> should

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the quakes go boom fast what you should

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.199 
the quakes go boom fast what you should
use<00:02:20.290> quick<00:02:20.740> scope<00:02:20.980> now<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.400> lot<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:21.940> people<00:02:22.120> like

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
use quick scope now a lot of people like

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.970 
use quick scope now a lot of people like
okay<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.600> quit<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.140> bear<00:02:23.319> with<00:02:23.350> one<00:02:23.620> there's<00:02:23.890> two

know<00:02:32.500> stuff<00:02:32.770> like<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.580> really<00:02:34.000> hard<00:02:34.209> to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
know stuff like that is really hard to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.830 
know stuff like that is really hard to
quickscope

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
quickscope

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.050 
quickscope
with<00:02:35.050> an<00:02:35.170> m9<00:02:35.590> people<00:02:36.310> do<00:02:36.430> do<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.820> I<00:02:36.880> get

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
with an m9 people do do it and I get

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.580 
with an m9 people do do it and I get
them<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.240> lot<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.420> credit<00:02:37.630> because<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.290> so

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
them a lot of credit because that is so

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.840 
them a lot of credit because that is so
hard<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.010> do<00:02:39.540> also<00:02:40.540> when<00:02:40.720> people<00:02:40.750> play<00:02:41.500> with

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
hard to do also when people play with

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.880 
hard to do also when people play with
what's<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.910> call<00:02:43.120> just<00:02:43.390> like<00:02:43.989> they<00:02:44.680> just

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
what's a call just like they just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.890 
what's a call just like they just
quickscope<00:02:45.459> with<00:02:45.760> like<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.030> pistol<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.690> works

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
quickscope with like a pistol that works

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.080 
quickscope with like a pistol that works
better<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.410> sometimes<00:02:47.950> do<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.489> but<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:48.970> have

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
better I sometimes do that but if I have

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.310 
better I sometimes do that but if I have
two<00:02:49.209> snipers<00:02:49.390> I'll<00:02:49.660> quit<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:49.959> two<00:02:50.140> snipers

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
two snipers I'll quit so two snipers

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.380 
two snipers I'll quit so two snipers

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
even know how to quickscope go to Papua

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.120 
even know how to quickscope go to Papua
and<00:03:01.030> do<00:03:01.150> what<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.300> said<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:02.080> keep<00:03:02.260> practicing

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
and do what I said just keep practicing

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.800 
and do what I said just keep practicing
learn<00:03:03.430> where<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.730> send<00:03:03.970> in<00:03:04.060> your<00:03:04.239> screen<00:03:04.660> is

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
learn where to send in your screen is

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.560 
learn where to send in your screen is
because<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.519> necessity<00:03:07.030> because<00:03:07.239> you<00:03:07.450> can

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
because is a necessity because you can

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.810 
because is a necessity because you can
flask<00:03:07.870> up<00:03:08.170> once<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.470> learned<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.860> cuz<00:03:09.459> you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
flask up once you learned that cuz you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.240 
flask up once you learned that cuz you
um<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.239> do<00:03:10.360> feel<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.780> at<00:03:11.050> one<00:03:11.230> point<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.769> could
