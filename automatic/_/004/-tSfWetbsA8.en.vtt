00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.080
 the brick field created by a hair that 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.179
 has been one of the most 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.709
 important in the industry not only for 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.540
 your sales number but also because 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.039
 represented a safe investment to the 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.050
 developers who decided to launch 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.240
 games for this console although the gene 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.250
 boy is remembered for his glorious catalog 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.810
 in the middle of the 90s is when the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.150
 fighting games were enjoying their 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.679
 maximum popularity appeared some 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.570
 powers difficult to forget that 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.519
 they only sold you the nice box with 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.170
 the name of some known game that 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.000
 they normally enjoyed divas at 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.940
 tortillas to enjoy them because it is 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.450
 favorite but when you played it on your 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.300
 game boy were a truly thing 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.449
 horrible and you felt extremely conned 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.070
 and the most stupid gamer in the world but 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.780
 good let's leave our childhood more 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.920
 one side and let's get to know these 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.920
 horrible titles 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.010
 street fighter 2 game boy 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.140
 the legendary title responsible for 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.560
 have revolutionized the arcades had a 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.150
 someone's forum I go around 1995 the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.760
 game presented some pretty graphics 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.920
 decent and an extremely gameplay 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.820
 disgusting broken very, very smelly 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.340
 surely many streetfighter fans 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.830
 they saw their faces with this good title 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.060
 that title was so bad and techno 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.280
 that makes the street movie 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.350
 vandam's fighter 2 looks like a work 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.869
 of art compared to this mess 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.619
 damn hell if they see it out there 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.619
 what do i 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.940
 mortal kombat if you thought you did not know 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.460
 could fall lower than street fighter 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.530
 you're wrong since the version of mortal 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.900
 kombat for game boy one thing 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.910
 indescribable leave your the horrible ones 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.220
 graphics with which the title counted 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.560
 leave your music meaningless and 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.690
 disgusting that had the title the game 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.210
 literally moved by pictures and was 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.800
 so but so slow that all the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.600
 playability became meaningless 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.330
 where you just end up pressing buttons 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.980
 alloway there is no doubt that in those times 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.260
 the competition between street fighter and 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.450
 mortal kombat was so big that even 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.870
 they were competing to make the port more horrible 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.870
 someone vol 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.260
 ramÃ³n reig serves if the version 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.519
 original of which was not exactly very 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.200
 good this deadly kombat with dinosaurs 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.660
 decided to take out a horrible portal game 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.970
 boy to follow the bad habit is 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.769
 in charge of fights on the laptop there's no 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.060
 words so low that I can 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.190
 share the experience of playing a 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.040
 game as horrible as primark ways not 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.610
 I know if control was so broken the lack 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.890
 to have a decent music or I do not know if 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.180
 was the delay of new friends I do not know 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.459
 it was but the game was a 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.170
 conjugation of the most horrible things 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.769
 that may have been done outside of 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.769
 gameboy game 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.810
 killer instinct 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.700
 the gameboy version of killing sing 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.760
 had better fluency than 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.500
 titles mentioned above but still 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.659
 this port contained horrible music 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.120
 without digitized voices and without a 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.709
 well-defined combos mechanics this 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.480
 game should have stayed in mind 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.760
 sick of its creators that we 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.189
 punished with this stinky chingadera 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.189
 called killer instinct that was 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.790
 really one of the poorest games and 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.790
 sad 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.830
 king of fighters 95 this game of 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.720
 most decent ports that had the time 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.220
 Game fights because unlike 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.380
 of other titles that wanted to look like 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.240
 the coffers in a mono matica console 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.310
 like the game boy here the people of 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.410
 atacara used a little more gray mass and 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.930
 he presented us with a chibi concept of klinko 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.880
 fighters with this reduced the size of 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.040
 the sprites adapting them very well for 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.720
 have a better gameplay on the laptop to 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.150
 despite good intentions and 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.920
 respect for your own work this port 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.530
 had at times a slight problem in 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.910
 the speed of the front break still so one 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.069
 of the best fight titles that 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.930
 they went out for the brick gameboy 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.629
 but good, I'm going to leave you here 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.039
 because I study indigestado and no longer 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.949
 I want to follow our titles that 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.940
 Just remembering them makes me bust the 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.470
 liver 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.509
