sunshine is beautiful in any image so I
have<00:02:17.819> an<00:02:17.940> example<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:18.390> an<00:02:18.510> image<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:18.960> took

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
have an example of an image that I took

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.170 
have an example of an image that I took
some<00:02:19.560> time<00:02:19.770> back<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.880> one<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.090> my

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
some time back and this is one of my

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.210 
some time back and this is one of my
favorite<00:02:21.630> images<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.680> Sun<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.070> hitting

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
favorite images and the Sun is hitting

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.170 
favorite images and the Sun is hitting
just<00:02:23.550> right

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
just right

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.300 
just right
as<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.659> see<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.959> Sun<00:02:25.319> flare<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.950> kind<00:02:26.250> of

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
as you can see the Sun flare is kind of

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.679 
as you can see the Sun flare is kind of
coming<00:02:26.609> across<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.969> image<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.450> I'm<00:02:27.510> not

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
coming across the image and I'm not

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.809 
coming across the image and I'm not
directly<00:02:28.170> into<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.129> was<00:02:29.519> able<00:02:29.670> to

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
directly into it and I was able to

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.690 
directly into it and I was able to
capture<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.859> just<00:02:31.859> by<00:02:31.980> kind<00:02:32.219> of<00:02:32.340> getting<00:02:32.609> that

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
capture it just by kind of getting that

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.119 
capture it just by kind of getting that
right<00:02:33.000> angle<00:02:33.659> and<00:02:33.989> just<00:02:34.049> experiment<00:02:34.620> because

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
right angle and just experiment because

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.740 
right angle and just experiment because
sometimes<00:02:35.609> you<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.000> sometimes<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.540> don't

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
sometimes you get it sometimes you don't

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.720 
sometimes you get it sometimes you don't
but<00:02:37.200> that's<00:02:37.349> basically<00:02:37.890> how<00:02:38.159> you<00:02:38.219> get<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.640> and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
but that's basically how you get it and

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.179 
but that's basically how you get it and
for<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.480> most<00:02:39.629> part<00:02:39.810> don't<00:02:40.109> you<00:02:40.920> know<00:02:41.040> I

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
for the most part don't you know I

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.709 
for the most part don't you know I

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
should say for the most part make sure

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.459
