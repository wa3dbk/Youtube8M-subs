the<00:01:59.990> sparkle<00:02:00.319> is<00:02:00.740> actually<00:02:01.459> because<00:02:01.789> she's

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
the sparkle is actually because she's

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.289

drape so we might sell this one or we

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.840

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850

with link and zelda kind of battle shots

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.140 
with link and zelda kind of battle shots
so<00:03:46.600> they're<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.810> bit<00:03:46.989> distressed<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:48.010> dirty<00:03:48.549> so

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
so they're a bit distressed and dirty so

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.759 
so they're a bit distressed and dirty so
we<00:03:49.299> might<00:03:49.450> actually<00:03:49.690> use<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.200> dress<00:03:50.500> as<00:03:50.709> a

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
we might actually use this dress as a

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.410 
we might actually use this dress as a
double<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.430> it's<00:03:51.760> pretty<00:03:51.940> much<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.150> same

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
double and it's pretty much the same

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.920 
double and it's pretty much the same
color<00:03:52.750> so<00:03:53.170> um<00:03:54.299> we're<00:03:55.299> going<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.480> go<00:03:55.600> pick<00:03:55.900> up

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
color so um we're going to go pick up

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.110 
color so um we're going to go pick up
that<00:03:56.200> fabric<00:03:56.650> maybe<00:03:56.890> next<00:03:57.100> week<00:03:57.370> some<00:03:57.790> point

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
that fabric maybe next week some point

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.400 
that fabric maybe next week some point
but<00:03:58.390> overall<00:03:59.140> and<00:04:00.900> we<00:04:01.900> did<00:04:02.049> pretty<00:04:02.170> good<00:04:02.290> i

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
but overall and we did pretty good i

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.069 
but overall and we did pretty good i
think<00:04:02.709> all<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:02.920> together<00:04:03.190> was<00:04:03.670> how<00:04:04.120> much<00:04:04.269> 75

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
think all this together was how much 75

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.140 
think all this together was how much 75
