and it has the straps now this I like to
think<00:01:16.260> that<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.280> small<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:18.090> medium

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
think that I have a small to medium

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.950 
think that I have a small to medium
sized<00:01:18.720> head<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.410> this<00:01:20.130> week<00:01:20.400> fits<00:01:20.759> very<00:01:21.330> snug

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
sized head and this week fits very snug

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.440

I<00:01:22.380> might<00:01:23.280> say<00:01:23.550> a<00:01:23.580> little<00:01:24.030> bit<00:01:24.420> too<00:01:24.899> snug<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.040> I

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
I might say a little bit too snug so I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.300 
I might say a little bit too snug so I
guess<00:01:27.450> keep<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.899> in<00:01:28.020> mind<00:01:28.259> when<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.800> are<00:01:28.979> wig

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
