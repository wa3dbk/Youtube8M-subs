00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello how are the spring villas 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.629
 we have been doing a long time 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.760
 crafts so I thought it was 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.650
 a good idea to start today with little things 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.630
 to eat today I bring you several ideas for 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.309
 make companies with chocolate because to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.170
 Although I said some time 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.279
 I have a hard time eating fruit strawberries 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.010
 I love 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.160
 besides the strawberry its very good help 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.350
 eliminate toxins that do not cheat is by the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.930
 chocolate fight wrinkles 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.450
 what you want is an excuse to get 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.600
 warm helping to maintain the levels of 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:39.010
 sugar equal if you bathe the chocolate 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.690
 do not have a lot of vitamins c if it's 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.280
 for vitamin c you can also eat 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.200
 orange and not bathe the two kilos of 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.180
 chocolate 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.760
 they are good for our long memory 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.890
 term 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.870
 good that the good memory does not sound 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.059
 bad at all because chocolate delays 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.739
 aging so if we go live 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.620
 100 years we would need to have good 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.719
 memory a cup of strawberries has only 25 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.149
 good calories we go directly to see 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.710
 how is the mess made to make this idea 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.710
 we are going to need strawberries 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.370
 black chocolate to melt 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.370
 white chocolate 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.229
 and toothpick 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.790
 first of all let's take the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.680
 chocolates and we're going to melt them in the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.330
 microwave at medium power with much 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.830
 Be careful not to burn me 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.690
 I recommend that you go warming up and 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.300
 the go moving slowly until 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.060
 have this texture 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.360
 let's wash the dams and dry it very 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.160
 all right 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.670
 now let's put one of their faces in 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.950
 white chocolate 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.869
 we stick a stick 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.299
 and I 'm going to nail it to let it dry 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.770
 in this way if they can put it in the 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.909
 refrigerator in chocolate will take 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.909
 very much hand in hardening 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.430
 when they are hard we are going to take a little 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.159
 of dark chocolate and let's make a 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.920
 uve in this way this is going to simulate the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.770
 suit of a jacket and the white part 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.250
 it will be the shirt 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.750
 we cover well everywhere 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.750
 Right now we are seeing it upside down 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.019
 and when it has hardened let's draw 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.200
 with a stick the triangles that will be 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.090
 the bow tie 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.090
 and three points that will be the buttons 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.350
 we still see the strawberry through 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.600
 right is one thing like that 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.400
 when they have cooled completely they 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.280
 we remove the chopsticks and comb a 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.370
 little leaves from the top 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.170
 ready this idea seems very elegant and 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.140
 very fun as a dessert a wait like this 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.880
 a little more special to serve it in some 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.930
 glass tray and that will give you a 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.930
 very sophisticated touch 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.790
 for the second idea what are we going to 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.450
 do is cut the top part of 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.450
 some strawberries 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.550
 and then we are going to cut them 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.940
 half in a more way until 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.940
 we can 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.069
 finally let's put the two halves 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.469
 together and we will go through them with a 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.269
 stick if your strawberries are very 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:20.319
 You can use large skewer sticks 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.319
 more than toothpick 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.720
 now let's prepare a tray and the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.370
 chocolate that falls when it cools 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.800
 we can recover it we place with 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.000
 care to our strawberries and let's 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.000
 to bathe this face with chocolate 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.579
 when we have it ready we put it to the 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.879
 fridge a couple of minutes so that it 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.879
 cool 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.400
 then we turn them over and the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.900
 we remove the toothpick you have to 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.640
 make sure we get all the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.920
 faces of the strawberries so that the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.510
 chocolate grip well and not split into 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.860
 the top part is important to cover 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.110
 all the corners so that it is 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.110
 Perfect as a chocolate filled strawberry 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.750
 we return it in the refrigerator and error of 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.359
 strawberry has been broken because it had not 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.490
 drying right because they are cold the step 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.500
 to another dish and if you want you can 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.560
 decorate them by putting the chocolate 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.880
 another color juntitos or even before 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.870
 that the chocolate hardens you can 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.870
 throw spider colored threads 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.370
 and this the breasts that have inside 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.650
 when it is focused on me I love it 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.650
 and it seems very romantic 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.220
 for the last idea I'm going to use phrases from 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.220
 various sizes 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.550
 and what I'm going to do is just 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:59.230
 wet the chocolate everywhere 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.820
 and before the chocolate hardens 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.820
 I'm going to put shavings of colors 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.050
 You can try several combinations 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.540
 put a layer of white chocolate and 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.480
 another of dark chocolate to put threads of 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.100
 one color and another and playing with the 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.240
 chocolate colors by adding 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.699
 shavings of the flavors that you like 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.460
 this idea despite being the easiest is 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:23.940
 my favorite when it's cold we're going 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.470
 to move to a cupcake mold 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.470
 as if they were chocolates 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.430
 I think it's a super fun idea 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.020
 and it is placed in a box you can 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.050
 give it to someone you want in a 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.860
 special day really this idea I 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.860
 love 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.030
 and this has been all in today's video 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.970
 I hope you liked it and that what 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.289
 put into practice because it really is 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.090
 I think it's a very good idea 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.710
 good to make us in a little bit more 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.479
 spiced to give it to someone who 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.940
 we want and it's good, maybe yes 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.620
 be a bit of an excuse to make me lukewarm 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.690
 with ruffles but today it is better to eat 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.539
 strawberries with chocolate that is bread with 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.250
 chocolate or chocolate with chocolate
