00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
mixing it I know it seems like it's a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.050 
mixing it I know it seems like it's a
lot<00:01:32.750> well<00:01:33.200> because<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:34.039> but<00:01:34.609> at<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.030> end

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
lot well because it is but at the end

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.999 
lot well because it is but at the end

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
it'll all dry up so you pretty much want

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.760 
it'll all dry up so you pretty much want
to<00:01:37.130> fry<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.399> basin<00:01:38.090> in<00:01:38.299> there<00:01:38.539> and<00:01:38.780> uh<00:01:39.079> as<00:01:39.409> you

to fry the basin in there and uh as you
can<00:01:39.920> see<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.460> if<00:01:40.609> my<00:01:40.759> mama<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.359> go<00:01:41.600> with<00:01:42.289> a
