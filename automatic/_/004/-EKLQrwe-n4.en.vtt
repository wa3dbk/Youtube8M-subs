the front of this and the cutouts that
they<00:01:10.560> did<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> top<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> bottom<00:01:12.270> I'm

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
they did for the top and the bottom I'm

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.830 
they did for the top and the bottom I'm
not<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> big<00:01:13.590> fan<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:15.150> definitely<00:01:15.360> not

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
not a big fan and I have definitely not

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960 
not a big fan and I have definitely not
held<00:01:16.140> back<00:01:16.350> mentioning<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.670> seeing

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
held back mentioning this and seeing

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
held back mentioning this and seeing
people<00:01:18.380> are<00:01:19.380> agreeing<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
people are agreeing with me the the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.590 
people are agreeing with me the the
bottom<00:01:22.560> part<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.070> much<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.240> wish<00:01:24.390> they

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
bottom part not so much I just wish they

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
bottom part not so much I just wish they
could<00:01:24.750> complete<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.590> think<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.280> would

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
could complete that I think it would

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.280 
could complete that I think it would
look<00:01:26.549> nicer<00:01:26.909> down<00:01:27.060> at<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> bottom<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
look nicer down at the bottom but the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.450 
look nicer down at the bottom but the
top<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:30.030> don't<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.600> way<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.869> looks

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
top I I just don't like the way it looks

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.370 
top I I just don't like the way it looks
for<00:01:32.460> functionality<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.210> understand<00:01:33.930> why<00:01:34.140> they

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
for functionality I understand why they

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
for functionality I understand why they
would<00:01:34.409> want<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.799> leave<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.430> sensors<00:01:35.850> open<00:01:36.119> on

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
would want to leave the sensors open on

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.510 
would want to leave the sensors open on
the<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.450> side<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.140> doesn't<00:01:37.409> impede<00:01:37.710> your

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the one side so it doesn't impede your

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.880 
the one side so it doesn't impede your
phone<00:01:38.970> dimming<00:01:39.479> when<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> don't<00:01:40.470> want<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
experienced it with other screen shields

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.990

but<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.500> they're<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.399> they<00:01:47.790> may

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
but if they're going to do that they may

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.420

as<00:01:48.149> well<00:01:48.299> even<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.170> both<00:01:49.380> sides<00:01:49.680> because

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
as well even it up on both sides because

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.190 
as well even it up on both sides because
having<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> device<00:01:51.240> look<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> screen

shields cut wrong I understand wanting

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
shields cut wrong I understand wanting
to<00:01:58.740> keep<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> sides<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.460> little<00:01:59.490> bit<00:01:59.790> short<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
to keep the sides a little bit short to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.719 
to keep the sides a little bit short to
put<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> case<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.719> I'm<00:02:00.930> fine<00:02:01.320> with<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:02.490> if

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
put a case on I'm fine with that but if

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.580 
put a case on I'm fine with that but if
you're<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.780> top<00:02:04.020> you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
you're going to do that to the top you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.039 
you're going to do that to the top you
may<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:04.890> well<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.460> don't<00:02:06.210> know<00:02:06.390> completed

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
may as well I don't know completed

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.919 
may as well I don't know completed
somehow<00:02:07.439> make<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.920> look<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.569> uniform<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.720> both

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
somehow make it look a uniform on both

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.199 
somehow make it look a uniform on both
sides<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.649> course<00:02:11.250> then<00:02:11.400> you've<00:02:11.550> got<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> larger

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
sides of course then you've got a larger

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.280 
sides of course then you've got a larger
hole<00:02:12.390> cut<00:02:12.629> out<00:02:12.660> at<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> top

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
hole cut out at the top

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.160 
hole cut out at the top
I<00:02:13.500> don't<00:02:14.099> know<00:02:14.219> whether<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:15.060> would<00:02:15.209> be<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.840> put

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
I don't know whether it would be to put

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.649 
I don't know whether it would be to put
holes<00:02:16.739> where<00:02:17.340> those<00:02:17.489> sensors<00:02:17.849> are<00:02:18.120> might<00:02:18.480> be<00:02:18.629> a

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
holes where those sensors are might be a

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.550 
holes where those sensors are might be a
good<00:02:18.840> idea<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.439> don't<00:02:19.769> know<00:02:19.859> I'm<00:02:20.459> sure<00:02:20.549> they've

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
good idea I don't know I'm sure they've

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.020 
good idea I don't know I'm sure they've
tested<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.650> out<00:02:22.829> and<00:02:23.040> done<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> best<00:02:23.909> that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
tested it out and done the best that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.089 
tested it out and done the best that
they<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:24.689> is<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.680> option<00:02:26.069> that

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
they can and this is the the option that

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.099 
they can and this is the the option that
they<00:02:26.310> have<00:02:26.519> but<00:02:26.909> you<00:02:27.269> know<00:02:27.390> with<00:02:27.629> other<00:02:27.810> screen

thirty dollars screen shield down the
fifteen<00:03:20.849> dollars<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.540> you've<00:03:21.989> got<00:03:22.139> a<00:03:22.199> second

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
fifteen dollars and you've got a second

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229 
one happens again you get it replaced

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.990 
one happens again you get it replaced
again<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:25.919> you<00:03:25.979> now<00:03:26.250> take<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> thirty<00:03:26.819> dollar

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
again so you now take a thirty dollar

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.399 
again so you now take a thirty dollar
and<00:03:27.209> you've<00:03:27.299> knocked<00:03:27.479> down<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.900> ten<00:03:28.109> dollars

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
and you've knocked down to ten dollars

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.899 
and you've knocked down to ten dollars
because<00:03:28.590> you've<00:03:28.799> got<00:03:28.979> three<00:03:29.250> screen<00:03:29.549> shields

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
because you've got three screen shields

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.719 
because you've got three screen shields
so<00:03:30.449> in<00:03:30.810> my<00:03:31.260> opinion<00:03:31.379> do<00:03:31.799> you<00:03:31.859> do<00:03:32.220> get<00:03:32.459> what<00:03:32.609> you

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
so in my opinion do you do get what you

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.460 
so in my opinion do you do get what you
pay<00:03:32.879> for<00:03:33.150> are<00:03:33.359> there<00:03:33.840> companies<00:03:34.260> out<00:03:34.440> there

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
pay for are there companies out there

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.969 
pay for are there companies out there
that<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.889> like<00:03:35.519> better<00:03:35.760> yes<00:03:36.419> there<00:03:36.720> are<00:03:36.900> but<00:03:37.560> you

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:37.979 
that I like better yes there are but you

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.289 
that I like better yes there are but you
know<00:03:38.099> these<00:03:38.459> are<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.790> things<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.239> have

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
know these are the things that you have

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.030 
know these are the things that you have
to<00:03:39.389> decide<00:03:39.690> if<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.930> want<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.169> do<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.799> wet

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
to decide if you want to do the wet

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.469 
to decide if you want to do the wet
screen<00:03:41.370> shield<00:03:41.549> install<00:03:41.879> is<00:03:42.000> very<00:03:42.239> nice

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
screen shield install is very nice

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.349 
screen shield install is very nice
because<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.989> have<00:03:43.349> less<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.859> chance<00:03:43.889> of

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
because you have less of a chance of

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.789 
because you have less of a chance of
making<00:03:45.359> an<00:03:45.479> error<00:03:45.629> and<00:03:45.959> putting<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.379> on<00:03:46.560> and

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
making an error and putting that on and

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:47.899 
making an error and putting that on and
lining<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.190> up<00:03:47.280> if<00:03:47.459> you're<00:03:47.549> someone<00:03:47.849> that

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
lining it up if you're someone that

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.699 
lining it up if you're someone that
doesn't<00:03:48.239> necessarily<00:03:48.359> like<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.169> there<00:03:49.560> are

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
doesn't necessarily like that there are

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.550 
doesn't necessarily like that there are
options<00:03:49.949> for<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.459> out<00:03:50.639> there<00:03:50.669> as<00:03:50.970> well<00:03:51.180> but

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
options for you out there as well but

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.409 
options for you out there as well but
this<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.769> my<00:03:52.919> honest<00:03:53.790> opinion<00:03:54.150> with<00:03:54.269> this

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
this is my honest opinion with this

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.289 
this is my honest opinion with this
isn't<00:03:54.930> something<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.459> I'm<00:03:56.459> too<00:03:56.909> keen<00:03:57.269> on

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
isn't something that I'm too keen on

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.030 
isn't something that I'm too keen on
because<00:03:57.870> just<00:03:58.109> of<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.470> aesthetic<00:03:58.859> reasons

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
because just of the aesthetic reasons

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.009 
because just of the aesthetic reasons
I've<00:03:59.519> tried<00:04:00.060> other<00:04:00.329> screen<00:04:00.659> shields<00:04:00.959> that

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
I've tried other screen shields that

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.259 
I've tried other screen shields that
have<00:04:01.199> work<00:04:01.439> just<00:04:01.709> fine<00:04:01.859> but<00:04:02.340> that's<00:04:02.760> just<00:04:02.879> me
