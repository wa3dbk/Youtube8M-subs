 here is the heat here just to give a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.370
 then it 's not a little bit dry 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.969
 white shade base only for 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.250
 neutralize the color of the eyelid and 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.090
 emphasis on the things that the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:06.990
 People are going to use the brush here. 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:09.299
 Need to start working with 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.060
 lighter colors 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.369
 This is the under here value here. 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.299
 compensate small 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.720
 shadows and fancies have no pity 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:29.579
 putting shade is very important in this 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.729
 step here do not save in the shade 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:38.970
 clear and also a little below the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:41.400
 eyebrow that will help to blur the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.950
 dark shadow as soon as they 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.500
 reach and reach in height 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.270
 asked shading this guy here 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.860
 We're going to wear the sexy shade Paul and 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.750
 it was bad and only that in the last third 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.600
 of her lack in a little corner 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.290
 if I like it and rub the crown only 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.030
 with light strokes to qualify well 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.670
 spicy and well and will already creating 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.340
 drawing of this little pussy here 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.740
 who does not like this beak can do 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.380
 more rounded also no problem 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.100
 no, I'm going to pout a little bit 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:26.430
 more standing, no problem 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.430
 in all - and its people and will bring 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:40.570
 even so far with this little brush 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.510
 here also to apply shadows 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.170
 I'll use a bit of a shadow to 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.940
 dark purple well opaque right here 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.010
 in this end of the color of and with that 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.570
 won here also for shadows at a 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:04.200
 little bigger 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:04.200
 I go very carefully in the most smoked 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.520
 That's why it was important that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.510
 first step of putting it quite clear 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:21.959
 on the movable eyelid because it 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:25.020
 that strikes us already said that it is 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.870
 very marked as strange I'm going to use 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:38.519
 a little brush, so it 's best that he 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:45.030
 already in the box here, same thing 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:04:04.970
 this side along with that first 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:04:04.970
 shadow that we come here 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:19.140
 I think this purple it will value 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.010
 even more the same now we go 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.430
 wondering how much more smoking 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.430
 more beautiful 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.390
 How do we work with opaque colors? 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.669
 so you have to have a little more 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.900
 patience a little more chatinha de 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:39.419
 foam but always with light 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:44.129
 stamp I always use to always speak 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:47.029
 a shower on the stage one day 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:47.029
 okay 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.180
 people the line bava I'll use a brush 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.810
 precision sapphire with a gold color 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.110
 it's a very burnt gold nest 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:25.500
 This one is soft color on the pallet 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:28.169
 same to me and then I'm going to 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.650
 eyelash mask that has 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:36.180
 This applicator is very small and 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:39.810
 will make a lock down here in 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.180
 children and it 's interiors is easier 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.300
 reach the indexes here with the people more 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.169
 I like it to do it down here and 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.169
