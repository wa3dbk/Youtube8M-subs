00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:03.389
Hi YouTube,
This is GeekTeen2

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.670
This is an update to my most viewed video,
New Android Tablets.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.150
The Asus Eee Pad Slider and
the Sony Tablet S, formerly known as the S1,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.410
have been released to mostly positive reviews.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.770
More so for the Sony Tablet S.
The Sony Tablet P,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.830
formerly known as the S2,
hasn't been released yet.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.400
In the nearby future, there's likely to be;
3 new Galaxy Tabs,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.070
2 new Xooms,
1 new Eee Pad,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.180
and HTC's first Honeycomb tablet.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.660
Samsung is planning 3 new Galaxy Tabs;
the Galaxy Tab 8.9,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.950
the Galaxy Tab 7.7,
and the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.690
The largest of the 3 new Galaxy Tabs is the
Galaxy Tab 8.9.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.659
It's a bit cheaper, but it's almost identical
to the Galaxy Tab 10.1.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.070
It also runs Android Honeycomb.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.290
It has an 8.9-inch display,
unlike the 10.1-inch on the tab 10.1.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.830
Unlike the Galaxy Tab 10.1,
available in black and white,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.040
the tab 8.9 has a grey back that represents
brushed aluminum,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.550
it's still plastic though.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.590
It's just as thick as the 10.1,
the worlds slimmest tablet, but lighter.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.130
I have high expectations for this tablet,
as the 10.1 is one of the best tablets available.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.910
Samsung is going to release a smaller tablet;
the Galaxy Tab 7.7.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.050
As you probably figured out,
it has a 7.7-inch display;

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.060
just a bit bigger than your typical 7 inch
tablet.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.280
Like the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and 8.9,
the Tab 7.7 runs the Android Honeycomb OS.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.510
It looks similar to the Galaxy Tab 10.1,
but it's slightly slimmer,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.110
it has a port at the short end so it can be
docked vertically,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.210
and it's the only Galaxy Tab with a metal
back.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.320
This will be a great small tablet.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.850
Samsung is also going to release a successor
to the original 7 inch Galaxy Tab;

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.899
the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.400
Unlike the original, this one runs Android
Honeycomb,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.840
just like all the Galaxy Tabs after the original.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.250
It's hardly smaller than the Tab 7.7,
with only a 0.7 inch difference in screen

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.250
size.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.189
But the performance is lower so it will be
cheaper.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.260
It will be available in both white and the
fake brushed aluminum like the Tab 8.9.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.959
Unless if the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus,
and the Tab 7.7 have a big price difference,

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.599
and they're still both great deals,
it seems pointless to release both of them

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.690
at around the same time.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.659
It might be better for Samsung to spend their
money on things like,

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:52.900
better Galaxy Tab accessories,
and more colours for the Galaxy Tab 10.1.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.499
But the 7.0 Plus might be a great budget tablet.

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:03.170
Motorola hasn't announced them yet,
but there's leaked photos of 2 new Motorola

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.170
tablets.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.489
Both of them are 9 millimetres thick.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.299
That's thicker than the Galaxy Tab 10.1,
and the iPad 2, by just a bit,

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.739
but that's thinner than the original Motorola
Xoom.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.180
One of them is a successor to the first Android
Honeycomb tablet,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.010
the Motorola Xoom, or as I like to call, the
Xoom,

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.529
which is a much better name that's more true
to the spelling.

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:32.599
The second one, is probably going to be released
alongside it.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.040
It's smaller, and it appears to be designed
so that it will be normally held in a vertical

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.629
position,
unlike the other 2, which are designed to

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.769
be held in a horizontal position most of the
time.

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.290
Asus is going to release the third tablet
in their Eee Pad line,

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.230
the Eee Pad Memo 3D.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.480
The Eee Pad Memo is a 7-inch tablet,
unlike it's big sisters;

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.730
the Eee Pad Transformer and the Eee Pad Slider,
which have 10.1-inch displays.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.249
It has a pressure sensitive stylus,
which would make this tablet great for drawing,

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.950
if you have the right app.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.029
Asus should include an imaging app for this
tablet.

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:11.220
I hope to see this feature on more tablets.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.559
A more recent addition is an autostereoscopic
display.

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.389
That is, a glasses-free 3D display.

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.419
This should be good for gaming, if developers
add support for it.

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.690
It doesn't have dual cameras though.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.550
The Asus MeMic and a pair of earbuds will
be bundled with this tablet.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.960
The MeMic is a Bluetooth headset and reciever.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.960
You probably don't want to hold a tablet,
even a 7-inch tablet up to your ear.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.530
With the Memo 3D, you can hold the MeMic up
to your ear instead.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.650
You can also plug headphones into the MeMic.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.990
Asus should also sell this separately.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.580
HTC is going to release their first 10-inch
tablet,

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.139
also their first Honeycomb tablet;
the HTC Jetstream.

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:04.680
It will be the first 4G LTE tablet from AT&amp;T
in the US, selling for $700.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.570
It will be available in Canada from Rogers.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.379
This thing is powerful, with a 1.5 GHz dual
core Snapdragon processor.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.460
The rear facing camera is also great.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.740
It's 8 MP and it has a nice lense with Autofocus.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.930
Even though the front facing camera is only
1.3 MP, this is probably the best Cameratablet

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.349
you can buy.

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.550
It has a micro-USB port for charging, which
I prefer over the specialized ports on the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.290
iPads and Galaxy Tabs.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.440
Toshiba is also planning to release a new
tablet.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.919
It's really slim, not thick like the Toshiba
Thrive.

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:47.680
It has micro-HDMI and a micro SD card slot,
but more importantly, it has a standard USB

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.639
port,
which is a pleasant surprise for such a slim

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:52.639
tablet.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:58.990
I was hoping that more tablets with standard
USB ports would be released.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.259
Just a comparison for most tablet owners,
both of the Apple iPads have 9.7-inch displays.

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:11.520
Later this year, I'm probably going to make
a video review on an Android tablet.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:19.449
Possibly, one of the bigger Galaxy Tabs, the
next generation of Xooms, or the Asus Eee

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.629
Pad Slider.

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.389
Please rate this video if you can.
