that our adoption is best for me i think
that<00:01:43.289> people<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.740> consider<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.369> this

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that people have to consider that this

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.359 
that people have to consider that this
process<00:01:45.539> is<00:01:45.810> about<00:01:46.109> the<00:01:46.380> baby<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.859> not<00:01:47.130> about

process is about the baby it's not about
me<00:01:47.609> and<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:49.280> anybody<00:01:50.280> else's

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
me and it's not about anybody else's

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.260 
me and it's not about anybody else's
mainly<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.590> concern<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.039> how<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.849> baby<00:01:54.119> is

adoption is is great for the adopting

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.309 
adoption is is great for the adopting
family<00:02:33.329> because<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.920> allows<00:02:35.250> us<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:36.569> have<00:02:37.079> a

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
family because it allows us to have a

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.129 
family because it allows us to have a
special<00:02:37.650> connection<00:02:38.269> with<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.630> person<00:02:39.840> who

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
special connection with the person who

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.559 
special connection with the person who
gave<00:02:40.319> birth<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.799> our<00:02:41.099> child<00:02:41.250> which<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.209> so

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
gave birth to our child which is so

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.809 
gave birth to our child which is so
absolutely<00:02:43.139> important<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.099> was<00:02:44.310> actually

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
absolutely important I was actually

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.099 
absolutely important I was actually
gotten<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.090> be<00:02:45.239> pretty<00:02:45.269> good<00:02:45.630> friends<00:02:45.810> with

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
gotten to be pretty good friends with

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.470 
gotten to be pretty good friends with
the<00:02:46.260> adoptive<00:02:46.680> family<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.609> think<00:02:48.329> it's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
the adoptive family and I think it's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.780 
the adoptive family and I think it's
kind<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:49.109> having<00:02:49.530> an<00:02:49.799> extended<00:02:50.340> family

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
kind of like having an extended family

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.449 
kind of like having an extended family
it<00:02:51.599> does<00:02:51.900> feel<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.319> you're<00:02:52.530> giving<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
it does feel like you're giving the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.550 
it does feel like you're giving the
adopting<00:02:54.090> parents<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.599> gift<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.139> they<00:02:55.169> can

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
adopting parents a gift that they can

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.520 
adopting parents a gift that they can
have<00:02:56.389> you<00:02:57.389> know<00:02:57.569> since<00:02:57.810> they're<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.049> lot<00:02:58.319> of

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
have you know since they're a lot of

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.930 
have you know since they're a lot of
times<00:02:58.739> they're<00:02:58.950> not<00:02:59.099> able<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.549> have<00:02:59.700> their<00:02:59.880> own

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
times they're not able to have their own

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.550 
times they're not able to have their own
children<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.780> are<00:03:00.930> ready<00:03:01.169> to<00:03:01.290> have<00:03:01.530> children
