00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:10.640 
that day were they were the biggest

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
that day were they were the biggest
things<00:00:10.790> I've<00:00:10.970> ever<00:00:11.000> seen

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
things I've ever seen

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.400 
things I've ever seen
hands<00:00:11.960> down<00:00:12.290> easy<00:00:13.100> and<00:00:13.310> I<00:00:13.910> think<00:00:14.540> jaws<00:00:14.990> is<00:00:15.290> the

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
hands down easy and I think jaws is the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.929 
hands down easy and I think jaws is the
only<00:00:15.530> place<00:00:15.800> I've<00:00:16.010> seen<00:00:16.250> where<00:00:16.400> I've<00:00:16.520> been

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
only place I've seen where I've been

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.599 
only place I've seen where I've been
mmm<00:00:17.419> maybe<00:00:17.929> more<00:00:18.230> scared<00:00:18.589> because<00:00:19.369> of<00:00:19.519> the

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
mmm maybe more scared because of the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.640 
mmm maybe more scared because of the
power<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.119> way<00:00:20.240> is<00:00:20.359> at<00:00:20.630> jaws<00:00:20.900> and<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:21.439> first

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
power the way is at jaws and the first

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.890 
power the way is at jaws and the first
time<00:00:21.859> I<00:00:21.890> surfed<00:00:22.759> really<00:00:23.060> big<00:00:23.179> jaws<00:00:23.419> that<00:00:23.720> was

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
time I surfed really big jaws that was

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.069 
time I surfed really big jaws that was
probably<00:00:24.529> even<00:00:25.039> more<00:00:25.460> overwhelming<00:00:26.240> but<00:00:26.720> this

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
probably even more overwhelming but this

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.200 
probably even more overwhelming but this
this<00:00:27.439> day<00:00:27.710> was<00:00:27.919> this<00:00:28.369> last<00:00:28.579> Cortes<00:00:29.029> was

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
this day was this last Cortes was

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.669 
this day was this last Cortes was
clearly<00:00:29.539> the<00:00:29.689> biggest<00:00:30.109> way<00:00:30.319> as<00:00:30.439> I've<00:00:30.560> ever

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
clearly the biggest way as I've ever

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.500 
clearly the biggest way as I've ever
seen<00:00:30.849> I<00:00:31.849> know<00:00:32.329> I<00:00:32.509> saw<00:00:32.870> waves<00:00:33.730> over<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:34.969> 70<00:00:35.359> foot

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
seen I know I saw waves over the 70 foot

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.529 
seen I know I saw waves over the 70 foot
mark<00:00:35.809> 80<00:00:36.170> foot<00:00:36.620> plus<00:00:37.070> waves<00:00:37.370> out<00:00:37.640> there<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:37.879> even

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
mark 80 foot plus waves out there I even

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.930 
mark 80 foot plus waves out there I even
think<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:39.079> there<00:00:39.739> might<00:00:39.980> have<00:00:40.010> been<00:00:40.129> a<00:00:40.250> wave

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
think that there might have been a wave

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.220 
think that there might have been a wave
close<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.390> a<00:00:41.449> hundred<00:00:41.719> feet<00:00:41.870> out<00:00:42.019> there<00:00:42.199> I

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
close to a hundred feet out there I

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.520 
close to a hundred feet out there I
really<00:00:42.289> do<00:00:42.739> feel<00:00:43.930> like<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:45.140> surfable

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
really do feel like a surfable

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.979 
really do feel like a surfable
theoretical<00:00:46.070> yes<00:00:46.219> I<00:00:46.699> do<00:00:47.120> I<00:00:47.269> believe<00:00:47.629> someone

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
theoretical yes I do I believe someone

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.259 
theoretical yes I do I believe someone
get<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.199> hundred<00:00:48.469> foot<00:00:48.559> wave<00:00:48.710> out<00:00:48.920> there<00:00:49.269> for

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
get a hundred foot wave out there for

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.000 
get a hundred foot wave out there for
sure<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:50.719> that<00:00:51.079> will<00:00:51.230> be<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.469> spot<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:51.890> will

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
sure and that will be the spot it will

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.160 
sure and that will be the spot it will
happen<00:00:52.160> because<00:00:53.089> the<00:00:53.329> reef<00:00:53.510> will<00:00:53.690> handle<00:00:54.019> it

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
happen because the reef will handle it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.110 
happen because the reef will handle it
and<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.309> way<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.609> storm<00:00:55.910> in<00:00:56.089> my

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
and the the the way the storm in my

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.389 
and the the the way the storm in my
opinion<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.780> way<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.019> storms<00:00:57.829> set<00:00:58.070> up<00:00:58.219> there

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
opinion the way the storms set up there

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.650 
opinion the way the storms set up there
in<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.579> North<00:00:58.730> Pacific<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.239> where<00:00:59.480> it's

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
in the North Pacific and where it's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.479 
in the North Pacific and where it's
located

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
located

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.579 
located
it'll<00:01:01.489> happen<00:01:01.670> there<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:02.269> I<00:01:02.780> mean<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:03.499> was

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
it'll happen there and I mean it was

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.399 
it'll happen there and I mean it was
really<00:01:03.800> close<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.370> day<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:04.820> think<00:01:05.170> had<00:01:06.170> there

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
really close that day I think had there

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.780 
really close that day I think had there
have<00:01:06.500> been<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.650> few<00:01:06.740> more<00:01:06.950> people<00:01:07.280> out<00:01:07.549> there

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
have been a few more people out there

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.490 
have been a few more people out there
and<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:08.000> few<00:01:08.150> more<00:01:08.299> people<00:01:08.450> documenting<00:01:09.350> it

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
and a few more people documenting it

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.700 
and a few more people documenting it
someone<00:01:10.009> might<00:01:10.159> have<00:01:10.250> been<00:01:10.400> real<00:01:10.610> close<00:01:10.820> I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
someone might have been real close I

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.080 
someone might have been real close I
mean<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:12.770> know<00:01:12.829> Greg<00:01:13.460> was<00:01:13.729> saying<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:14.060> same

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
mean I know Greg was saying the same

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.819 
mean I know Greg was saying the same
thing<00:01:14.509> Twiggy<00:01:14.900> was<00:01:15.049> saying<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.350> same<00:01:15.380> thing

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
thing Twiggy was saying the same thing

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.190 
thing Twiggy was saying the same thing
and<00:01:16.009> Brad<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.119> all<00:01:17.329> of<00:01:17.479> us<00:01:17.570> were<00:01:17.720> just<00:01:17.750> I

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
and Brad to all of us were just I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.819 
and Brad to all of us were just I
couldn't<00:01:18.920> believe<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:19.189> was<00:01:19.369> really<00:01:19.729> that<00:01:20.180> big

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
couldn't believe it was really that big

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.230 
couldn't believe it was really that big
we<00:01:21.829> thought<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.250> was<00:01:22.310> going<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.549> be<00:01:22.700> the

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
we thought it was going to be the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.490 
we thought it was going to be the
biggest<00:01:23.420> we'd<00:01:23.659> ever<00:01:23.780> seen<00:01:24.079> it<00:01:24.200> but<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.409> was

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
biggest we'd ever seen it but it was

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.350 
biggest we'd ever seen it but it was
another<00:01:24.920> level<00:01:25.189> on<00:01:25.399> top<00:01:25.430> of<00:01:25.759> that<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.149> was<00:01:26.299> like

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
another level on top of that it was like

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.899 
another level on top of that it was like
okay<00:01:27.229> wait<00:01:27.500> I've<00:01:27.680> seen<00:01:27.710> waves<00:01:28.520> that<00:01:28.729> look

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
okay wait I've seen waves that look

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.880 
okay wait I've seen waves that look
about<00:01:29.030> 50<00:01:29.570> 60<00:01:29.750> feet<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:30.320> seemed<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:30.860> be

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
about 50 60 feet this seemed to be

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.670 
about 50 60 feet this seemed to be
another<00:01:31.430> 20<00:01:31.820> 30<00:01:32.030> feet<00:01:32.210> bigger<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.409> way<00:01:33.530> of

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
another 20 30 feet bigger and the way of

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.980 
another 20 30 feet bigger and the way of
riding<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.490> waves<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.969> couple<00:01:35.509> of<00:01:35.600> the

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
riding the waves the couple of the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.260 
riding the waves the couple of the
really<00:01:36.320> big<00:01:36.469> waves<00:01:36.680> we<00:01:36.829> rowed<00:01:37.040> just<00:01:37.820> never

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
really big waves we rowed just never

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.050 
really big waves we rowed just never

ever seemed to end you're just it never
seemed<00:01:41.390> like<00:01:41.570> there<00:01:41.719> was<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.840> bottom<00:01:42.200> on<00:01:42.320> them

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
seemed like there was a bottom on them

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.410 
seemed like there was a bottom on them
it<00:01:42.890> was<00:01:43.009> amazing<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.640> then<00:01:43.729> letting<00:01:44.180> go<00:01:44.390> of

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
it was amazing and then letting go of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.520 
it was amazing and then letting go of
the<00:01:44.539> rope<00:01:44.719> I'm<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:44.990> know<00:01:45.079> in<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.200> way<00:01:45.289> of<00:01:45.409> that

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
the rope I'm you know in a way of that

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.260 
the rope I'm you know in a way of that
size<00:01:45.770> was<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.039> clear<00:01:46.399> when<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.789> let<00:01:46.909> go<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.180> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
size was a clear when to let go of the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.300 
size was a clear when to let go of the
rope<00:01:47.479> no<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:48.350> wasn't<00:01:48.680> clear<00:01:48.860> you're<00:01:49.039> tracking

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
and get out in front of it and have it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.510 
and get out in front of it and have it
catch<00:02:05.509> up<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.899> hit<00:02:06.049> you<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.380> your<00:02:06.560> your<00:02:07.009> timing

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
catch up and hit you so your your timing

catch up and hit you so your your timing
is<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:07.789> critical<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.420> when<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.810> let<00:02:08.989> go<00:02:09.129> but

tracking them from so

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.740 
tracking them from so

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
gonna tell me into the first one

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.270 
gonna tell me into the first one
actually<00:02:26.590> wasn't<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.830> first<00:02:27.010> wave<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
actually wasn't the first wave of the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.339 
actually wasn't the first wave of the
set<00:02:27.459> but<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.760> was<00:02:27.849> a<00:02:27.879> really<00:02:28.090> big<00:02:28.360> wave<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.780> and

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
set but it was a really big wave and and

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.600 
set but it was a really big wave and and
I<00:02:29.410> went<00:02:29.590> no<00:02:29.800> no<00:02:29.830> no<00:02:30.069> there's<00:02:30.220> there's

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
I went no no no there's there's

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.949 
I went no no no there's there's
something<00:02:30.910> behind<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.569> he<00:02:31.690> was<00:02:31.840> in

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
something behind it and he was in

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.720 
something behind it and he was in
disbelief<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.799> wanted<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.220> go<00:02:33.370> over<00:02:33.400> it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
disbelief that I wanted to go over it

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.190 
disbelief that I wanted to go over it
because<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:34.030> one<00:02:34.209> in<00:02:34.360> front<00:02:34.690> would<00:02:34.870> look<00:02:35.019> like

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
because the one in front would look like

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.949 
because the one in front would look like
such<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.530> big<00:02:36.340> perfect<00:02:36.879> wave<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.299> sure<00:02:37.900> enough

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
such a big perfect wave and sure enough

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.410 
such a big perfect wave and sure enough
we<00:02:38.260> went<00:02:38.379> over<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.670> was<00:02:39.819> just<00:02:40.060> one<00:02:40.390> of

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
we went over it and it was just one of

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.930 
we went over it and it was just one of
those<00:02:40.569> moments<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:41.110> like<00:02:41.640> one<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.790> only

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
those moments of like one of the only

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.130 
those moments of like one of the only
times<00:02:43.209> I've<00:02:43.360> ever<00:02:43.540> been

I've<00:03:00.160> never<00:03:00.459> seen<00:03:01.180> anything<00:03:01.420> like<00:03:01.510> it

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
I've never seen anything like it

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.259 
I've never seen anything like it
when<00:03:02.319> I<00:03:02.349> let<00:03:02.620> go<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.860> was<00:03:03.129> like<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.670> know<00:03:03.760> just

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
when I let go I was like you know just

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.819 
when I let go I was like you know just
like<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:04.930> said<00:03:05.079> I<00:03:05.140> was<00:03:05.260> trying<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.470> figure<00:03:05.650> out

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
like you said I was trying to figure out

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.500 
like you said I was trying to figure out
where<00:03:06.129> where<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.849> let<00:03:07.030> go<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.360> have<00:03:07.480> that

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
where where to let go and have that

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.039 
where where to let go and have that
perfect<00:03:07.840> amount<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.349> speed<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.780> drop

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
perfect amount of speed and the the drop

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.470 
perfect amount of speed and the the drop
drop<00:03:11.290> just<00:03:11.590> never<00:03:11.829> end<00:03:12.129> never<00:03:12.730> ended<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.329> was

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
drop just never end never ended it was

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.660 
drop just never end never ended it was
just<00:03:13.660> down<00:03:14.049> down<00:03:14.290> down<00:03:14.530> down<00:03:14.829> that<00:03:15.099> was<00:03:15.250> really

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
just down down down down that was really

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.210 
just down down down down that was really
bumpy<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.239> my<00:03:17.110> board<00:03:17.349> cavitate<00:03:17.859> it<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:18.040> little

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
bumpy and my board cavitate it a little

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.800 
bumpy and my board cavitate it a little
and<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.430> started<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.790> slide<00:03:19.060> back<00:03:19.329> up<00:03:19.359> a<00:03:19.690> little

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
and I started to slide back up a little

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.770 
and I started to slide back up a little
and<00:03:20.019> then<00:03:20.109> keep<00:03:20.709> going<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.489> kicked<00:03:22.299> out<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
and then keep going and I kicked out the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.809 
and then keep going and I kicked out the
wave<00:03:22.930> hit<00:03:23.200> me<00:03:23.350> in<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.950> made<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.400> kicked

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
wave hit me in and I made it and kicked

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.090 
wave hit me in and I made it and kicked
out<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.209> Greg<00:03:25.420> was<00:03:25.600> Greg<00:03:26.319> long<00:03:26.530> came<00:03:26.769> up<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.010> me

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
out and Greg was Greg long came up to me

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.370 
out and Greg was Greg long came up to me

saying that was unbelievable and nursing

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.470 
saying that was unbelievable and nursing
in<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.290> way<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.680> big<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.670> was<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:34.359> was

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
in a way of that big and it was it was

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.690 
in a way of that big and it was it was
pretty<00:03:34.810> darn<00:03:35.260> exciting<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:36.010> know<00:03:36.099> and<00:03:36.489> and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
pretty darn exciting you know and and

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.370 
pretty darn exciting you know and and
and<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.090> was<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.510> was<00:03:37.660> kind<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.959> early<00:03:38.260> in

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
and that was that was kind of early in

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.190 
and that was that was kind of early in
the<00:03:38.560> session<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.190> was<00:03:39.400> about<00:03:39.900> maybe<00:03:40.900> an<00:03:41.049> hour

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
the session that was about maybe an hour

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.949 
the session that was about maybe an hour
and<00:03:41.349> a<00:03:41.380> half<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:42.280> we<00:03:42.790> all<00:03:42.940> rode<00:03:43.180> for<00:03:43.780> sure

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
and a half in and we all rode for sure

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.300 
and a half in and we all rode for sure
the<00:03:44.109> biggest<00:03:44.200> waves<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.650> our<00:03:44.769> lives<00:03:44.950> for<00:03:45.250> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
the biggest waves of our lives for the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.360 
the biggest waves of our lives for the
next<00:03:45.370> three<00:03:45.880> hours<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.180> mean<00:03:46.599> I<00:03:46.660> saw<00:03:46.930> Greg<00:03:47.370> ride

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
next three hours I mean I saw Greg ride

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.699 
next three hours I mean I saw Greg ride
two<00:03:48.669> waves<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.209> were<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:50.380> know<00:03:50.410> probably

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
two waves that were you know probably

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.020 
two waves that were you know probably
bigger<00:03:51.010> than<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.280> one<00:03:51.430> he<00:03:51.579> didn't<00:03:51.819> get<00:03:51.880> it

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
bigger than the one he didn't get it

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.809 
bigger than the one he didn't get it
documented<00:03:52.450> but<00:03:52.750> they<00:03:52.930> were<00:03:52.989> they<00:03:53.680> were<00:03:53.819> they

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
documented but they were they were they

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.569 
documented but they were they were they
were<00:03:54.880> probably<00:03:55.299> 80<00:03:56.139> foot<00:03:56.349> waves<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.829> think<00:03:57.489> they

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
were probably 80 foot waves I think they

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.180 
were probably 80 foot waves I think they
were<00:03:57.750> they<00:03:58.750> were<00:03:58.840> just<00:03:58.930> reading<00:03:59.319> on<00:03:59.829> face

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
were they were just reading on face

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.430 
were they were just reading on face
height<00:04:00.430> first<00:04:00.700> they<00:04:01.120> were<00:04:01.239> just<00:04:01.510> out<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.349> this

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
height first they were just out of this

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.349 
height first they were just out of this
world<00:04:02.620> big<00:04:02.889> so<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.459> making<00:04:03.819> that<00:04:03.940> first<00:04:04.209> wave

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
world big so you making that first wave

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.059 
world big so you making that first wave
I<00:04:04.510> mean<00:04:04.660> probably<00:04:04.870> helped<00:04:05.410> everyone<00:04:05.650> in<00:04:05.859> a<00:04:05.919> way

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
I mean probably helped everyone in a way

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.710 
I mean probably helped everyone in a way
that<00:04:06.340> confidence<00:04:06.819> like<00:04:06.940> okay<00:04:07.209> he<00:04:07.359> made<00:04:07.540> that

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
that confidence like okay he made that

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.960 
that confidence like okay he made that
yeah<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.290> know<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.859> was<00:04:09.160> it<00:04:09.400> really<00:04:09.669> helped<00:04:09.819> my

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
yeah you know it was it really helped my

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.009 
yeah you know it was it really helped my
confidence<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:12.040> had<00:04:12.639> heel<00:04:13.120> straps<00:04:13.480> on<00:04:13.660> my<00:04:13.780> board

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
confidence I had heel straps on my board

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.930 
confidence I had heel straps on my board
and<00:04:14.440> none<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:14.680> those<00:04:14.769> guys<00:04:14.980> did<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:15.370> felt<00:04:15.669> like<00:04:15.819> I

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
and none of those guys did I felt like I

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.199 
and none of those guys did I felt like I
had<00:04:16.090> really<00:04:16.419> good<00:04:16.539> control<00:04:17.849> but<00:04:18.849> at<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.000> same

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
had really good control but at the same

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.539 
had really good control but at the same
time<00:04:19.479> you<00:04:20.200> never<00:04:20.349> on<00:04:20.620> those<00:04:20.769> really<00:04:21.130> biggest

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
time you never on those really biggest

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.980 
time you never on those really biggest
waves<00:04:21.789> at<00:04:22.000> almost<00:04:22.180> every<00:04:22.450> time<00:04:22.630> I've<00:04:22.780> been<00:04:22.810> on

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
waves at almost every time I've been on

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.080 
waves at almost every time I've been on
one<00:04:23.289> my<00:04:23.650> board<00:04:23.890> has<00:04:24.070> slowed<00:04:24.370> down<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.610> little<00:04:24.909> or

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
one my board has slowed down a little or

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.850 
one my board has slowed down a little or
cavitate<00:04:25.599> it

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
cavitate it

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.159 
cavitate it
because<00:04:26.370> he<00:04:26.460> it's<00:04:27.330> so<00:04:27.479> hard<00:04:27.689> to<00:04:27.720> handle<00:04:28.050> the

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
because he it's so hard to handle the

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.990 
because he it's so hard to handle the
speed<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.710> actually<00:04:28.949> had<00:04:29.189> a<00:04:29.220> four<00:04:29.520> fin<00:04:29.759> on<00:04:29.970> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
speed I actually had a four fin on the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.839 
speed I actually had a four fin on the
on<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:31.199> boat<00:04:31.379> a<00:04:31.710> brand<00:04:32.159> new<00:04:32.430> one<00:04:32.639> that<00:04:32.669> I

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
on the boat a brand new one that I

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.159 
on the boat a brand new one that I
probably<00:04:33.150> should<00:04:33.389> have<00:04:33.419> rode<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.750> think<00:04:34.080> it

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
probably should have rode I think it

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.929 
probably should have rode I think it
would<00:04:34.289> have<00:04:34.379> worked<00:04:34.469> even<00:04:34.830> better<00:04:34.949> but<00:04:35.460> I'm
