you to look ahead down the trail I think

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.660 
you to look ahead down the trail I think
this<00:00:19.290> is<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> most<00:00:19.860> important<00:00:20.430> things

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
this is one of the most important things

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.030 
this is one of the most important things
of<00:00:20.910> riding<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.300> bike<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.900> today<00:00:22.830> we're

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
of riding a bike and today we're

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.620 
of riding a bike and today we're
teaching<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.490> how<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> turn<00:00:24.000> where<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.480> look

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
teaching you how to turn where to look

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.109 
teaching you how to turn where to look
on<00:00:24.990> straights<00:00:25.770> where<00:00:26.040> to<00:00:26.220> look<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.760> rooty

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
on straights where to look and on rooty

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.250 
on straights where to look and on rooty
sections<00:00:27.510> where<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.869> look

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
sections where to look

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.080 
sections where to look
ok<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.860> an<00:00:28.980> exercise<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.520> can<00:00:29.730> try<00:00:29.850> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
ok this is an exercise you can try it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.299 
ok this is an exercise you can try it
we've<00:00:30.359> put<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.600> cross<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.380> tree<00:00:31.740> far<00:00:32.190> ahead

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
we've put a cross on a tree far ahead

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.100 
we've put a cross on a tree far ahead
which<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.180> where<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> think<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.870> should<00:00:34.050> be

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
which is where I think you should be

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.720 
which is where I think you should be
looking<00:00:34.470> at<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.770> point<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.250> trail<00:00:35.489> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
looking at this point in the trail you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
looking at this point in the trail you
should<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.420> already<00:00:36.570> taken<00:00:36.900> in<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.500> these

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
should have already taken in all these

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.950 
should have already taken in all these
routes<00:00:37.949> and<00:00:38.309> obstacles<00:00:38.820> along<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.809> by

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
routes and obstacles along here and by

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.150 
routes and obstacles along here and by
the<00:00:40.050> time<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.530> here<00:00:40.769> you<00:00:40.980> should<00:00:41.129> be

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the time you get here you should be

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.189 
the time you get here you should be
already<00:00:41.519> looking<00:00:41.910> down<00:00:42.120> they're<00:00:42.420> ready<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
already looking down they're ready to

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.200 
already looking down they're ready to
take<00:00:43.470> in<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.710> next<00:00:43.739> obstacles<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.790> get<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
take in the next obstacles and get and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.229 
take in the next obstacles and get and
calculate<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.780> speed<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> body<00:00:46.470> position

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
calculate your speed and body position

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.820 
calculate your speed and body position
ok<00:00:48.239> again<00:00:48.540> we're<00:00:48.690> using<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:49.080> Red<00:00:49.260> Cross<00:00:49.530> this

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
ok again we're using the Red Cross this

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.979 
ok again we're using the Red Cross this
time<00:00:50.040> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.220> exit<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.699> a<00:00:50.790> turn<00:00:51.059> similar<00:00:51.839> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
time on the exit of a turn similar to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.329 
time on the exit of a turn similar to
what<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.229> did<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.409> the<00:00:52.620> routes<00:00:52.860> where<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.190> look

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
what we did on the routes where you look

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.130 
what we did on the routes where you look
far<00:00:53.610> ahead<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.180> time<00:00:54.449> you're<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.659> as<00:00:54.900> far

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
far ahead this time you're not as far

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.649 
far ahead this time you're not as far
ahead<00:00:55.290> cause<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.769> a<00:00:55.830> tight<00:00:56.100> hairpin<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.420> I

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
ahead cause it's a tight hairpin but I

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.810 
ahead cause it's a tight hairpin but I
feel<00:00:58.019> like<00:00:58.229> as<00:00:58.500> you're<00:00:58.710> entering<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:59.430> hairpin

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
feel like as you're entering the hairpin

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.039 
feel like as you're entering the hairpin
you<00:01:00.030> should<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.330> already<00:01:00.540> looking<00:01:00.870> at<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
you should be already looking at the

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:02.329 
you should be already looking at the
exit<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.619> hairpin

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
exit of the hairpin

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.859 
exit of the hairpin
like<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.119> you're<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.420> middle<00:01:03.659> of<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
like when you're in the middle of the

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:05.960 
like when you're in the middle of the
turn<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.320> should<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.589> looking<00:01:04.710> already<00:01:05.159> exit

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
turn you should be looking already exit

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.550 
turn you should be looking already exit
down<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> trail<00:01:06.690> so<00:01:07.110> that's<00:01:07.260> why<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.470> think

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
down the trail so that's why I think

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.560 
down the trail so that's why I think
that<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.250> put<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> cross<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.450> when

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that we put the cross here so when

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.210 
that we put the cross here so when
you're<00:01:09.690> coming<00:01:09.930> into<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.350> turn<00:01:10.590> you're

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you're coming into the turn you're

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.649 
you're coming into the turn you're
already<00:01:11.430> looking<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.940> setting<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
already looking at setting up for the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.599 
already looking at setting up for the
exit<00:01:15.289> ok<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.469> cross<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.859> way<00:01:17.039> down<00:01:17.219> the<00:01:17.369> trail

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
exit ok the cross is way down the trail

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.130 
exit ok the cross is way down the trail
the<00:01:17.789> same<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.149> the<00:01:18.270> turn<00:01:18.539> and<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> route

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the same as the turn and the route

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.529 
the same as the turn and the route
section<00:01:19.710> we've<00:01:20.159> got<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.240> slight

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
section we've got it here it's a slight

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.539 
section we've got it here it's a slight
downhill<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.380> we've<00:01:22.500> got<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> exit

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
