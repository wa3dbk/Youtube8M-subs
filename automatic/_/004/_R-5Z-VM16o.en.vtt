00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
we're seeing and so it's more about how

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.800 
we're seeing and so it's more about how
you<00:01:11.539> do<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:12.229> lunge<00:01:12.860> or<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.250> squat<00:01:13.640> it's<00:01:14.240> about<00:01:14.479> the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
you do a lunge or a squat it's about the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.740 
you do a lunge or a squat it's about the
quality<00:01:15.140> versus<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.369> quantity<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.180> exactly

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
quality versus the quantity and exactly

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.390 
quality versus the quantity and exactly
it<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:18.409> it's<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:18.860> I<00:01:18.890> think<00:01:19.100> that's<00:01:19.250> what<00:01:19.340> we

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
that's the important part of the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.059 
that's the important part of the
exercises<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.050> up<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.500> everybody<00:02:32.800> seems

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
exercises on the up and everybody seems

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.800 
exercises on the up and everybody seems
to<00:02:33.160> focus<00:02:33.370> on<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.819> demo<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.239> focus<00:02:34.569> on<00:02:34.660> the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
to focus on the demo is focus on the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.330 
to focus on the demo is focus on the
down<00:02:34.989> I'm<00:02:35.230> always<00:02:35.380> saying<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.739> it's<00:02:36.160> always

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
down I'm always saying that it's always

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.070 
down I'm always saying that it's always
on<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.700> eccentric<00:02:37.330> phase<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.930> should

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
on the eccentric phase that you should

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.990 
on the eccentric phase that you should
be<00:02:38.200> focusing<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.860> contract<00:02:39.670> yeah<00:02:39.790> exactly

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
be focusing and contract yeah exactly

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.699 
be focusing and contract yeah exactly
and<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.750> what<00:02:40.900> ended<00:02:41.080> up<00:02:41.140> happening<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.680> people

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
and so what ended up happening is people

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.100 
and so what ended up happening is people
are<00:02:42.010> too<00:02:42.190> focused<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.239> up<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
are too focused on the the up the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.750 
are too focused on the the up the
downward<00:02:44.560> phase<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.370> then<00:02:45.519> they're<00:02:45.640> also

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
downward phase and then they're also

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.460 
downward phase and then they're also
focused<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.209> leaning<00:02:46.599> forward<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.319> it

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
focused on leaning forward and so it

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.190 
focused on leaning forward and so it
ends<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.709> being<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.130> quad<00:02:48.640> only<00:02:49.269> exercise<00:02:49.840> and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
ends up being a quad only exercise and

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.170 
ends up being a quad only exercise and
if<00:02:50.350> you're<00:02:50.530> already<00:02:50.769> quad<00:02:51.370> dominant<00:02:51.580> meaning

if you're already quad dominant meaning

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.910 
if you're already quad dominant meaning
your<00:02:52.300> quads<00:02:52.540> are<00:02:52.720> already<00:02:53.110> overworked<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.769> do

found is like the pubic bone being in
between<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.260> front<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.940> two<00:03:15.940> legs<00:03:16.239> do<00:03:16.480> you
