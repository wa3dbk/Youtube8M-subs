00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
a pound 310 pounds and I'm 5 foot 4

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.170 
a pound 310 pounds and I'm 5 foot 4
inches<00:01:14.689> my<00:01:15.689> goal<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.590> lose<00:01:16.740> 150<00:01:17.490> pounds<00:01:17.520> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
inches my goal is to lose 150 pounds and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.420 
inches my goal is to lose 150 pounds and
he<00:01:18.450> has<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:18.900> now<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
he has a right now I I think that's a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.999 
he has a right now I I think that's a
realistic<00:01:21.240> goal<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.900> maybe<00:01:22.470> it'll<00:01:22.680> change

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
realistic goal and maybe it'll change

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.800 
realistic goal and maybe it'll change
once<00:01:23.549> i<00:01:24.560> get<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.189> my<00:01:26.820> first<00:01:27.090> goal<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.630> what

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
once i get down to my first goal or what

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
once i get down to my first goal or what
map<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.259> i<00:01:28.500> figure<00:01:29.130> i<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.250> evaluate<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:30.000> at

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
map but i figure i can evaluate it at

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.510 
map but i figure i can evaluate it at
that<00:01:30.270> point<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:31.770> hundred<00:01:32.280> fifty

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that point but right now hundred fifty

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.499 
that point but right now hundred fifty
pounds<00:01:32.880> big<00:01:33.119> goal<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.150> i<00:01:36.180> will<00:01:36.360> be

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
pounds big goal and so i will be

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.609 
pounds big goal and so i will be
starting<00:01:36.750> my<00:01:37.110> pre-op<00:01:38.100> diet<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:39.320> march<00:01:40.320> first

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
starting my pre-op diet on march first
and<00:01:42.170> because<00:01:43.170> my<00:01:43.200> BMI<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.950> over<00:01:44.220> 50<00:01:44.430> it'll<00:01:45.299> be

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
and because my BMI is over 50 it'll be

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.950 
and because my BMI is over 50 it'll be
three<00:01:46.439> protein<00:01:47.040> shakes<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.430> day<00:01:47.810> for<00:01:48.810> two<00:01:48.930> weeks

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
three protein shakes a day for two weeks

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.889 
three protein shakes a day for two weeks

and that's it i go back and forth with
my<00:01:55.079> feelings<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:56.090> one<00:01:57.090> minute<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.630> feel
