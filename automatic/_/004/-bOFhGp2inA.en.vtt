all<00:00:01.469> right<00:00:01.589> everyone<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.639> morning<00:00:03.000> i<00:00:03.210> just

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
all right everyone this morning i just

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.900 
all right everyone this morning i just
woke<00:00:03.389> up<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:04.130> felt<00:00:05.130> like<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.460> know<00:00:05.580> trying

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
woke up and I felt like you know trying

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.340 
woke up and I felt like you know trying
to<00:00:06.029> actually<00:00:06.180> finish<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.600> scratch<00:00:06.930> build<00:00:07.200> or

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
to actually finish a scratch build or

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.100 
to actually finish a scratch build or
something<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.030> I<00:00:09.030> thought<00:00:09.570> about<00:00:09.690> making<00:00:09.870> his

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
something and I thought about making his

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.570 
something and I thought about making his
effort<00:00:10.410> because<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.830> don't<00:00:11.040> know<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.130> never<00:00:11.309> flew

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
effort because I don't know I never flew

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.509 
effort because I don't know I never flew
a<00:00:11.610> wing<00:00:11.759> go<00:00:11.880> for<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.380> had<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> whole

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
a wing go for and you know I had a whole

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.279 
a wing go for and you know I had a whole
bunch<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.759> micro<00:00:15.030> parts<00:00:15.360> laying<00:00:15.540> around<00:00:15.630> from

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
bunch of micro parts laying around from

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.890 
bunch of micro parts laying around from
when<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.310> my<00:00:17.640> Walker<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.029> helicopters<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.720> stuff

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
when I my Walker a helicopters and stuff

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.679 
when I my Walker a helicopters and stuff
like<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.189> so<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> got<00:00:20.760> some<00:00:20.910> digital<00:00:21.300> servos

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
like that so I got some digital servos

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.359 
like that so I got some digital servos
here<00:00:21.930> from<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> Walker<00:00:22.619> oh<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.070> speed

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
here from the Walker oh the speed

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.990 
here from the Walker oh the speed
controllers<00:00:23.850> 20<00:00:24.300> amp<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.609> tiger

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.420 

one<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.449> 1302<00:00:31.880> motor<00:00:33.320> 5900<00:00:34.320> kv<00:00:34.620> i<00:00:34.800> don't<00:00:35.250> think

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
one or 1302 motor 5900 kv i don't think

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.020 
one or 1302 motor 5900 kv i don't think
this<00:00:35.520> motors<00:00:35.880> gonna<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.120> big<00:00:36.300> enough<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:38.030> push

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
this motors gonna be big enough to push

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.100 
this motors gonna be big enough to push
this<00:00:39.270> very<00:00:40.140> fast<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:41.300> if<00:00:42.300> at<00:00:42.540> all<00:00:42.570> i<00:00:42.750> don't<00:00:42.930> know

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
this very fast or if at all i don't know

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.420 
this very fast or if at all i don't know
like<00:00:43.200> i<00:00:43.410> haven't<00:00:43.680> tested<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.010> yet<00:00:44.219> because

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
like i haven't tested on yet because

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.180 
like i haven't tested on yet because
it's<00:00:44.610> snowing<00:00:45.000> outside<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.590> see<00:00:46.879> um

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
it's snowing outside as you can see um

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.540 
it's snowing outside as you can see um
so<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:51.050> pretty<00:00:52.050> much<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.320> built<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> got

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
so just pretty much just built it got

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.660 
so just pretty much just built it got
done<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.620> but<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.739> cool<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
done with it but it's cool because it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.529 
done with it but it's cool because it
uses<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> walker<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.780> gyro<00:00:58.710> out<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.980> em<00:00:59.160> 120<00:00:59.670> so

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
uses the walker a gyro out of em 120 so

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.209 
uses the walker a gyro out of em 120 so
it's<00:01:01.289> got<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.010> flight

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
it's got you know like flight

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.700 
it's got you know like flight
stabilization<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:03.149> I'll<00:01:03.270> show<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.449> example

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.750 

it's<00:01:10.710> pretty<00:01:10.890> cool<00:01:11.100> because<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.549> all

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
it's pretty cool because all this all

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.630 
it's pretty cool because all this all
these<00:01:11.880> parts<00:01:12.150> were<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.299> laying<00:01:12.600> around<00:01:12.750> so

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
these parts were just laying around so

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:23.649 
these parts were just laying around so
it's<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.000> had<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.299> waste<00:01:16.259> anything

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:35.670 

where<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.810> try<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.290> again

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:46.350 

come<00:01:36.340> on<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.860> go<00:01:41.760> all<00:01:42.760> right<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:46.210> you

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
come on there you go all right so as you

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.800 
come on there you go all right so as you
can<00:01:46.450> see<00:01:46.630> watch<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.020> I<00:01:47.050> lift<00:01:47.290> it<00:01:47.380> up<00:01:51.780> got<00:01:52.780> a

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
can see watch it I lift it up got a

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.300 
can see watch it I lift it up got a
little<00:01:52.930> bit<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.170> flight<00:01:53.350> stabilization<00:01:53.560> and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
little bit of flight stabilization and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.340 
little bit of flight stabilization and
it's<00:01:55.150> cool<00:01:55.300> because<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.570> can<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:56.260> know

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
it's cool because you can you know

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.990 
it's cool because you can you know
change<00:01:56.410> the<00:01:56.800> settings<00:01:57.100> on<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.280> gyro<00:01:57.640> make<00:01:57.880> it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
change the settings on the gyro make it

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.120 
change the settings on the gyro make it
a<00:01:58.210> little<00:01:58.360> more<00:01:58.479> softer<00:01:58.960> more<00:01:59.740> better<00:01:59.950> or

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
a little more softer more better or

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.130 
a little more softer more better or
harder<00:02:00.780> pretty<00:02:01.780> cool<00:02:01.930> though<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:03.220> then<00:02:04.140> I'll

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
harder pretty cool though and then I'll

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.450 
harder pretty cool though and then I'll
show<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.320> how<00:02:05.410> much<00:02:05.470> it<00:02:05.650> weighs<00:02:05.830> right<00:02:06.310> now

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
show you how much it weighs right now

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:26.780 
show you how much it weighs right now
think<00:02:07.300> away<00:02:07.530> 99.4<00:02:08.530> grams<00:02:15.630> zeroed

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.440 

yeah<00:02:28.489> 99.3<00:02:30.379> before<00:02:31.379> or<00:02:31.469> something<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.769> that

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
yeah 99.3 before or something like that

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.699 
yeah 99.3 before or something like that
so<00:02:33.450> under<00:02:34.260> hundred<00:02:34.530> grand<00:02:34.739> it's<00:02:34.859> pretty<00:02:35.069> cool

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
so under hundred grand it's pretty cool

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:51.750 
so under hundred grand it's pretty cool
dude<00:02:37.709> no<00:02:38.519> other<00:02:38.670> prop

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.010 

I'll<00:02:52.760> know<00:02:52.940> it's<00:02:53.120> gonna<00:02:53.270> be<00:02:53.450> strong<00:02:53.690> enough<00:02:53.720> to

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
I'll know it's gonna be strong enough to

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.780 
I'll know it's gonna be strong enough to
push<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.320> mean<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.830> can<00:02:55.070> feel<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.490> power<00:02:55.700> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
push I mean I can feel the power a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.080 
push I mean I can feel the power a
little<00:02:56.090> bit<00:02:59.200> hopefully<00:03:00.200> but<00:03:00.950> if<00:03:01.160> not<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.640> want

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
little bit hopefully but if not I want

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.690 
little bit hopefully but if not I want
try<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.240> find<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.540> better<00:03:02.690> motor<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:03.700> maybe

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
try to find a better motor and maybe

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.070 
try to find a better motor and maybe
make<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.240> sell<00:03:05.450> but<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.690> kind<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.930> like

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
make it to sell but I kind of like

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.449 
make it to sell but I kind of like
trying<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.410> keep<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.650> one<00:03:06.800> cell<00:03:07.040> because<00:03:07.250> just

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
trying to keep it one cell because just

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.790 
trying to keep it one cell because just
you<00:03:07.820> know<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.090> small<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.900> unique<00:03:09.260> kinda<00:03:09.620> i

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
you know it's small and unique kinda i
