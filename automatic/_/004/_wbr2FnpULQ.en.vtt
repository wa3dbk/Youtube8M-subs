00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.430

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.480

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.530
 under load is not so hot and 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.230
 could use electricity but still 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.820
 decent quick and equal time 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.820
 to pack one around the cartons
