00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:05.009
 in this movie I'll show you how to insert multiple single image filters 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.569
 the final work for 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.999
 will be under study 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.999
 but it minimizes the foot but if compared 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.069
 and this our initial image before we begin to punish 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.769
 what is the background leaving and sitar 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:23.779
 ok what it was 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.779
 I believe we will work on these 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.159
 artistic 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.380
 these 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.380
 the three years 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.480
 whichever comes in the context 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.350
 the state 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 the intensity when it contours the haze 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.630
 such science theme 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.560
 tonight the team 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.680
 every team that has a matrix 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.830
 OK 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.850
 and with our filter was applied the image but it is only in the image 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 bush when he founded 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 if the cuca moves us in viseu we will see

 o detran-rs 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.610
 the crime 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.450
 it does not apply to committees that change but the country 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 espinoza a non-black thing that there were documents 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.530
 liege easter element 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.630
 filter 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.230
 for what 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.420
 there is woodpecker 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.560
 the crack 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.570
 it's not customary 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.370
 we won 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.370
 let's increase 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.910

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.190
 sr between 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.790
 I did not believe 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.120
 roth 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.820
 the Archer 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.140
 and our new layer already worked with the two filters 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.289
 What we want now is to show the 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:17.229
 the background model ' 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.649
 the other filter 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:19.709
 3 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.130
 we will have to pay 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.589
 all this zone 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.509
 behind the gave 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:25.879
 There's a lot 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.949
 The simplest and fastest formed marking is the low bop 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.789
 which substantially increased 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:39.009
 and the father was cuca hardness numancia substitute we're talking about 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.129
 and I would support notes the crisis will get the support of the fund 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.419
 history that is locked

 what is it 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.739
 it does not have to be a fragment 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.749
 weigh more need 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.749

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.889
 the wounds 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.539
 I heard the crack and 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.349
 invisible while viewing it 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.419
 the backdrop 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.719
 your filter 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:56.719
 undoing 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.280
 stylization 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.729
 the sparkles 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.050
 only there 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.379
 on the wall 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.520
 the action of this rock 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.189
 and the other was 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.830
 here among people not over January 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.620
 has quality 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.620
 that year the filter 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.400
 dashes and strokes 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.719
 selmir 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:31.080
 why there 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.419
 this filter 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.900
 tarsus 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.319
 in my opinion 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.900
 very funny 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.639
 the latin 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.639
 both the style that commands 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.279
 no human that not because I'm going to stick with it over 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.240
 pasta 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.659
 what grew up was this maybe so and how do they want more 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.710
 more creased rush 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.389
 the rest 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.860
 the continuous etc who the contrast 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.460
 the criminal 13 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.460
 because 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.169
 where was it 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.419
 been studying years was higher than visible in the serve a help 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.860
 another goal 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.559
 For the problem let's increase 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:27.770
 the contrast 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.129
 Wow, that's wonderful. 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.129
 according to the study 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.129
 this is one of the trends so do not 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.899
 it's because
