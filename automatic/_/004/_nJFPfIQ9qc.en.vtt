 then you know that talks begin 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.230
 and so the progress of the 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:02.190
 movie chingón in 2016 if 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.190
 captain america looks the same 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.620
 ok it's not true 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.100
 hola friends of youtube as 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.680
 are I passionate and welcome to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.900
 this these new developments on 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.560
 the film cool 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.720
 in these last weeks we have had 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 many and some information about the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.340
 deadpool movie alone since its 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.650
 filming started does not mill much 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.320
 time and in the images that we 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.970
 show we can see that the scenes that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.340
 are filming the similar ones 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.200
 the trailer that was shown is done a lot 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.210
 time in which it is made by 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.850
 computer but as we see here be 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.670
 a lot with real people real cars 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.880
 with a real debris and also what 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.650
 we can see is that the suit is 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.380
 excellent we see that you are to the video of 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.140
 comic book really be a little realistic 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.150
 but it is to make it look much better and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.390
 as we can see in his eyes are 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.550
 a few little white dots so that you do not 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.470
 They know how sensors are sensors 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.810
 special effects so you have 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.760
 mobility at the moment of encouraging them and 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.520
 the pool to have expressions with their 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.790
 eyes not just also his mouth other 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.680
 news is that the ajax villain will be in 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:30.480
 the movie played by the actor 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.330
 or something like that the interpreter since 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.640
 posted a photo of the city ​​of the 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.310
 chair of a movie chair the one 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.780
 he is seen telling the heart 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.599
 what is obviously not saying that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.610
 will represent this character you do not know 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.129
 if this is going to be the main villain to 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.780
 sometimes there was some secondary and so that 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.480
 not a premium introduction so you do not 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.030
 be small up to direct huevones is the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.410
 project remaining powers to 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:04.470
 deadpool and it also goes wrong and obviously 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:06.569
 is and given that in the wrong one and it is in 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.930
 the comics kills what he wants to kill everyone 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.690
 those who with this with said project 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.060
 including what I believe has as 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.950
 a good one also has to do in the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.109
 online web project since with it you 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.870
 they gave their mancini career all I 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.730
 I also think that they can do one the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.650
 be able to make a cameo techno and relate 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.150
 hard what is called tite is logical and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.150
 we might see a small 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:37.380
 hearts that I suppose and the truth is that 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.990
 actor, well, I think that also 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.890
 to highlight is that we see now reynolds 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.500
 with his appearance of the weight wilson as 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.900
 our face also has a little 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.330
 disfigured but not like in comics 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.530
 that looks like a zombie like that so 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.410
 I think obviously with effects 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.420
 digital will be a little more horrendous and 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.910
 obviously I hope it looks like a 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.560
 zombie of teu ping and scary because 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.380
 you hope that if you go to a child and leave 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.260
 between a child finish this film 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.330
 fear 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.819
 although I doubt it since I know that 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.329
 movie will be ro classification be for 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.920
 adults is to say over 18 years what 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.079
 which is also great news and 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.720
 that we will see deadpool cut heads 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.250
 crush to give rods in the balls all 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.310
 we will see it as from the ass we see in the 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.560
 obvious tulle comics will be 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.720
 simply spectacular in this 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.590
 movie and we will see it as we want 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.120
 see him crushing killing shooting is 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.610
 say it will be a movie full of 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.250
 killing but no doubt with a killing 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.310
 very humorous and obviously let's hope 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.830
 that this film surpasses the fourth 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.240
 wall no doubt this movie I'm very 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.220
 eager to see her 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.060
 I think of my favorite movies 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.070
 coming next year 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.840
 I hope and let me enter this movie 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.030
 because by that time I'm going to have 17 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.190
 years but I think that if they are not going to enter 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.960
 I hope so here in Mexico they are worth 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.000
 mother the postcards classifications of 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.020
 films 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.420
 but well they have also come out in as 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.370
 new photos of the cremation in the 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.340
 that we see in the pool suit as 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.470
 that could be some damage and shots 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.300
 because they expect us to see they are seen here as 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.420
 a few holes in the suit what which 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.830
 it means that he was shot and maybe 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.630
 in the costume of each year because 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.450
 obviously I do not think that in all the 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.340
 movie illustrates that it is still intact 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.540
 physically expect more also something 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.880
 realistic 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.980
 in this new shooting photo of the 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.870
 deadpool movie we can also see 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.510
 the actor who will play the character 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.420
 the colossus that we carry our 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.130
 character in the x-men movies 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.940
 although it has always been like a character 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.440
 something secondary 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.680
 since previously in this movie 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.730
 I have a role a little more protagonist 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.890
 we also see that he has his suit 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.620
 special effects that obviously give you 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.920
 life to this character with two bodies 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.230
 metallic and all this 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.540
 The truth is that I hope you have a 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.289
 good rating in this movie 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.319
 It would be quite pathetic 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.430
 good friends friends this has been all 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.740
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.409
 I hope you continue here informing about this 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.939
 movie and I also want to inform you 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.399
 that the spider-man channel on telecinco 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:21.979
 would climb to captain america advances 

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:25.069
 civil war but in its advance obviously 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.569
 I'll use the loquendo polos and as far as I know 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:28.969
 that you like it when you 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.949
 I recommend my primary channel so that 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:33.409
 you take a look at my videos in case 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:36.319
 you never gave them 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:39.229
 if you liked this video and if you like that 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.939
 is unfolding in this in these 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:43.519
 videos with how to talk to 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:47.739
 true voice then they gave like 

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:47.739
 some positive comment and 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.430
 and so that this channel continues to grow 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.430
 you can put some new themes in the 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.010
 comments and obviously go having 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.690
 new ideas for this new channel 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.250
 you comment here game of what themes 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.410
 they want me to talk on my channel 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.860
 primary I never spoke and also 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:10.100
 can you make some small video 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.410
 so that this channel is not so inactive 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.360
 that already has the same activity as 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.180
 the primary one and that both are 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.320
 equally balanced with their with their 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:25.530
 videos and 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:27.330
 and this is wrong good thing is I leave 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.409
 tell the advance of this movie 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:33.819
 personally 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:36.249
 and well I do not have an official goodbye 

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:39.809
 this channel so I 'll just say that 

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:39.809
 I'm going to invent one at this moment 

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.350
 and I can not think of anything so I'll do something 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.510
 related to the video I like 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.920
 define all the advances is cute all 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.920
 it's a changa 

00:07:53.100 --> 00:08:04.860
 and if a serious girl to click 

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.860
 until next time
