00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 hello in this video we will see the rumba 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.950
 bang bang room 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.450
 I'm going to proceed to learn my cell phone and 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.950
 when I have paid for them to go with 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.930
 of speed charges this round 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.289
 now when installing the room 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.140
 does not have a 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.060
 a start screen that is loading 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.939
 to the rom as well as it can be shown 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.359
 right now so do not worry 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.570
 when installing this rom that way 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.640
 it's just for this rom comes with 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.640
 android 4.4 points 2 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.270
 is for good in this case a galaxy s 4 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.270
 mini 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.560
 good is loading the widget 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.750
 we should know 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.750
 and in charge 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.160
 let's go to the android version 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.159
 4.4 points 2 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.380
 monroe 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.810
 now these run is 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.990
 You have several options to configure your 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.870
 appearance what is ban control has 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.430
 a lot of 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.060
 configuration of the lounge in as much as 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.060
 that all 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.120
 you can enter to see each one 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.020
 quite configurable 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.109
 same has 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.109
 has the option to make dark 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.370
 make the white color predominate more 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.360
 as you can see but now I activate it 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.840
 and it gives a better appearance 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.450
 now 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.210
 something particular that happens to me that has 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.860
 past with this room is that 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.550
 at the moment you want to update a 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.030
 application and I'm not connected to wifi 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.560
 the cell phone only starts 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.810
 to overheat as if it were 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.709
 processing information 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.060
 and the cell phone and logically heated 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.200
 until you can find a point of 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.760
 wifi I connect and start doing the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.910
 update and the solar returns to the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.990
 normal 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.160
 and another detail is that if I'm using it 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.770
 constantly for example during half 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.600
 hour with followed by either listening 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.970
 music or playing or doing something 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.720
 the meeting also the cell phone heats up 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.440
 a little bit also the back in the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.360
 lower part 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.980
 that's the only drawback that has 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.650
 had already part of the duration of the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.730
 battery as you can see me in that 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.730
 moment is already in 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.709
 in 35 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.600
 this this course in a day does not not last me 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.130
 Full day 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.740
 those are the only mishaps that I've 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.560
 had there with respect to speed 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.570
 I have not worked anything is an album 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.720
 relatively stable the only detail 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.850
 about those warm moments and the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.420
 Battery life in description 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.370

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.370

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.380
