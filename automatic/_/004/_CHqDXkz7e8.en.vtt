layout you you get rid of like overlaps
and<00:05:21.660> all<00:05:21.780> that<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.320> just<00:05:22.500> looks<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.980> lot

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
and all that and it just looks a lot

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.030 
and all that and it just looks a lot
better<00:05:24.080> so<00:05:25.080> I'll<00:05:25.169> probably<00:05:25.290> just<00:05:25.470> be<00:05:25.650> using

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
better so I'll probably just be using

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.820 
better so I'll probably just be using
like<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.370> YouTube<00:05:26.760> theme<00:05:27.060> for<00:05:27.419> that<00:05:27.540> so<00:05:27.830> blue

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
like the YouTube theme for that so blue

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.500

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
have a kill to death sticker and all

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.320 
have a kill to death sticker and all
that<00:05:34.950> jazz<00:05:35.460> like<00:05:35.880> weapons<00:05:36.450> used<00:05:37.250> setups<00:05:38.330> all

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
that jazz like weapons used setups all

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.600 
that jazz like weapons used setups all
that<00:05:39.600> just<00:05:39.900> make<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.050> look<00:05:40.350> nice<00:05:40.770> just<00:05:41.340> looking

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
that just make it look nice just looking

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.969 
that just make it look nice just looking
so<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.479> looks<00:05:42.510> like<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:42.840> more<00:05:43.200> professional<00:05:43.530> job
