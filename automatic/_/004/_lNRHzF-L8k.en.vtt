00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:14.560
 easy unemployed shower specialist 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:16.630
 custom made hello if we replaced the 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.789
 bathtub by mean shower it's because 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.250
 that we get to a certain age 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:35.140
 and then we really wanted to 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:36.250
 change it's true that at sixty 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.280
 where begins to ask questions 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.559
 so go to a bathtub it's not 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.730
 obvious at all and with a shower well 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.730
 it makes things easier 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.160
 also we must not forget to make 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.440
 the opportunity of savings is what 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.660
 when we take a drink it takes 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.680
 much more water than if there is 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 it's really a shower 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.070
 which was interesting too it was 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.690
 the speed at which we could do 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.550
 the modification was not a construction site 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.820
 who would say at eight days we're just going 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.370
 adapt the shower directly to 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.620
 the location you had before we 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.020
 does not need to break tiles 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.290
 to change everything and that's really 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.290
 fantastic 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.630
 we can vary the colors have little 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.220
 varied also how to access 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.760
 the interior with doors that are 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.550
 different 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.130

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.369

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.369
 after 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:19.240
 huawei that's fine then yes that's it 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.310

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.030
 what was expected when what 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.450
