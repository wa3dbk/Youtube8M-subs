rock back and forth and the knife will

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.200 
rock back and forth and the knife will
slide<00:00:51.180> right<00:00:51.420> through<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> squash<00:00:53.210> hands

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
slide right through the squash hands

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.080 
slide right through the squash hands
down<00:00:54.510> easiest<00:00:55.170> way<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.760> then<00:00:56.760> once

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
down easiest way to do this then once

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
down easiest way to do this then once
you've<00:00:57.239> got<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.600> two<00:00:57.780> halves<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.440> want<00:00:58.800> to

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
seeds away because you can roast these

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.930 
seeds away because you can roast these
seeds<00:01:10.440> up<00:01:10.620> just<00:01:11.190> like<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.490> would<00:01:11.580> roast<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
so once you've got both halves all

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
so once you've got both halves all
cleaned<00:01:17.730> up<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.000> ready<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.450> go<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.560> like

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
cleaned up and ready to go I just like

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.230 
cleaned up and ready to go I just like
to<00:01:19.830> season<00:01:20.100> them<00:01:20.400> before<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.700> pop<00:01:20.940> them<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to season them before I pop them in the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.630 
to season them before I pop them in the
oven<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> give<00:01:22.350> each<00:01:22.560> half<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.250> bit<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
oven so I give each half a little bit of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.340 
oven so I give each half a little bit of
olive<00:01:23.850> oil<00:01:24.120> it's<00:01:24.510> probably<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> teaspoon

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350

olive oil it's probably about a teaspoon
between<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.130> two<00:01:26.310> halves<00:01:26.690> then<00:01:27.690> just<00:01:27.930> brush

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
between the two halves then just brush

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.350 
between the two halves then just brush
that<00:01:28.440> in<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.550> didn't<00:01:29.760> have<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.910> pastry

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
spaghetti squash and this is a really

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.839 
spaghetti squash and this is a really
convenient<00:02:23.110> option<00:02:23.980> especially<00:02:24.489> when<00:02:24.640> time

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
convenient option especially when time

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.240 
convenient option especially when time
is<00:02:25.030> not<00:02:25.180> on<00:02:25.420> your<00:02:25.569> side<00:02:25.629> but<00:02:26.440> if<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.709> do<00:02:26.980> have

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
is not on your side but if you do have

is not on your side but if you do have
the<00:02:27.459> extra<00:02:27.489> time<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.180> definitely<00:02:28.629> recommend

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the extra time I definitely recommend

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.350 
the extra time I definitely recommend
going<00:02:29.440> for<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.830> roast<00:02:30.160> because<00:02:30.489> roasting

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
going for the roast because roasting

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.479 
going for the roast because roasting
vegetables<00:02:31.900> will<00:02:32.080> always<00:02:32.500> result<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.040> a

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
vegetables will always result in a

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.330 
vegetables will always result in a
deeper<00:02:34.090> richer<00:02:34.540> flavor<00:02:35.049> and<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.860> just<00:02:36.099> adds

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
deeper richer flavor and it just adds

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.800 
deeper richer flavor and it just adds
another<00:02:36.549> layer<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.599> yumminess<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.410> dish

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.300

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
a little bit of time to cool off all you

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.080 
a little bit of time to cool off all you
need<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.680> do<00:02:47.799> is<00:02:47.950> grab<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> fork<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:48.760> you're

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
squash and what you'll see is it starts

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.880 
squash and what you'll see is it starts
to<00:02:55.299> pull<00:02:55.510> away<00:02:55.540> into<00:02:56.140> these<00:02:56.290> very<00:02:56.530> thin

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890

spaghetti<00:02:57.489> like<00:02:57.879> strands<00:03:01.859> and<00:03:03.299> then<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.750> just

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
spaghetti like strands and then you just

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.420

the skin then once you've got all the
squash<00:03:09.010> out<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.549> shell<00:03:09.819> you<00:03:10.269> can<00:03:10.299> take
