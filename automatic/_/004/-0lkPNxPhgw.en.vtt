00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.769
 Swimming pool and we are going to talk today. 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.300
 natural cleaning products 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.330
 be aware of if you have the pool of your 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.220
 home cleaning, who does this is? 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.400
 pool will see if this exactly then 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.949
 so is the imminent housekeeper 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.289
 Inep then it's very close, it's already 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.760
 Warm even you can use the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.869
 People are going to talk a little about the manor. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.210
 We are going to speak specifically now. 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.239
 for swimming pool treatment 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.030
 then there is a range of products 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.770
 is not the same with brics and working on 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.610
 discovers of the type thus 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.100
 CearÃ¡ 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.590
 the soap to use for everything you do not have today 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.059
 product clean flat glass to clean it 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.829
 value of the product to clean the show 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.960
 so the pool did not run away from being so 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.579
 more or less on the same path 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.860
 then there are several types of chlorine 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.920
 they are also people always recommend the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.109
 chlorine to exist and use populism and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.399
 tricolor chlorine shims are clear 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.410
 stabilized 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.239
 it is important to note that it is not clear 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.580
 common is greater not not 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.040
 then it did not even exist nor are all 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.280
 products informs you that you have 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.080
 types of seaweed is my pool which 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.720
 I had already put the two kilos of 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.060
 chlorine does not kill someone kills because 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.590
 arrived a certain time that something she 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.390
 creates resistance against non-chlorine 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.790
 can put a bucket stated that there 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.740
 goes where there is a workshop of the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.479
 the maintenance to go there and kill and 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.240
 kill those seaweed 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.610
 so how does it best shape 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.229
 this is how we have already commented that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.720
 the customer got lost in the water can not 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.220
 one brings a bottle of water here 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.530
 for the company 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.020
 we do not charge anything we do a 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.009
 analysis of the water and make a diagnosis 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.079
 your water 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.820
 This is certain that it is wrong and 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.579
 I recommend the right product and hence 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.180
 people sell the product that goes to a water 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.799
 so like this and do not have the index 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.040
 of correctness and almost 100% there that people 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.840
 Why do we hit on it? 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.990
 brought the people made a diagnosis to 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.700
 people sell the products the customer led 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.080
 He does not have the money and the water comes back. 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.610
 to be beautiful is of the cases the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.140
 pool owner can do the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.090
 complete treatment and this is not it 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.400
 Even if we come here, then explain. 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.930
 always remembering here because for 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.910
 treat a pool to us always like this 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.830
 requires physical treatment there is also 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.540
 the chemical products 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.880
 then so much as it is proposed 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.230
 product on the water in the pool 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.200
 You have to let me filter that I 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.630
 then we are 70% 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.860
 beautiful and filter that can put a lot 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.380
 of products leave one hour a day 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.959
 connected and do not look pretty she's got a way 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.670
 to video all the products in which they are 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.489
 necessary to clean the pool at 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.140

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.940
 He'll have it so he comes here. 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.769
 I have a price here today. 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.569
 compatible in good market price and 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.580
 chemical is all people 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.950
 assistance and advice to customers 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.620
 underway is not a service that has iss 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.250
 that we offer to the public has 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.959
 pool 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.359
 wonder this post let's talk one 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.859
 little solar heating since you are 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.560
 Coming summer is coming summer 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.140
 with full force and the great demand is 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.030
 solar heating going in your pool is the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.829
 that we have commented on in other 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.670
 programs is who had the opportunity to 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.459
 watch 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.600
 so who does not have solar and does not 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.030
 is using the vaccine 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.890
 so why get that to be 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.170
 It's even worth taking such cold water. 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.450
 it was not around you and who does not have 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.850
 Cell Phone Reported to be Less Than 20 Degree 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.890
 between 18 and 22 degrees traffic telephony 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.109
 to take a shower she is comfortable 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.239
 when it starts to rise from 27 degrees 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.609
 so if Russian solar at this time like this 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.030
 it works very well right now and has a 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.639
