00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.250 

so<00:03:35.300> right<00:03:35.480> there<00:03:35.750> I'm<00:03:35.930> going<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.230> open<00:03:36.349> Dee

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
so right there I'm going to open Dee

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.550 
so right there I'm going to open Dee
and<00:03:39.099> then<00:03:39.550> I'm<00:03:39.640> going<00:03:39.909> to<00:03:39.940> third<00:03:40.900> fret<00:03:41.319> and

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
and then I'm going to third fret and

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.119 
and then I'm going to third fret and
then<00:03:41.709> I'm<00:03:41.800> going<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:41.980> do<00:03:42.239> open<00:03:43.239> down<00:03:44.230> pull<00:03:44.890> off

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
then I'm going to do open down pull off

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.979 
then I'm going to do open down pull off
on<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.459> G

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.240 

so<00:03:48.530> we<00:03:48.620> got

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.960 

we<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:53.970> go

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
we can go

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.390 
we can go
lead<00:03:56.480> right<00:03:56.750> into<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:57.170> Secord<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:58.220> that

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
lead right into that Secord so that

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.000 
lead right into that Secord so that
would<00:03:58.520> be

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.530 

so<00:04:03.010> that's<00:04:03.130> just<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.400> pull<00:04:03.700> off<00:04:03.910> on<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.180> D

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
so that's just a pull off on the D

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.180 
so that's just a pull off on the D
string<00:04:04.570> third<00:04:05.290> fret

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.920 

that<00:04:10.670> one's<00:04:10.880> always<00:04:11.060> good<00:04:11.390> on<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.600> D<00:04:11.900> string

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
that one's always good on the D string

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.360 
that one's always good on the D string
open<00:04:13.270> hit<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.420> C<00:04:14.600> chord<00:04:14.960> we<00:04:15.800> can<00:04:15.830> do<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.130> same

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
open hit the C chord we can do that same

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.270 
open hit the C chord we can do that same
thing<00:04:16.430> on<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.820> G

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.650 

back<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.550> D
