00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
they are fighting for their lives they

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.980 
they are fighting for their lives they
are<00:04:37.260> about<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.620> do<00:04:37.910> anything<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.540> comes<00:04:39.720> into

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
are about to do anything that comes into

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.810 
are about to do anything that comes into
their<00:04:40.170> power<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:41.420> fight<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.750> most<00:04:42.990> obnoxious

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
their power and fight the most obnoxious

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.650 
their power and fight the most obnoxious
monstrous<00:04:44.820> creatures<00:04:45.330> ever<00:04:45.770> save<00:04:47.660> friends

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
monstrous creatures ever save friends

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.510 
monstrous creatures ever save friends
and<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:49.020> think<00:04:49.050> that's<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.800> so<00:04:50.010> important

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
and I think that's so so important

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.620 
and I think that's so so important
because<00:04:50.580> here<00:04:51.570> goes<00:04:51.750> my<00:04:51.780> dog<00:04:52.050> again<00:04:52.580> um<00:04:53.630> that's

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
because here goes my dog again um that's

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.570 
because here goes my dog again um that's
I<00:04:54.900> think<00:04:55.110> that's<00:04:55.260> such<00:04:55.470> an<00:04:55.740> important<00:04:56.190> part<00:04:56.400> of

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
I think that's such an important part of

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.420 
I think that's such an important part of
a<00:04:56.730> book<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.540> just<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.200> show<00:04:58.230> character<00:04:59.190> growth

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
a book and just to show character growth

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.270 
a book and just to show character growth
and<00:04:59.850> relationships<00:05:00.690> because<00:05:01.130> sometimes<00:05:02.130> we

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
and relationships because sometimes we

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.160 
and relationships because sometimes we
don't<00:05:02.400> see<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.850> enough<00:05:03.180> sometimes<00:05:03.750> there's

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
don't see that enough sometimes there's

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.680 
don't see that enough sometimes there's
not<00:05:04.470> as<00:05:04.740> much<00:05:04.980> emotion<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.850> book<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:06.660> I

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
not as much emotion in a book so I

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.660 
not as much emotion in a book so I
definitely<00:05:07.260> definitely<00:05:07.740> love<00:05:08.310> that<00:05:08.550> about

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670

know when I'll get to it but I did
really<00:06:20.730> enjoy<00:06:20.850> this<00:06:21.510> book<00:06:21.750> it<00:06:22.290> did<00:06:22.980> give<00:06:23.160> it<00:06:23.190> a

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
really enjoy this book it did give it a

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.680 
really enjoy this book it did give it a
3<00:06:23.490> out<00:06:23.550> of<00:06:23.669> 5<00:06:23.790> because<00:06:24.120> it<00:06:24.270> took<00:06:24.360> me<00:06:24.540> a<00:06:24.570> lot

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
3 out of 5 because it took me a lot

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.440 
3 out of 5 because it took me a lot
longer<00:06:24.840> to<00:06:25.080> read<00:06:25.380> then<00:06:25.620> it<00:06:25.830> should<00:06:26.070> have<00:06:26.450> which

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
longer to read then it should have which

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.990 
longer to read then it should have which
is<00:06:27.840> more<00:06:28.380> of<00:06:28.470> like<00:06:28.500> a<00:06:28.650> writing<00:06:29.040> style<00:06:29.430> kind<00:06:29.880> of

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
is more of like a writing style kind of

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.750 
is more of like a writing style kind of
quirk<00:06:30.270> that<00:06:30.450> I<00:06:30.510> have<00:06:31.250> with<00:06:32.250> these<00:06:32.430> looks

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
quirk that I have with these looks

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.159 
quirk that I have with these looks
rather<00:06:33.360> than<00:06:33.660> the<00:06:33.810> storyline<00:06:34.260> itself<00:06:34.740> um<00:06:35.120> I

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
rather than the storyline itself um I

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.800 
rather than the storyline itself um I
don't<00:06:37.169> know<00:06:37.440> but<00:06:37.919> I<00:06:37.979> just<00:06:38.130> I<00:06:38.580> wasn't<00:06:39.120> drawn<00:06:39.390> to

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
don't know but I just I wasn't drawn to

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.670 
don't know but I just I wasn't drawn to
the<00:06:39.930> buck<00:06:40.080> like<00:06:40.260> I<00:06:40.289> didn't

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
the buck like I didn't

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.680 
the buck like I didn't
want<00:06:40.830> to<00:06:40.919> pick<00:06:41.100> it<00:06:41.130> up<00:06:41.370> like<00:06:41.759> I<00:06:41.970> knew<00:06:42.210> I<00:06:42.240> hadn't

dark<00:07:16.380> and<00:07:16.770> that's<00:07:17.550> almost<00:07:17.880> don't<00:07:18.210> wanna<00:07:18.330> say<00:07:18.479> I

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:18.509 
dark and that's almost don't wanna say I

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:19.850 
dark and that's almost don't wanna say I
do<00:07:18.630> realize<00:07:19.139> that<00:07:19.169> they're<00:07:19.500> like<00:07:19.830> a

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
do realize that they're like a

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.950 
do realize that they're like a
children's<00:07:20.220> novel<00:07:20.759> but<00:07:20.880> I<00:07:21.060> do<00:07:21.150> want<00:07:21.570> a<00:07:21.750> little

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
children's novel but I do want a little

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.490 
children's novel but I do want a little
bit<00:07:22.199> more<00:07:23.660> darkness<00:07:24.660> just<00:07:25.080> because<00:07:25.320> I<00:07:25.349> feel

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 
bit more darkness just because I feel

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.469 
bit more darkness just because I feel
like<00:07:25.860> in<00:07:26.039> every<00:07:26.190> book<00:07:26.580> they<00:07:26.789> get<00:07:27.000> a<00:07:27.030> little<00:07:27.360> bit

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 
like in every book they get a little bit

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.450 
like in every book they get a little bit
darker<00:07:27.630> and<00:07:27.990> darker<00:07:28.169> and<00:07:28.620> especially<00:07:29.099> with

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 
darker and darker and especially with

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.760 
darker and darker and especially with
the<00:07:29.550> development<00:07:30.120> of<00:07:30.210> Luke<00:07:30.509> and<00:07:30.780> his

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:31.770 
the development of Luke and his

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.830 
the development of Luke and his
relationship<00:07:32.070> with<00:07:32.400> Annabeth<00:07:32.940> and<00:07:33.150> Percy's

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 
relationship with Annabeth and Percy's

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.050 
relationship with Annabeth and Percy's
relationship<00:07:34.470> with<00:07:34.590> Annabeth<00:07:34.979> I<00:07:35.130> think<00:07:35.400> that

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060 
relationship with Annabeth I think that

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.140 
relationship with Annabeth I think that
all<00:07:36.270> of<00:07:36.330> them<00:07:36.630> is<00:07:36.930> gonna<00:07:37.259> get<00:07:37.500> pretty<00:07:37.889> dark<00:07:38.250> so

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.150 
all of them is gonna get pretty dark so

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.370 
all of them is gonna get pretty dark so
I<00:07:40.009> don't<00:07:41.009> know<00:07:41.160> I<00:07:41.750> so<00:07:42.750> hopefully<00:07:43.050> the<00:07:43.259> next

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 
I don't know I so hopefully the next

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.710 
I don't know I so hopefully the next
book<00:07:43.620> will<00:07:43.860> not<00:07:44.460> disappoint<00:07:45.000> me<00:07:45.180> this<00:07:45.389> one<00:07:45.570> was
