bead of silicone around the edge there
and<00:01:04.760> I<00:01:05.760> hope<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.560> don't<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.830> over<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> top

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
and I hope this don't go over the top

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.179 
and I hope this don't go over the top
anyway<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:10.890> go<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:13.260> guess<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.010> got

anyway here we go and I guess you got
some<00:01:14.520> time<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:17.030> get<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.270> air<00:01:18.330> bubbles<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
some time to get the air bubbles out of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.180 
some time to get the air bubbles out of
this<00:01:19.470> stuff
