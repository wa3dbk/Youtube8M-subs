things we've been working on that I had

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.900 
things we've been working on that I had
been<00:00:40.649> sitting<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.070> little<00:00:41.160> bit<00:00:41.460> not<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.790> they

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
care about their but there's actually

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.299 
care about their but there's actually
running<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.410> little<00:00:46.559> bit<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.890> stuff<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.190> use

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
running a little bit of stuff we use

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
running a little bit of stuff we use
that<00:00:47.520> they<00:00:47.640> haven't<00:00:48.000> been<00:00:48.090> running<00:00:48.500> for<00:00:49.500> hours

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that they haven't been running for hours

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.729 
that they haven't been running for hours
ago<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:50.309> could<00:00:50.430> run<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.059> maybe<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
ago they could run it so maybe it's you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.250 
ago they could run it so maybe it's you
know<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:53.850> when<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.390> start<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.989> in

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
know out there when you start going in

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.619 
know out there when you start going in
the<00:00:55.350> flow<00:00:56.090> it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.270> bit<00:00:57.360> different

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the flow it's a little bit different

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.849 
the flow it's a little bit different
projects<00:00:57.870> where<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> defense<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.590> really

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
projects where the defense is really

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.680 
projects where the defense is really
grinding<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.789> they<00:00:59.850> know<00:00:59.969> every<00:01:00.210> play<00:01:00.449> out

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
grinding in and they know every play out

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
grinding in and they know every play out
there<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> start<00:01:01.590> taking<00:01:01.800> less<00:01:02.280> than<00:01:02.489> just

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
there you start taking less than just

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.009 
there you start taking less than just
playing<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.270> they've<00:01:03.539> been<00:01:03.629> thinking<00:01:03.930> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
playing and they've been thinking so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.299 
playing and they've been thinking so
much<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.290> practice<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.769> think<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.220> they

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
much of practice I think that they

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.800 
much of practice I think that they
making<00:01:05.549> mistakes<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> didn't<00:01:06.360> take<00:01:06.479> me<00:01:06.600> too

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
making mistakes as I didn't take me too

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.719 
making mistakes as I didn't take me too
much<00:01:07.049> rather<00:01:07.470> than<00:01:07.680> reacting<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> use

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
much rather than reacting with and use

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
much rather than reacting with and use
of<00:01:08.880> their<00:01:09.000> talents<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.420> skills<00:01:09.840> what's<00:01:10.710> good

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
of their talents and skills what's good

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.830 
of their talents and skills what's good
