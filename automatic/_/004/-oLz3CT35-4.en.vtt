screen which HC lists is a super LCD
exactly<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.070> same<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.460> with<00:00:11.880> incredible<00:00:12.420> Wes

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
exactly the same is with incredible Wes

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.279 
exactly the same is with incredible Wes
however<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.160> notable<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.960> although<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
however it is notable that although the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.500 
however it is notable that although the
screens<00:00:16.800> are<00:00:16.949> pretty<00:00:17.100> much<00:00:17.220> identical<00:00:17.510> when

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
screens are pretty much identical when

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.730 
screens are pretty much identical when
put<00:00:19.050> side<00:00:19.320> by<00:00:19.350> side<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.949> face<00:00:20.310> directly

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
put side by side and face directly

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.929 
put side by side and face directly
incredible<00:00:22.740> as<00:00:22.800> has<00:00:23.100> much<00:00:23.340> better<00:00:23.580> viewing

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
incredible as has much better viewing

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.390 
incredible as has much better viewing
angles<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.510> actually<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.890> little<00:00:26.160> bit

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
angles and actually is that little bit

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.339 
angles and actually is that little bit
brighter<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.119> better<00:00:27.330> saturated<00:00:28.080> than<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
brighter and better saturated than the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.410 
brighter and better saturated than the
sensation<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.580> we're<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.000> trying<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.240> show

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
sensation so we're just trying to show

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.229 
sensation so we're just trying to show
that<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.840> now<00:00:31.369> let<00:00:32.369> me<00:00:32.399> see<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> sensation

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
that here now let me see the sensation

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.620 
that here now let me see the sensation
pretty<00:00:34.050> quickly<00:00:34.320> starts<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> wash<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.630> where

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
pretty quickly starts to wash out where

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.650 
pretty quickly starts to wash out where
is<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> incredible<00:00:37.079> West<00:00:37.440> tends<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.129> keep<00:00:38.280> its

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
is the incredible West tends to keep its

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.139 
is the incredible West tends to keep its
color<00:00:39.660> fidelity<00:00:40.280> all<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.550> way<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.850> until<00:00:42.000> very

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
color fidelity all the way up until very

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.560 
color fidelity all the way up until very
oblique<00:00:43.219> very<00:00:44.219> odd<00:00:44.730> angles<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> these<00:00:48.270> aren't

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
oblique very odd angles so these aren't

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.160 
oblique very odd angles so these aren't
really<00:00:49.140> things<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.950> should<00:00:50.730> bother<00:00:50.879> your

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
really things that should bother your

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.630 
really things that should bother your
daily<00:00:52.170> basis<00:00:52.649> most<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.039> time<00:00:53.190> most<00:00:53.550> people

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
daily basis most of time most people

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.260 
daily basis most of time most people
face<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.750> smartphone<00:00:55.289> straight<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:56.270> however

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
face this smartphone straight up however

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.889 
face this smartphone straight up however
it's<00:00:57.649> just<00:00:58.649> notable<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.329> although<00:01:00.329> they're

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
it's just notable that although they're

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.200 
it's just notable that although they're
branded<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> same<00:01:01.530> way<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.940> actual

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
branded the same way the actual

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.109 
branded the same way the actual
technology<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.500> actual<00:01:04.619> screens<00:01:05.119> that

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
technology and the actual screens that

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.350 
technology and the actual screens that
HTC<00:01:06.540> gives<00:01:06.810> us<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.310> not<00:01:08.310> equivalent<00:01:09.740> quality

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
HTC gives us and not equivalent quality

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.600 
HTC gives us and not equivalent quality
so<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.960> sensation<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.710> still<00:01:14.189> has<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> very

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so the sensation is still has a very

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.980 
so the sensation is still has a very
good<00:01:14.670> LCD<00:01:16.400> it's<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> same<00:01:18.810> level

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
good LCD it's just not on the same level

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
good LCD it's just not on the same level
with<00:01:19.320> incredible<00:01:19.890> s<00:01:28.159> just<00:01:29.159> welcome<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.610> the

side so can under the impression that

side so can under the impression that
we're<00:01:34.079> dealing<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> effects<00:01:35.070> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
we're dealing with the effects of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.600 
we're dealing with the effects of
sunlight<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:36.119> anything<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:41.400> really

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
sunlight or anything like that it really

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.929 
sunlight or anything like that it really
is<00:01:41.729> only<00:01:41.939> about<00:01:42.119> viewing<00:01:42.659> angles<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.229> terms<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
is only about viewing angles in terms of

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.920 
is only about viewing angles in terms of
regularly<00:01:44.939> use<00:01:47.090> sensation<00:01:48.090> tends<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.750> give

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
regularly use sensation tends to give

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.350 
regularly use sensation tends to give
you<00:01:49.110> pretty<00:01:49.920> good<00:01:50.130> color<00:01:50.399> accuracy<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.149> set

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you pretty good color accuracy and set

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
you pretty good color accuracy and set
and<00:01:51.990> saturation<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.189> you're<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.399> really

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and saturation so you're not really

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.179 
and saturation so you're not really
going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.820> notice<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.829> quite<00:01:56.040> as

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
going to notice that it's not quite as

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.410 
going to notice that it's not quite as
good<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.430> incredible<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.299> actually

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
good as incredible when you actually

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.420 
good as incredible when you actually
have<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.840> side-by-side<00:01:58.159> it<00:01:59.159> tends<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
have it in side-by-side it tends to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.649 
have it in side-by-side it tends to
become<00:01:59.579> apparent<00:02:00.500> pretty<00:02:01.500> quickly
