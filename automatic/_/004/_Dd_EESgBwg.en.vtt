little exaggerated because of the color

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.800 
little exaggerated because of the color
that<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.600> chose<00:01:06.979> but<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.939> keep<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.360> mind<00:01:09.390> that

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.230 

as<00:01:21.300> far<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:22.230> cap<00:01:22.500> construction<00:01:22.940> she<00:01:23.940> has

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
as far as the cap construction she has

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.780 
as far as the cap construction she has
no<00:01:24.570> cards<00:01:24.990> only<00:01:25.460> adjustable<00:01:26.460> straps<00:01:28.310> now<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> am

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
no cards only adjustable straps now I am

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.990 
no cards only adjustable straps now I am
5/8<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.500> would<00:01:31.740> say<00:01:31.980> that<00:01:32.370> emma<00:01:32.820> is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
5/8 and I would say that emma is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.280 
5/8 and I would say that emma is
probably<00:01:33.780> anywhere<00:01:34.320> between<00:01:34.640> 20<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:36.290> 24

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
probably anywhere between 20 to 24

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.070 
probably anywhere between 20 to 24
inches<00:01:37.860> she<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.640> pretty<00:01:38.940> long<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.510> me<00:01:39.690> so

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
inches she is pretty long on me so

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.320 
inches she is pretty long on me so
obviously<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.490> don't<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.150> law

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
obviously if you don't like the law

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.180 
obviously if you don't like the law
manually<00:01:42.870> then<00:01:43.080> I<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.350> stay<00:01:43.530> away<00:01:43.740> from<00:01:43.800> time

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
manually then I will stay away from time

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.030 
manually then I will stay away from time
as<00:01:44.400> well<00:01:44.870> because<00:01:45.870> of<00:01:46.020> her<00:01:46.200> length<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.800> am

as well because of her length I am

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.190 
as well because of her length I am
expecting<00:01:47.730> her<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.000> shine<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> really

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
expecting her to shine but I really

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.760 
expecting her to shine but I really
didn't<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.680> any<00:01:50.420> shedding<00:01:51.420> maybe<00:01:52.050> one<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:52.740> two

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
pluck it just a little bit but they did

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.890

as well and the lace is not ear to ear
also<00:02:10.320> which<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.649> thought<00:02:10.860> was<00:02:11.070> really<00:02:11.430> weird

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
also which I thought was really weird

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.820 
also which I thought was really weird
without<00:02:12.090> necessary<00:02:12.720> unit<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.260> only<00:02:13.560> had

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
without necessary unit that only had

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.460 
without necessary unit that only had
like<00:02:14.700> three<00:02:15.150> inches<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.690> lace<00:02:15.930> right<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.350> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
like three inches of lace right in the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.050 
like three inches of lace right in the
flats

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.000 

so<00:02:24.060> if<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.329> all<00:02:24.510> haven't<00:02:24.780> noticed<00:02:25.260> by<00:02:25.409> now<00:02:25.439> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
so if you all haven't noticed by now I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.770 
so if you all haven't noticed by now I
tried<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.519> switch<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.909> up<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.180> lot<00:02:27.359> try

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
tried to switch it up a lot try

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.839 
tried to switch it up a lot try
different<00:02:27.959> hair<00:02:28.349> styles<00:02:28.980> different<00:02:29.609> hair

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
different hair styles different hair

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.119 
different hair styles different hair
colors<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:30.900> was<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> main<00:02:31.500> reason<00:02:31.530> why<00:02:32.099> I

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
colors so that was the main reason why I
