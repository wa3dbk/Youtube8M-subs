00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
process we're actually taking its memory

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.119 
process we're actually taking its memory
out<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.510> getting<00:00:42.780> deep<00:00:42.960> inside<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> so

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
out and getting deep inside of it so

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.709 
out and getting deep inside of it so
let's<00:00:44.520> not<00:00:44.670> screw<00:00:44.730> around<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.300> its<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:45.629> it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
just that minuscule so I'm going to put

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.030 
just that minuscule so I'm going to put
them<00:01:35.130> aside<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.390> lose<00:01:36.689> them
