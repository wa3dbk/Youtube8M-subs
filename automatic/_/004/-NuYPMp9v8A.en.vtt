00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.029
 but these stable jobs 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.489
 a tree 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.049
 it starts with a european cup 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.049
 sakho s his big difference 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.900
 it's going badly his grave 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.390
 how 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.929
 but that's why not 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.009
 why report for august 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.470
 because on all fours 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.810
 it begins 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.880
 once again the knowledge no major disruption 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.020
 following a fire an epidemic the sects a harvest by man a 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.930
 Windthrow caused by the wind or by the dilapidation of the trees 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.500
 once again his keys from the seed present in the soil or 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.590
 on the branches of the trees were falling 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.660
 save small Sardinian wait for the forest cover the space and the 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 light that will allow them to grow 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.609
 the areas affected by the different disturbances 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.800
 do not react the same way 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.220
 for exemple 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.660
 a forest of periphery we will leave more quickly after a 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.660
 fire 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.350
 the corons that contain her mom spreading great heat for 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.250
 you break out and right now it's the term 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.280
 for spruce acreage so well done 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 often fire did not qualify the reforestation 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.750
 to speed up the regeneration process 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.780
 in general the softwoods takes a much slower growth 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.030
 Herbaceous plants with certain species of trees or shrubs 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.050
 the rapid growth of these species slow it down considerably the 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.630
 development of conifers often to the point of compromising their survival 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.950
 gold to grow well young if I had to cf walf receive 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.270
 enough food 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.870
 if plans third its lack of ambition 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.870
 we will have to listen to it mechanically 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.619
 since the use of phytos ed 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.540
 a kind of life these are ripley terzieff trees 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.190
 on public affairs since 2000 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.860
 the enemies are stubborn 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.190
 save after a first interview we should come back again to clear 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.629
 young people pose investors who have resumed the offensive 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.850
 usually these jobs are executed 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.850
 in es3 this year I'm in reforestation 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.529
 according to the species on the 19th and its activity between 50 and simple 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:24.229
 but not all trees not the same life guys nor the same qualities 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.099
 to promote the growth of the most promising trees the forester and 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.529
 will recommend for cutting off sun point trees that could do 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.749
 in training or more vigorous 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.469
 it was here that after a few tens of years a hectare of forest 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:44.430
 developed will produce fewer trees and more productivity research 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:46.799
 had already probable 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.249
 during the clashes why not for whom and why not but can 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.649
 pronounce for the primary 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.889
 and who says he was called to appear before the court of appeal 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:55.810
 sometimes 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.839
 nature what can even cheer the evenings 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:02.559
 usually when the fruit of the tree matures it falls to 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.769
 soil they are not cholet 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.189
 same thing for men 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.339
 when he matures he begins to wither he falls 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.819
 sometimes it's the insects that will attack the trees the foreheads 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.799
 die 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.879
 on other occasions the fire without charging 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.819
 when unions happen forest human technology looks good 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.129
 powerless to limit the devastating effect of the flames 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.709
 harvesting mature forests made by humans in addition to producing a 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.269
 important economic activity contributes to renewing the forest of 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.449
 controlled way 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.449
 while minimizing impacts on the forest environment 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.509
 it's the lovers of growth 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:50.849
 each represents the growth of the central bank alassane sy sailing 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.129
 there everyone growing of all the trees that gives the possibility 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.479
 forestry 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:57.149
 this call to castelmoron can cost
