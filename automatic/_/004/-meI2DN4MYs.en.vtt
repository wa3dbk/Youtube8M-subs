give<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.210> settings<00:01:30.540> tab<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.869> well<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.619> let's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
give you a settings tab as well so let's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.980

just<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> settings<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.570> really

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
just go in the settings now I really

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.690 
just go in the settings now I really
think<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.229> could<00:01:34.439> go<00:01:34.590> far<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.460> phinney

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.789 
think this could go far I'm in phinney
board<00:01:35.970> simply<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:37.079> people<00:01:37.560> could<00:01:37.710> start

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799

making<00:01:38.220> themes<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.790> will<00:01:38.909> implement<00:01:39.210> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
making themes that will implement you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.060

haven't<00:01:40.110> scrolled<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> down<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.040> your

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
haven't scrolled up and down on your

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.060 
haven't scrolled up and down on your
pages<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> I'll<00:01:42.180> recommend<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.560> theme

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
pages so it I'll recommend you theme

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.010 
pages so it I'll recommend you theme
developers<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.579> there<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.570> should<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.840> on

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
developers out there you should get on

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.429 
developers out there you should get on
this<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.649> make<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> theme<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.450> implements

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
this and I make a theme that implements

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.499 
this and I make a theme that implements
the<00:01:49.710> infinite<00:01:50.460> board<00:01:50.640> style<00:01:51.000> because<00:01:51.479> I

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the infinite board style because I

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.990 
the infinite board style because I
really<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.960> would<00:01:52.140> look<00:01:52.200> pretty<00:01:52.530> cool

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
really think that would look pretty cool

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.240 
really think that would look pretty cool
so<00:01:54.000> there<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.329> infinity<00:01:54.840> board<00:01:55.250> click

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
so there you go infinity board click

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.889 
so there you go infinity board click
that<00:01:56.430> gives<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> few<00:01:57.329> options<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.840> course

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that gives you a few options of course

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.230 
that gives you a few options of course
you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.259> turn<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.740> off<00:01:59.000> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.119> have

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
you can turn it on and off you can have

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.170 
you can turn it on and off you can have
your<00:02:00.299> bounce<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.960> when<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.759> bounces

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
your bounce so when you go up it bounces

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.240 
your bounce so when you go up it bounces
back to<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> middle<00:02:04.049> or<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.530> just

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
back to the middle or you can just

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.789 
back to the middle or you can just
though<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.790> it'll<00:02:05.880> stay<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:07.500> scroll

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
though up and it'll stay up you scroll

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.229 
though up and it'll stay up you scroll
bar<00:02:07.979> type<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.399> when<00:02:08.550> you're<00:02:08.670> scrolling<00:02:08.879> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
will do the same thing I'm a bit

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.949 
will do the same thing I'm a bit
confusing<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.490> there<00:02:35.700> probably<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.300> you

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
confusing you there probably but you

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.650 
confusing you there probably but you
understand<00:02:37.470> what<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.620> mean<00:02:37.680> I'm<00:02:38.090> top<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.300> app

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
understand what I mean I'm top on app

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.690 
understand what I mean I'm top on app
exit<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.650> once<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.920> exit<00:02:41.190> an<00:02:41.310> app<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.610> go

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
exit so once you exit an app it go

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.820 
exit so once you exit an app it go
straight<00:02:42.000> back<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> top<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.930> page<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
straight back to the top of the page and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.800 
straight back to the top of the page and
that's<00:02:44.490> about<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.000> setting<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.540> once

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
that's about it the setting so once

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.479 
that's about it the setting so once
you've<00:02:45.959> sort<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.500> all<00:02:46.560> out<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.250> start

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
you've sort it all out you can start

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.830 
you've sort it all out you can start
moving<00:02:47.640> your<00:02:47.790> application<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.630> I'm<00:02:48.720> just

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
moving your application so I'm just

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.470 
moving your application so I'm just
going<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.110> scroll<00:02:49.410> over<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:50.180> start<00:02:51.180> moving

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
going to scroll over and start moving

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.300 
going to scroll over and start moving
some<00:02:51.600> applications<00:02:52.260> onto<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.950> other<00:02:53.040> page

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
some applications onto the other page

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.370 
some applications onto the other page
now<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.300> can<00:02:54.480> see<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.720> facebook<00:02:55.140> has

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
now you can see that facebook has

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.710 
now you can see that facebook has
dropped<00:02:55.770> down<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.700> just<00:02:57.030> move<00:02:57.420> some<00:02:57.630> more<00:03:02.720> move

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
dropped down so just move some more move

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.860 
dropped down so just move some more move
another<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.850> see<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.300> i<00:03:06.600> can

you can do this through as many

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.420 
you can do this through as many
applications<00:03:12.450> as<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.720> want<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.280> put

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
applications as you want so you can put

applications as you want so you can put
all<00:03:14.610> your<00:03:14.730> applications<00:03:14.850> on<00:03:15.420> one<00:03:15.570> page<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:16.050> i

said or just have how many applications

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.380 
said or just have how many applications
you<00:03:19.620> want<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:20.640> can<00:03:20.760> do<00:03:20.880> this<00:03:21.000> for<00:03:21.180> all<00:03:21.209> your
