that's a plane she's on the 4:30 room

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.990 
that's a plane she's on the 4:30 room
you<00:02:06.780> go<00:02:08.420> with<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> six<00:02:09.750> speed<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.289> sixth<00:02:10.619> gear

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
you go with the six speed and sixth gear

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.530 
you go with the six speed and sixth gear
at<00:02:12.000> 60<00:02:12.660> miles<00:02:12.840> an<00:02:13.019> hour<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:14.819> inch<00:02:15.000> was<00:02:15.209> turning

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
at 60 miles an hour the inch was turning

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.100 
at 60 miles an hour the inch was turning
just<00:02:15.780> slightly<00:02:16.079> over<00:02:16.290> 1500<00:02:17.130> rpm

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110
