00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.359
 the 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.029
 if someone feels peace of aena is a toner i 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.470
 I'm presenting a championship match 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.430
 - equipment in a start of the year 2011 then unemployed black for banks 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.900
 we have the super grandmaster alexander notiver against padoán martín 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.060
 in grand master only 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.060
 they are also in their eleven 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.690
 everything is seen and adapted to each hour 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.620
 in no current fadrique cap opening every hour 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.530
 in its star program the united states declared a comfortable is giving 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.199
 this variation of the banks will be 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.750
 is very topical now it is very popular in 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.650
 I understand high class 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.390
 then with cache fipresci noodles 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.100
 then there were many 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.220
 many actions are demonstrably demandable in white clubs parody as 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.540
 I wish it had been two oscars v3 pasaca controls the c5 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.670
 also to me to measure 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.240
 transfer 3 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.460
 because it is very very flexible of the pse-ee you can mix the plans also to 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.460
 she is half average to everything or also from 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.070
 it is necessary then 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.600
 we have 6 5 I made four and a half in merida also tempo as you get 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.040
 chance is of 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.159
 the match from the is very complicated 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.490
 but if I did not like it for europe, it stopped low because 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.180
 it is still that this has wished them then the complications are 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.590
 more difficult for blacks for aesthetics 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.120
 falseen was taken and four in trance is now clear 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.470
 who means it to have a performance before the weak strong 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.139
 that is the question then 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.109
 ec 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:13.829
 the game towards the dynamic for the media a bit more complicated than vido 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.389
 dsta nelson being white 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.720
 they are going to take this out of space i 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.690
 depends on the activity in the media silva denied being 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.859
 then I have inside 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.809
 of hacienda 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.169
 before three 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.089
 it's almost past 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.949
 I'll tell you about three's threaten then 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.559
 - this is the moment 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.599
 of two bank because more more flexible to doubt 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:47.499
 bullfighting 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.970
 because now he's thinking 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.099
 still high ere one 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.119
 i 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:56.659
 go to the rock 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.989
 black earthenware 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.009
 victor 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:04.709
 scútaro b tactical by banks 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.799
 for example if you play 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.079
 A) Yes 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.659
 diaz telefe 4 then now it seems that 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:16.259
 this obviously is not possible 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.380
 i 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.999
 the tactics is 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:25.870
 I always get up in this guy for the banks it was he who for example of 6 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.440
 13 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.889
 the only moment 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.270
 and then ee 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.019
 his mother i 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.910
 all this is good for the Basques 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.899
 efe four ecstasy 7rm 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.169
 the sale of cedés 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.739
 because 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.619
 the celestial and 7 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.369
 so 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.669
 it does not make sense for the galaxy standing bank 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.669
 to change pawns in transit and there is one 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.189
 i this planet say that understand 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.639
 and the testify they made pablos of euros to generate 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.179
 the opposite 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:07.879
 it was he who now raised it means he has said of the space of all 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.249
 activity within the corporation 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:11.949
 i with 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.069
 with this parade where you want 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.599
 play as h5 of unemployed but believe or to be slower to attack opaque and 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:21.650
 they are made 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.069
 i adore 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.550
 very good this moment 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.949
 it's going to be a kind of stress 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.069
 i tere 3 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.319
 will control much quaranta so close 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.800
 so 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.020
 from 4 to 11 5 is 5 and also f4 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.710
 it was then very centralized they do not know the problem 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.400
 in Iran now yes 3 5 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.860
 It is very difficult 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.809
 for where they pay for it because nothing to leave 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:55.279
 we are not going to extend to standing unemployed bread with possession 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.319
 Now I bet you all black stone 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.820
 are the nation 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:08.789
 and did not announce last night museum piece with nation for blacks has been created ere 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.520
 more important 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.240
 then p4 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.319
 and at the same time pass the tenth to attack other banks because it is de vido 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:19.830
 luzón game 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.380
 professional before 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.380
 in full match 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:28.939
 and now the threat is clear 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.919
 donda blacks are trying to put some pressure on santiago before what is 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:35.779
 plus 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.180
 I am afraid that yes because many think the way 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.340
 well the sae 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.949
 I waited too late 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.410
 and now the ages t 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.009
 They are very dignified and clear 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:53.910
 what if 7 7 6 also to each scene in the 3 6 and 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.360
 what can it be for the media 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.360
 the whole piece in hostage Álava 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.199
 before from tactics on the side of the knife 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.689
 then yes if you play threats and 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.830
 that Tuesday france 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.839
 so 

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.039
 it serves 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.939
 drafting 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:33.839
 i did not work and now in full a bandage or pawns 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.499
 for whites 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:39.400
 is more and more complications if you take 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:41.939
 that easy 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:44.939
 i medina can defend 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.999
 phase to get banks 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:52.999
 then here 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:55.480
 for bernard king 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.249
 with celery from the stands 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:59.809
 says of nothing else 

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:02.849
 then the two under tanaka 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:05.849
 because I hate hate I can not defend 

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.319
 It will not work 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:13.550
 for example 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.080

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.080
