00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
possibly could from the Star Wars the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.820 
possibly could from the Star Wars the
clones<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.390> war<00:00:21.600> mod<00:00:21.840> i'll<00:00:22.320> put<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.560> link<00:00:22.590> for

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
clones of war mod i'll put a link for

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.120 
clones of war mod i'll put a link for
that<00:00:22.890> mod<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.910> description<00:00:24.480> now

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
that mod in the description now

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.589 
that mod in the description now
basically<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.400> map<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:26.880> quite<00:00:27.390> simple<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.019> I

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
basically this map is quite simple and I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.240 
basically this map is quite simple and I
raise<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.779> polygons<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.070> these

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
raise the polygons here so that these

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.720 
raise the polygons here so that these
these<00:00:33.120> units<00:00:33.540> can't<00:00:33.870> escape<00:00:34.520> all<00:00:35.520> these

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
these units can't escape all these

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
these units can't escape all these
battle<00:00:36.090> droids<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> go<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.079> way<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
battle droids have to go is this way and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.119 
battle droids have to go is this way and
the<00:00:38.010> map<00:00:38.160> ends<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.530> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.010> be

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the map ends here so this is going to be

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.569 
the map ends here so this is going to be
a<00:00:41.160> crazy<00:00:41.460> fight<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.530> I<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:44.280> an<00:00:44.399> idea

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
a crazy fight here and I have an idea

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.260 
a crazy fight here and I have an idea
what's<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.239> happen<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:47.120> might<00:00:48.120> do<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
what's going to happen but I might do a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.319 
what's going to happen but I might do a
rematch<00:00:48.660> after<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.379> we'll<00:00:49.620> say<00:00:50.149> let's<00:00:51.149> get
