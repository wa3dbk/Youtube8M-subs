ones i bought i unlocked on my point
streaks<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:52.799> not

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890

and the one I've got right now which is
a<00:02:06.200> 86<00:02:06.800> that's<00:02:07.250> really<00:02:07.640> good<00:02:07.790> what<00:02:08.209> it<00:02:08.300> does<00:02:08.539> is

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
a 86 that's really good what it does is

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.410 
a 86 that's really good what it does is
that<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:08.990> fun<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.410> he<00:02:09.530> around<00:02:09.679> my<00:02:09.860> map<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.550> it

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
better mind if you think you're a little

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.900 
better mind if you think you're a little
bit<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.020> an<00:02:15.319> offensive<00:02:15.770> player<00:02:15.920> or<00:02:16.310> kind<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.819> a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
bit of an offensive player or kind of a

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.820 
bit of an offensive player or kind of a
camper<00:02:17.330> I'm<00:02:17.870> not<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.200> right<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.350> little<00:02:18.620> bit

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
camper I'm not the right a little bit

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.740 
camper I'm not the right a little bit
campus<00:02:19.220> then<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.760> wouldn't<00:02:20.090> really<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.450> wouldn't

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
campus then I wouldn't really I wouldn't

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.400 
campus then I wouldn't really I wouldn't
really<00:02:20.870> use<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.520> point<00:02:22.520> streak<00:02:22.760> because

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
really use that a point streak because

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.810 
really use that a point streak because
it<00:02:24.410> follows<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.490> don't<00:02:25.670> move

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
it follows you and if you don't move

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.860 
it follows you and if you don't move
then<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.150> not<00:02:26.209> going<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.480> move<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:26.810> a

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
then it's not going to move and a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.449 
then it's not going to move and a
benefit<00:02:27.230> therefore<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.680> won't<00:02:27.800> get<00:02:27.950> any<00:02:28.010> get

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
benefit therefore it won't get any get

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.520 
benefit therefore it won't get any get
you<00:02:28.550> any<00:02:28.700> kills<00:02:28.970> right<00:02:29.780> now<00:02:30.050> I<00:02:30.080> think<00:02:30.290> I'm

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
you any kills right now I think I'm

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.840 
you any kills right now I think I'm
gonna<00:02:30.650> get<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.890> more<00:02:31.070> secure<00:02:31.310> which<00:02:31.489> i<00:02:31.580> think<00:02:31.640> is

gunner<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:20.110> I've<00:03:21.110> played<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.530> little<00:03:21.620> bit<00:03:21.769> guys

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
gunner and I've played a little bit guys

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.060 
gunner and I've played a little bit guys
a<00:03:21.980> couple<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.519> times<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:23.230> believe<00:03:24.230> it's<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.530> 17th

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
a couple of times I believe it's a 17th

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.300 
a couple of times I believe it's a 17th
for<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.640> 17<00:03:26.090> point<00:03:26.510> streak<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:27.799> it's<00:03:28.130> not<00:03:28.190> really

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
for a 17 point streak so it's not really

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.300 
for a 17 point streak so it's not really
