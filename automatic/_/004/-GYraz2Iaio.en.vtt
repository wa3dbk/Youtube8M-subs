00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 I greet everyone, I am Natalia Nevzorova and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 Now we will see how it works 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.259
 touch tonal basis 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.300
 perfection 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:19.050
 I took for myself the tone 3 300 424 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:26.369
 ivory tone and as usual we 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:32.210
 remove the seal and now we put 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.530
 tonal framework quite a bit I will put 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 it turned out we are not as little as 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.350
 I would like to see how this works 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.680
 tonal basis i mean i start 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.680
 shade 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.289
 small so jaundiced 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.379
 it appears to pour it dense in its 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.770
 consistency see what contains 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.960
 reflective particles because immediately 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.260
 this skin becomes light but 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.600
 versus tonal base in van she 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.439
 a little bit more closely is the tonal 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.939
 the basis is lighter about the consistency of its 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.790
 and here is a little tonal basis provide 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.670
 more transparent effect than this one 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.920
 if you see otton here, I still see 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.619
 on his hand I want to say that if 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 tonal framework in the bathroom is suitable for 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.560
 any age that series giordani gold 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.590
 just meant for a woman live 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.340
 30 years this tonal foundation gives the skin 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.259
 natural tone and radiance of youth and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.439
 contains a moisturizing complex which 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.310
 prevents skin dehydration and how 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.070
 consequence 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.680
 the appearance of the first wrinkles so you 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.990
 look what I liked in her she 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.119
 matting well i mean you see no such 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.860
 pronounced oily sheen like 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.759
 earlier, for example, gave a tonal basis 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.909
 adaptive and here's the difference you see too 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.280
 there is here the border just shades 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.050
 on the skin are noticeable that here a little bit like that 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.940
 I think even more pink shade 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.320
 than ivory here 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.980
 if we look here with us 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.080
 presented see shades and pink 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.630
 beige there she will be pinker 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.310
 gentle vanilla there is a shade well here 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.550
 me this ivory 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.770
 Well, so probably yes, I'll show you where 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.310
 well vybelivaet skin at court I 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.980
 noted but the reflective effect is not 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.950
 so noticeable as in tonal basis in van 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.230
 Well, and as for the moisture 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.140
 skin is smooth but still here in ivan 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.850
 sensations did not like more than this 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.770
 tonal basis well, I'll try 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.630
 Now how do these two tones work 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.270
 basics on the face and then share with you 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.980

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.080
 a little feeling have her presence on 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.500
 skin 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.320
 Well , that's what you see now 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.510

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.550
