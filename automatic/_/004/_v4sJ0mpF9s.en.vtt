I had this great color and talked about

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.990 
I had this great color and talked about
it<00:02:08.660> but<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:08.780> tionally<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.590> then<00:02:09.950> we<00:02:10.069> I<00:02:10.280> would

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
it but I tionally and then we I would

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.100 
it but I tionally and then we I would
love<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.300> but<00:02:11.599> I<00:02:11.660> thought<00:02:11.840> if<00:02:11.930> there's<00:02:12.050> a

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
love it but I thought if there's a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.960 
love it but I thought if there's a
difference<00:02:12.440> between<00:02:12.530> introducing<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.519> early

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
difference between introducing it early

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.559 
difference between introducing it early
and<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:15.290> introducing<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.010> too<00:02:16.129> often<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.269> I

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
and then introducing it too often so I

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.360 
and then introducing it too often so I
think<00:02:17.629> there<00:02:17.870> are<00:02:17.900> any<00:02:17.959> imbalance<00:02:18.650> like<00:02:18.860> throw

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
think there are any imbalance like throw

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.920 
think there are any imbalance like throw
it<00:02:19.519> in<00:02:19.640> there<00:02:19.819> from<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.090> get-go<00:02:20.269> but<00:02:20.720> don't

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
it in there from the get-go but don't

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.900 
it in there from the get-go but don't
then<00:02:21.530> don't<00:02:21.560> throw<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.129> in<00:02:22.250> every<00:02:22.670> five

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
then don't throw it in every five

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.520 
then don't throw it in every five
minutes<00:02:23.150> yeah<00:02:23.480> every<00:02:23.810> single<00:02:24.110> day<00:02:24.260> for<00:02:24.319> the
