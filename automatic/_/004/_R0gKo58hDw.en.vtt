William makes these wonderful shapes and
then<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.520> use<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> black<00:01:54.270> sticky<00:01:55.260> paper<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
then you use a black sticky paper to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.160 
then you use a black sticky paper to
stick<00:01:57.090> pieces<00:01:57.690> together<00:01:59.180> plus<00:02:00.180> some<00:02:00.450> pins<00:02:00.780> and
