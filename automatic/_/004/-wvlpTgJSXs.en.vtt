00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.860
 lion that is newly incorporated nelson how 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.889
 you are how you find yourself I am very very 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.019
 happy happy to be officially 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.730
 incorporates from campus and nothing working 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.080
 working hard and we know 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.449
 that although a very important commitment 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.140
 for everyone so this put him hard 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.269
 for what is coming 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.920
 sebastián what are these expectations 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.560
 new ones that you have expressly for this 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.359
 2014 campaign with the lion not only me 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.490
 but the campus with the staff working 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.740
 hard to bring me to find me a place and 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.030
 well before playing and I hope we are 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.410
 healthy competition with all 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.600
 partners between I planted not that the 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.490
 we complicate the coach and the other for 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.110
 the team this does not expect a big 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.170
 commitment we know we have chairs 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.500
 a great tournament 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.390
 try to keep the title but I move to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.309
 step and well I think we have 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.229
 liberators of the group phase 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.089
 work hard to hopefully pass the 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.199
 group at this time those are the 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.760
 main objectives 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.289
 sebastián other same you speak of that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.329
 internal competition that there will be that will be 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.100
 very healthy but as you think it will be like 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.289
 you visualize that it will be present with 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.270
 mauro boselli with matías britos with 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.520
 franco arizala with a miguel sabah and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.509
 with yourself I do not tell you it 's a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.670
 competition that has to do with 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.020
 campus that's good that there's a lot 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 competition that nobody lowers the arms 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.190
 we all demand we get the best out of each 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.649
 one for good now that I train 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.509
 you have to decide what is it that you 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.610
 have the difficulty but make it through 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.080
 good cause in case no because no 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.179
 have nobody but because you have good 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.100
 players and many players also by 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.959
 last you illusion and you look for this 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.399
 next campaign getting the 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.569
 bicampeonato and out there making a 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.819
 good participation in the cup 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.649
 liberators already the idea and step by step 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.750
 as it has always been characterized 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.100
 team this does not preempt things and 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.530
 He has not game by game we go 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 playing this propose and good to try 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.950
 to improve by correcting things 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.420
 that have to be improved but hopefully 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.500
 I hope they want to end the year 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.250

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.930

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.820

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.350

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.420
 they investigate supporting and saying good 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.650
 vibrates in what is very important and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.149

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.580

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.900
 support that for me is very important and 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.280
 at the same time he made that also happen 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.810
 a little bit faster knowing he had 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.250

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.810
