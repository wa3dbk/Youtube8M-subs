later<00:00:20.789> on<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.359> life<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.869> used<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.230> just<00:00:22.439> not<00:00:22.800> wear

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
later on in life I used to just not wear

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.859 
pretty chapped all the time and I used
to<00:00:26.220> think<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.730> was<00:00:26.880> better<00:00:27.119> gloss
