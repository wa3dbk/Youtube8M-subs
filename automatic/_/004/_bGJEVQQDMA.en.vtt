00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.760
 hello in this tutorial I teach you 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:14.610
 how to fix the gopro on your helmet 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.560
 of skiing with everything he fell 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.499
 it's time to go for a little bit 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.289
 ski or surf so that's why you 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:25.529
 obviously need the helmet a pencil to 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.619
 paper a little cloth a product for 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:36.120
 degrease the gopro with the support 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:41.190
 curved whoever is not flat I you 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.580
 worn the flat stand for when you 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.700
 see the difference so the flat support 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:53.880
 necessarily will not be able to adhere to it 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:56.460
 there is a space and it's not going to stick well 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.800
 so that's okay it can be pasted on 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.130
 the side if any on your helmet 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.100
 and even this one in any case does not 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.490
 not allow so you take the one who 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.920
 is curved and we're going to look we're going 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.829
 look for the place on the helmet 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:20.729
 which allows to be the most in touch 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:23.490
 with the stand and the helmet 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.200
 so see that before we do not know 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.799
 necessarily good we can not on this headset 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.920
 I want to put it on this level 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.380
 at this point we are just going to check 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.359
 with the camera and thanks to this small screen 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.359
 that it does not encroach on what we do not see 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:45.479
 not the helmet when in place 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.979
 so there you see it's okay huh 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.709
 see what's in front and we see 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.880
 not what is there is not seen above 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:58.079
 helmet 1 here and so here now 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.369
 we will locate in relation to the vertical 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:08.450
 of the helmet that he is well also 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:11.420
 centered on that so we find at 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.830
 horizontality good horizontality 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.330
 and good distance to 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.470
 helmets so me that's pretty much on the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:25.310
 on it that's pretty much center and we're going 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:30.080
 make a small mark to spot at 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.840
 pretty much where it's next then 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.459
 will clean with the rag and the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:42.590
 product to degrease for that 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:44.810
 hold on well this is a typical product 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.100
 to clean the screens and you can 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.850
 do with alcohol to burn there is 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:55.850
 no problem we have degreased and 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.600
 now we are going to simply stick 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:07.400
 so we'll remove the little pellet the 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:11.150
 small film a red in the back and 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.730
 we go to the pass and so to the place that 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.739
 I had spotted just now with the 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.739
 pencil the most entries possible 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.299
 contacts 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.390
 here and after we press hard 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.769
 for a few seconds 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.130
 I could have removed the gopro 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:37.760
 this level there to have the maximum 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:39.459
 adhesion is fixed the strongest 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:47.170
 possible 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:47.170
 here is that fx is ready to go to the ski
