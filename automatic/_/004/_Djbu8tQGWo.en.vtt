from mr. you know regular family and so
on<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.049> so<00:00:58.109> forth<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.429> some<00:00:59.549> of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
quite important to always sort of you

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.730 
quite important to always sort of you
know<00:01:36.359> have<00:01:36.570> someone<00:01:36.810> visits<00:01:37.259> believe<00:01:37.469> you<00:01:37.590> can

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
know have someone visits believe you can

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
know have someone visits believe you can
see<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.250> they've<00:01:39.000> achieved<00:01:39.119> anything<00:01:39.659> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
see that they've achieved anything you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.719 
see that they've achieved anything you
can<00:01:39.960> realize<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.859> the<00:01:40.920> dream<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.159> is

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
can realize that the dream is is

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.510 
can realize that the dream is is
touchable<00:01:42.179> so<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.039> me<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.399> very

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.000 
touchable so I think for me is very
important
