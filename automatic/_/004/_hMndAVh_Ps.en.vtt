00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:16.440
 bush and hi everyone 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.510
 we find ourselves for another video on 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.039
 this time it's a video 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.510
 different but I'm still in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.000
 contact with a gentleman 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.380
 British hi everyone and there this 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.180
 passion born on the multi as you 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.769
 can see the stock market have all widely 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.420
 I'm not on my side because I have 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.880
 problems is that white boks and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.860
 a down I wanted to share you a 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.350
 good way if you go see if you 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.520
 have the flames of fire to pass the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.899
 skills skills and all that 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.649
 there are some small tips for them 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.379
 and increase 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.840
 this is maybe you will have a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.870
 photo is shaking an elastic a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.320
 elastic or shoe lace or to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.910
 the limit the same how max who we 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.500
 had said I was stuff too 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.090
 helmet cord 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.880
 yeah the roof she sticks again bounded 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.340
 until finally and 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.970
 and long enough that 's body do not have 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.570
 no matter 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.620
 and so you put that tight 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.600
 both analog 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.300
 to each other so that 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.160
 it's like that so I go there for the 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.660
 market is therefore left out that it takes 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.420
 to increase discretion at 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.860
 max if you put like that you put 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.380
 in discretion and you may have let go 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.350
 with whom you put in them and all that 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.729
 you let go of it so that continues you 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.280
 talk about doing things we do other 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.660
 thing and tools tips she in 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.530
 France not necessarily it's empty lied 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.590
 but in a part where she is or 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.270
 would it be because otherwise we get 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:47.180
 quickly and easily and so wait 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.360
 sorry for the unexpected so for you 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.600
 remember it's just the two analog 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.729
 see the other's backhands with one that's 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.830
 not obliged for the right analog the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.270
 career it's easier to meiway in 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.380
 the more she had to turn the thing it's 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.690
 that makes it turn and that's good 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.150
 practice for him to keep the distance 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.440
 of diva not from anywhere and then 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.509
 you put in discretion and there you 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.569
 you let that go you go 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.340
 do something else to eat 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.349
 the chances of seeing where a few clashes 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.959
 minors with a few weeks warner 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.209
 not even and in the end you have the 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.650
 discretion I have two eyes at last 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.420
 principle but better watch your 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.049
 elastic on the stx game that sends you 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.730
 a scientist 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.349
 yeah you take away mathieu come out done 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.209
 mutate but ends on love on the 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.700
 button a and so there he runs in 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.530
 character starts running there 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.120
 in otherwise live it's going it goes 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.180
 increase endurance to blue background seems 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.549
 after an hour now here is it 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.019
 you see through it looks like 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.510
 we know these clashes 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.219
 So, if we ever have our little 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.719
 trick we wanted to share if you 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.430
 've not hesitate to them 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.379
 fed stockings apart yes for the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.019
 conduct simply lead was 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.000
 quickly in the opposite direction by brushing 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.500
 cars and his life that increases enough 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.370
 quickly see completed to the maximum 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.129
 while I have just a few 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.049
 hours of play 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:08.290
 a few hours yes a few hours 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.060
 so that's pretty cool and if not at 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.469
 level good steering I'll try to 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.329
 find a little trick I may have 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.209
 an idea of a trick I you 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.750
 I will give it to you in beauty 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.750
 want later 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.540
 it was the little tutorial if we find a 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.560
 methods earlier by then I think 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.140
 that I would put it by the same video 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.450
 so we tell you either right away to 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.790
 the following rates either at a next 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.150
 for online videos seems additionally 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.150
 his life hi
