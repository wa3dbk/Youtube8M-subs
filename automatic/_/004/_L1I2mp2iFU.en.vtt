00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.320
 hello everyone we are in the map 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.150
 so seats for a pylon or itunes 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.590
 as you want to read the description 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.930
 to know how to do it and then you 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.580
 equip in asset so it's pretty simple 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.990
 to find so these two species 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.359
 archers to send when I realize the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.619
 knife I'm shifting left to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 land on their hosts this arch 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.500
 metallic enough square is actually a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.100
 time I'm on the top so I 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.280
 can not do much 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.710
 of exceptional I tried while returning to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 the end here to go to make a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.250
 strike for canvas sources one can 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.750
 bet an invisible wall and the other arch 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.100
 also it's a little too far the trend 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.449
 trans so in any case we can reach 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.520
 above this arch which is already not 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.340
 badly but there is a second of nike 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.660
 punch that I'm going to show you 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.070
 in fact I play it really ready on 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.050
 positioning on the map allowed itself 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.229
 to go up there 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.790
 So here is my friend standing in front on 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.890
 he has a kind of wall besides 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.280
 quantico you will see can not go 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.070
 further 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.700
 so I'm facing myself and so 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 I have more than hit one shot 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.409
 of knife and push justice towards 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.049
 the top to get to the top 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.270
 so here it helps to be damn 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.020
 authors that one there is enough 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.520
 interesting let's say 1.2 precisely 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.979
 that's about the height this so the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.479
 higher so unfortunately little talked about 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.549
 afterwards it's a shame 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.250
 so after we can be confined to the east 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.360
 on the 2nd pillar 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.920
 good I also take the opportunity to tell you 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.899
 we can get out of the map of seats 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.189
 but then it's pretty hot to do 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.150
 I hope I can make you the 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.450
 watch and that in video 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:54.280
 so here and then we can go on the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.310
 third pillar here so here after we 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.870
 will finish with a third after y'en 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.280
 to a fourth who follows so I have him there 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.720
 is very simple he at the beginning of cards that 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.120
 just lets a dea at the top of the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.440
 rope thanks to the tires that's here and 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.760
 your friend who is squatting in front 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.500
 it's at the door a little bit 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.090
 of bias so here's once you 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.910
 are there you offer this villa and 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.870
 especially this spot of shooting pardon one can 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.560
 not go further if in time 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.550
 so we have to go a little bit there 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.550
 so there as I told you we can 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.230
 talk on the roof behind me 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.790
 that is to say that here if I here I bind myself 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.260
 at the rate sailboats that has nothing there is 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.840
 no skirmishes is nothing so after 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.300
 we go to the door and then 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.540
 so I showed you the fourth finally 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.640
 the latter 4th so far so dyke 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.900
 lunch in this seating map so we 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.520
 is here on the map and so does that 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.050
 happens here so see the opponent get 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.590
 place squatting on the kind of small 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.470
 because in concrete here is me I place myself here 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.090
 see to see that such an opponent even 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.880
 time I control my player did not see 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.650
 arrive on top of those of this wall 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.970
 in fact of this concrete pillar one can 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.620
 not the opposite we can go on this 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.010
 first pillar of who is right 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.070
 we have just seen appreciate so voila 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.140
 you walk all the way here from the wall and 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.239
 still the one we saw killer of the 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.459
 building that is left to arrive 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.010
 so far up to the tree level 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.080
 so we can not do much 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.690
 unfortunately we are downright driving 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.670
 so it's nice like die punch 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.670
 and so it was in the map seats
