00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.990
 let's start with the curiosities 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.970
 most of the princesses are 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.949
 in love with one of them is the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.039

 that looks like a snail waving towards the 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.230
 screen except in the episode 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.000
 problems in the lumpy and bloody space 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.580
 under the skin unlike the version 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.440
 original in Spanish they always say phrases 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.780
 of pop culture that have nothing that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.879
 see with the original example saying end 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.070
 that is, after the top episode 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.030

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.320

 week at 10 30 to then put 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.690
 old episodes this could be 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.970
 because cartoon network does not have more 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.860
 ads and use that to announce the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.619

 probably to a mushroom cloud 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.770
 generated by a nuclear bomb if so 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.720
 it is likely that today's land 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.730
 creatures that inhabit it were created to 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.310
 from the radioactive fallout that fell
