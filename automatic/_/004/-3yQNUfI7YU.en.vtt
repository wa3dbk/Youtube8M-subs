here is a perfect example of that so
this<00:01:52.709> is<00:01:53.179> sesame<00:01:54.179> soy<00:01:54.300> salmon<00:01:54.780> with<00:01:54.989> shredded

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
this is sesame soy salmon with shredded

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.070 
this is sesame soy salmon with shredded
Asian<00:01:55.679> vegetables<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.399> coconut<00:01:56.970> rice<00:01:57.090> you've

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
Asian vegetables and coconut rice you've

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.400 
Asian vegetables and coconut rice you've
got<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.619> whole<00:01:58.770> grain<00:01:59.039> brown<00:01:59.879> rice<00:02:00.259> very<00:02:01.259> very

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
got the whole grain brown rice very very

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.859 
got the whole grain brown rice very very
slow<00:02:01.709> release<00:02:01.950> carbohydrate<00:02:02.700> you've<00:02:03.599> got<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
slow release carbohydrate you've got the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.900 
slow release carbohydrate you've got the
lean<00:02:04.050> protein<00:02:04.500> there<00:02:04.709> from<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.039> fish<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
lean protein there from the fish and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.729 
lean protein there from the fish and
also<00:02:06.239> the<00:02:06.599> the<00:02:06.810> nutrient<00:02:07.170> dense<00:02:07.319> vegetables

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
also the the nutrient dense vegetables

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.619 
also the the nutrient dense vegetables
when<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.950> put<00:02:08.160> those<00:02:09.000> kind<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.360> ingredients

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
when you put those kind of ingredients

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.880 
when you put those kind of ingredients
together<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.289> such<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> way<00:02:10.679> you're

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
together in such a way you're

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.380 
together in such a way you're
essentially<00:02:11.400> creating<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.970> dish<00:02:12.180> that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
essentially creating a dish that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.630 
essentially creating a dish that
releases<00:02:12.870> its<00:02:13.020> energy<00:02:13.410> very<00:02:13.739> very<00:02:13.920> slowly<00:02:14.310> so

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
releases its energy very very slowly so

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.850 
releases its energy very very slowly so
it's<00:02:15.120> drip<00:02:15.480> feeding<00:02:15.750> your<00:02:15.959> blood<00:02:16.110> sugar<00:02:16.349> it's

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
it's drip feeding your blood sugar it's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's drip feeding your blood sugar it's
keeping<00:02:17.160> your<00:02:17.280> blood<00:02:17.489> sugar<00:02:17.700> an<00:02:17.819> even<00:02:18.000> level

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
keeping your blood sugar an even level

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.760 
keeping your blood sugar an even level
that's<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.629> lot<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.780> diabetics<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.620> one

that's a lot of diabetics this one

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.930 
that's a lot of diabetics this one
you're<00:02:19.890> recommending<00:02:20.069> for<00:02:20.310> vitamin<00:02:20.700> D

you're recommending for vitamin D
vitamin<00:02:21.209> D<00:02:21.930> yeah<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.349> primary<00:02:22.709> source<00:02:22.890> of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
vitamin D yeah the primary source of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.000 
vitamin D yeah the primary source of
vitamin<00:02:23.340> D<00:02:23.879> for<00:02:24.120> humans<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.440> conversion

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
vitamin D for humans is the conversion

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.130 
vitamin D for humans is the conversion
of<00:02:26.069> cholesterol<00:02:26.640> into<00:02:27.060> vitamin<00:02:27.180> D<00:02:27.510> precursors

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
of cholesterol into vitamin D precursors

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.290 
of cholesterol into vitamin D precursors

semester next thing to go in green chili
right<00:03:37.630> chilis<00:03:38.140> contain<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.470> chemical<00:03:38.620> called

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
right chilis contain a chemical called

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.970 
right chilis contain a chemical called
capsaicin<00:03:39.600> what<00:03:40.600> capsaicin<00:03:41.260> does<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.709> it

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
capsaicin what capsaicin does is it

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.010 
capsaicin what capsaicin does is it
stimulates<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.850> cells<00:03:43.180> on<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.450> inner<00:03:43.660> lining

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
stimulates the cells on the inner lining

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.870 
stimulates the cells on the inner lining
of<00:03:44.080> our<00:03:44.200> blood<00:03:44.410> vessels<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:45.459> secrete<00:03:45.760> a

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
of our blood vessels to secrete a

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.270 
of our blood vessels to secrete a
compound<00:03:46.360> called<00:03:46.480> nitric<00:03:46.870> oxide<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:48.040> then

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
compound called nitric oxide this then

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.040 
compound called nitric oxide this then
makes<00:03:48.490> the<00:03:48.700> muscles<00:03:49.180> in<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.540> blood<00:03:49.720> vessel

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
makes the muscles in the blood vessel

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.680 
makes the muscles in the blood vessel
walls<00:03:50.260> relax<00:03:51.010> as<00:03:51.459> they<00:03:51.730> relax<00:03:52.060> they<00:03:52.240> dilate

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
walls relax as they relax they dilate

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.870 
walls relax as they relax they dilate
the<00:03:52.930> vessel<00:03:53.680> gets<00:03:53.770> bigger<00:03:54.070> and<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.580> pressure

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
the vessel gets bigger and the pressure

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.850 
the vessel gets bigger and the pressure
within<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.450> goes<00:03:55.600> down<00:03:55.870> it's<00:03:56.260> amazing<00:03:56.530> isn't

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
within it goes down it's amazing isn't

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.670 
within it goes down it's amazing isn't
