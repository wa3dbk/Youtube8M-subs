00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello welcome on goal.com 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.980
 today I'm going to show you a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.320
 really mini stroller is called yoyo 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.370
 of sheba dozen then you they are they 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.390
 went besides his stroller or 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.160
 it's true it's there I 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.839
 had forgotten because not only 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.380
 it is compact but in addition it is 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:27.179
 light so here is a little this new 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.119
 net thrust that has existed for some 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.099
 time but good to gafi club hate 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.850
 just now we had already talked about it 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.790
 on our facebook page and so she 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.590
 so arrives in store today then 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.570
 7 inches is actually it's meant 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.440
 really nomadic people especially 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.960
 plane by train 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.300
 that's really handy because 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.930
 that you saw then between them 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.030
 go everywhere so we'll unfold it 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.030
 for one of the feet it's very simple 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.450
 you saw this little button just 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.050
 to press on to release the system 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.170
 is there just to dazzle at the 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.110
 gallery we're just going to take the little 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.010
 handle that is here and after it's done 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.640
 so fast easy to use I 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.720
 has already handled 2 3 x 2 kg ariane 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.950
 complicated so we have on this 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.950
 stroller an extension of hammocks by 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.020
 straps theme these one that helps 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.159
 to put a child from 6 months without 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.430
 problem inside 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.320
 okay so the chip is issued from a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.380
 part you 7 and some textile 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.150
 before textile is the gray part that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.830
 includes the hood and the chick 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.890
 okay so we'll have to count the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.320
 stroller 300 euros + 50 euros for the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.979
 textile kit so the stroller at 350 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.619
 euros in white base and soon 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.970
 will arrive a black base also on the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.160
 market 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.080
 so what can we say again about 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.140
 this stroller is a basket there is a 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.920
 walking foot there is an inclination so 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.090
 it's really a stroller that is 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.330
 made for many children apart from 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.930
 sure the newborns the little sense here 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.500
 if you want to come and see us right there 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.260
 will allow us to put back the hammock 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.990
 in sitting position and in the back we go 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.930
 see there is a small net that me 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.830
 seems to put a tutu a blanket or 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.670
 various things that we could not 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.650
 put in his pockets 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.950
 So here you have a little 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.660
 brake that cuts at the feet here that 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.310
 pretty simple in my basic sense 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.360
 it remains a brake on anything on the pushed 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.300
 we still have small 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.490
 suspension of agreement it's not it's not 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.190
 great but that's it we 're still 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.830
 all is really city and for 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.430
 going from one train to another from an airplane to 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.080
 the other 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.140
 so we do not need either 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.750
 suspensions super performing at this 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.150
 level there to fold it 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.090
 how it's going is very simple 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.500
 you have two buttons right here that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.019
 are red so we do not want to miss them 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.640
 okay so we'll clip and on like 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:32.340
 this and hop there ladoucette years 20 de 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.610
 come on the back he's just going 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.180
 now suffice to operate this 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.739
 red part there that you see here in 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.690
 repudiating the button that is right 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.989
 below like that and pulling towards you 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.140
 like that it's going to free the system 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:54.380
 we will simply take 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:56.970
 this chrome part agree to fold it 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.890
 once it's done we 'll never forget 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:07.160
 not so reactionary 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:09.290
 at that level on the bar the little one 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.120
 clip that will allow us precisely 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.090
 to have the stroller that does not get 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.540
 find meal so this game brings to 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.669
 the hand or so I have other bailiwick 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.540
 not necessarily I'm nomadic so 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.550
 necessarily I have a suitcase so I'm going 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.250
 take my little strap 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.880
 I go there clip is easily like 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.700
 this and I 'm going to put it on the shoulder 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.310
 that's good sorry I have a train to take 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.060
 so bye bye see you soon on goal.com 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.060
 ciao
