technology<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.870> transmission<00:00:37.620> that's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
technology we have a transmission that's

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.680 
technology we have a transmission that's
a<00:00:38.040> manual<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:38.820> controlled<00:00:39.120> by<00:00:39.210> computer

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
a manual but it's controlled by computer

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229 
a manual but it's controlled by computer
has<00:00:39.899> two<00:00:40.200> different<00:00:40.850> essentially<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.059> two

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
has two different essentially it's two

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.720 
has two different essentially it's two
transmissions<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.550> what<00:00:44.550> are<00:00:44.610> your

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
transmissions in one what are your

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.790 
transmissions in one what are your
thoughts<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.390> new<00:00:45.629> technology<00:00:46.230> coming

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
thoughts on that new technology coming

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
thoughts on that new technology coming
out<00:00:47.010> versus<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> traditional<00:00:48.719> good

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
out versus you know the traditional good

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.619 
out versus you know the traditional good
old<00:00:49.289> six-speed<00:00:50.039> manual<00:00:50.270> you<00:00:51.270> can't<00:00:51.480> argue

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
old six-speed manual you can't argue

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.790 
old six-speed manual you can't argue
with<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> dumb<00:00:51.989> booth<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.379> that's<00:00:52.559> where

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
with the dumb booth and that's where

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
with the dumb booth and that's where
they<00:00:52.920> come<00:00:53.039> down<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> talk<00:00:53.730> about<00:00:53.879> sheer<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
they come down to talk about sheer the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.700 
they come down to talk about sheer the
shift<00:00:54.780> time<00:00:55.020> there's<00:00:56.010> no<00:00:56.190> way<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.670> human

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.560 

today<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.280> throttle<00:01:02.850> matching<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.359> down

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
today with the throttle matching on down

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.050 
today with the throttle matching on down
shifts<00:01:04.460> everything<00:01:07.189> it<00:01:08.189> makes<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.460> hear<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
shifts everything it makes you hear you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.179 
shifts everything it makes you hear you
know<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.900> launch<00:01:10.110> control<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.770> with

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
know you with launch control and with

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.010 
know you with launch control and with
this<00:01:11.310> every<00:01:11.729> shift<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.030> perfect<00:01:12.420> but

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
this every shift is perfect but

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.219 
this every shift is perfect but
I<00:01:14.049> prefer<00:01:14.829> the<00:01:14.950> challenge<00:01:15.310> every<00:01:16.270> every<00:01:16.960> shift

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
I prefer the challenge every every shift

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.080 
I prefer the challenge every every shift
being<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.950> potential<00:01:18.460> risk<00:01:18.640> with<00:01:18.759> another

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
being the potential risk with another

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.830 
being the potential risk with another
mr.<00:01:19.390> shift<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:21.040> know<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.850> there's<00:01:22.600> this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
mr. shift you know and there's this

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.389 
mr. shift you know and there's this
something<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.350> be<00:01:23.439> said<00:01:23.649> for<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.280> know

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399

something to be said for the you know
the<00:01:24.939> first<00:01:25.240> time<00:01:25.509> you<00:01:25.780> really<00:01:26.200> nail<00:01:26.409> a

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
the first time you really nail a

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.590 
the first time you really nail a
downshift<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.189> really<00:01:27.880> figure<00:01:28.119> out<00:01:28.149> heel-toe

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
downshift and really figure out heel-toe

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.469 
downshift and really figure out heel-toe
and<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:28.930> took<00:01:29.049> me<00:01:29.259> you<00:01:30.009> know<00:01:30.039> years<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.360> took

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
and it took me you know years it took

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.070 
and it took me you know years it took
years<00:01:31.899> certificate<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.770> figure<00:01:33.070> that<00:01:33.189> out<00:01:33.340> and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
years certificate to figure that out and

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.070 
years certificate to figure that out and
it's<00:01:35.080> fun<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.470> go<00:01:35.590> from<00:01:35.920> six<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.030> first<00:01:37.210> you

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
it's fun to go from six the first you

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.880 
it's fun to go from six the first you
know<00:01:38.229> heel-toe<00:01:38.619> all<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.220> way<00:01:39.280> to<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.399> stop<00:01:39.670> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
know heel-toe all the way to a stop and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.950 
know heel-toe all the way to a stop and
the<00:01:41.890> TSG<00:01:42.369> they<00:01:43.060> all<00:01:43.179> they<00:01:43.299> all<00:01:43.330> make<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.720> very

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
the TSG they all they all make that very

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.889 
the TSG they all they all make that very
easy<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.500> do<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.939> thing<00:01:46.149> that<00:01:46.179> that<00:01:46.539> kills

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
easy to do and the thing that that kills

easy to do and the thing that that kills
me<00:01:47.049> of<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.229> new<00:01:47.319> 370<00:01:47.920> manual<00:01:48.670> transmission

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
me of the new 370 manual transmission

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.880 
me of the new 370 manual transmission
yet<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.600> can<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:49.899> automatic<00:01:50.500> from<00:01:50.740> oh

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
yet you can have automatic from oh

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.469 
yet you can have automatic from oh
that's<00:01:51.850> that's<00:01:52.209> so<00:01:52.509> sad<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.860> fine<00:01:54.069> automatic

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
that's that's so sad just fine automatic

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.520 
that's that's so sad just fine automatic

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
if you don't want to operate all three

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.160 
if you don't want to operate all three
pedals<00:01:56.679> yeah<00:01:57.250> yeah<00:01:58.030> just<00:01:58.659> get<00:01:58.810> one<00:01:58.929> with<00:01:59.080> two

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
pedals yeah yeah just get one with two

pedals yeah yeah just get one with two
yeah<00:01:59.500> yeah<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:01.500> understand<00:02:02.500> people<00:02:02.740> go<00:02:02.860> for<00:02:03.100> it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
yeah yeah I understand people go for it

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.499 
yeah yeah I understand people go for it
