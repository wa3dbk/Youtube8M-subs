00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.840
 Giresse for Tina the Coupe de France we will continue in the French language track 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.929
 with this time kara you know well 5arras 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:11.919
 it was good 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.189
 so that razor roofing minutia with which the team has nothing 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.379
 that's right 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.900
 so with its percentages define as a luxury mix what you can we 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.720
 to talk about it and who are the big days when it actually happens 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.790
 here services were specially formed for the Coupe de France 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.519
 with as everyone knows I think today of 500 what is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.859
 acquired 100% study express 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.460
 with the system that is in savoie wood nemes copy with different 

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:38.960
 chemicals a girl a young from the point of view of her class 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.890
 e 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.320
 which completes the same theme and is very good today 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.350
 with one match so far it was against canteen 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.380
 you have left well when it takes points away 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.120
 this is something and to feel your team still took over 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.340
 on how do you write 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.350
 Well, we did a great start in Europe 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.360
 we are reminded of a match that turned into computer I think by their 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.210
 parents who do not pay their experience for the time their hope in 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 common simply because his teammates that relatively stable 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.350
 today 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.630
 and it is true that the weakness of our mix was felt in this 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.600
 match% and it's true that on some strategic rhÃ´ne 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.810
 where the experience me jean veil could have made the difference and ben they knew 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.980
 to make a difference and we did not know how to do it 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.130
 so that these experts a good match to tender on both sides I think that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.160
 level style it was relatively close but I think europe their 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.060
 expansion it made me the difference 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.300
 you have planned to ditch anyway 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.260
 in the 17th will say it difficult good we knew we had the potential of the year and 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.180
 I want to say 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.510
 paris does not have the same I know that high we have quality we knew we 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 could win like losing and we played without pressure 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.200
 we lost we could not have 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.420
 maybe do better on mende do it 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.670
 we are not especially disappointed anyway we knew it was our 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.530
 most important match of the hen 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.119
 now we start when we surround ourselves with the same thing it's true 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.170
 what for our team 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.610
 but without this time it's his first phase of hens 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.040
 when it's real hard the comment for those who followed 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.040
 we wondered was he having pressure that plays without pressure 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.840
 in a mixer the problem is sometimes the agreement between the players 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.879
 can it go live in a match 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.270
 do you for the moment remain 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.329
 pretty good 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:13.669
 oud a few worries 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.759
 Nancy flying at the level of the atmosphere because no problem to defeat or not 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.849
 holiday the threat was very good there is no problem at this 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.519
 level I say we're not here to take the lead we're lying 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.979
 would not be in this situation there 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.949
 % so we take it really cool without pressure 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.439
 % ed with a prosthesis had a good time and especially no de 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.549
 fly away for a variety of reasons 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.650
 my state of mind 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.649
 what are the next two games there that you will play at 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.919
 so we were in our pool at a club playing with card 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.840
 so that during this cup of France 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.709
 the way of the players and so I think others here are cluttering us 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.910
 we are also a promising young team that is% and 4 m at the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.220
 level so when you know it's going to be a match to really take a 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.449
 very seriously 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.259
 and for 100 m to finish we have the shocks whiting teams of the site that 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.069
 we know very well with people that we think really well 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.359
 and with them also a lot of potential very good individual level so too 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.099
 with his two matches we know that these cups of France heart 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.689
 the force gives 200% to prevail 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.090
 it is clear and you have helped each other particularly 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.849
 mixers a piece of body in poland 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.030
 good it's true that our fingers it was not defined at the time of pardies 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.090
 that we have not been able to train for a very long time but 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.859
 it is true that for fifteen days three weeks we train properly 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.079
 regularly 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.230
 comcom to a filthy bassoues each member so what we are happy sivola 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.189
 than to come after the Coupe de France 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.669
 we took a cold snap I do not think that ares continue or drink the water 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.259
 will continue with new tablecloth 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.119
 people who listen loudly and retirees like curry with this 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:39.969
 agreement on the bonuses xpress precisely still the people of France 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.549
 it's not so that will continue to take over a new team and 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.609
 next 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.209
 we do not know exactly what it will give what is sure it is a guy 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.879
 will not continue like that 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.760
 and you personally have experienced great teams experienced mixed 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.589
 tonio in c is how did that 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.779
 it is true that today I have a busy working life 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.199
 so that the vote could have taken into account 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.149
 of the current scene of the current level it's true that this demand a lot of 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:08.099
 time a lot of concessions a lot of moves with players who 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.289
 jump and so on 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:11.769
 so I do not know I'm really wondering about my future 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.509
 maybe his last season at the highest level because otherwise it 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:15.499
 would not interest me 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:16.560
 e 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.590
 otherwise maybe really something happened 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.610
 fun with particular pals to me and really dedicated me to my life 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.599
 professional 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.710
 so maybe in 2006 2007 kara the return anyway 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.169
 it's possible it's not possible 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.969
 all of them today nothing is done he had defined but but that's 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.340
 also maybe conceivable 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.280
 ok thank you for all these answers good luck to you for them 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.810
 matches 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.159
 Thank you so much anyway 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.559
 and then he hopes that it will be good for you 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:41.899
 we plan to find in an upcoming video on team-aaa
