hi everyone I'd like to go over using
River<00:00:10.440> stones<00:00:11.990> for<00:00:12.990> sharpening<00:00:13.559> here<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.369> have

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
River stones for sharpening here I have

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.179 
River stones for sharpening here I have
my<00:00:14.879> Mora<00:00:15.209> that<00:00:15.719> I've<00:00:15.900> gone<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:17.180> made<00:00:18.180> dull<00:00:19.189> and

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
my Mora that I've gone and made dull and

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.390 
my Mora that I've gone and made dull and
we'll<00:00:20.519> notice<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.090> not<00:00:21.150> taken<00:00:21.869> hair<00:00:22.590> off<00:00:22.950> of

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
we'll notice it's not taken hair off of

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.840 
we'll notice it's not taken hair off of
my<00:00:23.550> leg

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.170 

okay<00:00:31.850> got<00:00:32.570> this<00:00:33.470> stone<00:00:33.860> it's<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:34.280> flattest<00:00:34.880> I

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
okay got this stone it's the flattest I

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.290 
okay got this stone it's the flattest I
could<00:00:35.630> find<00:00:35.920> running<00:00:36.920> my<00:00:37.040> finger<00:00:37.400> on<00:00:37.460> it<00:00:37.520> feels

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
could find running my finger on it feels

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.550 
could find running my finger on it feels
like<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.510> piece<00:00:38.780> of<00:00:38.900> glass<00:00:40.390> it<00:00:41.390> almost<00:00:41.930> seems

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
like a piece of glass it almost seems

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.020 
like a piece of glass it almost seems
flat<00:00:44.050> Heinie's<00:00:45.050> little<00:00:45.880> fraction<00:00:46.880> of<00:00:46.940> a

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
flat Heinie's little fraction of a

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.360 
flat Heinie's little fraction of a
millimeter<00:00:47.330> rise<00:00:48.080> there<00:00:49.540> right<00:00:50.540> there<00:00:51.370> that

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
millimeter rise there right there that

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.229 
millimeter rise there right there that
it<00:00:53.300> would<00:00:53.450> be<00:00:53.890> unrealistic<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.160> expect<00:00:55.370> a

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
it would be unrealistic to expect a

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.260 
it would be unrealistic to expect a
Riverstone<00:00:56.960> better<00:00:57.559> than<00:00:57.830> this<00:00:58.070> I<00:00:58.250> just<00:00:58.520> went

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
Riverstone better than this I just went

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.390 
Riverstone better than this I just went
out<00:00:59.360> looking<00:00:59.630> for<00:00:59.660> it<00:00:59.860> but<00:01:00.860> it's<00:01:01.070> got<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.250> nice

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
out looking for it but it's got a nice

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.670 
out looking for it but it's got a nice
flat<00:01:01.790> side<00:01:02.120> to<00:01:02.150> it<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.720> when<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:03.290> run<00:01:03.500> you

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
flat side to it and when you run you

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.900 
flat side to it and when you run you
know<00:01:04.250> I'm<00:01:04.309> over<00:01:04.460> it

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
know I'm over it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.480 
know I'm over it
your<00:01:05.480> finger<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:06.080> really<00:01:06.710> does<00:01:06.920> feel<00:01:07.280> like<00:01:07.310> a

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
your finger it really does feel like a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.630 
your finger it really does feel like a
piece<00:01:07.760> of<00:01:07.790> ceramic<00:01:08.360> or<00:01:08.480> glass<00:01:09.250> if<00:01:10.250> you've<00:01:10.400> been

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
piece of ceramic or glass if you've been

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.430 
piece of ceramic or glass if you've been
working<00:01:10.790> with<00:01:11.740> traditional<00:01:14.440> sharpening

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
working with traditional sharpening

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.500 
working with traditional sharpening
stones<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.610> should<00:01:16.790> be<00:01:16.940> able<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.150> tell<00:01:17.360> by

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
stones you should be able to tell by

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.770 
stones you should be able to tell by
field<00:01:18.040> that<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.250> really<00:01:19.730> super<00:01:20.330> high<00:01:20.510> grit

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
field that the really super high grit

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.810 
field that the really super high grit
ones<00:01:20.990> feel<00:01:21.890> smooth<00:01:22.280> not<00:01:22.970> rough<00:01:23.500> so<00:01:24.820> they've

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
ones feel smooth not rough so they've

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.420 
ones feel smooth not rough so they've
established<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:26.510> it's<00:01:26.950> blunt<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.280> not

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
established that it's blunt it's not

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.030 
established that it's blunt it's not
really<00:01:28.670> taken

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
really taken

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.230 
really taken
so<00:01:31.850> let's<00:01:32.810> sharpen<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.760> needs<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:34.880> bit<00:01:35.060> more

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
so let's sharpen it needs a bit more

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:52.170 
so let's sharpen it needs a bit more
stability

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.290 

now<00:01:52.750> granted<00:01:53.380> this<00:01:53.650> knife<00:01:54.010> was<00:01:54.310> not<00:01:54.580> super

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
now granted this knife was not super

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.050 
now granted this knife was not super
dull<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.590> he's<00:01:56.800> probably<00:01:57.100> would<00:01:57.670> do<00:01:57.880> all

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
dull and he's probably would do all

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.180 
dull and he's probably would do all
right<00:01:58.300> with<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.540> paper<00:01:58.810> test<00:01:59.260> if<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.770> actually

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
right with the paper test if I actually

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.650 
right with the paper test if I actually
had<00:02:00.490> paper<00:02:01.240> out<00:02:01.510> here<00:02:01.720> with<00:02:01.960> me<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:03.430> I<00:02:03.730> didn't

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
had paper out here with me but I didn't

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.150 
had paper out here with me but I didn't
bring<00:02:04.840> any<00:02:05.050> so<00:02:05.470> we'll<00:02:06.010> just<00:02:06.220> have<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.580> go<00:02:07.240> by<00:02:07.480> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
bring any so we'll just have to go by a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.870 
bring any so we'll just have to go by a
scale<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.960> how<00:02:10.960> well<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.290> takes<00:02:14.580> hand<00:02:15.580> I've<00:02:15.700> got

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
scale of how well it takes hand I've got

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.360 
scale of how well it takes hand I've got
sunscreen<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.540> my<00:02:16.690> eyes<00:02:16.870> yay<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.030> my

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.240 

wanna<00:02:24.000> take<00:02:24.299> it<00:02:24.780> whoa<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.680> steady<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:28.250> want

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
wanna take it whoa and steady just want

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.420 
wanna take it whoa and steady just want
to<00:02:29.510> take<00:02:30.510> our<00:02:30.720> time<00:02:30.750> not<00:02:31.379> really<00:02:31.709> rush<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:34.430> be

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
to take our time not really rush it be

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.330 
to take our time not really rush it be
controlled<00:02:35.909> in<00:02:36.510> our<00:02:36.750> motions

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.220 

and<00:02:44.819> when<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.209> are<00:02:45.239> sharpening<00:02:45.630> like<00:02:46.050> this

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
and when you are sharpening like this

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.490 
and when you are sharpening like this
you<00:02:46.410> can<00:02:46.590> feel<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.640> imperfection<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.840> can't

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
you can feel the imperfection you can't

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.520 
you can feel the imperfection you can't
really<00:02:49.770> see<00:02:50.459> them<00:02:50.700> there's<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.540> tiny<00:02:52.140> little

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
really see them there's a tiny little

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.729 
really see them there's a tiny little
vibration<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.670> your<00:02:53.730> knife<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:55.200> can<00:02:55.380> tell

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
vibration in your knife you can tell

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.100 
vibration in your knife you can tell
that's<00:02:56.160> wrong<00:02:56.520> where<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.270> not<00:02:57.540> perfectly

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that's wrong where it's not perfectly

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.050 
that's wrong where it's not perfectly
flat<00:03:00.650> which<00:03:01.650> really<00:03:02.010> enforces<00:03:02.550> why<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.790> want

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
flat which really enforces why you want

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.020 
flat which really enforces why you want
to<00:03:03.150> move<00:03:03.330> away<00:03:03.569> from<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.500> edge<00:03:05.030> sharpening

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
to move away from the edge sharpening

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.190 
to move away from the edge sharpening
with<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:07.190> bound<00:03:08.190> River<00:03:08.519> State<00:03:08.760> going<00:03:09.630> forwards

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
with a bound River State going forwards

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.250 
with a bound River State going forwards
is<00:03:10.860> great<00:03:11.310> for<00:03:11.580> removing<00:03:12.000> material<00:03:12.450> at<00:03:13.110> this

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
is great for removing material at this

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.040 
is great for removing material at this
point<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.769> are<00:03:13.920> polishing<00:03:14.269> it<00:03:15.269> was<00:03:15.420> super<00:03:15.810> doll

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
point we are polishing it was super doll

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.630 
point we are polishing it was super doll
I'd<00:03:16.260> probably<00:03:16.470> be<00:03:16.680> going<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:17.250> way<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.549> try

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
I'd probably be going that way to try

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.940 
I'd probably be going that way to try
and<00:03:17.970> remove<00:03:18.600> more<00:03:18.870> material<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.500> get<00:03:19.620> down<00:03:19.799> to

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950

alright this stick will do knock off the
bed<00:03:57.380> now<00:03:58.380> let's<00:03:59.160> see<00:03:59.370> how<00:03:59.520> much<00:03:59.640> of

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
bed now let's see how much of

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.200 
bed now let's see how much of
improvement<00:04:00.330> we<00:04:00.450> have

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:17.680 

oh<00:04:06.880> yeah

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.520 

yeah<00:04:18.410> not<00:04:19.480> not<00:04:20.480> super<00:04:21.019> sharp

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.730 

but<00:04:24.190> as<00:04:24.340> really<00:04:24.970> is<00:04:25.060> removing<00:04:25.510> half<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.560> what

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
but as really is removing half so what

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.590 
but as really is removing half so what
we<00:04:26.860> normally<00:04:27.010> do<00:04:27.310> when<00:04:27.490> we've<00:04:27.670> polished<00:04:28.300> the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
we normally do when we've polished the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.690 
we normally do when we've polished the
edge<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.960> knocked<00:04:29.320> off<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.620> best<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.160> it's

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
edge and knocked off the best and it's

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.520 
edge and knocked off the best and it's
taking<00:04:31.330> hair<00:04:31.540> reasonably

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
taking hair reasonably

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.960 
taking hair reasonably
yep<00:04:33.430> we<00:04:34.000> stop<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:35.560> for<00:04:35.800> me<00:04:35.920> that's<00:04:36.370> gonna

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
yep we stop it and for me that's gonna

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:47.850 
yep we stop it and for me that's gonna
be<00:04:37.150> my<00:04:37.420> belt

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.890 

all<00:04:48.370> right<00:04:48.520> I've<00:04:48.850> had<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.210> switch<00:04:49.510> to<00:04:49.540> the

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
all right I've had to switch to the

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.140 
all right I've had to switch to the
other<00:04:49.930> round<00:04:50.290> because<00:04:50.620> well<00:04:50.920> just<00:04:51.730> bring<00:04:51.850> out

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
other round because well just bring out

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.740 
other round because well just bring out
hair<00:04:52.390> but

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.320 

it's<00:04:58.410> just<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:58.830> bit<00:04:59.070> tricky<00:04:59.460> for<00:04:59.490> me<00:04:59.670> to<00:04:59.880> do<00:05:00.210> it

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
it's just a bit tricky for me to do it

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.720 
it's just a bit tricky for me to do it
like<00:05:00.480> this<00:05:00.600> because<00:05:00.990> I'm<00:05:01.170> right-handed<00:05:02.100> but

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
like this because I'm right-handed but

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.930 
like this because I'm right-handed but
that<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.680> so<00:05:04.680> much<00:05:04.920> sharper<00:05:05.190> now<00:05:05.520> that's<00:05:05.730> been

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
that is so much sharper now that's been

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.020 
that is so much sharper now that's been
stopped<00:05:06.300> it's<00:05:06.510> just<00:05:08.870> yeah<00:05:10.460> lovely<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:11.760> sharp

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
stopped it's just yeah lovely and sharp

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.530 
stopped it's just yeah lovely and sharp
so<00:05:12.840> there<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.110> have<00:05:13.140> it<00:05:13.470> a<00:05:13.680> knife<00:05:14.540> sharpened

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
so there you have it a knife sharpened

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.270 
so there you have it a knife sharpened
or<00:05:15.720> at<00:05:16.020> least<00:05:16.400> honed<00:05:17.600> with<00:05:18.600> a<00:05:18.960> reverse<00:05:19.890> danger

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
or at least honed with a reverse danger

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.920 
or at least honed with a reverse danger
to<00:05:21.000> be<00:05:21.090> honest<00:05:21.390> yeah<00:05:22.200> we<00:05:22.380> got<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:22.710> sort<00:05:23.100> of<00:05:23.220> once

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
to be honest yeah we got it sort of once

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.270 
to be honest yeah we got it sort of once
we<00:05:24.930> got<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.230> down<00:05:25.410> to<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.740> point<00:05:25.860> where<00:05:26.010> it<00:05:26.160> was

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
we got it down to the point where it was

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.600 
we got it down to the point where it was
no<00:05:26.550> longer<00:05:26.850> taking<00:05:27.600> hair<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:29.420> made<00:05:30.420> it<00:05:30.630> blunt

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
no longer taking hair I made it blunt

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.870 
no longer taking hair I made it blunt
but<00:05:32.610> by<00:05:32.910> finding<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.990> flattest<00:05:34.880> smoothest

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
but by finding the flattest smoothest

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.190 
but by finding the flattest smoothest
stone<00:05:36.300> we<00:05:36.510> could<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:37.310> being<00:05:38.310> very<00:05:39.200> precise

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
stone we could and being very precise

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.970 
stone we could and being very precise
with<00:05:40.410> our<00:05:40.560> motion<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:42.020> being<00:05:43.020> very<00:05:43.560> precise

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
with our motion and being very precise

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.830 
with our motion and being very precise
with<00:05:44.280> our<00:05:44.490> method<00:05:45.030> and<00:05:45.470> sharpening<00:05:46.470> away<00:05:47.840> from

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
with our method and sharpening away from

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.190 
with our method and sharpening away from
the<00:05:49.020> edge<00:05:49.110> opposed<00:05:49.590> to<00:05:49.770> into<00:05:50.190> it<00:05:50.960> we<00:05:51.960> were<00:05:52.140> able

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
the edge opposed to into it we were able

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.770 
the edge opposed to into it we were able
to<00:05:52.710> sharpen<00:05:53.370> this<00:05:53.700> back<00:05:54.060> up<00:05:54.300> to<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:54.540> point

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
to sharpen this back up to the point

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.190 
to sharpen this back up to the point
where<00:05:54.930> now<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.260> is<00:05:55.410> taking<00:05:56.310> hair<00:05:56.520> very<00:05:56.970> well

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
where now it is taking hair very well

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.620 
where now it is taking hair very well
which<00:05:58.200> is<00:05:58.230> the<00:05:58.980> level<00:05:59.310> of<00:05:59.370> sharpness<00:05:59.700> I<00:06:00.060> like

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630
