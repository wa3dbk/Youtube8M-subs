do<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.290> make<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.280> loop<00:02:46.440> you're<00:02:47.440> going<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.650> push

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
do and make a loop you're going to push

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.600 
do and make a loop you're going to push
this<00:02:47.830> through<00:02:49.710> just<00:02:50.710> like<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.040> basic

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
this through just like that basic

actually really easy all right you're
going<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.580> take<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.660> long<00:02:59.380> end<00:02:59.700> push<00:03:00.700> it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
going to take the long end push it

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.020 
going to take the long end push it
through<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.240> slip<00:03:01.480> knot<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:03.190> pull<00:03:04.770> all<00:03:05.770> right

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
through the slip knot and pull all right

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.590 
through the slip knot and pull all right
bring<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.180> down<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.570> little<00:03:07.660> bit<00:03:09.360> push<00:03:10.360> it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
bring that down a little bit push it

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
through the slip knot and pull push it a

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.630 
through the slip knot and pull push it a
slip<00:03:18.610> knot<00:03:19.950> tighten<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:22.140> push<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.170> through<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
slip knot tighten it push it through the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.229 
slip knot tighten it push it through the
little<00:03:24.880> loop<00:03:25.590> tighten<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.970> push<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.000> through

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
little loop tighten it push it through

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.560 
little loop tighten it push it through
the<00:03:28.300> loop<00:03:28.450> again<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:29.260> tighten<00:03:29.770> it<00:03:29.860> all<00:03:30.570> right

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
the loop again and tighten it all right

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.050 
the loop again and tighten it all right
so<00:03:31.780> I'm<00:03:32.080> going<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.100> get<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.310> couple<00:03:33.880> more<00:03:34.000> of

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
so I'm going to get a couple more of

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:44.039 
so I'm going to get a couple more of
these<00:03:34.209> done<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:36.010> will<00:03:36.190> show<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.430> how<00:03:43.049> easy

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
these done and I will show you how easy

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.759 
these done and I will show you how easy
it<00:03:44.620> can<00:03:44.680> be<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.959> basic<00:03:47.260> brain<00:03:47.470> for

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
it can be that is the basic brain for

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.759 
it can be that is the basic brain for
the<00:03:47.890> belt<00:03:48.900> okay<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.170> then<00:03:50.350> when<00:03:50.530> you're<00:03:50.680> at

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
the belt okay and then when you're at

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.870 
the belt okay and then when you're at
the<00:03:50.830> end<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:52.630> cut<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.019> off<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:54.430> push<00:03:54.700> the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
the end you cut it off you push the

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.590 
the end you cut it off you push the
cable<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.920> paracord<00:03:56.920> through<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.489> just

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
cable the paracord through and just

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.880 
cable the paracord through and just
tighten<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.810> up<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.320> will<00:03:59.440> tighten<00:03:59.650> on

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
tighten it up and it will tighten on

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.300 
tighten it up and it will tighten on
itself<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.510> you'll<00:04:01.750> cut<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.049> off<00:04:02.170> here<00:04:02.530> and

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
itself so you'll cut it off here and

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.539 
itself so you'll cut it off here and
you'll<00:04:03.459> pull<00:04:03.640> it<00:04:03.760> through<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:05.190> tighten<00:04:06.190> and

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
you'll pull it through and tighten and

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.490 
you'll pull it through and tighten and
it'll<00:04:07.030> be<00:04:07.150> done<00:04:07.330> you<00:04:07.840> can<00:04:07.989> do<00:04:08.110> this<00:04:08.230> for

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
to all right so you're going to make a

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.070 
to all right so you're going to make a
big<00:05:00.200> loop<00:05:01.210> alright<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.420> then<00:05:02.900> you're<00:05:03.050> just

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
big loop alright and then you're just

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.120 
big loop alright and then you're just
going<00:05:03.290> to<00:05:03.380> push<00:05:03.620> this<00:05:05.140> through<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.260> loop<00:05:09.130> just

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
going to push this through the loop just
