00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.820 
and came back to life i remember in my
studio<00:01:06.399> in<00:01:06.700> in<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.600> workshop<00:01:08.200> area<00:01:08.380> were<00:01:08.560> kept

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
studio in in the workshop area were kept

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.020 
studio in in the workshop area were kept
the<00:01:08.920> tools<00:01:09.130> if<00:01:09.460> I'd<00:01:09.550> ever<00:01:09.640> there<00:01:09.880> was<00:01:09.970> a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
the tools if I'd ever there was a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.700 
the tools if I'd ever there was a
fluorescent<00:01:10.630> light<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.020> I<00:01:11.410> remember

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
fluorescent light and I remember

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.200 
fluorescent light and I remember
whenever<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:12.040> plug<00:01:12.310> their<00:01:12.490> fluorescent<00:01:13.060> light

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
whenever I plug their fluorescent light

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.820 
whenever I plug their fluorescent light
in<00:01:13.420> i<00:01:13.600> turn<00:01:13.810> on<00:01:13.840> it<00:01:14.500> would<00:01:14.890> go<00:01:16.140> boom<00:01:17.140> you<00:01:17.680> know

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
in i turn on it would go boom you know

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.870 
in i turn on it would go boom you know
and<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:18.910> thought<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:20.560> I<00:01:20.680> put<00:01:20.950> those<00:01:21.460> fluorescent

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
and I thought if I put those fluorescent

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.529 
and I thought if I put those fluorescent
lights<00:01:22.240> inside<00:01:22.600> it'll<00:01:23.530> have<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:25.180> kind

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
lights inside it'll have this this kind

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.330 
lights inside it'll have this this kind
of<00:01:25.570> awakening<00:01:26.170> feeling<00:01:26.560> at<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.890> same<00:01:27.070> time<00:01:27.190> it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
of awakening feeling at the same time it

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.830 
of awakening feeling at the same time it
almost<00:01:27.520> looks<00:01:27.729> like<00:01:27.790> distant<00:01:28.270> Thunder<00:01:28.690> or

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
almost looks like distant Thunder or

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.770 
almost looks like distant Thunder or
something<00:01:29.170> like<00:01:29.229> that<00:01:29.290> so<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:31.270> way<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.570> piece

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
something like that so the way the piece

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.570 
something like that so the way the piece
shuts<00:01:32.110> off<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.530> shuts<00:01:32.770> off<00:01:32.950> pretty<00:01:33.220> quickly

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
shuts off it shuts off pretty quickly

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.670 
shuts off it shuts off pretty quickly
but<00:01:34.390> when<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.659> starts<00:01:34.690> up<00:01:35.020> again<00:01:35.170> it's<00:01:35.500> that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
but when it starts up again it's that

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.740 
but when it starts up again it's that
it's<00:01:36.490> this<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:36.970> has<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.299> kind<00:01:37.510> of<00:01:37.600> like

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
it's this it has this kind of like

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.830 
it's this it has this kind of like
awakening<00:01:38.409> feeling<00:01:38.799> and<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.430> drums<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:40.630> takes

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
awakening feeling and the drums it takes

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.570

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
a while for the drums to crank up to

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.190 
a while for the drums to crank up to
full<00:01:42.790> speed<00:01:42.850> things<00:01:43.510> a<00:01:43.600> good<00:01:43.780> it's<00:01:44.110> a

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
full speed things a good it's a

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.830 
full speed things a good it's a
destruction<00:01:44.590> somehow<00:01:45.220> dear<00:01:45.790> possibility<00:01:46.750> of

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
destruction somehow dear possibility of

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.990 
destruction somehow dear possibility of

looking<00:02:06.140> at<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.649> thought<00:02:06.829> this<00:02:07.009> is<00:02:07.189> probably

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
looking at it I thought this is probably

these<00:02:08.509> three<00:02:08.840> drums<00:02:09.110> are<00:02:09.289> probably<00:02:09.530> what<00:02:09.679> God

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
these three drums are probably what God

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.449 
these three drums are probably what God
looks<00:02:09.920> like<00:02:10.310> he<00:02:11.470> could<00:02:12.470> died<00:02:12.709> with<00:02:13.040> him<00:02:13.220> there

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
looks like he could died with him there

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:23.710 
looks like he could died with him there
is

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720
