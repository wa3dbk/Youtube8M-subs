00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.009
 if you go read medieval warefare the 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.019
 fun game that has already become 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.250
 in all a success on the pcd platform in 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.710
 I now jump into the world of 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.630
 videoconsoles being the xbox 360 the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.279
 first to have a conversion that 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.650
 has seen the light in digital format 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.419
 through xbox live being provided that 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.020
 will soon be released also for 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.020
 Playstation 3 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.260
 I was looking for 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.030
 in case some of you have not yet 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.530
 you know, we tell you that it is a 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 online multiplayer action game 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850
 set in the middle ages something that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 far from being anecdotal, it affects the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.600
 gameplay since unlike 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.340
 Other titles of the combat genre 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.230
 against the other players is carried 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.800
 out mainly in clashes 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.800
 body to body 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.360
 for this the game has two sides 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.310
 the agate knights and the order of 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.229
 neixÃ³n being able to choose in both cases 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.360
 between four kinds of characters with 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.340
 those that play the same as we saw in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.290
 the pc version is archers 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.479
 soldiers- vanguards and knights 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.340
 differentiating themselves so much for their 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.409
 speed as per the forces of their 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.350
 armor in addition to having weapons 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.360
 own encompassed in several types by 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.549
 give an example we will have the short 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.039
 and half distance like swords spears and 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.020
 maces thrown like knives and 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.450
 Axes or long-range weapons 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.700
 as bows crossbows and catalina adding 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.229
 among them about 60 weapons 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.679
 different with which to be able 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.679
 match us 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.460
 in this sense I was saying that the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.440
 control of the characters is a little more 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.180
 complex of what we could imagine in 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.680
 a principle requiring something of 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.080
 practice when you get to master it 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.090
 we have several types of lunges 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.800
 and a resistance bar resulting 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.810
 as important to attack as to know 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.880
 block at the exact moment being 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.590
 even possible reality stores for 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.390
 deceive the adversary by what the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.580
 confrontations have a certain 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.350
 tactical component we have to indicate 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.209
 in this same sense that although what 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.010
 normal is to play always controlling the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.690
 character in the first person the game 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.340
 It also gives us the option to change in 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.820
 any time at a third glance 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.820
 person 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.150
 although without a doubt one of the 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.739
 most striking peculiarities of 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.569
 combat system is that always the 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.519
 fire friend which implies that at the time 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.349
 to use our weapons we should have 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.900
 very careful not to harm our 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.819
 own teammates this is 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.650
 something that is not always easy 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.810
 when we are in the middle of a scuffle 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.299
 next to several players brandishing their 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.099
 swords even though that is precisely one 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.989
 of the funniest elements of the 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.000
 game that in more than one occasion will give 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.000
 place to quite ionic situations 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.280
 already passing the chapter of the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.690
 possibilities all the protagonism is 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.519
 focuses of course on the modes 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.190
 multiplayer online which are 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.200
 they divide in several modalities the majority 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.480
 of these are the classic ones in this 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.519
 kind of titles more exactly we have 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.650
 team duel team duel 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.870
 all against all one his last man in 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.730
 foot capture the flag and duel having 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.780
 in addition a considerable variety of 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.780
 maps to play 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.410
 however at this point the 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.090
 element has also disappointed them is 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.040
 the fact that while I started it 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.980
 allowed games of up to a maximum of 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.590
 32 players in this xbox conversion of 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.630
 60 the figure has been reduced to only 12 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.700
 what makes the games not result 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.520
 as epic as the original game where 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.750
 come on let's see real battles 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.880
 multitudinal ones staying now the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.350
 confrontations in simple skirmishes 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.350
 of a few units 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.370
 otherwise we also tell you that 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.720
 together the multiplayer modes of the game 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.550
 offers us the possibility of 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.620
 freely customize the clothes 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.020
 of our character or even play 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.000
 battles the single player mode since 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.530
 it is possible to create games using goals 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.240
 controlled by intelligence 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.770
 artificial to what you have to add a 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.600
 training mode where we can 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.060
 learn all the skills of the 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.680
 characters its development is quite 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.210
 curious since this places us in a 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.070
 camp where they will leave us 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.060
 teaching the key aspects of the 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.060
 game mechanics 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.840
 and before concluding we do not forget to 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.520
 talk about the technical section dealing with 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.229
 just like I started from a title of a 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.539
 fairly discrete level for the times 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.160
 present something that is noticeable especially in 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.710
 the quality of textures and 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.060
 animations of the characters although 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.680
 we could say that it meets the 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.419
 perfection considering that 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.400
 we are facing a low-cost game 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.530
 intended for digital download which 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.539
 also started originally as a 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.430
 way to gauge all under the name of 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.430
 activating and turning made with 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.050
 possibility in an independent title 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.090
 undoubtedly the most striking of his laying 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.310
 on stage is the rawness of the fighting 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.930
 since these are very visceral being able 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.060
 see things like after a lunge 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.250
 accurate of an enemy lose an arm or 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.199
 even that his head comes rolling to the 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.330
 time the characters' clothes are 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.580
 stain red splashed with blood 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.320
 being faithfully reflected all the 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.909
 brutality that you would expect from the 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.909
 fierce battles of the middle ages 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.279
 in short take it and medieval warfare 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:13.199
 for xbox 360 is a game that like 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.300
 that already happened I started with a great 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.459
 support fresh air and originality 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.259
 multiplayer genre in the case of a 

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:21.179
 title first of all very fun and that 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.949
 thanks to its great variety of maps and 

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:25.499
 game modes can keep us 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.229
 hooked a good season besides 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:30.389
 its reduced price of only 14 with 95 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:33.589
 euros in xbox live makes it look 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.589
 doubly attractive 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.020
 although unfortunately on the side 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.910
 negative we have to say that this 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.530
 adaptation is very tarnished by the 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.510
 quiet reduction in the number of 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.160
 players something that causes the 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.780
 gaming experience will suffer 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.970
 quite and it does not reach the height of 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.190
 fish version which continues to be 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.660
 much more advisable either we can 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.150
 obviate the fact that the game has 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.460
 come to xbox 360 right now that the 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.770
 console is finalizing its cycle what 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.970
 can make it happen too 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.890
 unnoticed for users who already 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.520
 have made the leap to platforms 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.520
 new generation 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:11.149
 listen out 

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:16.189
 with shadows 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.840
 it no longer exploded
