which<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.110> actually<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.530> loop<00:01:22.830> knot<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.670> can

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
which is actually a loop knot so you can

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.280 
which is actually a loop knot so you can
use<00:01:24.000> any<00:01:24.150> type<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.390> loop<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.140> know

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
use any type of loop not that you know

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.080 
use any type of loop not that you know
when<00:01:25.620> I<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.010> rather<00:01:26.250> ice<00:01:26.520> fishing<00:01:26.940> or

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
when I do this rather ice fishing or

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.480 
when I do this rather ice fishing or
open<00:01:27.450> water<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> reason<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.160> want<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
open water the reason you want the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.550 
open water the reason you want the
freedom<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.940> motion<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.260> it<00:01:31.350> does

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
freedom of motion is so that it does

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.350 
freedom of motion is so that it does
give<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.160> natural<00:01:32.670> presentation

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
give it a more natural presentation

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.640 
give it a more natural presentation
especially<00:01:33.780> when<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.990> has<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.320> freefall

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
especially when it has this freefall

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.900 
especially when it has this freefall
action<00:01:37.160> when<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:38.280> important<00:01:38.759> features

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
action when the important features

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.370 
action when the important features
though<00:01:39.330> is<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.509> make<00:01:39.750> sure<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
though is to make sure that you have a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.340 
though is to make sure that you have a
very<00:01:40.530> sensitive<00:01:41.310> float<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
very sensitive float and then you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.469 
very sensitive float and then you
balance<00:01:43.800> it<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> top<00:01:45.450> part

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
balance it so that just the top part

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.480 
balance it so that just the top part
sticks<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.830> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.070> get<00:01:47.160> a<00:01:47.220> lift

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
sticks out so that you can get a lift

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.910 
sticks out so that you can get a lift
bite<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:48.090> an<00:01:48.540> all-out<00:01:48.720> go<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.410> you<00:01:49.530> take<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
bite or an all-out go when you take it

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
bite or an all-out go when you take it
bike<00:01:54.920> because<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:56.160> that's<00:01:56.369> falling<00:01:56.790> down<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
bike because as that's falling down and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.900 
bike because as that's falling down and
if<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.900> going<00:01:58.110> down<00:01:58.320> natural<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.670> when

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
if it's going down natural that's when

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.860 
if it's going down natural that's when
the<00:02:00.030> fish<00:02:00.210> already<00:02:00.390> go<00:02:00.720> for<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
the fish already go for it
