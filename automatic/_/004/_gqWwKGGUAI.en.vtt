place<00:01:08.729> back<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.360> slider<00:01:09.900> back<00:01:10.140> in

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
place back in and slider back in

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770 
place back in and slider back in
position<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> humidity<00:01:11.939> sensor<00:01:12.479> here

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
position it's on a humidity sensor here

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.539 
position it's on a humidity sensor here
so<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.560> make<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:13.950> humid

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so you can actually make it more humid

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.370 
so you can actually make it more humid
or<00:01:14.909> less<00:01:15.180> humid<00:01:15.479> depending<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.900> your<00:01:16.020> food<00:01:16.229> and

veggies<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.009> stops<00:01:17.909> them<00:01:18.090> from<00:01:18.270> drying

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
veggies in there stops them from drying

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.480 
veggies in there stops them from drying
out<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> control<00:01:20.040> panel<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
out with the control panel it is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.670 
out with the control panel it is
electronic<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.500> actually

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
electronic so up here we can actually

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.460 
electronic so up here we can actually
select<00:01:22.979> fridge<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.030> freezer<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.140> hit<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
select fridge and freezer and we hit the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.469 
select fridge and freezer and we hit the
plus<00:01:25.710> or<00:01:25.890> minus<00:01:26.280> key<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.970> change<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
plus or minus key to change the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.240 
plus or minus key to change the
temperature<00:01:27.990> between<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.470> two<00:01:28.680> sections<00:01:29.009> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
temperature between the two sections so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
temperature between the two sections so
they're<00:01:29.490> independently<00:01:30.030> controlled<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:31.259> have

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
they're independently controlled we have

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.370 
they're independently controlled we have
a<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.740> alarm<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:32.939> door<00:01:33.180> alarm<00:01:33.509> yes

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
a little alarm here for door alarm yes

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.899
