00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.770
 so hey people already welcome to one 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.569
 new video then everything decisive 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.210
 I'll match the back here and today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.519
 some news about Battlefield 4 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.170
 and there is already the official one 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.440
 releasedatum so that really 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.490
 officially officially 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.770
 was announced on the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.660
 page that you see here in the background 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.330
 Accordingly, the game will battlefield 4 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.470
 towards the end of the month speaks 31 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.539
 October 2013 will be available in stores 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.160
 if you put the whole of the usa 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.630
 you probably have that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.059
 even on the 29th 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.950
 in the hand that should be at least that way 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.170
 because on Tuesdays are usually 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.370
 all new release published and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.469
 it probably will be like that too 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.660
 again brad pitt her since we now 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.550
 yes the official release date 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.680
 to have battlefield 4 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.399
 probably the beta already in the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.140
 september 2013 he sees said against 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.969
 end of the month why am I that way 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.620
 I'm sure I can tell you soon 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.090
 the alpha to battlefield 4 us 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.480
 probably at some point against 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.100
 published in late July 2013 and now 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.350
 again briefly on the subject of why I back 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.299
 I'm sure about that and go ahead 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.460
 Battlefield 4 about the same 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.930
 same developments as it 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.060
 Battlefield 3 has already done that 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.250
 means we have the release again against 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.229
 a month later at the end of the year 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.000
 we probably the beta and three 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.070
 models before the release we see the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.140
 alpha was about that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.549
 battlefield 3 that means you can 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.500
 we already at battlefield 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.479
 Imagine again 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.159
 Personally, I am looking forward to it 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.780
 which four after we already have one 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.939
 bit of singleplayer gameplay seen 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.530
 I'm all the more looking forward to that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.540
 multiplayer gameplay hopefully 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.189
 soon to be published in the near future 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.110
 and if you are up to date 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.909
 want to stay what begged 4 and others 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.159

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.880
