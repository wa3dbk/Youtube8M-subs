if<00:05:40.059> a<00:05:40.479> speed<00:05:40.779> crits<00:05:41.169> and<00:05:41.469> we<00:05:41.679> win<00:05:41.949> like<00:05:42.429> that's

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:42.879 
if a speed crits and we win like that's

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.159 
if a speed crits and we win like that's
that's<00:05:43.149> the<00:05:43.360> only<00:05:43.479> way<00:05:43.599> we<00:05:43.719> can<00:05:43.809> win<00:05:43.990> I<00:05:44.050> think

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
that's the only way we can win I think

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.290 
that's the only way we can win I think
no<00:05:44.889> I<00:05:44.919> don't<00:05:45.159> think<00:05:45.189> it<00:05:45.339> has<00:05:45.459> to<00:05:45.490> crit<00:05:45.849> Pikachu

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
no I don't think it has to crit Pikachu

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.049 
no I don't think it has to crit Pikachu
strong<00:05:47.069> after<00:05:48.069> life<00:05:48.249> together<00:05:48.459> absolutely

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:49.059 
strong after life together absolutely

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.230 
strong after life together absolutely
nothing<00:05:49.419> this<00:05:50.259> yeah<00:05:50.559> well<00:05:51.129> that's<00:05:51.279> leptin

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
nothing this yeah well that's leptin

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.559 
nothing this yeah well that's leptin
like<00:05:52.539> it's<00:05:52.809> a<00:05:52.899> bit<00:05:53.110> real<00:05:54.089> if<00:05:55.089> that<00:05:55.300> created

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
like it's a bit real if that created

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:56.999 
like it's a bit real if that created
acted<00:05:55.839> that<00:05:55.929> much<00:05:56.110> of<00:05:56.229> its<00:05:56.349> stamina<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:56.979> a

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
acted that much of its stamina the a

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.999 
acted that much of its stamina the a
speeds<00:05:57.399> given<00:05:57.669> to<00:05:58.229> but<00:05:59.229> Pikachu's<00:05:59.679> got<00:05:59.860> like

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
speeds given to but Pikachu's got like

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.909 
speeds given to but Pikachu's got like
30<00:06:00.759> times<00:06:01.089> the<00:06:01.360> attack<00:06:01.719> but<00:06:02.559> it's<00:06:02.740> our<00:06:02.889> best

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
30 times the attack but it's our best

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.799 
30 times the attack but it's our best
but<00:06:03.189> I<00:06:03.339> think<00:06:03.580> we<00:06:03.699> might<00:06:03.909> need<00:06:04.029> to<00:06:04.089> crit<00:06:04.419> but

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:04.809 
but I think we might need to crit but

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:12.320 
but I think we might need to crit but
we'll<00:06:05.409> say<00:06:05.649> let's<00:06:06.369> just<00:06:07.499> no<00:06:08.669> one<00:06:09.669> with<00:06:09.939> a<00:06:09.969> grid

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
we'll say let's just no one with a grid

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.639 
we'll say let's just no one with a grid
take<00:06:13.330> care<00:06:13.539> of<00:06:13.629> them<00:06:13.719> so<00:06:13.899> broad<00:06:14.169> I<00:06:14.259> pick<00:06:14.439> it<00:06:14.529> you

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:14.649 
take care of them so broad I pick it you

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:16.320 
take care of them so broad I pick it you
first<00:06:14.860> got<00:06:15.189> the<00:06:15.309> static<00:06:15.699> that<00:06:15.729> killer<00:06:16.179> would

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
first got the static that killer would

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.719 
first got the static that killer would
be<00:06:16.360> morale
