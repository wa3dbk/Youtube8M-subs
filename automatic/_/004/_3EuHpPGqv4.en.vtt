00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.680
 Hello Nita In the kitchen you are welcome. 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.720
 Today we are going to create Shreekhand. 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.140
 In fact, Shrikhand is a traditional sweet of Gujarat and Maharashtra. 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.660
 Samit Na Rehkar in Maharashtra and Gujarat 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.460
 It is also preferred all over the world. 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.740
 And it is cooked and made very sad. 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.660
 So come, see what we need to make a sugarcane. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.300
 We want to make the sugarcane 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.500
 To make whey we have taken 500 grams of yogurt here 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.680
 We have used freshly used curd in this house. 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.680
 If you want to make curd in the house 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.180
 So you can watch my curd video. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.660
 You should take care of this while making curd 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.040
 As soon as curd becomes, you put it in the fridge immediately 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.120
 Or use it immediately 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 Because we have to use sweet curd. 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.780
 Curd does not make us sour 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.080
 Now this curd we have in cotton clothes 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.420
 It will put that which will drain its entire water. 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.300
 If you do not want to make whey in the house 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.160
 So you can buy it from the market also. 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.440
 It also gets in the market. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.680
 Now we'll tie the clothes. 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.960
 After tying a knot, we 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.560
 Bound the knees and spin the dough in between. 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.380
 Then we will lighten it a little bit that the spoon does not fall down 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.280
 Now we will tangle this with the help of this spoon 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.860
 So that its entire water will get out. 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.200
 After extra water, then we will get a thick whey. 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.840
 So come, now we keep it. 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.760
 After hanging the curd for a few hours 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.420
 We have got 150 grams of whey. 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.320
 As much as whey, sugar will take as much sugar 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.160
 So we have taken 150 grams of sugar here. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.140
 If you want to consume the work, then you eat sugars 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.040
 Can work more according to your taste. 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.800
 Here we have taken 1/2 tsp milk spice. 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 This is the home made milk condiment. 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.260
 If you want to make milk masala at home 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.880
 So you can watch my milk spice video. 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.540
 The taste which is needed in Shrikhand, is called Surrey Flowers. 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.580
 Milk is added to the spices like jaifer, 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.580
 Cardamom, saffron, 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.560
 Almonds, pistachios and other flavors will be added to us. 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.400
 Pistachios and almond clippings and grapes to decorate. 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.240
 First of all, we will mix whey with sugar 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.280
 Our whey which is ours should not be too heavy. 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.460
 If you have accidentally tanged 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.640
 And she looks more pale than you 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.300
 So you can use a little milk in it. 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.880
 To whom you can get the consignment of Shrikhand properly. 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.980
 Now we have got good sugar in whey. 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.400
 Now we get it around 1- 1 Put in the side for 1/2 hour 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.900
 Whose Sugar Will Melt It In 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.200
 And then after that we will filter it. 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.300
 1. It's been 1/2 hour now we will see that sugar 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.940
 It is well pigmented and found. 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.860
 Now we will do this segment together and 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.740
 For this, we will find it with the help of cotton cloths. 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.640
 If you want, it can also be able to sieve it. 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.260
 Filtering this will make it smoother and 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.300
 It will look very healthy in the food. 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.220
 In this way, we will filter all the Shrikhand. 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.520
 Now you will see how greasy it is and together 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.100
 You can also see its consistency. 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.220
 Now after this we will add milk spices in it. 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.240
 And best match 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.600
 There will be milk spices full of flavors 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.140
 And the food will look very healthy. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Now we will give grapes in it. 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.140
 If there is no grapes, then do not add grapes. 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.760
 Now we will get it in the serving bowl. 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.780
 And decorate it with almonds and pistachios. 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.180
 Do not feel yammy 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.680
 When you keep it in the fridge it will be a little thicker 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.260
 And after keeping it in the fridge it will conduct cold cold surveys. 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.760
 Heats the hot and cold cold sink. 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.080
 Now we are ready to become a part of it. 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.300
 Now you also make it and share your experiences with me.
