same design of the MacBook Pro Retina
and<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.829> really<00:03:14.159> appreciate<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:15.030> because<00:03:15.239> the

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
and I really appreciate that because the

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.180 
and I really appreciate that because the
Retina<00:03:15.870> additions<00:03:16.290> were<00:03:16.440> not<00:03:16.620> meant<00:03:16.919> to<00:03:17.010> be

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
Retina additions were not meant to be

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.500 
Retina additions were not meant to be
bulky<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.790> are<00:03:17.879> meant<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> be<00:03:18.120> lightweight

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
bulky that are meant to be lightweight

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.149 
bulky that are meant to be lightweight
and<00:03:18.780> super<00:03:19.500> portable

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
and super portable

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.830 
and super portable
here's<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.549> quick<00:03:20.760> look<00:03:20.909> at<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.150> bottom<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.690> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
here's a quick look at the bottom of the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.569 
here's a quick look at the bottom of the
air<00:03:21.989> jacket<00:03:22.319> for<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.680> MacBook<00:03:22.889> Pro<00:03:23.190> retina

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
air jacket for the MacBook Pro retina

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.449 
air jacket for the MacBook Pro retina
you<00:03:23.760> can<00:03:24.449> see<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:25.079> has<00:03:25.349> these<00:03:25.709> suction<00:03:26.220> cups

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
you can see it has these suction cups

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.309 
you can see it has these suction cups
adhered<00:03:26.849> on<00:03:26.909> the<00:03:27.060> bottom<00:03:27.389> to<00:03:27.569> aid<00:03:27.780> against<00:03:28.229> the

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
adhered on the bottom to aid against the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.339 
adhered on the bottom to aid against the
anti-slip<00:03:29.269> performance<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.479> they<00:03:30.900> do<00:03:30.959> work

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
anti-slip performance and they do work

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.930 
anti-slip performance and they do work
we'll<00:03:31.769> get<00:03:31.889> more<00:03:32.040> into<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.400> later<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.669> in<00:03:32.849> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
we'll get more into it later on in the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.360 
we'll get more into it later on in the
video<00:03:33.180> but<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.199> can<00:03:34.440> see<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:34.859> does<00:03:35.010> not<00:03:35.040> add<00:03:35.340> a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
video but you can see it does not add a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.759 
video but you can see it does not add a
lot<00:03:35.579> of<00:03:35.639> bulk<00:03:35.909> to<00:03:36.299> even<00:03:36.659> the<00:03:36.810> bottom<00:03:37.290> half<00:03:37.530> of

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
lot of bulk to even the bottom half of

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.129 
lot of bulk to even the bottom half of
the<00:03:38.129> macbook<00:03:38.699> pro<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.299> it's<00:03:39.840> still

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
the macbook pro and it's still

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.839 
the macbook pro and it's still
transparent<00:03:40.769> you're<00:03:41.099> still<00:03:41.340> gonna<00:03:41.459> be<00:03:41.549> able

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
transparent you're still gonna be able

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.399

to<00:03:41.940> see<00:03:42.180> through<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.569> case<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:43.049> does<00:03:43.199> have<00:03:43.379> a

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
to see through the case it does have a

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.229 
to see through the case it does have a
darkening<00:03:43.919> grey<00:03:44.129> effect<00:03:44.430> even<00:03:44.579> on<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.879> bottom

darkening grey effect even on the bottom

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.809 
darkening grey effect even on the bottom
but<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.840> me<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.199> love<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:47.040> way<00:03:47.159> this<00:03:47.310> looks<00:03:47.370> and

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
but to me I love the way this looks and

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.680 
but to me I love the way this looks and
I<00:03:47.909> love<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.269> way<00:03:48.389> it<00:03:48.510> feels

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
I love the way it feels

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.520 
I love the way it feels
back<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:53.359> anti-slip<00:03:54.359> properties<00:03:55.109> of<00:03:55.319> this

back to the anti-slip properties of this

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.710 
back to the anti-slip properties of this
case<00:03:55.859> as<00:03:56.159> you<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.519> see<00:03:56.760> when<00:03:56.970> it's<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.239> table

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
case as you can see when it's on a table

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.569 
case as you can see when it's on a table
due<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.169> rubber<00:03:58.379> tips<00:03:58.889> on<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.189> bottom

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
due to the rubber tips on the bottom

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.059 
due to the rubber tips on the bottom
it's<00:04:00.090> not<00:04:00.269> gonna<00:04:00.419> move<00:04:00.720> which<00:04:01.319> is<00:04:01.349> great<00:04:01.769> but

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
it's not gonna move which is great but

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.830 
it's not gonna move which is great but

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
slippery feeling of this case because

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.939 
slippery feeling of this case because

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
no worries there the case itself does

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.030 
no worries there the case itself does
not<00:04:28.090> interfere<00:04:28.540> with<00:04:28.840> any<00:04:29.110> kind<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.650> usability
