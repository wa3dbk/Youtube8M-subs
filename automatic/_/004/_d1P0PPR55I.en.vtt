00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.370
 Well, today I would like to use an effector for lessons. 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.580
 Let's play together using an effect called wah pedal. 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.000
 It is this to use today. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.600
 As it is not a wah pedal strictly because it is a multi-effector of "ZOOM", 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.890
 There is also a wah pedal function in this, so I will use it to teach lessons. 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.390
 First of all, what is the wah pedal? 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.019
 I would like to see this pedal for a while, but 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:32.920
 When you push it into your toes and back to heels. 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.070
 The sound changes here. 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.580
 As the name suggests, it's a pedal that says "Wow Wow, Wow Wow." 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.100
 So what does it look like when it is incorporated into a performance is like this. 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.689
 That's the feeling, "Wow Wow" while doing chords and single tone cutting. 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.890
 For those who actually have a wah pedal, let's practice together. 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.420
 First of all wah pedal. 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.410
 Although it seems easy, it is surprisingly difficult. 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.550
 For example, with a constant rhythm, 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.680
 It is difficult to play while stepping on the pedals with your feet. 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.470
 So at first let's pile up practice from the simple hand phrases sober. 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.480
 First of all, it is this to try first. 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.890
 First of all, brushing the 5th fret of 3 strings without a wah pedal. 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.690
 I will play with brushing. 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.180
 It is only this. 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.670
 "Tat, Kut, Tsut, Kut", "Tat, Kut, Tsut, Kut", 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.870
 "Taku, Ku, Tsu, Ku" "Tak, Ku, Tsu, Ku". 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.940
 So, this with the pedal. 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.100
 Because it is the same timing when taking out the 5th fret of 3 strings and when stepping on the pedal, 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.530
 I think this can be done easily. 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.729
 So this time we reverse this. 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.430
 I did it with "Tatsu, Kutsu, Tsutsu, Kutsu" and "Tatsu, Kutsu, Tsu, Kutsu", 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.210
 This time, "Ttsu, Ku, Tat, Ku", "Tsu, Ku, Tat, Ku", 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.430
 "Tss, ss, ts, ss", "Tss, ss, ss, ss,". 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.470
 ... and I will do this, so I won't overlap with the pedal this time. 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.470
 Step on, take out, step on, take out, step on, take out, step on, take out. 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.730
 First of all, it's a lot of practice sober until you can do this. 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.050
 So, finally the third one. This is very difficult. 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.050
 First of all, please listen to this rhythm a little. 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.880
 "Four, up, down, up" 5 frets of 3 strings, 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.590
 "down". 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.099
 "Down, Up, Down, Up", "Down". 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.050
 I feel like that, I will divide three by three and play. 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.050
 So let's play this with pedals. 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.980
 At first, if you play with a large rhythm, I think it's easy to do. 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.680
 Step on, "Tat, Tsu, Ku", 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.430
 "Tatsu, Tsutsu, Kutsu", "Tatsu, Tsutsu, Kutsu", 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.569
 "Tam". 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.500
 "Tatsu, Tsutsu, Kutsu", "Tatsu, Tsutsu, Kutsu", 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.590
 "Tatsu, Tsutsu, Kutsu", "Tatsu, Tsutsu, Kutsu", 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.390
 "Tam". 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.640
 So if this is getting bigger 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.100
 I will be able to play even if I keep stepping on quarter notes in detail. 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.900
 let's do it. 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.819
 It is such a salt plume. 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.909
 Sometimes I feel very angry when my feet and hands don't engage at all. 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:25.009
 This is something that you can always do if you practice modest practice, so 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:26.870
 The first one, the second and the third. 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.779
 Soberly practice the three phrases I introduced earlier.
