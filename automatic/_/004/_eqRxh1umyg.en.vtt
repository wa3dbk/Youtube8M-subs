pit bulls and children are unprovoked
that<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:12.959> compared<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.379> only<00:03:13.500> forty-three

provoked<00:03:17.189> from<00:03:17.879> other<00:03:18.060> previous<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:20.299> why<00:03:21.299> is

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
provoked from other previous so why is

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.729 
provoked from other previous so why is
it<00:03:21.719> that<00:03:21.750> pit<00:03:22.560> bulls<00:03:22.799> are<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.609> most<00:03:23.849> likely<00:03:24.329> to

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
it that pit bulls are the most likely to

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.490 
it that pit bulls are the most likely to
attack<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.799> child<00:03:26.129> without<00:03:26.310> any<00:03:26.639> provocation

attack a child without any provocation

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.539 
attack a child without any provocation
maybe<00:03:28.500> it's<00:03:28.799> because<00:03:30.229> there's<00:03:31.229> something<00:03:31.549> in

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
maybe it's because there's something in

and some say they're addicted to pain
they<00:03:50.240> actually<00:03:50.450> like<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:51.470> get<00:03:51.620> hurt<00:03:51.830> because

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
they actually like to get hurt because

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.730 
they actually like to get hurt because
it<00:03:52.490> gives<00:03:52.610> them<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.910> high<00:03:55.930> well<00:03:57.190> even<00:03:58.190> so<00:03:58.850> even

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
it gives them a high well even so even

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.280 
it gives them a high well even so even

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
but the real problem may not be with the

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.740 
but the real problem may not be with the
dogs<00:04:45.350> as<00:04:45.560> much<00:04:45.740> as<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:45.980> dog<00:04:46.130> owners<00:04:46.580> pit<00:04:47.540> bulls

dogs as much as the dog owners pit bulls
have<00:04:48.050> been<00:04:48.230> tested<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:48.860> they<00:04:49.070> actually<00:04:49.490> have

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
have been tested and they actually have

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.720 
have been tested and they actually have
a<00:04:50.660> very<00:04:51.170> good<00:04:51.380> temperament<00:04:51.980> when<00:04:52.370> treated

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
a very good temperament when treated

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.970 
a very good temperament when treated
properly<00:04:53.000> they<00:04:53.870> rate<00:04:54.110> higher<00:04:54.380> than<00:04:54.410> golden

properly they rate higher than golden
retrievers<00:04:55.690> according<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.750> some<00:04:56.960> tests<00:04:58.120> the

retrievers according to some tests the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.500 
retrievers according to some tests the
problem<00:04:59.510> is<00:04:59.740> many<00:05:00.740> pit<00:05:00.980> bulls<00:05:01.270> are<00:05:02.270> not

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
problem is many pit bulls are not
