00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
quite a compact little box but of course

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.680

I think most of the expense probably

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.940 
I think most of the expense probably
goes<00:00:47.910> towards<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> mitch's<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.620> rest<00:00:49.800> have

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
saved a bit on packaging and stuff so

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590 
saved a bit on packaging and stuff so
they<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.199> get<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.620> couple<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.699> decent<00:00:53.969> factions

that<00:04:32.260> help<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.680> miniatures<00:04:33.040> in<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.310> couple<00:04:33.550> of

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
that help the miniatures in a couple of

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.540 
that help the miniatures in a couple of
these<00:04:33.760> larger<00:04:34.180> buildings<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.160> can<00:04:36.310> see

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
these larger buildings that you can see

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.100 
these larger buildings that you can see
and<00:04:36.820> that<00:04:37.270> makes<00:04:37.449> it<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.660> little<00:04:37.780> bit<00:04:37.990> more

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
and that makes it a little bit more

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.379 
and that makes it a little bit more
sturdy<00:04:38.440> but<00:04:38.680> you<00:04:39.430> know<00:04:39.520> again<00:04:39.820> they're<00:04:40.240> pretty

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
sturdy but you know again they're pretty

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.540 
sturdy but you know again they're pretty
flimsy<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:41.110> we'll<00:04:41.620> move<00:04:41.800> around<00:04:42.130> during<00:04:42.430> the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
flimsy and we'll move around during the

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.909 
flimsy and we'll move around during the
game<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:43.419> think<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.930> bit<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.139> work<00:04:44.289> with<00:04:44.560> some

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
game so I think a bit of work with some

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.460 
game so I think a bit of work with some
foam<00:04:45.370> core<00:04:45.669> once<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.060> blue<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.510> I'll<00:04:47.169> be<00:04:47.320> able

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
foam core once and blue and I'll be able

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.010 
foam core once and blue and I'll be able
to<00:04:47.620> make<00:04:47.740> these<00:04:48.010> a<00:04:48.039> lot<00:04:48.310> more<00:04:48.490> sturdy<00:04:48.880> but<00:04:49.630> for

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
to make these a lot more sturdy but for

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.990 
to make these a lot more sturdy but for
an<00:04:50.289> introductory<00:04:50.889> game<00:04:51.250> I<00:04:51.490> think<00:04:51.729> this<00:04:51.820> is<00:04:51.880> a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
an introductory game I think this is a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.480 
an introductory game I think this is a
nice<00:04:52.210> setup<00:04:52.510> I<00:04:52.780> must<00:04:53.320> admit<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:53.590> do<00:04:53.740> pine<00:04:54.130> for

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
nice setup I must admit I do pine for

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.040 
nice setup I must admit I do pine for
the<00:04:54.520> old<00:04:54.820> days<00:04:55.060> of<00:04:55.360> when<00:04:55.660> you<00:04:55.720> used<00:04:55.780> to<00:04:55.930> buy

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
the old days of when you used to buy

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.510 
the old days of when you used to buy
something<00:04:56.289> like<00:04:56.530> necromunda<00:04:57.010> and<00:04:57.370> get

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
something like necromunda and get

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.270 
something like necromunda and get
fantastic<00:04:58.470> multistorey<00:04:59.470> terrain<00:04:59.979> with

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
fantastic multistorey terrain with

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.800 
fantastic multistorey terrain with
plastic<00:05:00.729> bits<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.090> all<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.240> rest<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.510> it<00:05:01.600> but

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
plastic bits and all the rest of it but

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.600 
plastic bits and all the rest of it but
certainly<00:05:02.440> those<00:05:02.590> days<00:05:02.830> have<00:05:03.010> gone<00:05:03.039> I<00:05:03.250> mean

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
certainly those days have gone I mean

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.659 
certainly those days have gone I mean
due<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.419> cost<00:05:04.570> of<00:05:04.810> these<00:05:04.960> things<00:05:05.669> they

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
due to the cost of these things they

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.810 
due to the cost of these things they
really<00:05:06.820> have<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.410> try<00:05:08.410> and<00:05:08.710> do<00:05:09.130> it<00:05:09.280> as<00:05:09.520> cheaply

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
really have to try and do it as cheaply

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.610 
really have to try and do it as cheaply
as<00:05:09.880> possible<00:05:10.000> especially<00:05:10.750> when<00:05:11.229> you're

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
as possible especially when you're

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.290 
as possible especially when you're
dealing<00:05:11.830> with<00:05:12.039> quite<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:12.580> lot<00:05:12.729> of<00:05:12.849> metal

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
dealing with quite a lot of metal

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.879 
dealing with quite a lot of metal
miniatures<00:05:13.810> which<00:05:14.020> are<00:05:14.260> obviously<00:05:14.470> very

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
miniatures which are obviously very

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.129 
miniatures which are obviously very
expensive<00:05:15.520> these<00:05:15.639> days<00:05:15.700> so<00:05:16.570> keeping<00:05:16.960> it

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
expensive these days so keeping it

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.270 
expensive these days so keeping it
within<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:17.410> cost<00:05:17.620> point<00:05:17.830> I<00:05:18.010> think<00:05:18.070> they've

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
within the cost point I think they've

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.529 
within the cost point I think they've
done<00:05:18.370> a<00:05:18.430> pretty<00:05:18.610> good<00:05:18.729> job<00:05:18.849> and<00:05:19.210> given<00:05:19.419> you<00:05:19.510> a

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
done a pretty good job and given you a

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.800 
done a pretty good job and given you a
good<00:05:19.840> area<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.740> play<00:05:21.280> games<00:05:21.610> over<00:05:22.000> apparently

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
good area to play games over apparently

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.800 
good area to play games over apparently
this<00:05:22.930> is<00:05:23.139> a<00:05:23.440> bit<00:05:23.710> smaller<00:05:24.010> than<00:05:24.130> your<00:05:24.460> average

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
this is a bit smaller than your average

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.040 
this is a bit smaller than your average
infinity<00:05:25.810> games<00:05:26.050> but<00:05:27.510> we'll<00:05:28.510> just<00:05:28.539> be<00:05:28.750> using

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
infinity games but we'll just be using

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.390 
infinity games but we'll just be using
this<00:05:29.139> for<00:05:29.349> our<00:05:29.440> few<00:05:29.650> starter<00:05:29.950> games<00:05:30.130> and<00:05:30.310> then

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
this for our few starter games and then

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.710 
this for our few starter games and then
I'll<00:05:30.490> start<00:05:30.700> introducing<00:05:31.090> my<00:05:31.300> own<00:05:31.360> terrain

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
I'll start introducing my own terrain

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.600 
I'll start introducing my own terrain
it's<00:05:32.560> certainly<00:05:32.800> colorful<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.370> that's<00:05:33.520> a

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
it's certainly colorful and that's a

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.370 
it's certainly colorful and that's a
nice<00:05:33.849> thing<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.210> see<00:05:34.539> that's<00:05:34.780> a<00:05:34.840> nice<00:05:35.020> change

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
nice thing to see that's a nice change

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.730 
nice thing to see that's a nice change
from<00:05:36.010> my<00:05:36.220> usual<00:05:36.250> very<00:05:36.820> gray<00:05:37.150> somewhat<00:05:38.110> grabbed

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
from my usual very gray somewhat grabbed

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.450 
from my usual very gray somewhat grabbed
our<00:05:39.039> field<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.930> here's<00:05:41.349> the<00:05:41.500> main<00:05:41.860> meat<00:05:42.160> of

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
our field and here's the main meat of

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.330 
our field and here's the main meat of
the<00:05:42.639> set<00:05:42.880> which<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:44.169> metal<00:05:45.130> miniatures<00:05:45.660> and

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
the set which the metal miniatures and

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.950 
the set which the metal miniatures and
you<00:05:48.340> can<00:05:48.460> see<00:05:48.699> there's<00:05:48.970> quite<00:05:49.449> a<00:05:49.750> bit<00:05:49.810> of

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
you can see there's quite a bit of

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.250 
you can see there's quite a bit of
construction<00:05:50.620> to<00:05:51.039> be<00:05:51.160> done<00:05:51.370> then<00:05:52.260> they're

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
construction to be done then they're

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.580 
construction to be done then they're
quite<00:05:54.330> fiddly<00:05:55.330> little<00:05:55.479> metal<00:05:56.199> miniatures

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
quite fiddly little metal miniatures

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.820 
quite fiddly little metal miniatures
beautifully<00:05:57.520> detail<00:06:00.510> but<00:06:01.510> this<00:06:02.500> is<00:06:02.650> probably

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
beautifully detail but this is probably

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.350 
beautifully detail but this is probably
for<00:06:03.099> the<00:06:03.160> slightly<00:06:03.490> more<00:06:03.729> experienced

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
for the slightly more experienced

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.560 
for the slightly more experienced
modeler<00:06:04.720> because<00:06:05.639> there's<00:06:06.639> very<00:06:06.880> small<00:06:07.180> parts

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
modeler because there's very small parts

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.620 
modeler because there's very small parts
and<00:06:07.780> construction<00:06:08.650> to<00:06:08.740> be<00:06:08.860> done<00:06:09.449> let's<00:06:10.449> have<00:06:10.570> a

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
and construction to be done let's have a

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.089 
and construction to be done let's have a
look<00:06:10.780> in<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.020> introductory<00:06:11.440> rule<00:06:11.740> book<00:06:11.919> and

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
look in the introductory rule book and

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.320 
look in the introductory rule book and
see<00:06:12.190> if<00:06:12.250> it<00:06:12.370> gives<00:06:12.460> you<00:06:12.580> any<00:06:12.729> tips<00:06:13.120> on

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
see if it gives you any tips on

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.440 
see if it gives you any tips on
construction

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.760 

probably<00:06:17.450> not<00:06:17.540> but<00:06:17.720> it<00:06:17.900> shows<00:06:18.170> you<00:06:18.410> pictures

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
probably not but it shows you pictures

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.240 
probably not but it shows you pictures
of<00:06:19.460> the<00:06:20.170> final<00:06:21.170> miniatures<00:06:21.500> so<00:06:21.770> you<00:06:21.980> can<00:06:22.100> use

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
of the final miniatures so you can use

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.790 
of the final miniatures so you can use
those<00:06:22.430> as<00:06:22.640> a<00:06:22.670> guide<00:06:22.930> here<00:06:23.930> you<00:06:24.020> can<00:06:24.140> see<00:06:24.200> the

those as a guide here you can see the
miniatures<00:06:25.220> that<00:06:25.370> you<00:06:25.490> get<00:06:25.670> with<00:06:25.820> the<00:06:25.970> set

on and prime them so these are ready to

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.550 
on and prime them so these are ready to
paint<00:06:53.540> and<00:06:53.840> as<00:06:53.990> you<00:06:54.080> can<00:06:54.200> see<00:06:54.230> they're
