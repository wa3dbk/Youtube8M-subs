there and I got an extra water sensor so

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.000 
there and I got an extra water sensor so
I<00:00:47.250> could<00:00:47.399> put<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.149> outside<00:00:48.739> of<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
I could put it on the outside of this

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.670 
I could put it on the outside of this
tub<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.140> put<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.559> whole

tub and as you can see I put the whole

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.689 
tub and as you can see I put the whole
washer<00:00:53.160> into<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.780> tub<00:00:55.440> unit<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.039> if

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
washer into a little tub unit so if

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.840 
washer into a little tub unit so if
there's<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.969> problem<00:00:57.149> inside<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> washer<00:00:58.850> all

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
there's a problem inside the washer all

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.279 
there's a problem inside the washer all
the<00:00:59.969> water<00:01:00.149> will<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.420> contained<00:01:00.719> inside<00:01:00.899> that

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the water will be contained inside that

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.490 
the water will be contained inside that
little<00:01:01.680> tub<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> I'm<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> little

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
little tub so I'm going to do a little

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.520 
little tub so I'm going to do a little
demonstration<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.869> guess<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.439> other

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
demonstration here I guess the other

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.000 
demonstration here I guess the other
thing<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.770> added<00:01:08.010> was<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.930> Furman<00:01:09.930> MP<00:01:10.710> 20

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
thing I added was this Furman MP 20

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.609 
thing I added was this Furman MP 20
relay<00:01:14.010> unit<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.900> 20<00:01:15.900> amp<00:01:16.020> power<00:01:16.320> supply

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
relay unit this is a 20 amp power supply

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.249 
relay unit this is a 20 amp power supply
that's<00:01:17.100> got<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> little<00:01:17.580> control<00:01:18.080> unit<00:01:19.080> built

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
that's got a little control unit built

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.560 
that's got a little control unit built
into<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.860> there's<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:20.970> low<00:01:21.119> voltage

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
into it so there's some low voltage

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
into it so there's some low voltage
wiring<00:01:22.229> there's<00:01:22.590> normally<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> closed<00:01:23.159> circuit

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
wiring there's normally a closed circuit

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.560 
wiring there's normally a closed circuit
that<00:01:23.670> comes<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> bottom<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
that comes out of the bottom of the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.490 
that comes out of the bottom of the
flood<00:01:24.780> stop<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.770> thing<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:25.979> activated

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
flood stop when this thing is activated

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.190 
flood stop when this thing is activated
it<00:01:28.500> trips<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.729> unit<00:01:30.030> down<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> shuts

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it trips this unit down here so it shuts

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.920 
it trips this unit down here so it shuts
off<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.439> power<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.729> washer<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.780> is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
off the power to the washer which is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.880 
off the power to the washer which is
plugged<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.710> will<00:01:37.710> protect

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
plugged in here so that will protect

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.289 
plugged in here so that will protect
against<00:01:40.130> drainage<00:01:41.130> problems<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.090> some

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
against drainage problems so for some

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.469 
against drainage problems so for some
sort<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> drainage<00:01:42.930> problem<00:01:44.000> it<00:01:45.000> protects

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
sort of drainage problem it protects

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.870 
sort of drainage problem it protects
against<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.869> washer<00:01:46.380> dumping<00:01:47.130> its<00:01:47.250> contents

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
against the washer dumping its contents

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.770 
against the washer dumping its contents
out<00:01:48.000> onto<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> floor<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:50.420> let's<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> little

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
out onto the floor so let's do a little

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.240 
out onto the floor so let's do a little
demonstration<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.979> everything<00:01:53.220> is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
demonstration there everything is

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.940 
demonstration there everything is
running<00:01:53.430> normally<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.950> it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
running normally now as you can see it

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.850 
running normally now as you can see it
blinks<00:01:56.399> once<00:01:56.930> when<00:01:57.930> everything<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.439> normal

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
blinks once when everything is normal

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.069 
blinks once when everything is normal
and<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.310> open<00:02:02.240> okay<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.450> now<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.869> test

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
and it's open okay so now for the test

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.200 
and it's open okay so now for the test
you<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.280> blinking<00:02:05.549> once<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.060> it's

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
you can see it's blinking once so it's

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.839 
you can see it's blinking once so it's
running<00:02:06.899> normally<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.530> open<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.670> green
