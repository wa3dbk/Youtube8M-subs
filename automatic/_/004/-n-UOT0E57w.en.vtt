00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
my home screen here i've got a big

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.670 
my home screen here i've got a big
slider<00:00:41.629> right<00:00:42.629> slap<00:00:43.079> bang<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> middle<00:00:43.500> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
slider right slap bang in the middle of

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.250 
slider right slap bang in the middle of
the<00:00:43.739> screen<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.050> does

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the screen and so that's so what it does

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.319 
the screen and so that's so what it does
is<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.890> know<00:00:47.010> sighs<00:00:47.340> SB<00:00:47.670> puts<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.120> there

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
is just you know sighs SB puts up there

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.569 
is just you know sighs SB puts up there
and<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:49.200> lets<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.590> alter<00:00:50.039> your<00:00:50.070> brightness

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and just lets you alter your brightness

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.119 
and just lets you alter your brightness
right<00:00:50.789> from<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> slider<00:00:51.360> itself<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.559> i<00:00:52.980> think

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
right from the slider itself so i think

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.889 
right from the slider itself so i think
that's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:53.640> cool<00:00:53.820> feature<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.510> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that's a really cool feature and you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.229 
that's a really cool feature and you
know<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.559> handy<00:00:55.890> place<00:00:56.039> although<00:00:56.879> as

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
know in a really handy place although as

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.760 
know in a really handy place although as
you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:57.930> sometimes<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.739> little

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you can see here sometimes it's a little

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.170 
you can see here sometimes it's a little
bit<00:00:59.100> tricky<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.090> without

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
bit tricky just to get to it without

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.330 
bit tricky just to get to it without
kind<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.690> accidentally<00:01:01.530> tapping<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.039> another

apps<00:01:31.320> which<00:01:31.500> are<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.070> we'll<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.520> to

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
apps which are really so we'll go in to

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
apps which are really so we'll go in to
switch<00:01:32.939> your<00:01:33.090> effect<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.439> very<00:01:34.680> simple

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
switch your effect and it's very simple

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.800 
switch your effect and it's very simple
in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> settings<00:01:35.640> menu<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.210> you've<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.540> got

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
in the settings menu and you've just got

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.929 
in the settings menu and you've just got
the<00:01:36.900> kill<00:01:37.110> switch<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.729> shame

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the kill switch and then it's a shame

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.640 
the kill switch and then it's a shame
but<00:01:38.970> all<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> two<00:01:39.900> effects<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.439> think

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
but all you have is two effects I think

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.080 
but all you have is two effects I think
this<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.220> literally<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.670> been<00:01:41.850> released

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
this is literally just been released

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.690 
this is literally just been released
when<00:01:42.329> I'm<00:01:42.479> i'm<00:01:43.200> reviewing<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.100> i<00:01:44.220> would

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
when I'm i'm reviewing this so i would

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.249 
when I'm i'm reviewing this so i would
imagine<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.270> future<00:01:45.390> updates<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.079> might

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
imagine that in future updates you might

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.620 
imagine that in future updates you might
see<00:01:46.439> more<00:01:46.649> effects<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.310> kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.240> bit<00:01:48.420> more

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
see more effects and kind of a bit more

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.679 
see more effects and kind of a bit more
of<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.869> full<00:01:49.229> settings<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.450> will

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
of a full settings out there and so will

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.350 
of a full settings out there and so will
that<00:01:51.750> we've<00:01:52.290> got<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.619> set<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> rotate<00:01:53.729> x<00:01:53.970> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that we've got this set to rotate x and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.899 
that we've got this set to rotate x and
so<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.409> actually<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.920> rotecks<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.820> we

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
so this is actually the rotecks on so we

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.929 
so this is actually the rotecks on so we
just<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.119> ahead<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.329> open<00:01:58.070> phone<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.790> can

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
just go ahead and open phone so you can

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.760 
just go ahead and open phone so you can
see<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.360> i'm<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.689> sure<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.079> that's<00:02:01.229> kind<00:02:01.619> of

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
see there i'm not sure if that's kind of

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.740 
see there i'm not sure if that's kind of
I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.909> sort<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.119> goes<00:02:03.360> over<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
I think that just sort of goes over the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.810 
I think that just sort of goes over the
top<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.320> kind<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> effect<00:02:05.610> so

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
top and that's kind of the the effect so

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.300 
top and that's kind of the the effect so
nothing<00:02:06.509> too<00:02:06.750> kind<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.259> different<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.069> go

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
nothing too kind of different if we go

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.729 
nothing too kind of different if we go
back<00:02:08.459> into<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.660> go<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.170> temper<00:02:10.619> I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
back into here and we go on to temper I

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.559 
back into here and we go on to temper I
do<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> temper<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.550> fact<00:02:11.819> although<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
do like the temper of fact although it

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.850 
do like the temper of fact although it
does<00:02:12.840> seem<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.260> kind<00:02:13.530> of

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
does seem to be kind of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.050 
does seem to be kind of
though<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.190> we'll<00:02:14.280> just<00:02:14.340> go<00:02:14.550> back<00:02:14.760> into<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
though so we'll just go back into the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.330 
though so we'll just go back into the
phone<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.080> see<00:02:16.290> kind<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.710> fatal<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.220> one

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
phone you can see kind of fatal that one

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.760 
phone you can see kind of fatal that one
wasn't<00:02:17.610> too<00:02:17.850> bad<00:02:18.030> actually<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.350> can

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
wasn't too bad actually and so you can

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.770 
wasn't too bad actually and so you can
see<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.130> kind<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.820> face<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.360> black<00:02:21.480> and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
see it's kind of a face to black and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.170 
see it's kind of a face to black and
then<00:02:21.900> opens<00:02:22.620> again<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.160> think<00:02:23.190> we've<00:02:23.970> been

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
then opens again and I think we've been

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.160 
then opens again and I think we've been
doing<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> little<00:02:24.600> bit<00:02:24.780> now<00:02:24.930> it's

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
doing that a little bit now it's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.170 
doing that a little bit now it's
actually<00:02:25.440> not<00:02:25.530> too<00:02:25.590> lucky<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.520> we'll<00:02:27.090> just

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
actually not too lucky so and we'll just

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.370 
actually not too lucky so and we'll just
do<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.600> once<00:02:27.930> more<00:02:28.250> here<00:02:29.250> we'll<00:02:29.400> go<00:02:29.580> into<00:02:30.380> just

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
do it once more here we'll go into just

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.680 
do it once more here we'll go into just
music<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.520> can<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.880> here<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.270> face<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
music you can see here just face to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.330 
music you can see here just face to
black<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.170> then<00:02:34.320> sometimes<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.010> does<00:02:35.130> take<00:02:35.310> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
black and then sometimes it does take a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.490 
black and then sometimes it does take a
little<00:02:35.460> bit<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.760> while<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:37.110> yeah<00:02:37.290> I

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
little bit of a while and but yeah I

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.990 
little bit of a while and but yeah I
think<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:37.800> pretty<00:02:37.920> cool<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.850> one

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
think that's pretty cool so that one

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.880 
think that's pretty cool so that one
again<00:02:39.300> that's<00:02:39.480> another<00:02:39.600> free<00:02:39.990> at<00:02:40.230> week<00:02:40.470> called

definitely<00:02:51.069> my<00:02:51.430> favorite<00:02:51.819> out<00:02:51.909> this<00:02:52.120> top<00:02:52.330> five

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
definitely my favorite out this top five

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.930 
definitely my favorite out this top five
well<00:02:53.140> they<00:02:53.319> are<00:02:53.440> all<00:02:53.620> very<00:02:53.650> good<00:02:54.010> tweaks<00:02:54.340> and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
well they are all very good tweaks and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.699 
well they are all very good tweaks and
this<00:02:55.239> one<00:02:55.420> actually<00:02:55.569> puts<00:02:55.989> an<00:02:56.200> app<00:02:56.409> on<00:02:56.560> your

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709

this one actually puts an app on your
home<00:02:56.920> screen<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:58.500> obviously<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.950> know

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
home screen and so obviously you know

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.410 
home screen and so obviously you know
when<00:03:00.220> you're<00:03:00.310> using<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.610> volume<00:03:01.000> buttons<00:03:01.299> i

telling<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.840> down<00:03:05.049> here<00:03:05.349> what<00:03:05.860> brightness

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
telling it down here what brightness

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.009 
telling it down here what brightness

the<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:09.010> know<00:03:09.129> tap<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.519> icon<00:03:09.670> so<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.540> can<00:03:10.629> see

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
the you know tap the icon so you can see

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.050

tap the icon it's is no changed falling

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.610 
tap the icon it's is no changed falling
balance<00:03:13.329> in<00:03:13.420> our<00:03:13.510> change<00:03:13.810> brightness<00:03:14.049> level

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
balance in our change brightness level

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.309 
balance in our change brightness level
so<00:03:15.160> when<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:16.030> can<00:03:16.239> now<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.900> can<00:03:17.049> just<00:03:17.200> go

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
so when you can now you can just go

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.479 
so when you can now you can just go
ahead<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.500> use<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.799> volume<00:03:17.920> buttons<00:03:18.340> to

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
ahead and use the volume buttons to

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.610 
ahead and use the volume buttons to
change<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:19.000> brightness<00:03:19.180> itself<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.319> i<00:03:20.349> think

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
change the brightness itself so i think

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.900 
change the brightness itself so i think
that's<00:03:20.890> an<00:03:21.069> awesome<00:03:21.250> little<00:03:21.579> tweak

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
that's an awesome little tweak

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.869 
that's an awesome little tweak
definitely<00:03:22.510> going<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.019> come<00:03:23.140> in<00:03:23.260> handy<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.650> lot

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
definitely going to come in handy a lot

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.030 
definitely going to come in handy a lot
again<00:03:24.879> that's<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.359> free<00:03:25.599> tweaked<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.709> was

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
again that's a free tweaked so I I was

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.410 
again that's a free tweaked so I I was
just<00:03:27.129> really<00:03:27.310> impressed<00:03:27.640> with<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:27.819> one<00:03:28.090> and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
just really impressed with this one and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.910 
just really impressed with this one and
then<00:03:28.599> you<00:03:28.720> can<00:03:28.870> simply<00:03:29.019> just<00:03:29.230> tap<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.709> and

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
then you can simply just tap that and

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.369 
then you can simply just tap that and
it's<00:03:30.069> gone<00:03:30.250> back<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.700> volume<00:03:31.329> so<00:03:31.569> definitely

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
it's gone back to volume so definitely

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.199 
it's gone back to volume so definitely
worth<00:03:32.530> checking<00:03:32.560> out<00:03:32.950> that<00:03:33.129> one<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:34.030> one's

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
worth checking out that one that one's

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.819 
worth checking out that one that one's
called<00:03:34.390> brightness<00:03:34.690> icon<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.379> say<00:03:35.650> it's

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
called brightness icon and I say it's

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.770 
called brightness icon and I say it's
available<00:03:36.040> for<00:03:36.250> free<00:03:36.280> on<00:03:36.549> cydia<00:03:36.879> and<00:03:37.060> but<00:03:37.659> I'm

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
available for free on cydia and but I'm

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.180 
available for free on cydia and but I'm
really<00:03:37.989> I'm<00:03:38.230> really<00:03:38.260> pressed<00:03:38.739> with<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.040> one
