00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
plays darksteel Sentinel he blocks my

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.870 
plays darksteel Sentinel he blocks my
replica<00:04:38.540> let's<00:04:38.780> say<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:39.830> pump<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.280> Goblin

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:54.700 

yeah<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:43.910> could<00:04:44.150> send<00:04:44.390> him<00:04:44.420> to<00:04:44.630> one<00:04:45.020> right

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.400 

so<00:04:55.550> he<00:04:56.060> is<00:04:56.180> dark<00:04:56.420> souls<00:04:56.600> on<00:04:56.750> though<00:04:56.870> we've

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
so he is dark souls on though we've

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.020 
so he is dark souls on though we've
decided<00:04:57.770> he<00:04:58.010> has<00:04:58.100> dark<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:58.430> signal<00:04:58.790> that's

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
decided he has dark so signal that's

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.400 
decided he has dark so signal that's
we're<00:04:59.330> going<00:04:59.450> to<00:04:59.510> base<00:04:59.630> our<00:04:59.810> game<00:04:59.960> around<00:05:00.200> that

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
we're going to base our game around that

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.220 
we're going to base our game around that
so<00:05:01.310> i<00:05:01.340> tacked<00:05:01.670> with<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:01.880> three<00:05:02.090> goblins<00:05:02.270> right

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
so i tacked with the three goblins right

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.490 
so i tacked with the three goblins right
and<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:06.880> so<00:05:07.880> I<00:05:07.910> tried<00:05:08.690> on<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.900> one<00:05:09.200> that<00:05:09.410> he

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
and I so I tried on the one that he

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.930 
and I so I tried on the one that he
doesn't<00:05:09.680> block<00:05:09.980> so<00:05:10.520> he<00:05:10.790> takes<00:05:11.060> five<00:05:12.940> strikeout

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
doesn't block so he takes five strikeout

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.370 
doesn't block so he takes five strikeout
make<00:05:14.090> something<00:05:14.330> a<00:05:14.390> four<00:05:14.690> or<00:05:14.960> five<00:05:15.230> six<00:05:15.920> even

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
make something a four or five six even

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.100 
make something a four or five six even
if<00:05:18.380> he<00:05:18.500> does<00:05:19.030> block<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.270> replica<00:05:20.780> we<00:05:20.960> can

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
if he does block the replica we can

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.860 
if he does block the replica we can
still<00:05:21.350> kill<00:05:21.530> him<00:05:21.650> with<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.860> flesh<00:05:22.070> elegy<00:05:22.570> so<00:05:23.570> I

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
still kill him with the flesh elegy so I

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.970 
still kill him with the flesh elegy so I
think<00:05:24.020> it's<00:05:24.200> correct<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:24.560> attack<00:05:24.860> with

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
think it's correct to attack with

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
think it's correct to attack with
everything<00:05:26.950> so<00:05:27.950> all<00:05:28.280> right<00:05:28.490> he<00:05:28.610> blocks<00:05:28.880> the

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
everything so all right he blocks the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.650 
everything so all right he blocks the
replica<00:05:29.510> I<00:05:30.430> give<00:05:31.430> this<00:05:31.550> guy<00:05:31.730> plus<00:05:31.940> 3<00:05:32.150> plus<00:05:32.180> give

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
replica I give this guy plus 3 plus give

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.440 
replica I give this guy plus 3 plus give
the<00:05:32.900> Goblin<00:05:33.350> +<00:05:33.500> 3<00:05:33.620> +<00:05:33.650> 3<00:05:33.830> +<00:05:34.250> lipa<00:05:35.000> so<00:05:35.120> so<00:05:35.180> it's<00:05:35.390> a

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
the Goblin + 3 + 3 + lipa so so it's a

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.250 
the Goblin + 3 + 3 + lipa so so it's a
456<00:05:36.880> replicas<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.090> graveyard<00:05:38.450> then<00:05:39.230> I

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
456 replicas to the graveyard then I

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.010
