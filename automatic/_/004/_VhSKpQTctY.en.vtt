what happens small blind comes along not
a<00:00:35.010> great<00:00:35.190> flop<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:35.670> Lee<00:00:36.030> bets<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.570> don't

a great flop but Lee bets here don't
mind<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.710> firstly<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.820> check<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> pre

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
mind it firstly if we check in the pre

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.170 
mind it firstly if we check in the pre
flop<00:00:39.719> limper<00:00:40.290> bets<00:00:40.620> well<00:00:41.280> we'll<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> fold

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
flop limper bets well we'll have to fold

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
flop limper bets well we'll have to fold
since<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.570> won't<00:00:42.719> have<00:00:42.899> odds<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.290> call<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:44.010> by

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
since we won't have odds to call but by

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
since we won't have odds to call but by
stabbing<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.910> gives<00:00:45.329> us<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.600> chance<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.020> take

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
stabbing here gives us a chance to take

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.950 
stabbing here gives us a chance to take
down<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.620> pot<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> gutter<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
down the pot and we do have a gutter so

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.650 
down the pot and we do have a gutter so
it's<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.680> semi<00:00:49.980> Bluff<00:00:50.280> though<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.390> don't

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
it's really a semi Bluff though we don't

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660 
it's really a semi Bluff though we don't
really<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.079> too<00:00:52.230> many<00:00:52.350> hours<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.460> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
really have too many hours do we but I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.220 
really have too many hours do we but I
guess<00:00:53.940> there's<00:00:54.180> some<00:00:54.360> potential<00:00:54.690> depending

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
guess there's some potential depending

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.630 
guess there's some potential depending
on<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.410> happens<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.980> maybe<00:00:56.280> wrap<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
on what happens to maybe wrap a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
on what happens to maybe wrap a
flashcard<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.719> hits<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.260> forth

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
flashcard if it hits and so forth

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.910 
flashcard if it hits and so forth
remember<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.989> limper<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.559> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
remember to it is just a limper and a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.650 
remember to it is just a limper and a
small<00:01:02.190> blind<00:01:02.399> certainly<00:01:03.030> no<00:01:03.210> reason<00:01:03.359> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
small blind certainly no reason to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
small blind certainly no reason to
suspect<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.110> big<00:01:04.320> hand<00:01:04.500> preflop<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.040> course<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
suspect a big hand preflop of course and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
suspect a big hand preflop of course and
a<00:01:05.939> flop<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.360> could<00:01:06.570> easily<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.170> missed<00:01:07.380> our

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
a flop that could easily have missed our

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
a flop that could easily have missed our
opponents<00:01:08.010> here<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.909> are<00:01:09.119> pretty<00:01:09.450> short<00:01:09.720> stack

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
opponents here we are pretty short stack

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.630 
opponents here we are pretty short stack
though<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.680> makes<00:01:10.890> things<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.280> bit<00:01:11.310> awkward

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
though so it makes things a bit awkward

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.700 
though so it makes things a bit awkward
and<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:12.540> concern<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> small

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and some concern here when the small

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.429 
and some concern here when the small
blind<00:01:13.860> calls<00:01:14.159> did<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.909> say<00:01:15.119> concern<00:01:15.570> i<00:01:15.869> meant

some history to boot I think the

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.559 
I've sensed the very obvious float from
our<00:03:48.980> opponents<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:49.549> in<00:03:49.730> an<00:03:49.849> attempt<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.269> get<00:03:50.510> a

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
our opponents so in an attempt to get a

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.690 
our opponents so in an attempt to get a
little<00:03:50.810> bit<00:03:50.959> more<00:03:51.290> money<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.799> pot<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.189> opted

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
little bit more money in the pot I opted

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.550 
little bit more money in the pot I opted
for<00:03:52.909> the<00:03:52.939> check<00:03:53.269> raised<00:03:53.510> here<00:03:53.750> he<00:03:54.290> actually

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
for the check raised here he actually

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.630 
for the check raised here he actually
picked<00:03:55.040> up<00:03:55.220> hearts<00:03:55.579> and<00:03:55.790> on<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.930> river<00:03:57.640> FML

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
picked up hearts and on the river FML

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.660 
picked up hearts and on the river FML
but<00:03:59.540> did<00:04:00.109> get<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.439> in<00:04:00.530> around<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.890> 75-percent

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
but did get it in around a 75-percent

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.910 
but did get it in around a 75-percent
favor<00:04:02.030> there<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:02.480> think<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.349> blind<00:04:03.500> versus

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
favor there I think of the blind versus

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.619 
favor there I think of the blind versus
blind<00:04:04.220> battle<00:04:04.579> sometimes<00:04:04.939> players<00:04:05.209> get<00:04:05.450> a<00:04:05.480> bit

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
blind battle sometimes players get a bit

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.270 
blind battle sometimes players get a bit
carried<00:04:05.840> away<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.290> spaz<00:04:06.560> out<00:04:06.739> of<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:06.980> because

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
carried away and spaz out of it because

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.520 
carried away and spaz out of it because
they<00:04:07.819> just<00:04:08.060> think<00:04:08.359> that<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.959> heads-up<00:04:09.260> pot

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
they just think that in a heads-up pot

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.690 
they just think that in a heads-up pot
their<00:04:09.739> opponents<00:04:10.189> never<00:04:10.370> going<00:04:10.549> to<00:04:10.609> have

their opponents never going to have

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.550 
their opponents never going to have
anything<00:04:10.909> a<00:04:11.150> little<00:04:11.180> history<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.170> that<00:04:12.349> and

anything a little history to that and

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.289 
anything a little history to that and
you've<00:04:12.680> got<00:04:12.829> a<00:04:12.890> good<00:04:13.159> recipe<00:04:13.430> for<00:04:13.819> getting
