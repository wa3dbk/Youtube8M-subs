00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
little bit so let's start from the side

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.600 
little bit so let's start from the side
of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> map<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.710> spawned<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
of the map that we spawned on on the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.970 
of the map that we spawned on on the
moment<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> moment<00:00:39.660> I'll<00:00:40.649> start<00:00:40.920> with

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
moment at the moment I'll start with

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.560 
moment at the moment I'll start with
this<00:00:41.070> building<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.850> when<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.329> work

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this building here and when I work

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.299 
this building here and when I work
around<00:00:42.960> we'll<00:00:43.260> come<00:00:43.500> back<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.010> building

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
around we'll come back to that building

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.220 
around we'll come back to that building
day<00:00:44.640> at<00:00:44.700> last<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.690> thing<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.930> note<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.200> that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
day at last one thing to note is that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.440 
day at last one thing to note is that
there<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.680> these<00:00:46.920> wooden<00:00:47.340> fences<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.329> so

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
there are these wooden fences here so

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.360 
there are these wooden fences here so
you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.750> run<00:00:48.930> around<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.230> back<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> it's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you can run around the back and it's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.520 
you can run around the back and it's
worth<00:00:50.579> noting<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.260> are

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
worth noting just because if you are

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
worth noting just because if you are
running<00:00:52.829> from<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> opposite<00:00:53.579> side<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.510> you're

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
running from the opposite side so you're

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.479 
running from the opposite side so you're
on<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> opposite<00:00:55.289> side<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.739> map<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.460> can

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
on the opposite side of the map you can

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.920 
on the opposite side of the map you can
be<00:00:56.730> running<00:00:56.850> through<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.660> no<00:00:57.690> idea

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
be running through here and have no idea

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
be running through here and have no idea
or<00:00:58.350> somebody<00:00:58.620> straight<00:00:58.890> behind<00:00:59.219> those<00:00:59.399> wooden

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
or somebody straight behind those wooden

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.580 
or somebody straight behind those wooden
blocks<00:01:00.210> wooden<00:01:00.780> fences<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.410> something

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
blocks wooden fences so that's something

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.860 
blocks wooden fences so that's something
just<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.949> work<00:01:02.100> no<00:01:02.280> noting<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.690> go

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
just to work no noting you can go

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.580 
just to work no noting you can go
underneath<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.890> part<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.320> stairs<00:01:07.320> here

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.760 
underneath this part of the stairs here
this<00:01:08.070> room<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.030> very<00:01:09.330> very<00:01:09.540> useful<00:01:09.770> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
this room here is very very useful and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.890 
this room here is very very useful and
one<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.130> don't<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.790> dynamic<00:01:12.570> map

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
one of you don't know I'm a dynamic map

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.170 
one of you don't know I'm a dynamic map
parts<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.560> events<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.010> gate<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.970> shoot

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
parts of events that gate if you shoot

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.060 
parts of events that gate if you shoot
it<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.630> knife<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.990> it'll<00:01:16.200> open<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it or knife it it'll open up you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.050 
it or knife it it'll open up you
probably<00:01:17.250> won't<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.610> doing<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.820> from<00:01:17.939> this

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
probably won't be doing it from this

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.039 
probably won't be doing it from this
side<00:01:18.240> you're<00:01:18.390> probably<00:01:18.540> doing<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.869> from<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
side you're probably doing it from the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.480 
side you're probably doing it from the
other<00:01:19.229> side<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> other<00:01:19.799> spawn<00:01:20.189> part

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
other side because the other spawn part

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.850 
other side because the other spawn part
is<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.869> you've<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.590> nice

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
is just over there you've got a nice

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.340 
is just over there you've got a nice
overview<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.759> window<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.840> anyone<00:01:25.229> that's

middle which is very very useful and
however<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.790> do<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> great<00:01:30.750> line<00:01:30.990> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
however you do not have a great line of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.630 
however you do not have a great line of
sight<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.439> runs<00:01:31.619> over<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.159> physically

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
sight and runs over there you physically

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.550 
sight and runs over there you physically
have<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.850> come<00:01:33.119> out<00:01:33.270> into<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> open<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
have to come out into the open and you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.740 
have to come out into the open and you
were<00:01:34.650> very<00:01:34.680> very<00:01:35.070> exposed<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.659> you

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
were very very exposed if you do so you

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.660 
were very very exposed if you do so you
can<00:01:36.990> come<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:38.009> Crouch<00:01:38.250> behind

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
can come up here you can Crouch behind

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.950 
can come up here you can Crouch behind
it<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.450> color<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:39.869> this

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it have a little bit of color but this

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.359 
it have a little bit of color but this
will<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.290> give<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.560> very<00:01:40.590> much<00:01:40.799> cover<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.130> tool

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
will not give you very much cover a tool

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.130 
will not give you very much cover a tool
you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.060> come<00:01:42.270> all<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> way<00:01:42.630> around<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.049> edge

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
you can come all the way around the edge

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.889 
you can come all the way around the edge
you<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.500> also<00:01:43.649> jump<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.130> onto<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.970> lorry<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
you can also jump up onto the lorry and

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.149 
you can also jump up onto the lorry and
it's<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.140> very<00:01:46.350> good<00:01:46.530> way<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.680> doing<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it's a very good way of doing the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's a very good way of doing the
opposite<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.939> spawn<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.420> side<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
opposite so if you spawn this side you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.679 
opposite so if you spawn this side you
can<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:48.960> come<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:50.060> jump<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.180> here<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
can then come up here jump up here and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.420 
can then come up here jump up here and
then<00:01:52.200> start<00:01:52.560> shooting<00:01:52.740> people<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.310> this

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
then start shooting people from this

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.859 
then start shooting people from this
angle<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:53.939> from<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.090> angle<00:01:54.360> which<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.630> very

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
angle or from that angle which is very

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.810 
angle or from that angle which is very
very<00:01:55.079> cool<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.560> I'm<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> show<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.310> one

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
very cool and I'm going to show you one

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.080 
very cool and I'm going to show you one
of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.420> dynamic<00:01:57.930> map<00:01:58.079> events<00:01:58.500> which<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.130> over

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
of the dynamic map events which is over

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.830 
of the dynamic map events which is over
hah

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
hah

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.050 
hah
which<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.320> may<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:02.100> sometimes<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.909> map

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
which you may see sometimes on the map

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
which you may see sometimes on the map
and<00:02:03.210> not<00:02:03.299> really<00:02:03.479> know<00:02:03.600> how<00:02:03.810> its<00:02:03.990> activated<00:02:04.439> so

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and not really know how its activated so

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.889 
and not really know how its activated so
over<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.880> area<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> map<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.479> actually<00:02:06.719> have

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
over this area the map you actually have

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
over this area the map you actually have
this<00:02:07.500> area<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.429> see<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.640> closed

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
this area here you can see it's closed

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.380 
this area here you can see it's closed
off<00:02:09.119> currently<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.890> if<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.640> hold<00:02:11.879> X<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.270> can

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
off currently and if you hold X you can

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.570 
off currently and if you hold X you can
actually<00:02:12.599> breach<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.410> like<00:02:14.040> we've<00:02:14.190> done<00:02:14.340> so

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
actually breach it like we've done so

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.640 
actually breach it like we've done so
there<00:02:14.910> everything<00:02:15.720> actually<00:02:16.050> explode<00:02:16.440> which

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
there everything actually explode which

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.320 
there everything actually explode which
is<00:02:16.800> awesome<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.459> this<00:02:17.550> area<00:02:17.849> light<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.239> you

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
is awesome and in this area light up you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.390 
is awesome and in this area light up you
can<00:02:18.450> see<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.720> yellow<00:02:18.989> exclamation<00:02:19.319> mark<00:02:19.890> mark

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
can see the yellow exclamation mark mark

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.520 
can see the yellow exclamation mark mark
on<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.760> map<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.540> area<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.870> now<00:02:22.020> open<00:02:22.410> up

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
on the map and this area is now open up

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.530 
on the map and this area is now open up
so<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.770> now<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> separate<00:02:23.459> walkway<00:02:24.270> rather

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
so it's now a separate walkway rather

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.699 
so it's now a separate walkway rather
than<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.930> going<00:02:25.110> through<00:02:25.349> here<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.590> can

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
than just going through here you can

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.990 
than just going through here you can
also<00:02:25.830> go<00:02:26.099> through<00:02:26.340> there<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.819> something

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
also go through there so it is something

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.390 
also go through there so it is something
to<00:02:27.239> earth<00:02:27.390> note<00:02:27.660> there's<00:02:27.810> now<00:02:27.930> two<00:02:28.400> entrances

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
to earth note there's now two entrances

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.640 
to earth note there's now two entrances
and<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:30.239> it's<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.450> main<00:02:30.720> dynamic<00:02:31.200> map<00:02:31.349> event

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and then it's a main dynamic map event

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.140 
and then it's a main dynamic map event
and<00:02:31.739> what<00:02:31.830> happens<00:02:32.129> is<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.819> complete<00:02:33.120> a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and what happens is if you complete a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.430 
and what happens is if you complete a
field<00:02:33.510> order<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:33.959> map<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.170> may

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
field order on this map you may

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.430 
field order on this map you may
sometimes<00:02:34.680> get<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.489> skull<00:02:36.000> symbol<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:37.290> is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
sometimes get the skull symbol that is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.740 
sometimes get the skull symbol that is
not<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.709> Kem<00:02:38.220> strike<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.849> is<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.030> dynamic<00:02:39.300> map

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
not a Kem strike it is a dynamic map

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.080 
not a Kem strike it is a dynamic map
event<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.830> will<00:02:40.950> launch<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.489> load<00:02:41.849> of

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
event and it will launch a load of

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.030 
event and it will launch a load of
missiles<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.080> sky<00:02:43.319> now<00:02:43.500> start<00:02:43.739> landing

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
missiles up in the sky now start landing

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.309 
missiles up in the sky now start landing
on<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> ground<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.540> kill<00:02:45.870> off<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
on the ground and it can kill off the

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.720 
on the ground and it can kill off the
enemies<00:02:46.620> I'm<00:02:46.709> going<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.890> cut<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> clip<00:02:47.519> where

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
enemies I'm going to cut to a clip where

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.490 
enemies I'm going to cut to a clip where
I<00:02:47.760> got<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.209> with<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.510> multiplayer<00:02:48.900> I'm<00:02:49.349> gonna

I got this with in multiplayer I'm gonna

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.140 
I got this with in multiplayer I'm gonna
show<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.920> very<00:02:50.190> very<00:02:50.310> quickly<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.030> then

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
we're going to come back to the map

all right so they go guys you've seen
that<00:03:36.629> in<00:03:36.900> action<00:03:37.230> it's<00:03:37.409> very<00:03:37.680> very<00:03:37.920> cool<00:03:38.129> if

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
that in action it's very very cool if

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.920 
that in action it's very very cool if
you're<00:03:38.519> on<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.790> enemy<00:03:39.420> team<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.810> that

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
you're on the enemy team and that

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.500 
you're on the enemy team and that
happens<00:03:40.409> just<00:03:40.530> run<00:03:41.099> get<00:03:41.730> into<00:03:41.970> cover<00:03:42.120> hide

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
happens just run get into cover hide

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.509 
happens just run get into cover hide
it's<00:03:42.959> it's<00:03:43.319> gonna<00:03:43.620> kill<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.950> pretty<00:03:44.129> much<00:03:44.310> so

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
it's it's gonna kill you pretty much so

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.309 
it's it's gonna kill you pretty much so
you<00:03:44.970> can<00:03:45.090> also<00:03:45.209> get<00:03:45.360> on<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:45.629> kept<00:03:45.840> tank<00:03:46.080> and

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
you can also get on this kept tank and

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.399 
you can also get on this kept tank and
actually<00:03:47.310> jump<00:03:47.760> on<00:03:47.970> top<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.299> here<00:03:48.599> not<00:03:49.260> the

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
actually jump on top of here not the

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.530 
actually jump on top of here not the
most<00:03:49.620> useful<00:03:49.860> location<00:03:50.700> but<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.000> guess<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.420> can

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
most useful location but I guess you can

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.270 
most useful location but I guess you can
surprise<00:03:51.900> people<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.470> are<00:03:52.590> around<00:03:52.709> here

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
surprise people that are around here

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.520 
surprise people that are around here
we<00:03:53.549> pretty<00:03:53.700> much<00:03:53.849> very<00:03:54.180> exposed<00:03:54.659> so<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:55.409> won't

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
we pretty much very exposed so I won't

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.860 
we pretty much very exposed so I won't
really<00:03:55.680> recommend<00:03:56.190> it's<00:03:56.370> not<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.329> best<00:03:57.659> place

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
really recommend it's not the best place

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.149 
really recommend it's not the best place
in<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.079> world<00:03:58.170> so<00:03:58.500> we<00:03:58.560> sort<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.769> covered<00:03:59.010> that

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
in the world so we sort of covered that

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.720 
in the world so we sort of covered that
side<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.819> the<00:04:00.000> map<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.799> pretty<00:04:01.799> much<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.610> know

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
side of the map and pretty much you know

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.150 
side of the map and pretty much you know
stand<00:04:03.000> aside<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.480> map<00:04:03.629> one<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.860> key

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
stand aside the map one of the key

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.530 
stand aside the map one of the key
windows<00:04:05.609> positions<00:04:06.090> up<00:04:06.239> there<00:04:06.390> which<00:04:06.480> you

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
windows positions up there which you

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.789 
windows positions up there which you
always<00:04:06.780> want<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:06.959> be<00:04:07.019> checking<00:04:07.290> wherever<00:04:07.650> you

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
always want to be checking wherever you

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.800 
always want to be checking wherever you
are<00:04:07.829> in<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.129> map<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.340> go<00:04:09.269> doing<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.629> sort<00:04:09.750> of

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
are in the map so go doing a sort of

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.059 
are in the map so go doing a sort of
loop<00:04:09.989> around<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.349> map<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.620> have<00:04:10.650> got<00:04:10.980> this

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
loop around the map you have got this

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.860 
loop around the map you have got this
little<00:04:11.280> part<00:04:11.549> where<00:04:11.819> you<00:04:11.910> can<00:04:12.030> nicely<00:04:12.510> get<00:04:12.840> a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
little part where you can nicely get a

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.690 
little part where you can nicely get a
good<00:04:13.560> vantage<00:04:13.709> point<00:04:13.980> over<00:04:14.400> there<00:04:14.549> you've<00:04:14.670> got

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
good vantage point over there you've got

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.789 
good vantage point over there you've got
this<00:04:14.849> back<00:04:15.090> room<00:04:15.390> which<00:04:16.289> is<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.500> good<00:04:16.650> way<00:04:16.769> of

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
this back room which is a good way of

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:17.870 
this back room which is a good way of
getting<00:04:17.039> around<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.280> edge<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.579> map<00:04:17.729> if

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
getting around the edge of the map if

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.879 
getting around the edge of the map if
your<00:04:18.150> being<00:04:18.479> feeling<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.780> bit<00:04:18.900> weary<00:04:19.139> you've

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
your being feeling a bit weary you've

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.349 
your being feeling a bit weary you've
got<00:04:20.130> another<00:04:20.280> part<00:04:20.519> here<00:04:20.820> which<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> good

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
got another part here which is a good

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.150 
got another part here which is a good
sort<00:04:21.660> of<00:04:21.720> vantage<00:04:22.199> point<00:04:22.440> over<00:04:22.740> there<00:04:22.949> you're

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
sort of vantage point over there you're

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.040 
sort of vantage point over there you're
seeing<00:04:23.310> anyone<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:23.729> that<00:04:23.850> direction<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.810> can

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
seeing anyone in that direction you can

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.270 
seeing anyone in that direction you can
go<00:04:25.199> all<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.470> way<00:04:25.620> around<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.919> edge<00:04:26.039> of<00:04:26.190> this

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
go all the way around the edge of this

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.439 
go all the way around the edge of this
truck<00:04:26.550> for<00:04:26.639> you<00:04:26.729> gotta<00:04:26.880> be<00:04:26.970> wary<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.330> they've

truck for you gotta be wary that they've

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.120 
truck for you gotta be wary that they've
had<00:04:27.630> many<00:04:27.780> people<00:04:28.050> waiting<00:04:28.229> in<00:04:28.470> that<00:04:28.500> building

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
had many people waiting in that building

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.920 
had many people waiting in that building
there<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:30.000> can<00:04:30.120> easily<00:04:30.449> pick<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:30.900> off

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
there and I can easily pick you off

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.330 
there and I can easily pick you off
because<00:04:31.410> if<00:04:31.500> you're<00:04:31.650> sitting<00:04:31.860> here<00:04:32.010> you<00:04:32.220> can

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
because if you're sitting here you can

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.670 
because if you're sitting here you can

easy to shoot anyone that's in that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.710 
easy to shoot anyone that's in that
direction<00:04:34.830> which<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.340> worth<00:04:35.729> noting<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.630> you

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
direction which is worth noting and you

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.029 
direction which is worth noting and you

can also do the same for anyone else

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.070 
can also do the same for anyone else
over<00:04:38.340> here<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:39.120> is<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.570> know<00:04:39.690> sometimes

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
over here this is you know sometimes

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.330 
over here this is you know sometimes
people<00:04:40.349> do<00:04:40.440> like<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.680> camp<00:04:40.889> in<00:04:41.010> it<00:04:41.130> because<00:04:41.280> you

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
people do like to camp in it because you

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.980 
people do like to camp in it because you
can<00:04:41.520> spawn<00:04:41.849> in<00:04:42.030> here<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.300> they'll<00:04:42.419> often<00:04:42.570> spawn

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
can spawn in here so they'll often spawn

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.900 
can spawn in here so they'll often spawn
and<00:04:43.139> then<00:04:43.200> not<00:04:43.440> move<00:04:43.710> this<00:04:44.340> is<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.520> very<00:04:44.729> high

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
and then not move this is a very high

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.820 
and then not move this is a very high
traffic<00:04:45.150> area<00:04:45.660> this<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.289> another<00:04:46.500> one<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.770> the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
traffic area this is another one of the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.379 
traffic area this is another one of the
spawn<00:04:47.070> points<00:04:47.430> we<00:04:47.520> have<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.669> spawn<00:04:47.940> here<00:04:48.210> or

spawn points we have a spawn here or
where<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:48.930> started<00:04:49.470> off<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:50.039> video<00:04:51.500> you<00:04:52.500> also

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
where I started off the video you also

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.290 
where I started off the video you also
have<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:52.800> nice<00:04:52.950> sort<00:04:53.190> of<00:04:53.220> indent<00:04:53.729> here<00:04:54.030> which<00:04:54.180> is
