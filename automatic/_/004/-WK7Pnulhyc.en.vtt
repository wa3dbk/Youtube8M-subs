00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
fourth variant so we've got a bit of a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.330 
fourth variant so we've got a bit of a
gold<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.660> silver<00:00:13.290> mix<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:13.740> round<00:00:13.920> about<00:00:14.130> a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
hundred and fifty thousand coins and I

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.920 
hundred and fifty thousand coins and I
didn't<00:00:17.430> expect<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.090> be<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.750> good

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
didn't expect this to be that good

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.170 
didn't expect this to be that good
because<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.740> defense<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.369> pretty<00:00:20.699> much<00:00:20.939> all

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
because the defense is pretty much all

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.990 
because the defense is pretty much all
silver<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.170> all<00:00:22.500> silver<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.670> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
silver of that it is all silver and I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.730 
silver of that it is all silver and I
thought<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.960> was<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.350> kind<00:00:25.590> of

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
thought it was going to be kind of

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.790 
thought it was going to be kind of
average<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.480> good<00:00:27.510> honestly<00:00:28.289> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.420 
I wasn't as good as before be did get a
lover<00:03:18.660> since<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:18.989> think<00:03:19.200> in<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.650> six<00:03:20.070> games<00:03:20.250> I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
lover since I think in the six games I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.250 
lover since I think in the six games I
played<00:03:20.670> he<00:03:21.150> has<00:03:21.239> got<00:03:21.450> five<00:03:21.660> assists<00:03:21.989> which<00:03:22.140> is

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
played he has got five assists which is

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.620 
played he has got five assists which is
really<00:03:22.590> solid<00:03:22.980> for<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> left-wing<00:03:23.850> didn't<00:03:24.480> get

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
really solid for a left-wing didn't get

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.810 
really solid for a left-wing didn't get
many<00:03:24.900> goals<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.410> think<00:03:25.680> got<00:03:25.860> one<00:03:26.070> or<00:03:26.160> two<00:03:26.340> but

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
many goals I think got one or two but

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.330 
many goals I think got one or two but
then<00:03:26.970> we<00:03:27.090> have<00:03:27.299> got<00:03:27.510> van<00:03:27.720> Persie<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.410> yes<00:03:28.709> he

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
then we have got van Persie and yes he

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.520 
then we have got van Persie and yes he
is<00:03:29.459> pretty<00:03:29.850> much<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.209> entire<00:03:30.570> cost<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.380> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
is pretty much the entire cost of the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.310 
is pretty much the entire cost of the
team<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.640> when<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.910> have<00:03:33.180> an<00:03:33.480> attack<00:03:33.870> this

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
team but when you have an attack this

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.250 
team but when you have an attack this
deadly<00:03:34.860> you<00:03:35.430> pretty<00:03:35.970> much<00:03:36.120> can't<00:03:36.720> lose<00:03:37.019> I

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
deadly you pretty much can't lose I

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.920 
deadly you pretty much can't lose I
don't<00:03:37.680> think<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:38.519> actually<00:03:39.060> conceded<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.900> goal

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
don't think I actually conceded a goal

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.800 
don't think I actually conceded a goal
because<00:03:40.440> my<00:03:40.560> attack<00:03:40.890> was<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.370> solid<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:42.299> just

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
because my attack was so solid it just

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.650 
because my attack was so solid it just
made<00:03:43.470> for<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.430> solid<00:03:44.820> defense<00:03:45.239> because

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
made for a really solid defense because

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.569 
made for a really solid defense because
the<00:03:46.260> apparent<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.709> really<00:03:46.860> had<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.040> chance<00:03:47.280> to

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
the apparent it really had a chance to

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.699 
the apparent it really had a chance to
score<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.360> was<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.720> was<00:03:48.780> amazing<00:03:49.320> it's

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
score and it was it was amazing it's

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.250 
score and it was it was amazing it's
it's<00:03:50.430> crazy<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.910> can't<00:03:51.150> against<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.750> lot<00:03:52.079> of

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
it's crazy you can't against a lot of

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.900 
it's crazy you can't against a lot of
silver<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.709> gold<00:03:52.890> teams<00:03:53.100> like<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.549> have<00:03:53.760> as

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
silver and gold teams like you have as

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.000 
silver and gold teams like you have as
well<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.390> it's<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.989> pretty<00:03:55.230> fair<00:03:55.500> match<00:03:55.709> up<00:03:55.890> I

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
well so it's a pretty fair match up I

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.979 
well so it's a pretty fair match up I
think<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.310> came<00:03:56.489> up<00:03:56.579> against<00:03:56.910> some<00:03:57.450> for<00:03:57.720> silver

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
think I came up against some for silver

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.690 
think I came up against some for silver
team<00:03:58.170> as<00:03:58.290> well<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.620> also<00:03:58.769> get<00:03:59.190> some<00:03:59.310> food<00:03:59.519> go

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
team as well but I also get some food go

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.390 
team as well but I also get some food go
to<00:03:59.730> him<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.510> gives<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.470> really<00:04:01.560> interesting

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
to him so it gives a really interesting

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.670 
to him so it gives a really interesting
opponent<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.299> when<00:04:03.810> your<00:04:03.959> match<00:04:04.110> made<00:04:04.380> and

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
opponent to you when your match made and

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.220 
opponent to you when your match made and
it<00:04:05.070> is<00:04:05.489> what<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.940> really<00:04:06.269> really<00:04:06.630> works<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.170> I

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
it is what it really really works and I

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.750 
it is what it really really works and I
didn't<00:04:07.590> think<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:07.890> gonna<00:04:08.070> this<00:04:08.190> good<00:04:08.370> Bert<00:04:08.579> van

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
didn't think is gonna this good Bert van

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.900 
didn't think is gonna this good Bert van
Persie<00:04:09.360> is<00:04:09.510> phenomenal<00:04:10.200> he<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.890> such<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.850> good

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
Persie is phenomenal he is such a good

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.880 
Persie is phenomenal he is such a good
finish<00:04:12.390> that's<00:04:12.750> not<00:04:12.870> even<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.140> best<00:04:13.170> example

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
finish that's not even the best example

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.920 
finish that's not even the best example
because<00:04:14.160> he<00:04:14.280> didn't<00:04:14.489> actually<00:04:14.640> score<00:04:15.120> but<00:04:15.269> he

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
because he didn't actually score but he

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.110 
because he didn't actually score but he
gets<00:04:16.169> in<00:04:16.380> some<00:04:16.650> great<00:04:16.890> positions<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.489> this<00:04:17.850> oh

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
gets in some great positions and this oh

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.900 
gets in some great positions and this oh
my<00:04:18.600> god<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:18.989> didn't<00:04:19.229> even<00:04:19.290> think<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.979> shoe<00:04:20.250> but

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
my god I didn't even think to shoe but

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.810 
my god I didn't even think to shoe but
it<00:04:21.120> obviously<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.570> pretty<00:04:21.810> bad<00:04:22.049> keeping<00:04:22.380> but

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
it obviously is pretty bad keeping but

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.710 
it obviously is pretty bad keeping but
still<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.849> nice<00:04:24.240> little<00:04:24.510> finish<00:04:24.900> there<00:04:25.140> at<00:04:25.380> me

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
still a nice little finish there at me

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.160 
still a nice little finish there at me
oddly<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.260> was<00:04:26.890> abusing<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:28.120> guy's<00:04:28.390> keeper<00:04:28.960> in

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
oddly I was abusing this guy's keeper in

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.440 
oddly I was abusing this guy's keeper in
this<00:04:29.860> game<00:04:30.160> I'm<00:04:30.370> not<00:04:30.520> even<00:04:30.760> gonna<00:04:30.880> lie<00:04:31.090> because

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
this game I'm not even gonna lie because

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.400 
this game I'm not even gonna lie because
it<00:04:31.840> was<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.050> self<00:04:32.320> keeper<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.940> think<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.300> think<00:04:35.230> it

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
it was a self keeper I think I think it

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.870 
it was a self keeper I think I think it
was<00:04:35.500> one<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.830> pro<00:04:36.040> league<00:04:36.250> keepers<00:04:36.670> that's

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
was one of the pro league keepers that's

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.190 
was one of the pro league keepers that's
fairly<00:04:37.150> sure<00:04:37.450> I<00:04:37.570> could<00:04:37.750> be<00:04:37.840> completely<00:04:37.960> wrong

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
fairly sure I could be completely wrong

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.370 
fairly sure I could be completely wrong
I<00:04:38.410> can't<00:04:38.710> remember<00:04:38.890> at<00:04:39.100> all<00:04:39.220> but<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.330> did<00:04:40.930> kind

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
I can't remember at all but I did kind

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.640 
I can't remember at all but I did kind
of<00:04:41.680> abuse<00:04:42.100> aerobics<00:04:42.670> I<00:04:42.820> saw<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.150> in<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.270> a

all<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.420> the<00:04:56.080> best<00:04:56.290> way<00:04:56.440> to<00:04:56.500> play<00:04:56.770> this<00:04:56.920> team

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
all and the best way to play this team

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.910 
all and the best way to play this team
is<00:04:57.310> simply<00:04:58.240> sort<00:04:58.510> of<00:04:58.570> build<00:04:58.810> up<00:04:58.990> until<00:04:59.560> your

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
is simply sort of build up until your

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.500 
is simply sort of build up until your
wingers<00:05:00.400> or<00:05:00.640> your<00:05:00.850> left<00:05:00.970> back<00:05:01.210> where<00:05:01.420> you

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
wingers or your left back where you

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.030 
wingers or your left back where you
right<00:05:01.660> back<00:05:01.810> overlap<00:05:02.320> and<00:05:02.500> then<00:05:02.680> you<00:05:02.770> can<00:05:02.920> do

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
right back overlap and then you can do

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.860 
right back overlap and then you can do
some<00:05:03.250> awesome<00:05:03.580> plays<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.150> is<00:05:04.360> across<00:05:04.600> it<00:05:04.750> in

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
some awesome plays and is across it in

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.720 
some awesome plays and is across it in
or<00:05:05.140> just<00:05:05.410> pass<00:05:05.680> it<00:05:05.830> off<00:05:05.920> to<00:05:05.950> one<00:05:06.400> of<00:05:06.430> your

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
or just pass it off to one of your

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.730 
or just pass it off to one of your
central<00:05:07.120> vacuum<00:05:07.390> it's<00:05:07.510> all<00:05:07.690> your<00:05:07.840> striker<00:05:08.080> and

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
central vacuum it's all your striker and

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.960 
central vacuum it's all your striker and
you're<00:05:08.860> probably<00:05:09.040> gonna<00:05:09.220> score<00:05:09.520> because<00:05:09.700> it's

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
you're probably gonna score because it's

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.690 
you're probably gonna score because it's
such<00:05:10.150> a<00:05:10.180> good<00:05:10.450> team<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.900> only<00:05:11.380> reason<00:05:11.980> i'm<00:05:12.160> not

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
such a good team the only reason i'm not

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.130 
such a good team the only reason i'm not
gonna<00:05:12.790> give<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.180> 10<00:05:13.330> a<00:05:13.360> 10<00:05:13.570> is<00:05:13.720> because

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
gonna give it a 10 a 10 is because

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.500 
gonna give it a 10 a 10 is because
sometimes<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:15.280> goalkeeper<00:05:15.850> was<00:05:16.000> really

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
sometimes the goalkeeper was really

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.930 
sometimes the goalkeeper was really
really<00:05:16.990> dodging<00:05:17.500> almost<00:05:18.130> cost<00:05:18.370> me<00:05:18.520> so<00:05:18.820> many

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
really dodging almost cost me so many

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.030 
really dodging almost cost me so many
goals<00:05:19.210> because<00:05:20.110> you<00:05:20.230> couldn't<00:05:20.500> really<00:05:20.710> keep

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
goals because you couldn't really keep

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.530 
goals because you couldn't really keep
hold<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.490> stuff<00:05:21.700> but<00:05:21.910> that's<00:05:22.090> not<00:05:22.240> really<00:05:22.419> a

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
hold of stuff but that's not really a

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.080 
hold of stuff but that's not really a
problem<00:05:22.770> because<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:24.040> should<00:05:24.310> be<00:05:24.520> scoring

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
problem because you should be scoring

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.450 
problem because you should be scoring
far<00:05:25.810> too<00:05:26.020> many<00:05:26.169> goals<00:05:26.470> anyway<00:05:27.070> with<00:05:27.250> van

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
far too many goals anyway with van

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.730 
far too many goals anyway with van
persie<00:05:27.970> so<00:05:28.180> with<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:28.930> team<00:05:29.169> itself<00:05:29.530> you

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
persie so with the team itself you

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.960 
persie so with the team itself you
shouldn't<00:05:30.040> have<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.160> problem<00:05:30.370> with<00:05:30.520> possession

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
shouldn't have a problem with possession

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.270 
shouldn't have a problem with possession
should<00:05:31.210> always<00:05:31.660> pretty<00:05:32.410> much<00:05:32.650> have<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:32.950> ball

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
should always pretty much have the ball

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.100 
should always pretty much have the ball
and<00:05:33.520> that's<00:05:33.640> why<00:05:33.910> i<00:05:33.940> didn't<00:05:34.390> concede<00:05:34.840> any

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
and that's why i didn't concede any

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.990 
and that's why i didn't concede any
goals<00:05:35.440> which<00:05:35.680> it's<00:05:36.190> actually<00:05:36.340> pretty<00:05:36.700> crazy

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
goals which it's actually pretty crazy

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.430 
goals which it's actually pretty crazy
because<00:05:37.180> i'm<00:05:37.360> not<00:05:37.480> even<00:05:37.600> good<00:05:37.870> I'm<00:05:37.990> bad<00:05:38.230> I'm

pretty bad at this game so for me not to

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.750 
pretty bad at this game so for me not to
concede<00:05:42.370> in<00:05:42.640> six<00:05:43.210> games<00:05:43.600> is<00:05:43.900> pretty<00:05:44.830> crazy<00:05:45.370> so

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
concede in six games is pretty crazy so

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.390
