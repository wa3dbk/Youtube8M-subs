00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the granic change booths that will be in

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.689 
the granic change booths that will be in
the<00:00:18.210> city<00:00:18.420> unless<00:00:19.410> JX<00:00:19.859> does<00:00:20.100> plan<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.430> add

additional granite change laws which

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.580 
additional granite change laws which
would<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> best<00:00:23.279> updates<00:00:23.880> ever

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
would be one of the best updates ever

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.570 
would be one of the best updates ever
but<00:00:25.590> yeah<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> reason<00:00:26.160> why<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> city<00:00:26.490> is

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
but yeah the reason why the city is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.950 
but yeah the reason why the city is
great<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.060> merchanting<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.570> something

great for merchanting is something

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.080

level 75 and 99 we have about 12 mil XP
which<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> vast<00:00:39.719> majority<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.469> way<00:00:40.590> to

which is the vast majority of the way to
99<00:00:41.250> last<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.730> checked<00:00:41.809> that<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.870> city<00:00:43.140> itself

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
99 last I checked that a city itself

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.650 
99 last I checked that a city itself
introduces<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> bunch<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.820> new<00:00:45.059> ways<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> train

introduces a bunch of new ways to train

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.450 
introduces a bunch of new ways to train
your<00:00:45.780> skills<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> which<00:00:47.100> will<00:00:47.250> obviously

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
your skills some of which will obviously

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.510 
your skills some of which will obviously
require<00:00:48.270> raw<00:00:48.570> materials<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.289> train<00:00:49.530> them<00:00:49.739> that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
require raw materials to train them that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.979 
require raw materials to train them that
in<00:00:50.670> itself<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.210> enough<00:00:51.300> investing

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
in itself will be enough investing

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.619 
in itself will be enough investing
material<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.610> particularly<00:00:54.300> interests

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
material but what particularly interests

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.709 
material but what particularly interests
me<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.289> twenty<00:00:55.649> percent<00:00:55.920> XP<00:00:56.300> bonus<00:00:57.300> for

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
me is this twenty percent XP bonus for

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.290 
me is this twenty percent XP bonus for
two<00:00:57.989> groups<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.500> two<00:00:58.680> skills<00:00:59.010> each<00:00:59.250> hour<00:00:59.520> now

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
two groups of two skills each hour now

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.639 
two groups of two skills each hour now
why<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.020> interesting<00:01:01.500> because

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
why is this so interesting because

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.680 
why is this so interesting because
people<00:01:02.520> will<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.760> hopping<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.300> skilled

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
people will be hopping from skilled

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.570 
people will be hopping from skilled
skill<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.140> get<00:01:04.290> most<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.010> there<00:01:05.460> will

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
skill to get most out of it there will

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550 
skill to get most out of it there will
be<00:01:05.610> impulsively<00:01:06.330> instant<00:01:06.780> buying<00:01:07.020> an<00:01:07.229> instant

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
be impulsively instant buying an instant

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.080 
be impulsively instant buying an instant
selling<00:01:07.890> raw<00:01:08.040> materials<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.790> finished

selling raw materials and finished

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.210 
selling raw materials and finished
products<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.290> lead<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> faster<00:01:10.740> flips

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
products this will lead to faster flips

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280 
products this will lead to faster flips
and<00:01:11.400> more<00:01:11.580> fluctuation<00:01:12.270> which<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.080> turn

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and more fluctuation which in turn

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
and more fluctuation which in turn
creates<00:01:13.710> bigger<00:01:14.040> margins<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.820> simply<00:01:15.570> helps

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
creates bigger margins it simply helps

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
creates bigger margins it simply helps
to<00:01:15.869> boost<00:01:15.990> all<00:01:16.229> sorts<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.710> merchanting<00:01:17.159> it's

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to boost all sorts of merchanting it's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.980 
impact of this update on a market should
be<00:01:30.960> significant<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.640> first<00:01:32.880> batch<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.869> be

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

released in September and will have four
segments<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.540> two<00:01:36.720> skills<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.290> each<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.770> them

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
segments with two skills in each of them

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.280 
segments with two skills in each of them
of<00:01:38.040> those<00:01:38.880> segments<00:01:39.329> there<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.570> only<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.900> one

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
of those segments there will only be one

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.770 
of those segments there will only be one
with<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> bonus<00:01:40.950> per<00:01:41.220> hour<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.570> first

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
with a bonus per hour so this first

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.929 
with a bonus per hour so this first
batch<00:01:43.020> doesn't<00:01:43.500> appear<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.070> interesting

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939

it<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.250> ultimately<00:03:41.640> bad<00:03:42.090> for<00:03:42.360> merchant
