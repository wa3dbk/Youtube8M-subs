00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200

passed<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.410> ball<00:03:30.560> more<00:03:30.769> I<00:03:30.950> thought<00:03:31.190> we

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
passed the ball more I thought we

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.340 
passed the ball more I thought we
stalled<00:03:31.640> some<00:03:31.910> things<00:03:32.120> on<00:03:32.239> offense<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:32.900> I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
stalled some things on offense and I

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.020 
stalled some things on offense and I
thought<00:03:33.980> our<00:03:34.100> defense<00:03:34.220> played<00:03:34.579> much<00:03:34.820> better
