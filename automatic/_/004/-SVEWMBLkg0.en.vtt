there for them a y splitter from factory
big<00:02:17.930> points<00:02:18.350> there<00:02:18.590> nice<00:02:20.980> some<00:02:21.980> fans<00:02:22.610> cruise

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
big points there nice some fans cruise

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.840 
big points there nice some fans cruise
okay<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:24.140> think<00:02:24.920> these<00:02:25.010> are<00:02:25.070> extra<00:02:25.430> screws<00:02:25.670> just

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
okay I think these are extra screws just

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.670 
okay I think these are extra screws just
in<00:02:25.940> case<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.210> lose<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:27.080> one<00:02:27.290> right<00:02:27.470> there

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
in case you lose that one right there

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.740 
in case you lose that one right there
ain't<00:02:27.830> no<00:02:27.890> as<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.010> part<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.310> mounting<00:02:28.750> just

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
ain't no as a part of the mounting just

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.870 
ain't no as a part of the mounting just
here<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.020> go<00:02:30.170> yeah<00:02:30.380> here<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.770> go<00:02:30.800> screws<00:02:31.310> wow

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
here you go yeah here you go screws wow

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.790 
here you go yeah here you go screws wow
that's<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.870> first<00:02:32.900> I've<00:02:33.260> ever<00:02:33.290> seen<00:02:33.740> a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
that's the first I've ever seen a

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.100 
that's the first I've ever seen a
company<00:02:34.190> actually<00:02:34.340> give<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.850> extra<00:02:35.270> of

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
company actually give you extra of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.230 
company actually give you extra of
something<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.740> same<00:02:36.920> tone<00:02:37.160> their<00:02:37.370> proper

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.370 

okay<00:02:44.240> so<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.510> reducer<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.260> don't<00:02:46.100> think<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:47.380> but

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
okay so I reducer I don't think so but

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.910 
okay so I reducer I don't think so but
actually<00:02:48.770> I<00:02:48.830> you're<00:02:49.010> right<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.190> can<00:02:49.310> see<00:02:49.460> the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
actually I you're right you can see the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.060 
actually I you're right you can see the
the<00:02:51.920> resistors<00:02:52.850> in<00:02:53.000> there<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.830> i<00:02:54.890> may<00:02:55.010> have

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
the resistors in there so i may have

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.980 
the resistors in there so i may have
here<00:02:55.220> into<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.459> kind<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.700> thing<00:02:55.870> good<00:02:56.870> for

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
here into that kind of thing good for

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.410 
here into that kind of thing good for
you<00:02:57.700> well<00:02:58.700> does<00:02:58.910> turn<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.150> 4-pin<00:02:59.720> into<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.020> three

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
you well does turn a 4-pin into a three

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.730 
you well does turn a 4-pin into a three
so<00:03:02.420> or<00:03:02.810> if<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:03.020> has<00:03:03.140> anything<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.530> do<00:03:03.709> with

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
so or if that has anything to do with

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:14.110 
so or if that has anything to do with
the<00:03:04.010> resistors<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.690> much<00:03:11.900> fun<00:03:12.610> separate<00:03:13.610> 2011

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
the resistors so much fun separate 2011

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.120 
the resistors so much fun separate 2011
money<00:03:14.270> max<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:15.110> nice<00:03:15.320> tweezing<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.890> later

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
money max a nice tweezing that later

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.720 
money max a nice tweezing that later
your<00:03:17.090> back<00:03:17.300> plate<00:03:17.570> for<00:03:18.110> your<00:03:18.200> Intel<00:03:18.730> there's

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
your back plate for your Intel there's

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.150 
your back plate for your Intel there's
not<00:03:19.820> 2011<00:03:20.330> just<00:03:20.690> like<00:03:20.930> an<00:03:21.290> optimist<00:03:21.800> looks

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
not 2011 just like an optimist looks

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.090 
not 2011 just like an optimist looks
very<00:03:22.459> similar<00:03:22.730> than<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.120> HD<00:03:23.420> for<00:03:23.600> teens<00:03:24.100> here's

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
very similar than I HD for teens here's

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.360 
very similar than I HD for teens here's
some<00:03:25.340> rubber<00:03:27.730> yes<00:03:29.020> no<00:03:30.020> rubber<00:03:30.800> stickers<00:03:31.250> you

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
some rubber yes no rubber stickers you

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.310 
some rubber yes no rubber stickers you
can<00:03:31.520> put<00:03:31.700> on<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.880> sides<00:03:32.090> here<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:32.989> it's

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
can put on the sides here so it's

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.960 
can put on the sides here so it's
recommends<00:03:33.830> yeah<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:34.250> padding<00:03:34.550> thank<00:03:34.760> yes

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
recommends yeah it's padding thank yes

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
I do like the city's white cable

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.590 
I do like the city's white cable
underneath<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.680> your<00:04:17.800> wire<00:04:18.010> just<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.209> did<00:04:19.360> I

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
underneath it your wire just it did I

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.690 
underneath it your wire just it did I
mean<00:04:20.290> I<00:04:20.530> would<00:04:20.739> have<00:04:20.830> preferred<00:04:20.920> it<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.340> be<00:04:21.520> all

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
mean I would have preferred it to be all

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.910 
mean I would have preferred it to be all
black<00:04:22.060> but<00:04:22.540> I<00:04:22.870> don't<00:04:23.260> know<00:04:23.380> this<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.680> going<00:04:23.830> to

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
black but I don't know this is going to

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.520 
black but I don't know this is going to
look<00:04:23.980> pretty<00:04:24.040> sharp<00:04:24.430> right<00:04:24.700> here<00:04:24.940> like<00:04:25.120> this

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
look pretty sharp right here like this

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.020 
look pretty sharp right here like this
contrast<00:04:26.530> is<00:04:26.650> good<00:04:26.860> yeah<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.490> contrast<00:04:27.880> is

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
contrast is good yeah the contrast is

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.610 
contrast is good yeah the contrast is
really<00:04:28.330> good<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.930> course<00:04:29.110> you<00:04:29.260> do<00:04:29.410> get

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
really good and of course you do get

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.500 
really good and of course you do get
another<00:04:30.160> one<00:04:30.310> of<00:04:30.370> those<00:04:30.490> fans<00:04:30.820> those<00:04:31.270> are<00:04:31.420> both

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
another one of those fans those are both

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.970 
another one of those fans those are both
140s<00:04:32.110> yes<00:04:32.650> but<00:04:33.130> they<00:04:33.400> probably<00:04:33.700> have<00:04:34.090> won<00:04:35.050> 29

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
140s yes but they probably have won 29

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.850 
140s yes but they probably have won 29
goals<00:04:36.190> yeah<00:04:36.580> pebble<00:04:36.940> or<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:37.620> we'll<00:04:38.620> get<00:04:38.740> it

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
goals yeah pebble or so we'll get it

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.920 
goals yeah pebble or so we'll get it
more<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.340> specific<00:04:40.030> details<00:04:40.420> in<00:04:40.870> the
