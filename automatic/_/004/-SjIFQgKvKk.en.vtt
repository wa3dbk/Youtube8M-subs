all six strings

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.340 
all six strings
so<00:01:25.789> it's<00:01:25.939> basically<00:01:26.119> like<00:01:26.570> see<00:01:27.140> me<00:01:27.289> it's

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
so it's basically like see me it's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.910 
so it's basically like see me it's
basically<00:01:27.710> like<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.009> blues<00:01:28.460> in<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:28.969> key<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.240> a

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
basically like a blues in the key of a

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.620 
basically like a blues in the key of a
but<00:01:30.920> its<00:01:31.039> major<00:01:31.310> chords<00:01:31.820> instead<00:01:32.149> of<00:01:32.240> dominant

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
but its major chords instead of dominant

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.139 
but its major chords instead of dominant
chords<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.289> if<00:01:34.069> you<00:01:34.189> look<00:01:34.369> at<00:01:34.549> like<00:01:34.700> blues

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
chords and if you look at like blues

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.899 
chords and if you look at like blues
theory<00:01:35.509> it's<00:01:35.659> like<00:01:35.840> one<00:01:36.140> four<00:01:36.560> or<00:01:36.649> five<00:01:36.909> chords

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
theory it's like one four or five chords

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.899 
theory it's like one four or five chords
so<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.810> key<00:01:38.960> of<00:01:39.079> any<00:01:39.289> have<00:01:39.530> your<00:01:39.710> one<00:01:39.950> your
