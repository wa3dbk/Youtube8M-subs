probably going to be getting rid of this
power<00:01:44.340> supply<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.540> junker

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
power supply just because it's a junker

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.910 
power supply just because it's a junker
and<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.850> provide<00:01:47.869> 700<00:01:48.869> watts<00:01:49.470> anymore

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
and it can provide 700 watts anymore

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.160 
and it can provide 700 watts anymore
because<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.280> kind<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.610> broke<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.000> when<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.020> was

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
because I kind of broke it when I was

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.920 
because I kind of broke it when I was
sleeping<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.700> put<00:01:54.090> some<00:01:54.240> heat-shrink<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
sleeping I I put some heat-shrink on the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.200 
sleeping I I put some heat-shrink on the
inside<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.159> frayed<00:01:56.460> ends<00:01:56.790> when<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.030> come

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
inside so the frayed ends when it come

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.899 
inside so the frayed ends when it come
out<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.380> may<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.250> d<00:01:59.490> soldered

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.999 
out I think I may be d soldered
something<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.810> got<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.530> too<00:02:01.649> hot<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:01.979> the

something or I got it too hot with the
heat<00:02:02.189> gun<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.149> doesn't<00:02:03.930> provide

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
heat gun in there so it doesn't provide

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.139 
heat gun in there so it doesn't provide
what<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.920> used<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.399> i<00:02:05.430> mean<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.820> still<00:02:05.880> turned

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
edge it'll turn off so kind of broke it

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.960 
edge it'll turn off so kind of broke it
so<00:02:15.200> I'm<00:02:15.680> going<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.860> need<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.550> be<00:02:16.670> getting

isn't<00:02:33.200> going<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.410> work<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.860> i'm<00:02:33.950> probably

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
isn't going to work so i'm probably

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.759 
isn't going to work so i'm probably
going<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.520> take<00:02:34.610> my<00:02:34.790> cooler<00:02:35.209> off<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:36.140> my<00:02:36.410> little

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
going to take my cooler off of my little

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.500 
going to take my cooler off of my little
7<00:02:37.040> some<00:02:37.190> fabric<00:02:37.580> over<00:02:37.819> there<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.300> drop<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.900> in

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
7 some fabric over there and drop it in

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.559 
7 some fabric over there and drop it in
there<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.260> mean<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:43.190> don't<00:02:43.819> know<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.090> stay<00:02:44.330> put

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
there and I mean I don't know I stay put

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.210 
there and I mean I don't know I stay put
it<00:02:44.660> on<00:02:44.780> see<00:02:45.200> how<00:02:45.230> forth<00:02:45.590> gigahertz<00:02:45.860> does

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
it on see how forth gigahertz does

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.500 
it on see how forth gigahertz does
because<00:02:46.489> if<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.700> can<00:02:46.850> handle<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.360> can't

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
because if it can handle it it can't

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.979 
because if it can handle it it can't
handle<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.840> right<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.670> pretty<00:02:49.940> much<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.720> is

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
handle it right so pretty much that is

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.460 
handle it right so pretty much that is
the<00:02:51.200> update<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.660> can<00:02:53.840> think<00:02:53.989> of<00:02:54.140> anything

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
the update if I can think of anything

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.320 
the update if I can think of anything
else<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.739> put<00:02:54.950> my<00:02:55.130> scout<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.610> will<00:02:55.819> continue<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
else to put my scout I will continue the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.440 
else to put my scout I will continue the
mod<00:02:56.510> but<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.700> pretty<00:02:58.700> much<00:02:58.760> think<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.209> scouts

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
mod but I pretty much think the scouts

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.020 
mod but I pretty much think the scouts
done<00:02:59.750> I<00:03:00.739> don't<00:03:01.310> really<00:03:01.430> think<00:03:01.549> there's<00:03:01.880> going

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
done I don't really think there's going

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.729 
done I don't really think there's going
to<00:03:02.120> be<00:03:02.180> any<00:03:02.390> more<00:03:02.660> videos<00:03:03.049> with<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.410> probably

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
to be any more videos with it probably

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.710 
to be any more videos with it probably
just<00:03:03.890> going<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.100> get<00:03:04.160> rid<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.459> case<00:03:04.670> and

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
just going to get rid of the case and

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.360 
just going to get rid of the case and
run<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.810> over<00:03:05.930> something<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.680> just<00:03:07.100> don't<00:03:07.280> know

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
run it over something I just don't know

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.840 
run it over something I just don't know
maybe<00:03:07.640> i'll<00:03:07.790> give<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:07.940> away<00:03:08.120> but<00:03:10.209> yeah<00:03:12.850> that's

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
maybe i'll give it away but yeah that's

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.479 
maybe i'll give it away but yeah that's
pretty<00:03:14.120> much<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.560> my<00:03:15.560> whole<00:03:15.920> rig<00:03:16.190> was

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
pretty much it my whole rig was

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.880 
pretty much it my whole rig was
dependent<00:03:17.030> on<00:03:17.120> my<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.480> board<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:17.989> that<00:03:18.680> broke

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
dependent on my the board and that broke

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.729 
dependent on my the board and that broke
so<00:03:19.340> it's<00:03:19.579> over<00:03:20.329> i<00:03:23.079> don't<00:03:24.079> think<00:03:24.320> i'll<00:03:24.440> be<00:03:24.470> doing

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
so it's over i don't think i'll be doing

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.960 
so it's over i don't think i'll be doing
