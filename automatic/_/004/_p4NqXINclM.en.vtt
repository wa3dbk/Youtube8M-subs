00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.839
 healthy little brothers with you beatard 671 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.280
 and in this video I will show you books with 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.590
 I used to go to courses 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.620
 English just in the past 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.269
 video I told you that they are somewhere in 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.920
 lying around me and so I found them 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.080
 Actually not all because somewhere was 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.199
 there was also a business english edition too 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.980
 here is the same big book so far 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.650
 rather, two books are usually 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.250
 there is such a book is 5 read 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.930
 no, no, here you are reading here 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.850
 texts some tasks you do it 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.680
 the color book and the other is black and white 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.010
 sea remember here you just too 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.690
 gaining the task essentially but here 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 probably only one job there is no 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.539
 lyrics you just need to listen 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.340
 and do it alone here 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.760
 it turns out group work that is 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.619
 for example you are sitting with someone on 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.270
 classes and you talk to him here with 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.640
 what kind of person practice english 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.729
 that is to represent for example what are you 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.750
 such there john un smith and you should there 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.570
 solve some problem in general this 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.970
 elementary books yes this is the beginning 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.450
 it seems if I am not mistaken no no 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.520
 used to be here before such books 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.570
 I have a thousand when still at school yet 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.700
 the smallest was ever 10 9 like this 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.409
 about looked like books with english 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.710
 probably they are no longer allowed 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.680
 see English that grandfather is written here 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:50.009
 some pictures of the best children 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:52.229
 Books just this is just the basis studied 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.259
 open doors for them and what to do 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.329
 still there is so so so so so all 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.390
 nothing else the rest of the book is 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.399
 which are already more mature I 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.399
 used so mean little elementary 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.399
 pre-intermediate 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.580
 and the Internet is the average level 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.150
 intermediate 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.240
 and three books are dictionaries 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.120
 words and what turns out here is given 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.170
 word for example i'm getting closer i'm not 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.890
 I know this word will be seen and explained 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.580
 English words ie dictionary 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.580
 which explains everything in English 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.480
 that is, dive and litter is still something 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:43.200
 Well, in short , somehow, too, 3 dictionaries for 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.239
 different level it seems where I went to 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.989
 English courses there seemed to be 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.370
 5-6 levels whether or not 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.989
 there is elementary pre-intermediate 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.580
 intermediate 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:03.780
 intermediate and advance supports so what 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.720
 I also wanted to show you a book 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.610
 read here is such a name 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.329
 arthur clarke excel 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.910
 expedition duper calculate very difficult 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.540
 there are a lot of words like dohrena 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.549
 which well for example the Internet was not 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.250
 although the Internet is already such a bread, I would 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:29.790
 became a difficult level here a lot of things 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:33.650
 interesting how many words of everyones 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:40.590
 could learn to any grammar 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.280
 a proposal that's being built but are 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.610
 here are the books 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.049
 Naturally still do not overpower 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.329
 as you know, well, that is, for example, I know 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:52.440
 how is it super read well here I know 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:55.430
 something like where the emphasis is on the word 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.049
 hack counts as words read 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:04.130
 roughly but like some words 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:04.130
 translates of course shorter cram 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:11.440
 here probably already all I do not know what he 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.360
 show business english for a hundred 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.030
 I wo n't find interest I don't know where he is 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.120
 lying around I might be somewhere just 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.470
 between the cabinets they are clogged yes well that is to 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.090
 such a state to this door 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.270
 open there from there everything falls out 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.880
 I had to pull some of the things there 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.180
 to find these books here and these books 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.840
 they cost dearly told you still 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.500
 maybe 7 years ago the internet is 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.600
 such a book 1, it became about 500 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.620
 600 rubles but this is without 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:48.880
 without a workbook that is 1200 rubles 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.860
 there drive seems to be still inside there 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.419
 choose a disk or cassette but the last 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.419
 edition were not only with discs and 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.710
 it seems well it seems some people 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.300
 would buy an ear book but I 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.810
 Naturally did not buy in ear books 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.630
 because my mother bought everything 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.780
 actually because it would be like that 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.860
 consider here already arrived here wrote 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.050
 something inside and basically a bushin 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.450
 they were even offered books even in those 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.889
 places on courses on the same 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.150
 because I don’t know someone else’s books 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.889
 Were not needed because they already passed 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.210
 a certain level of him just 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.210
 offered the type who wants to buy 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.810
 stuffy science book there at half price 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:38.260
 some agreed to buy would be gone 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.780
 who did not disdain yes but most 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.750
 naturally bought new 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:48.060
 you could buy them yourself 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.180
 could be ordered through in 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.180
 courses 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.070
 Anton actually through the courses there was 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.470
 cheaper map became us here or 200 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.960
 rubles and if you buy in such stores 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.510
 as a step towards the top five 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.300
 still that young guard used to be right now I 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:09.660
 I do not know where it is all now it's all in 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.180
 the center probably moved but there is always 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.980
 there was a very strong mark-up there for rubles 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.160
 I rubber for 100 rubles but it was more expensive 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.140
 sometimes even up to 200 by 300 for those 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.060
 times when salaries were less then 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:25.860
 there is inflation adjusted of course it 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:31.560
 big money that's why all 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:34.200
 ordered directly it was a review of books 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.900
 with whom I dealt there is not quite 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.070
 there probably still 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.630
 Business English as I told you already 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.680
 but the rut will probably be very 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:47.450
 difficult so I think you can 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.450
 finish thank you for your attention bye
