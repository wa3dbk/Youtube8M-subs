00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
the off position which is why I chose

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.580 
the off position which is why I chose
twelve<00:00:36.310> o'clock<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.880> it<00:00:37.570> still<00:00:38.020> keeps<00:00:38.230> track

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
this is an electronic watch using a

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.310 
this is an electronic watch using a
series<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.880> little<00:00:46.330> motors<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.020> can<00:00:47.170> see

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
series of little motors and you can see

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.780 
series of little motors and you can see
these<00:00:47.470> motors<00:00:47.770> right<00:00:47.920> here<00:00:48.100> here's<00:00:48.490> two<00:00:48.760> of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
these motors right here here's two of

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.180 
these motors right here here's two of
them<00:00:49.060> to<00:00:49.600> drive<00:00:50.050> these<00:00:50.260> belts<00:00:50.710> which<00:00:50.890> tell<00:00:51.160> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
them to drive these belts which tell the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.150 
them to drive these belts which tell the
time<00:00:51.490> so<00:00:52.000> when<00:00:52.540> you<00:00:52.690> turn<00:00:53.050> it<00:00:53.200> back<00:00:53.230> on<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.980> does

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
time so when you turn it back on it does

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:06.679 
time so when you turn it back on it does
this<00:00:54.310> little<00:00:54.550> dance<00:00:55.420> with<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.750> belts<00:00:56.110> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.140 

there<00:01:07.689> you<00:01:07.780> go<00:01:07.869> it's<00:01:08.380> 4:40<00:01:08.950> now<00:01:09.280> it's<00:01:09.640> actually

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
there you go it's 4:40 now it's actually

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.260 
there you go it's 4:40 now it's actually
in<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.840> special<00:01:11.649> mode<00:01:11.890> right<00:01:12.159> now<00:01:12.219> that<00:01:13.060> is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
in a special mode right now that is

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.169 
in a special mode right now that is
called<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.929> power<00:01:14.770> saving<00:01:15.159> mode<00:01:15.579> where<00:01:16.060> it

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
called a power saving mode where it

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.209 
called a power saving mode where it
tells<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.659> time<00:01:16.689> but<00:01:17.499> it<00:01:17.619> doesn't<00:01:17.920> have<00:01:18.070> the

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
tells the time but it doesn't have the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.910 
tells the time but it doesn't have the
seconds<00:01:18.820> belt<00:01:19.600> running<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.530> there's<00:01:20.679> a<00:01:20.740> good

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
seconds belt running and there's a good

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.739 
seconds belt running and there's a good
reason<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.280> keeping<00:01:21.759> this<00:01:21.909> one<00:01:22.149> what<00:01:22.509> you<00:01:22.630> do

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
reason that keeping this one what you do

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.630 
reason that keeping this one what you do
to<00:01:22.840> turn<00:01:23.049> it<00:01:23.140> back<00:01:23.319> on<00:01:23.619> is<00:01:23.859> it's<00:01:24.280> not<00:01:24.340> really<00:01:24.609> a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
to turn it back on is it's not really a

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.309 
to turn it back on is it's not really a
crown<00:01:24.880> it's<00:01:24.999> more<00:01:25.119> like<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.299> joystick<00:01:25.749> you<00:01:25.960> turn

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
crown it's more like a joystick you turn

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.630 
crown it's more like a joystick you turn
it<00:01:26.439> over<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.859> left<00:01:27.359> and<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.369> starts

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
it over to the left and then it starts

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.160 
it over to the left and then it starts
to<00:01:30.759> go<00:01:32.969> now<00:01:33.969> you<00:01:33.999> can<00:01:34.210> keep<00:01:34.539> track<00:01:34.810> of<00:01:35.049> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
to go now you can keep track of the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.050 
to go now you can keep track of the
running<00:01:35.469> seconds<00:01:35.950> but<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.189> problem<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:37.030> that

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
running seconds but the problem is that

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.090 
running seconds but the problem is that
it<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.600> extremely<00:01:38.159> how<00:01:39.159> should<00:01:39.340> I<00:01:39.429> say<00:01:41.100> well

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
it is extremely how should I say well

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.969 
it is extremely how should I say well
it's<00:01:42.340> loud<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.999> I<00:01:43.960> have<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.319> microphone<00:01:44.530> here

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
it's loud and I have the microphone here

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.080 
it's loud and I have the microphone here
a<00:01:45.009> little<00:01:45.130> far<00:01:45.399> away<00:01:45.609> I'm<00:01:45.759> going<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:45.939> put<00:01:46.030> the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
a little far away I'm going to put the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.940 
a little far away I'm going to put the
microphone<00:01:46.359> you'll<00:01:46.630> be<00:01:46.719> closer<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.139> the<00:01:47.200> watch

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.199 

that's<00:01:50.950> cool<00:01:51.249> to<00:01:51.399> watch<00:01:51.549> but<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:51.969> quickly

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
that's cool to watch but that quickly

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.319 
that's cool to watch but that quickly
gets<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.869> little<00:01:53.049> bit<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:54.369> don't<00:01:54.819> say<00:01:54.939> annoying

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
gets a little bit I don't say annoying

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.149 
gets a little bit I don't say annoying
but<00:01:55.780> it's<00:01:56.020> it's<00:01:56.319> a<00:01:56.439> loud<00:01:56.619> thing<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.069> you're

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
but it's it's a loud thing and you're

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.260 
but it's it's a loud thing and you're
going<00:01:57.249> to<00:01:57.340> want<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.579> keep<00:01:57.729> in<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.030> power

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
going to want to keep in that power

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.149 
going to want to keep in that power
saving<00:01:58.689> mode<00:01:58.869> most<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.499> the<00:01:59.560> time<00:01:59.770> so<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.039> order

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
saving mode most of the time so in order

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.190 
saving mode most of the time so in order
to<00:02:00.310> engage<00:02:00.459> it<00:02:00.789> again<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.569> put<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.869> crown

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
to engage it again you put that crown

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.129 
to engage it again you put that crown
over<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.520> left<00:02:03.759> again<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.270> now<00:02:05.079> the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:06.899 
over to the the left again and now the
only<00:02:05.499> time<00:02:05.799> you're<00:02:05.979> going<00:02:06.069> to<00:02:06.130> hear<00:02:06.279> noise<00:02:06.520> is

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
only time you're going to hear noise is

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.300 
only time you're going to hear noise is
when<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.209> hour<00:02:07.389> and<00:02:07.840> minute<00:02:07.929> belts<00:02:08.830> move

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
when the hour and minute belts move

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.949 
when the hour and minute belts move
which<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:09.819> going<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.030> be<00:02:10.149> once<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.509> minute<00:02:10.810> it

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
which is going to be once a minute it

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.370 
which is going to be once a minute it
still<00:02:11.350> makes<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.740> kind<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.720> gear<00:02:13.720> type<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.200> noise

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
still makes a kind of gear type of noise

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.589 
still makes a kind of gear type of noise
but<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.189> a<00:02:15.280> lot<00:02:15.430> more<00:02:15.580> manageable<00:02:15.849> this<00:02:16.450> is

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
but it's a lot more manageable this is

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.940 
but it's a lot more manageable this is
the<00:02:16.689> type<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.900> watch<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.349> has<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.709> type<00:02:17.920> of

the type of watch it has that type of

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.850 
the type of watch it has that type of
calling<00:02:18.909> card<00:02:19.209> sound<00:02:19.659> which<00:02:19.930> says<00:02:20.230> hey

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860

follow-up model which I can't discuss
too<00:02:59.110> much<00:02:59.290> but<00:02:59.740> it's<00:02:59.890> going<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.160> be<00:03:00.280> very

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
too much but it's going to be very

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.000 
too much but it's going to be very
interesting<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.300> this<00:03:01.630> steampunk<00:03:02.200> model<00:03:02.830> is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
interesting and this steampunk model is

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.130 
interesting and this steampunk model is
a<00:03:03.040> limited<00:03:03.490> ition<00:03:03.940> version<00:03:04.330> that<00:03:04.780> they<00:03:04.960> never

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
the idea and enough people liked it they

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.580 
the idea and enough people liked it they

something<00:03:19.840> different<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.340> they<00:03:21.340> wanted<00:03:21.610> to

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
something different and they wanted to

something different and they wanted to

make so the first thing they decide is
they<00:03:26.890> want<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.190> do<00:03:27.280> something<00:03:27.550> with<00:03:27.670> these

effectively<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.489> was<00:03:30.810> impossible<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.050> would

effectively it was impossible and would

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.199 
effectively it was impossible and would
have<00:03:32.590> been<00:03:32.709> outrageously<00:03:33.370> expensive<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:34.000> make

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
have been outrageously expensive to make

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
is a quartz paste watch but obviously

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.710 
is a quartz paste watch but obviously
much<00:03:39.280> more<00:03:39.489> sophisticated<00:03:40.209> than<00:03:40.420> your<00:03:40.570> normal

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720

very interesting watch this one is a

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.620 
very interesting watch this one is a
little<00:04:32.890> bit<00:04:33.070> more

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
little bit more

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.810

and<00:04:34.380> I'll<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.890> I'll<00:04:34.980> get<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.430> that<00:04:35.670> in<00:04:35.760> a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
and I'll and I'll get to that in a

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.090 
and I'll and I'll get to that in a
second<00:04:36.300> but<00:04:36.750> I<00:04:36.870> just<00:04:36.930> wanted<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.500> sort<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.860> show

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
you all the little features here but

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.570 
you all the little features here but
what's<00:04:40.200> different<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.650> case<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.130> essentially

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
what's different the case is essentially

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.570 
what's different the case is essentially
the<00:04:41.730> same<00:04:42.000> but<00:04:42.480> you<00:04:42.630> have<00:04:42.840> these<00:04:43.580> bronze

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
the same but you have these bronze

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.920 
the same but you have these bronze
components<00:04:45.540> here<00:04:45.990> which<00:04:46.560> are<00:04:47.930> naturally

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
components here which are naturally

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.380 
components here which are naturally
going<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.200> patina<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:50.160> one<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.730> I<00:04:51.000> think

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
going to patina so this one is I think

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.120 
going to patina so this one is I think
this<00:04:51.690> is<00:04:51.750> like<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.080> very<00:04:52.230> first<00:04:52.380> model<00:04:52.830> ever

made and it's you know it's a couple of

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.330 
made and it's you know it's a couple of
weeks<00:04:55.170> old<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.680> can<00:04:55.830> tell<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.040> there's
