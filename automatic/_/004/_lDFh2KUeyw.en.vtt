00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.159
 more consistent and the one that provides us 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.349
 higher amounts of calories but the 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.709
 nutritionist conception design here 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.049
 this 2,000 calorie diet that says 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.040
 that in this lunch you should not 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.709
 exceed the 450 calories that we 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.560
 can provide for which you 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:20.459
 recommend that you consume a salad 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.160

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.330
 oven with lemon iced tea and it gives you 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.880
 this reward that not many are 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.889
 It's the Neapolitan ice cream 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.590

 we are already approaching dinner 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.260
 and in this stage ricardo that is the stage 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.100
 of the snack around 6 o'clock 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.740
 late 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.780

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.820
 the 110 calories needed 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.980
 at this time or you can replace it with 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.470
 any dairy product since the 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.960
