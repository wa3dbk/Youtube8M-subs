00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 agi 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.190
 and today is a very special day 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.740
 because for the first time a 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:35.180
 event organized by this beauty 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.120
 lady who calls herself sara carnation who 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.970
 is the creator of this group that yes 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.230
 call facebook drivers will be as you are 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.690
 all this came to mind 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.180
 extraordinary idea then first 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.830
 the group was founded a couple of 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.960
 years ago because I want to be a pilot 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.470
 I wanted to group in a whole page 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.080
 my 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.780
 my pilot friends you have become in 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.600
 many are now 12 thousand people 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.360
 of every game of the world pilots of each 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.430
 gender and degree from the ultralights to 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.130
 model aircraft and general aviation 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.130
 military pilots and so on 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.430
 the infiniti is a patrol of airplanes 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.440
 obviously advanced ultralights that 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.560
 it takes its cue from the innovations that are there 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.050
 been on the subject of training flights 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.750
 by the rocklab doing a course 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.180
 that you can access a small one 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.580
 patrol is a small patrol below 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.930
 the age point of view but not 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.970
 small from the point of view of the 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.820
 numbers because the first patrol of 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.260
 ultralight armani composed of twelve 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.290
 aircraft are twelve aircraft 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.820
 almost all ultralights all the same 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.009
 with the same services of course 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.330
 to maintain flight parameters that 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.290
 are equal for everyone and therefore able to 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.940
 fly safely 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.860
 the important thing of the children of the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.920
 message he wants to bring and of course 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.709
 that can also be done with 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.540
 ultralight an important thing in 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.580
 they have a very composed way 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.340
 then defined the tricolor darts then 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.050
 with all due respect, of course 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.760
 arrows of color that we always have 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.260
 I do n't say in my heart but we have it 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.989
 within infinities because one of the 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.519
 of our pilots and the commander de 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.290
 rinaldis generale de rinaldis that is 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.760
 was commander of the three-colored arrows 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.180
 there are also other drivers who have 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.549
 made part of the greatest formation 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.230
 Italian of course from us pilots 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.030
 that we come absolutely from the civil 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.019
 we always try to steal the most 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.120
 The maximum possible is possible 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.100
 especially on safety because the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.720
 which they always tell us they do 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.220
 who taught us from the beginning 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.970
 fly handsome information and a single 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.000
 airplane 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.239
 but it is a thing to do with a lot of head the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.829
 thing 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.440
 the last thing I want to say about 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.790
 infiniti is the beating heart of the 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.190
 training that a woman has before 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.829
 valentina papa is a military pilot 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.180
 she is also valentina and our leader is 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.180
 the number one training leader 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.940
 we have administrators one of the 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.290
 which is william peruzzi that the instructor 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.240
 flight of this view 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.690
 surface of terni you see 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.730
 beautiful that gave me strength and 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.440
 courage and support in everything in everything 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.260
 this then the aero that of terni 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.130
 obviously came to this project 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.440
 and helping us is a group in all this 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.770
 so strong so numerous 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.090
 I imagine it will also have others 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.620
 initiatives will also want to promote 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.240
 other initiatives I have seen in general 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.890
 landi, for example, who spoke of 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.230
 flight safety will continue on 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.520
 this road is not and I suppose so yes 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.430
 given the success we have achieved 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.310
 in these days I assume that that 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.709
 continue you talked about carlo landi 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.050
 I would like to say a few words because I carlo 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.360
 he is a friend first of all but takes care of 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.370
 a topic that is very much we say 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.550
 important for us pilots precisely the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.770
 general flight safety what it is to fly 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.330
 sure it's a project that was born a little 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:21.660
 as such a wish came to mine 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.490
 colleagues to myself to pass those 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.100
 which are our knowledge and skills 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.540
 our experiences in military flight and 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.730
 in professional flight 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.620
 to the pilots of the general aviation of the 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.540
 qds that is to those who fly to 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.130
 passion especially knowledge 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.090
 addressed to the prevention of 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.710
 accidents in order to improve the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.530
 quality of flight of these 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.140
 pilots what the common factors are 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.500
 can lead to accidents but 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.840
 today it is now the science of 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.480
 flight and safety prevention 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.330
 very advanced and it is established that over 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.880
 60 70 percent of accidents are 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.860
 due to the human factor ie not so much 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.140
 to the car not so much to breaks or to 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.490
 malfunctions as much as ad 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.640
 piloting errors 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.560
 or deficiencies on the part of others 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.150
 elements that are not just pilots who 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.740
 however they intervene in the flight or the 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.030
 maintenance or the same equipment 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.980
 that have limitations 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.410
 so it is important and prepare the 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.990
 pilot especially those of aviation 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.360
 general of vds that do not have structures 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.670
 important kg that can protect them 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.660
 to personally build a culture 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.490
 of the flight we wanted to make small 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.340
 safety stacks 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.470
 what do you really want to say yes to in 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.970
 europe is also very active in the sector 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.780
 of safety prevention e 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.300
 this must be said 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.040
 they had complimented just for 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.140
 we are starting this 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.330
 collaboration with safe flying 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.850
 we will prepare very little videos 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.940
 court 23 minutes so they can 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.460
 be seen at any time 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.500
 by pilots in which in each of them 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.810
 we will give indications on how 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.030
 face particular situations 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.190
 during the flight or in preparation for 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.320
 flight that equally important in addition to 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.870
 what you are already doing as others 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:18.610
 initiatives could be taken 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:21.280
 to join pilots to fly safe has in 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.950
 project and in these days we will put it 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.870
 online is a project to create a site 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.180
 internet that will be called just flying 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.760
 safe with our new new emblem 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.170
 official and on this site the pilots 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.540
 they will all be able to intervene but 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.610
 above all they will find find 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.350
 as already happens in part on the 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.940
 facebook page that we always have 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.800
 fly safe 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.390
 will be able to find all the material that 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.940
 he needs them to prepare their own well 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.010
 flight both technically and 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.810
 from the planning point of view 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.210
 and both weather information and 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.120
 above all they will be able to find some 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.860
 qualified interlocutors like mine 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.270
 colleagues who help me flock safely 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.870
 who will answer all of them 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.060
 questions 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.790
 safety first and this 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.930
 we wanted strongly present in 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.330
 this hard hour 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.850
 we will continue on this street I assume 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.730
 because we have already also requests for 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.940
 other airfields to do this 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.560
 initiative precisely elsewhere because 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.590
 it would be nice to do it in itinerant and 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.750
 create a more involving 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.180
 people as possible more regions possible 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.950
 we rifle europe will try to follow you 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.770
 to tell throughout Europe 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.470
 these things and make it clear that the pilots in 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.000
 italy are busy and try to 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.030
 stay together as much as possible for 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.170
 be a force to better represent 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:42.220
 one's passion one's interests e 

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.820
 what the world of aeronautics that 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.810
 needs to be repositioned I believe 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.120
 do you agree 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.919
 absolutely yes thanks a lot of 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.870
 participation because you too 

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:55.240
 delle faiulo then sees given a nice one 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:58.380
 contribution being here with us today 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.380
 thank you
