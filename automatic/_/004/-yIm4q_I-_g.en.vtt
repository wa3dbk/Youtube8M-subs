00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
if the car started to slide it would

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.790 
if the car started to slide it would
pick<00:03:03.540> up<00:03:03.690> for<00:03:03.900> me<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.290> would<00:03:04.410> keep<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.740> on

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
as soon as I turn that off though it

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.870 
as soon as I turn that off though it
handled<00:03:07.350> exactly<00:03:07.740> like<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:08.100> track<00:03:08.400> car<00:03:08.580> and

Utes<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.240> braking<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.840> have<00:03:13.110> to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
Utes and the braking you have to

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.390 
Utes and the braking you have to
actually<00:03:13.380> break<00:03:13.680> really<00:03:13.950> hard<00:03:14.190> into<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
actually break really hard into the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.980 
actually break really hard into the
corner<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.910> get<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.090> weight<00:03:15.240> transferred<00:03:15.780> so

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
corner to get the weight transferred so

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.120

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
that you can actually get it around that

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.520 
that you can actually get it around that
corner<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.240> brakes<00:03:18.480> were<00:03:18.720> unfolded<00:03:19.290> it

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
corner and the brakes were unfolded it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.830 
corner and the brakes were unfolded it
