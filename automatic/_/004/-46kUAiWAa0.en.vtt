00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
 to progress to international football the first FC Nuremberg in continuity one 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.409
 right we are 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:09.819
 Winfried Padberg 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.819
 first goal finish 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.119
 is dangerous 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.750
 that is why they are not entirely harmless, especially the private ones 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.109
 our most interesting 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.480
 the equity that this is so is much smaller 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.039
 Number one in the world the criticism of the party until the 27 meters goal removal 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.349
 Companies 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.020
 this los Billerbeck Lobo 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.579
 not come Jan the outpost evaluates for the 2 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.579
 Mainz Lewis Holtby first on the down 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.229
 the Mainzers 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.689
 tactically very disciplined and openly ask them to André Schürrle 

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:51.440
 fails to all of war III shepherd twenty-fifth minute 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.440
 in 4 2 2 Tuchel costs his team 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.910
 Marty sent to this meadow 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.120
 controlled one stood compactly it unsolicited on the individual 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.260
 Quality Christian Fuchs 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.520
 hip-hop Switzerland good chances 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.730
 left lying 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.890
 The club has Dr 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.729
 to get into the game to develop chances to score completely out of the game 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.140
 different means last 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.520
 so 35 minutes drew to see that the centrality of the scoring clear 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.590
 on page Dr 05 o'clock give Langquaid great feed of pupils and Torben p 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.590
 so threatens just before banks 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.690
 and the assistants 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 nowadays also dangerous flyers in front of cyber-ark 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.550
 Markus Decker Abbas is a graduate but Maria leaves so the boss on the court left the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.070
 Card of course 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.499
 it stuck small June 2 started passage two 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:55.750
 Mainz back to a good chance this time is alive 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.600
 after all, these two-sided best away team were 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.130
 VMware from Bundesliga the team of Dieter Hecking had more possession over than 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.129
 But 60 percent of them do not develop much from Nuremberg 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.129
 Pinola's mistake left hidden behind 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:17.119
 and my second place with Caligiuri and that's more beautiful 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.639
 Steuble and what to say as a commentator on the car ddp you can 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.479
 ever Max of Thomas Tuchel shipping next to his 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.519
 Of course, that was a great opportunity for them to be next to many of them 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.959
 play 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.999
 André 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.399
 the funniest minute 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:44.969
 therefore set Mühlberg great second round disciplines 24 counters 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.219
 small alpine republic 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.719
 but basically forward 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.899
 Not much roots 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.599
 they returned to overtake Mainz 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.349
 Specification of the hole 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.370
 not too much a system of Beijing Qin Gang go like that 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.089
 Stoppage time and struggling 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:07.239
 he is normal high explosive and interesting the long slag front Chev 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.239
 why suddenly 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.339
 see the hand play of the Kurt Lage 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:18.439
 it was all over 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.599
 October of the world 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.229
 Ulrich Laux and free kick Leo 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.559
 the assistant z 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:25.949
 instead of on the 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.009
 if the EU is wrong 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.659
 cheap valued to this scene all this 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.569
 that would have certainly been seen but that is 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.349
 in 4th place 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.609
 Korte threw Yang Dankert on this position so nothing is up 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:41.639
 at 0 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.069
 2 044 of the area for Nuremberg 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.439
 for FSV Mainz 05 4
