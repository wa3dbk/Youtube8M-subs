00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.550 
will Andale basically a level you up
really<00:01:12.030> quickly<00:01:12.330> probably<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.840> best<00:01:13.020> area<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
really quickly probably the best area in

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.410 
really quickly probably the best area in
Midgar<00:01:14.010> before<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.939> outside

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
Midgar before you actually get outside

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
bit this first reactor is that reactor

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.469 
bit this first reactor is that reactor
to<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.619> I've<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.520> heard<00:01:21.180> levels

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
to do it in I've actually heard levels

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.240
