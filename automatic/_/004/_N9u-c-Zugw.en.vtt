the choconuvo go and do that which is

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.410 
the choconuvo go and do that which is
quite<00:01:31.829> term<00:01:32.159> quite<00:01:32.880> nice<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> him<00:01:33.329> actually

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
quite term quite nice of him actually

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.340 
quite term quite nice of him actually
and<00:01:33.750> i'll<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:34.470> more<00:01:34.740> about<00:01:35.040> him<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.350> guide

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and i'll do more about him in the guide

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
and i'll do more about him in the guide
shall<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.740> doing<00:01:37.950> about<00:01:38.159> him<00:01:38.430> very<00:01:38.759> very<00:01:39.030> soon

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
shall be doing about him very very soon

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.980

so<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.369> chalk<00:01:42.030> system<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
so this is the chalk system and it is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
so this is the chalk system and it is
quite<00:01:43.259> an<00:01:43.350> interesting<00:01:43.619> system<00:01:44.040> although

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
quite an interesting system although

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
quite an interesting system although
it's<00:01:45.060> fairly<00:01:45.450> tedious<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.409> obviously

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
it's fairly tedious because obviously
