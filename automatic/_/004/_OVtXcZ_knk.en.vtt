00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
going to go that's my in point now I'll

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.590 
going to go that's my in point now I'll
just<00:03:28.220> set<00:03:28.400> my<00:03:28.519> input<00:03:28.820> i<00:03:28.850> can<00:03:29.030> go<00:03:29.120> anywhere<00:03:29.420> on

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
just set my input i can go anywhere on

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.600 
just set my input i can go anywhere on
the<00:03:29.690> timeline<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.650> then<00:03:30.799> set<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.220> out<00:03:31.340> point

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
the timeline to then set the out point

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.789 
the timeline to then set the out point
so<00:03:31.940> i<00:03:31.970> find<00:03:32.299> where<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:32.450> is<00:03:32.690> i<00:03:32.930> might<00:03:33.530> want<00:03:33.650> to

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
so i find where that is i might want to

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.150 
so i find where that is i might want to
