00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:20.750
 very good we are all in reactions 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.789
 season number 3 if finally 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.169
 we come to this season that both 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.360
 They were waiting and they were so 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.990
 asking for the trailer I stay a little 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.820
 well I have to say there are many who 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.379
 they gave like and that is what I like the most 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.839
 that you did want this 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.970
 happen and here we are in the first 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:40.190
 episode this season that for me 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.900
 it's going to be an amazing season besides 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.270
 of what 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.890
 as I said in the trailer they are not going to 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.930
 have scores or is this just what 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.450
 I'm just going to react the video I'm going to 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.600
 talk about him and that will be all because no 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.490
 it felt like to score 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.310
 something that someone else did the truth is 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.950
 that is not as fair do not say to me not 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.300
 I would like you to score 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.220
 some bad score or some 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.800
 average score something that I did that 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.300
 it cost me a lot to do or is it something 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.850
 unfair you will understand what I am 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.580
 saying so good I decided to eliminate 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.860
 the scores and I usually leave the video 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.050
 so without saying more we are going to 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.570
 start this not the first video of the 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.060
 season will be spider in counter of the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.580
 mark animation is clear yes so 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.360
 good more than saying let's start and 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.360
 this in 321 that the video starts 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.430
 what we have is the hunger james jones 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.430
 a damaging full speed 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.189
 okay 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.840
 because we have the zombie lenderman this 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.840
 memories 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.200
 now my question is where is 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.670
 s 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.670
 here someone is missing 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.430
 plus 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.430
 here someone is missing 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.710
 beautiful 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.060
 I wanted to see this for a long time 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.990
 order they put an animation 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.050
 ok hello 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.350
 they are looking for it now now everything is 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.350
 obvious 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.380
 because I loved that 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.110
 I loved that 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.840
 and now how do you take it off 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.410
 oh, poor, my friends, line 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.130
 what happened 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.130
 and diamonds 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.920
 or 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.230
 they do not have captured 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.700
 if that was easy 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.890
 to fly 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.790
 by God get out of there fast all 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.790
 all 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:31.470
 to be hidden from the compression 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.470
 type of food 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.020
 so that sometimes 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.020
 not out there not contagion 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.870
 okay 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.230
 to deal with now if we run it can not be 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.310
 in the scene of the doors 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.310
 I saw this every time 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.110
 the teachers 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:04.680
 I hate photos and not the button 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:07.640
 they had constant pain 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.640
 I can not be here 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.950
 that is, he only throws it alone 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.269
 perfect good 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.870
 Oh my God 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.870
 goodbye 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.810
 and they succeeded 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.330
 a bone to hurt 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.800
 as always an excellent animation or 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.440
 be a serious applause 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.070
 a serial applause from uau 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.960
 he did an excellent job I love 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.960
 ok let's talk about this have 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.409
 it's good that better than a video like that 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.289
 to start a season or it was a 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.639
 excellent video I give my applause that is 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:08.449
 I give him 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:12.590
 a video that I seriously seriously 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.630
 loved you it was like there was action from 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.840
 start to the end 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.180
 perhaps they saw the scene discovered that 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.680
 scene is typical or that scene if 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:28.060
 lack does not have to do an animation like that 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.060
 my god 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.090
 ok I still do not know how he does it I do not know 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.319
 making animations must be very difficult 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.289
 I think they spend a lot of time 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:42.349
 doing them because I think since I think 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.719
 that the last one was months ago that he did 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.220
 that was a wijchen counter or something 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:51.560
 A) Yes 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:54.130
 yes so good this was fun 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.390
 I entertained myself too much with this video and 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.760
 this was the beginning of the season 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.250
 that I think is going to be epic so 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.840
 good with nothing more to say I hope that 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.450
 this episode of reactions has 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.100
 liked if you liked likes and 97,000 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.800
 your comment and if not then do not leave anything 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.600
 weird electro that says goodbye to God there 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.060
 they tell me in the comments to what more 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.890
 they want me to react later because it is 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.980
 a season that is just beginning and 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:23.530
 I 've run out of ideas already so 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.530
 good how smart goodbye goodbye
