00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.369
 one of my hobby horses in navigation 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.230
 on the engine is hammering on the core of the 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.910
 matter to be able to joke so many and 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.829
 sit in such a device 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.360
 The core of the matter is navigation and to 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.500
 You must be able to navigate the screen properly 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.449
 can read 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.610
 so that screen readability is 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.500
 just very important and moreover 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.750
 since we were on the motorbike they already got it 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.190
 love driving with beautiful weather and that we 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.170
 sit completely open and that sun of all 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.489
 Either way the device may seem is 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.480
 Also notably readability in 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.430
 sunlight 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.410
 just basic of interest to one 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.059
 good motor navigation 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.649
 so also the big difference beyond the 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.510
 smartphone as often as the sun stand still 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.760
 shines then you see no more thunder well 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.280
 busty readability with the zumo 660 at 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.910
 the 350 with the 550 as well as with the tomtom 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.649
 rider 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.629
 quite nice but we also saw 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.640
 gradually you can do better too 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.960
 look at a volt each other and montana 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.340
 yes it reflects more but 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.660
 nevertheless, that readability is that 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.280
 I really thought it was better I got the 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.390
 order them once made a video of it 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.009
 driving 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.050
 well that is rolling video of 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.240
 readability in sunlight and a tricky one 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.679
 story certainly if you have 4 devices with 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.869
 want to compare each other so I have 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.700
 done something improvised 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.679
 moreover , just emphasize that it is here 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.990
 is about the spring sun and groin anyway 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.940
 weather with different than the summer sun and all 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.989
 completely different than the summer sun 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.420
 Spain 

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:32.440
 let alone the low autumn sun, well then 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.119
 we have to wait another half year 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.920
 but good for that 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.479
 comments I have the devices 7 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.729
 juxtaposed for comparison 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.610
 really go to practice sometime 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.229
 see what that yields 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.840
 look here will list especially wants 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.390
 I just show where the sun is now 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.580
 which is therefore as it were, at an angle of 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.739
 to shine at the top and when I'm from 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.690
 this position those screens separately 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:58.569
 let's look in this case the 350 de 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.550
 660 the 590 and the under the rider then see 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.920
 you know that they are all pretty good 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.660
 readable 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.610
 I now really put my head, as it were 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.810
 on the saddle of the motorcycle yes then 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.050
 it's very different and then you actually see it 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.910
 that only the 590 remains legible 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.830
 well you will in practice of course 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.450
 never do and therefore also the perspective 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.430
 with which you look at the screen also 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.799
 of influence but assume of me in this 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.900
 case it is really about the direction of 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:27.040
 the in shining 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.349
 And yes, you really already see one now 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.450
 difference arise 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.489
 you have 95 this is 590 remains good 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.129
 upright now again from above then see 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.340
 you that even the 350 lower left a little better 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:43.840
 is then the rest but actually be 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.640
 all of them quite easy to read and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.319
 then we look again from below 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.150
 yes then the case changes and then you see 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.099
 that actually only those 590 over and over 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.799
 remains the tomtom we see nothing 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.840
 660 we see very little and the 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.790
 350 although a bit but also level 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.200
 while the here can still be fine 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.579
 navigate 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.470
 but well again that is natural 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.000
 not as you normally drive the motor then 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.799
 do you put yourself or not on the saddle this is 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.510
 much more a real setup it 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.489
 device is upright and in this case the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.129
 sun from behind and then you see it 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.810
 590 excellent blood but the 350 in this case 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.579
 at least as good and maybe even 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.670
 for better, what clearer and what 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.560
 contrasted image both are in themselves 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.819
 easy to read and also if you have the tomtom 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.349
 rider is wrong 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.819
 yes then you would even think that 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.739
 drive maybe a little better 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.480
 readable it is already slightly less 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.819
 mirroring but that can also come through 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.129
 the place where I stand is the moment 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.190
 fact is both are just fine 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.720
 readable , however, that becomes very different 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.120
 if we just pick up the engine 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.549
 and turn around and the sunlight obliquely 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.849
 let it shine behind just watch it 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.859
 I here with the zumo 660 and then you see 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.769
 a once a huge difference you 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.530
 sunlight now comes as ware from 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.769
 diagonally from the back and then you see 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.199
 that the 590 is infinitely easier to read 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.060
 like that 660 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.319
 these are really differences that matter 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.609
 do in practice 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.129
 this is with the 660 we go this 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.799
 compare with what it is 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.699
 younger zumo 350 and we put that 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.709
 next to it 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:14.109
 then you can see that the 350 is something 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.549
 is easier to read than the 660 and that 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.269
 contrast the green that you see now 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.400
 also an image 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.720
 but you compare to each other 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.240
 now comes in a child's light background 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.460
 that fully 590 at once 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.400
 are straight and then you see that he is 350 a 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.650
 scores much better 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.340
 the essence of the matter is that 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.200
 590 handles trance much better 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.300
 flexibility of the screen with others 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.370
 words that he has the incident sunlight 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.710
 used for lighting 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.120
 I even have the relief of that here 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.520
 590 all the way 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.660
 disabled and then I can do it 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.280
 read the screen properly 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.900
 but then he must be without really full 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.070
 inschijnen look like I'm here now 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.290
 to the settings 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.000
 then you will see if you pay attention 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.960
 too critical on schedule is zero 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.150
 per cent 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.650
 brightness 0% and if the uptick yes then 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.210
 can I move up again then see 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.670
 you do get a little brighter but that 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.140
 difference is not even true in this position 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.250
 very big 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.140
 and then I will leave the sun again 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.090
 register yes then you will see the whole one again 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.470
 good problems already readability of 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.210
 just now 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.980
 Well, finally, we are going to use the device 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.770
 just compare with the big competitor 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.600
 the tomtom rider wide image yes 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.490
 clear and what you also very clear 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.260
 Here it is that sun visor what 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.880
 on top of that rider is big nonsense 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.350
 that it is not the sun at all 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.970
 that is causing you problems 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.710
 I really have to get up here right now 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.270
 look from the front then I see the driver 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.670
 still something but you see very clearly 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.670
 that that 590 scores a lot better 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.170
 as we mentioned readability 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.970
 sunlight on the engine is normal 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.640
 extremely important for the engine 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.100
 navigation system and first with the 590 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.780
 significantly better than at all 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.400
 competitors in the market and 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.710
 although it is the most expensive 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.590
 device and it costs 200 euros more than 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.200
 for example a zumo 390 but alone 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.020
 this aspect is separate from all other issues 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.210
 for me personally an absolute reason to 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.660
 to opt for that 95 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.660
 Thanks for the attention
