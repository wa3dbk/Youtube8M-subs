00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.960
 gigantic equipment that does not stop working for a minute the mills 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.400
 jorge lacerda work 24 hours are responsible for 8% of energy 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400
 produced in the country 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.849
 the jorge lacerda complex does not stop 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.929
 the process of power generation involved 340 employees 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.530
 begins with the transportation of coal into the plants 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.890
 the procedure is done was a set of treadmills that works 24 hours 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.840
 each mill consumes on average 400 tons of ore per day 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.490
 the coal 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.820
 traveled by a tangle of conveyor belts 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.950
 until it turns into useful energy time 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.650
 placing the group already has stage responsible for the three plants 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.680
 in the position of the country's largest private generator 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.829
 accounting for 8% of all energy produced in Brazil 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.770
 bia through this tunnel with more than half a kilometer of extension what I want 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.850
 I am going to enter the outside of 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.540
 into the plant can be transformed into heat this year the energy 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.990
 after arriving at the cinema the coal is deposited 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.070
 evenly invested stored 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 controlled by a wind team that regulates the distribution 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.050
 prior to starting the combustion process 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.140
 thermoelectric power in brazil is considered complicated 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.260
 since the main source of the national system continues to be the 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.910
 hydroelectric 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.260
 even so 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.770
 all the energy that will be produced in the country's thermoelectric plants until the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.120
 2010 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.120
 already purchased by the national operator 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.590
 the amount of coking coal it stores from a plant's parade 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:15.549
 as father jorge lacerda 2 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.919
 is enough to ensure pure thermal production eight hours faith 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.619
 still in the raw state 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.729
 coal needs to be demolished and Fri to Sun 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.809
 before being burned 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.499
 for this the complex has 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.499
 nicodemo indians the dryers 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.459
 coal after woman said 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.099
 he then directed the area of ​​the burners on foot 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:46.680
 where he then interest was mixed with the area of ​​interest in the furnace 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:51.249
 processed in the system packs the coal matters and finally in the boilers 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:55.239
 everything will depend on the burners reaches fifteen hundred grams 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.849
 the ore burned generating heat 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.409
 What will heat the water? 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.670
 transforming attacks that drive the set of turbines generating 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.459
 energy 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.390
 the profession but transferred to a modern substation 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.359
 built in the park são jorge lacerda 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:15.399
 then 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:19.869
 there will be several national distribution systems controlled by 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.869
 eletrosul 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.360
 one of the by-products of the beneficiation of coal 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.919
 this instant 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.489
 after completion 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.909
 she is a university student 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.270
 these tanks 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.320
 the product is sent to the center of the country and used as one of the 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.430
 raw material 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.439
 in the manufacture of cement 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.509
 per day 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:50.059
