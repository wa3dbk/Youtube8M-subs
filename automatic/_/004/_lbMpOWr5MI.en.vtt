side<00:02:08.630> effect<00:02:08.989> basically<00:02:09.619> just<00:02:09.649> take<00:02:10.069> two<00:02:10.399> a

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
side effect basically just take two a

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.600 
side effect basically just take two a
day<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:11.000> pretty<00:02:11.540> much<00:02:11.690> stayed<00:02:12.140> very<00:02:12.620> consistent

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
day I pretty much stayed very consistent

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.030 
day I pretty much stayed very consistent
taking<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.209> every<00:02:14.569> single<00:02:14.959> day<00:02:15.110> they're<00:02:15.800> kind

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
taking to every single day they're kind

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.210 
taking to every single day they're kind
of<00:02:16.190> big<00:02:17.440> but<00:02:18.940> yeah<00:02:20.050> kind<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.170> big<00:02:21.470> if<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.010> can

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
of big but yeah kind of big if you can

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.120 
of big but yeah kind of big if you can
see<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:26.420> they're<00:02:26.959> really<00:02:27.470> easy<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.890> swallow

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
see but they're really easy to swallow

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.130 
see but they're really easy to swallow
because<00:02:28.430> they're<00:02:28.819> kind<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.209> fact<00:02:29.569> that<00:02:29.840> they

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
because they're kind of fact that they

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.610 
because they're kind of fact that they
got<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.440> little<00:02:30.590> gel<00:02:31.840> coating<00:02:32.840> around<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
got the little gel coating around the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.220 
got the little gel coating around the
outside<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.120> they're<00:02:35.269> really<00:02:35.420> easy<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.959> chase

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
outside so they're really easy to chase

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.229 
outside so they're really easy to chase
I<00:02:36.500> take<00:02:36.709> two<00:02:36.950> at<00:02:37.069> once<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.640> don't<00:02:37.819> have<00:02:38.090> any
