fifty grams to two hundred grams

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.050 
fifty grams to two hundred grams
depending<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.950> sweetness<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.640> your

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
depending on the sweetness of your

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.890 
depending on the sweetness of your
berries<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.320> taste<00:01:37.619> them<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.159> they're<00:01:38.900> really

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
berries so taste them if they're really

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.539 
berries so taste them if they're really
sweet<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:40.530> some<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.860> them<00:01:40.979> are<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.400> could

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
sweet which some of them are you could

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.539 
sweet which some of them are you could
probably<00:01:41.790> use<00:01:42.030> less<00:01:42.329> sugar<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.340> if<00:01:44.340> they're<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
probably use less sugar and if they're a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.660 
probably use less sugar and if they're a
little<00:01:44.880> tangy<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.840> add<00:01:46.380> more<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.490> can

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
little tangy then add more you can

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.639 
little tangy then add more you can
always<00:01:47.820> adjust<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.540> sugar<00:01:48.780> later<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.409> well

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
always adjust your sugar later as well

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.319 
always adjust your sugar later as well
and<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.299> will<00:01:51.450> need<00:01:51.659> some<00:01:52.200> water<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.369> like

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and then you will need some water I like

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.780 
and then you will need some water I like
to<00:01:54.509> add<00:01:54.630> about<00:01:54.869> 2/3<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.649> cup<00:01:55.680> hundred<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.340> 60

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to add about 2/3 of a cup hundred and 60

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.999 
to add about 2/3 of a cup hundred and 60
milliliters<00:01:57.180> disap<00:01:57.659> water<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:58.860> you're

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
milliliters disap water now if you're

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.700 
milliliters disap water now if you're
using<00:01:59.040> frozen<00:02:00.030> though<00:02:00.240> blueberries<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.290> find

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
using frozen though blueberries I find

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.889 
using frozen though blueberries I find
because<00:02:01.829> there<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> lot<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> water<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.119> kind

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
because there is a lot of water I kind

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.260 
because there is a lot of water I kind
of<00:02:03.960> tend<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.040> cut<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.369> water<00:02:05.790> back<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.060> at

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
of tend to cut that water back to at

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.020 
of tend to cut that water back to at
least<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> half<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.170> cup<00:02:07.200> 120<00:02:08.129> milliliters

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.230 

then<00:02:11.209> we<00:02:12.170> will<00:02:12.440> need<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:13.040> like<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.520> add<00:02:13.640> like

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
then we will need I like to add like

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.910 
then we will need I like to add like
just<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.720> pinch<00:02:15.020> like<00:02:15.260> an<00:02:15.500> eighth<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.830> a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
just a pinch like an eighth of a

what we want this to do is cook away at
a<00:03:12.830> simmer<00:03:13.340> until<00:03:15.190> we<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.489> juices<00:03:17.329> thicken<00:03:18.019> the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
a simmer until we the juices thicken the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.490 
a simmer until we the juices thicken the
blueberries<00:03:18.829> start<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.310> break<00:03:19.549> down<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:20.500> the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
blueberries start to break down and the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.620 
blueberries start to break down and the
law<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.890> course<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.400> longer<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:23.030> cook<00:03:23.329> this

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
law of course the longer you cook this

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.460 
law of course the longer you cook this
the<00:03:24.019> more<00:03:24.260> thick<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.400> sauce<00:03:25.700> will<00:03:26.150> be<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:27.079> I

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
the more thick the sauce will be so I

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.270 
the more thick the sauce will be so I
find<00:03:28.250> at<00:03:28.459> least<00:03:28.489> ten<00:03:29.120> minutes<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.900> just<00:03:30.280> judge

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
find at least ten minutes and just judge

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.810 
find at least ten minutes and just judge
by<00:03:31.870> how<00:03:32.870> thick<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.590> want<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.070> be<00:03:34.220> but<00:03:34.459> the

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
by how thick you want it to be but the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.360 
by how thick you want it to be but the
juices<00:03:35.360> should<00:03:35.390> be<00:03:35.870> clear<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.590> nice<00:03:36.920> and

thick<00:03:43.209> ok<00:03:44.209> that<00:03:44.570> looks<00:03:44.810> good<00:03:45.489> this<00:03:46.489> is<00:03:46.730> about

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
thick ok that looks good this is about

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.810 
thick ok that looks good this is about
after<00:03:47.540> 10<00:03:47.930> minutes<00:03:48.320> so<00:03:48.920> I'm<00:03:49.040> happy<00:03:49.310> with<00:03:49.489> this

it in jar and put it in the fridge it'd

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.090
