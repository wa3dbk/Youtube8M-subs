00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
well early which we did building a good

well early which we did building a good
lead<00:00:28.950> early<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.309> in<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> game<00:00:29.579> and<00:00:29.879> a<00:00:30.029> half

time<00:00:30.540> so<00:00:31.200> again<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.399> thought<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.790> played<00:00:32.940> well

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149

time so again I thought we played well
on<00:00:33.239> both<00:00:33.329> sides<00:00:33.629> of<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> ball<00:00:33.989> we've

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
on both sides of the ball we've

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.900 
on both sides of the ball we've
corrected<00:00:35.039> a<00:00:35.219> lot<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.460> things<00:00:35.610> over<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.879> last

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
corrected a lot of things over the last

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.520 
corrected a lot of things over the last
several<00:00:36.180> weeks<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> hopefully<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.320> hit<00:00:37.379> my

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
several weeks so I hopefully we hit my

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.709 
several weeks so I hopefully we hit my
best<00:00:37.739> football<00:00:38.039> right<00:00:38.219> now<00:00:38.390> talk<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:39.420> both

just<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> fourth<00:00:41.640> time<00:00:41.730> ever<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.239> had<00:00:42.329> 300

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
just the fourth time ever we had 300

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.479 
just the fourth time ever we had 300

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.740 
yards passing in 200 yards rushing and
that<00:00:44.640> was<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.790> big<00:00:44.970> part<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.420> talk<00:00:45.720> about

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that was a big part of that talk about

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.260 
that was a big part of that talk about
you<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> throwing<00:00:47.400> of<00:00:47.520> Robbie<00:00:47.730> meny<00:00:48.060> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you know the throwing of Robbie meny and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.180 
you know the throwing of Robbie meny and
how<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.450> passing<00:00:49.020> game<00:00:49.200> really<00:00:49.800> opened<00:00:50.130> up

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
how that passing game really opened up

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.090 
how that passing game really opened up
last<00:00:50.370> week<00:00:51.200> that<00:00:52.200> maybe<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.860> we're<00:00:52.950> most

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
last week that maybe think we're most

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.470 
last week that maybe think we're most
enthusiastic<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.850> right<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> thought

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
enthusiastic about right now I thought

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.270 
enthusiastic about right now I thought
we<00:00:54.570> threw<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.810> ball<00:00:54.899> very<00:00:54.960> well<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:56.130> played

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
we threw the ball very well we played

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.220 
we threw the ball very well we played
against<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> good<00:00:56.700> secondary<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.540> Robbie<00:00:58.050> made

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
against a good secondary and Robbie made

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.720 
against a good secondary and Robbie made
some<00:00:58.350> great<00:00:58.530> decisions<00:00:58.980> guys<00:00:59.370> made<00:00:59.579> some

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
some great decisions guys made some

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
some great decisions guys made some
great<00:00:59.910> catches<00:01:00.120> ran<00:01:00.570> after<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.989> catch<00:01:01.170> well

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
great catches ran after the catch well

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
great catches ran after the catch well
so<00:01:02.100> there's<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> lot<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> positives<00:01:03.120> coming<00:01:03.390> out

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
so there's a lot of positives coming out

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.789 
so there's a lot of positives coming out
of<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> needed<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.290> done<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
of that but it needed to be done it's a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.249 
of that but it needed to be done it's a
very<00:01:04.979> good<00:01:05.100> defense<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:06.960> can't

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259

our<00:02:35.980> best<00:02:36.010> football<00:02:36.340> right<00:02:36.640> now<00:02:36.790> in<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.940> end

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
our best football right now in the end

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.340 
our best football right now in the end
of<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.239> season<00:02:37.420> our<00:02:37.780> offensive<00:02:38.080> line<00:02:38.200> has

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350

last two years being somewhere 19 and
one<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:45.410> think<00:04:45.740> in<00:04:45.860> our<00:04:46.160> regular<00:04:46.580> season<00:04:46.910> record

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
one I think in our regular season record

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.800 
one I think in our regular season record
but<00:04:48.260> um<00:04:48.440> it's<00:04:48.740> it's<00:04:48.980> rewarding<00:04:49.700> at<00:04:50.270> this<00:04:50.510> point

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810
