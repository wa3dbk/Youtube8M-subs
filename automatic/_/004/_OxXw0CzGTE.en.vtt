00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
one up and it looked funny this was my

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.970 
one up and it looked funny this was my
first<00:00:27.449> time<00:00:27.720> using<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> looked<00:00:28.560> fun<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980

looks<00:00:29.010> manly<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> decided<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> give<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
looks manly so I decided to give it a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.130 
looks manly so I decided to give it a
try<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.309> get<00:00:32.550> three<00:00:32.790> kills<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> three

try and I get three kills I get a three

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.290 
try and I get three kills I get a three
kill<00:00:34.410> streak<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.579> clip<00:00:35.820> was<00:00:36.000> great

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
kill streak so this clip was great

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.240 
kill streak so this clip was great
because<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.930> only<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.350> three<00:00:37.649> shots

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
because you only have three shots

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.560 
because you only have three shots
so<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.480> MK<00:00:40.170> 32<00:00:40.649> was<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> very<00:00:41.219> effective<00:00:41.579> three

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so this MK 32 was a very effective three

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.410 
so this MK 32 was a very effective three
shots<00:00:42.840> three<00:00:43.110> kills<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> second<00:00:45.239> clip
