this the video going to that little um
little<00:00:33.030> zoomed<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.670> overall<00:00:36.210> it'll<00:00:36.600> be

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
little zoomed in but overall it'll be

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.630 
little zoomed in but overall it'll be
the<00:00:36.870> same<00:00:37.730> okay<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> box<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.100> box<00:00:41.129> says

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the same okay so the box the box says

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:55.340 
the same okay so the box the box says
pull<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.239> tabs<00:00:42.510> okay<00:00:53.510> pull<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> tabs<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:51.180 
pull the tabs okay pull the tabs on the
others<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:04.140> I'll<00:01:05.010> lift

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.340 

so<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:52.220> kind<00:01:52.940> of<00:01:53.000> just<00:01:53.150> like<00:01:53.330> took<00:01:54.050> all<00:01:54.200> the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
so I kind of just like took all the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.820 
so I kind of just like took all the
parts<00:01:54.650> where<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:56.000> was<00:01:56.720> on<00:01:56.930> like<00:01:57.350> taking<00:01:57.680> out<00:01:57.710> the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
parts where I was on like taking out the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.560 
parts where I was on like taking out the
box<00:01:58.009> actually<00:01:58.250> cause<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:58.970> was<00:01:59.090> pretty<00:01:59.390> tricky

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
box actually cause it was pretty tricky

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.410 
box actually cause it was pretty tricky
but<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:00.470> managed<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:00.920> do<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:02.030> switched

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
but I managed to do it and I switched

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.150 
but I managed to do it and I switched
the<00:02:02.660> camera<00:02:03.080> angle<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:03.440> you<00:02:03.470> can<00:02:03.650> see<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:03.830> little

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
the camera angle so you can see a little

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.949 
the camera angle so you can see a little
more<00:02:06.130> now<00:02:07.130> mind<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.729> me<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.209> TV<00:02:08.780> is
