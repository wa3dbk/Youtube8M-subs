00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.950
 Hi, I'm the good doctor and this is 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.380
 medicine clarifies your channel of 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 medicine on the internet today we are going to talk 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.420
 of cardiopulmonary resuscitation 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.480
 pediatric is the resuscitation that 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.360
 you have to perform the children according to 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.910
 the recommendations of the year 2010 the 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.369
 Pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation is 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.540
 was going to differentiate in under one year and 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.410
 between children of 1 and 8 years but 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.360
 us to do it here in a way 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.150
 didactic we will not take into account 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.390
 these ages except for the realization 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.090
 of cardiac compressions first thing 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.440
 that we have to keep in mind is that the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.719
 cardiorespiratory arrest in children is 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.120
 different from that of adults while 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.910
 that adults tend to be because of problems 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.820
 cardiac diseases, mainly heart disease 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.950
 ischemic acute myocardial infarction in 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.580
 children is usually because of problems 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.750
 respiratory with which the steps that 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.300
 you have to continue for resuscitation 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.760
 cardiopulmonary diseases are different from 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.270
 adult 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.640
 in the absence of a baby or a child to see 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.440
 the algorithm performing the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.180
 cardiopulmonary resuscitation since I've 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.510
 brought to irene irene is the doll 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.490
 my daughter's favorite that will serve us 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.380
 to see what are the steps that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.750
 we have to perform a resuscitation 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.940
 cardiopulmonary the algorithm we're going to 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.860
 follow is next the first thing is to see 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.720
 If the child is conscious or 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.660
 unconscious for it what will be that 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.480
 to do is call to shake him see if he 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.210
 respond to our stimuli if you are 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.070
 conscious is responding what 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.520
 we have to do it's lateral position of 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.020
 security we will put you aside and 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.650
 we will notify the emergency services 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.810
 and we will stay with the second case the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.180
 patient is unconscious the second 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.120
 what we have to do is see if it breathes 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.050
 we will take five seconds to see if 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.810
 breathe and if it breathes again position 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.910
 side security and notify the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.010
 emergency services and the third 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.099
 case and the serious 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.730
 the complete algorithm of the stop 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.280
 cardiorespiratory in children 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.459
 first of all we call the patient hey 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.769
 hey hey he is unconscious does not respond to 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.920
 second stimuli we open the airway 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.190
 we put the patient and pull the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.870
 jaw up we check that 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.090
 he has not swallowed anything that has nothing 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.909
 of the mouth if I had something we removed 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.550
 once with the airway open you have to 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:46.990
 check again if you breathe 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.140
 if you do not breathe 5e rapid insufflations 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.210
 for this we put our mouths together 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.180
 mouth and your nose and you have to do five 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.510
 infractions followed approximately 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.939
 one second duration 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.060
 we check with our eyes that the 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:05.159
 chest is extended to check 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.180
 that really is getting air and 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.860
 automatically after 30 compressions 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.590
 if it's a very small child how would it be 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.349
 this case put two fingers to the height 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.989
 of the chest and we would do 30 compressions of 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.170
 fast and effective way you have to depress 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.430
 your thorax a third and you have to keep 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.859
 about 100 120 beats per minute 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.989
 we can also do the compressions 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.030
 in the following way by joining 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.040
 our two fingers on the child's chest 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.700
 in the cases of infants and 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.400
 performing this compression if the children 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.400
 what we will have to put 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.579
 It is the heel of our hand on your chest 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.340
 and perform the compressions of it 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.230
 way once we've done 5 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.659
 ventilations and the first 30 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.819
 compressions we automatically call 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.780
 emergency services 1-1-2 and 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.139
 we continue with resuscitation 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.139
 cardiopulmonary 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.780
 as we have commented the stop 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.000
 cardiorespiratory in children is 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.040
 be of respiratory origin and one of the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.650
 reasons why they enter this 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.390
 stop is because they have choked 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.660
 they are playing they put things in their mouths 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.359
 and they suck and what they have in their mouths 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.760
 obstructs the airway that is to say them 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.980
 tampon choke in these moments 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.950
 will start coughing and when the cough is not 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.320
 effective and if you have witnessed that 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.710
 choking you should put on 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.390
 back and with the heel of your hand 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.100
 hit him firmly between his 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.070
 shoulders between what are the 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:44.710
 scapulae or shoulder blades hit him five 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:47.080
 times followed 1 2 3 4 and 5 if you eject the 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.630
 perfect object and you have to stay with 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.640
 reassure him wait for him to breathe 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.540
 again quietly if you have not 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.650
 expelled 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.000
 you have to try to remove it with your finger and 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.950
 automatically start with the 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.370
 cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:06.010
 5 breaths 30 compressions and then 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.380
 keep 30 230 2 and notify the 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.750
 emergency services 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.690
 If you liked this video, give us a 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.430
 like Irene and me and of course it's a 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.170
 very interesting video so that 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.350
 share with your relatives and 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.570

 do not forget to subscribe to our 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.970
 channel on youtube facebook and twitter this 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.970
 it's clear medicine and I'm the doctor 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.680
 good a clear medicine is possible and 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.680
 necessary thank you very much
