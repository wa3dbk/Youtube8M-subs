00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
it pretty easily the exhaust system was

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.710 
it pretty easily the exhaust system was
very<00:01:43.860> quiet<00:01:44.400> it's<00:01:44.760> gonna<00:01:44.880> sound<00:01:45.090> really<00:01:45.390> good

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it is a shaft drive system so there is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.420 
it is a shaft drive system so there is
no<00:01:48.360> chain<00:01:48.660> so<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.650> heard<00:01:49.800> me<00:01:49.950> write<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.160> I

no chain so if you heard me write that I
said<00:01:50.760> shaft<00:01:51.270> drive<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.200> don't<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.500> any

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
said shaft drive so you don't have any

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.730 
said shaft drive so you don't have any
chain<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.510> whatsoever<00:01:54.510> a<00:01:54.990> big<00:01:55.470> gas<00:01:55.710> tank
