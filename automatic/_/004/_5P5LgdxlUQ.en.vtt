00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.290
 Hey guys 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.930
 welcome to another day of 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.910
 training and this week you learn 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.850
 how to use the map your favor one 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.140
 Starcraft 2 Sharing 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.940
 you have already learned in macro and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.620
 Miguel you always want to conquer 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.960
 every possible advantage over your 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.970
 opponent is investing well his or her 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.100
 ensure that each 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.700
 unit and finish the combat well 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.560
 go 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.780
 only together with this you all too 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.030
 can work the idea of ​​using a map 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.620
 your favor what you can do to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.719
 control your opponent's movement 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.609
 to hide buildings is to attack the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.649
 surprise face to prepare some kind 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.239
 of ambush or simply do with 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.850
 that a positioning in combat is 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.890
 much better your side the blocks of the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.659
 game has several elements that create the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.159
 opportunities and we are here to 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.390
 pass on to you how to take advantage 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.979
 from them 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.050
 Let's go now with a beard that will detail 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.339
 some map elements that you can 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.309
 use in your favor 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.659
 the first is the bottleneck are places 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.589
 on the map where the path is 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.120
 narrow 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.280
 usually players use 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.649
 defensively to make walls with the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.570
 constructions already controlling this area 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.399
 you can also use offensively to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.790
 get better with quality 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.770
 the second large and elevated grounds 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.600
 ramps on the main base and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.500
 natural expansion are the most important 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.210
 you need to control is the whole game 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.009
 put constructions to make walls and 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.170
 positioned units at the top 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.829
 It helps them a lot when it comes to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.320
 defend 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.909
 Another tip is to place the siege unit 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.049
 on the terrain taken to attack any 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.909
 type of threat now called the tower in 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.859
 most often in the view of a 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.509
 important point on the map and so it is 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.590
 fundamental that you control it 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.270
 during the game 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.960
 now let's go to the details about the call 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.670
 it does not detect invisible drives 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.429
 units and airplanes and constructions 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.899
 not activate the call and when you 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.000
 put a worker to activate the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.460
 tower it will not appear in the list 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.950
 blockers idle workers 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.320
 vision are small parts of the map with 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.899
 smoke or shrubs that had a vision 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.030
 only from terrestrial units and as 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.400
 we can use our favor 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.690
 putting buildings proximity drops 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.430
 my nose are just a few examples 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.290
 also great for body units at 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.480
 body that if not get close to the unit 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.550
 enemy attacking the distance 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.260
 and to finalize worth putting one 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.760
 armadillo bomb a widow mine to 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.520
 surprise the opponent 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.160
 the destructible rocks and rock towers 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.770
 are neutral structures to block the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.050
 release passages are great for using the 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.330
 please either release space and have 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.670
 a larger area for example and 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.500
 mill or to close an area 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.970
 to protect the expansion as per 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.120
 example in ashkelon 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.770
 and to finish the rich minerals always 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.900
 are in more exposed places 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.910
 but sometimes the risk is that each 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.100
 worker collects 7 minerals for 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.680
 different blues trip where 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.300
 workers collects five trips to 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.950
 best way to risk minerals 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.170
 rich and when you play so 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.270
 offensive because your opponent will stay 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.890
 in defense and you will have full control of the 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.270
 bad 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.830
 At this point in the game, I think 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.960
 You already called, right? 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.760
 the big bid even you marry them 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.500
 fundamentals you've learned in macro and 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.230
 micro with the elements that we passed 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.360
 today with a good exerts a composition 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.250
 government that your opponent has if you 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.170
 complete this with the positioning in 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.600
 that your opponent can not fight 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.280
 Right or I do not know you, for example. 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.680
 intercepts an attack in the middle of the path 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.610
 had a guy completely in the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.320
 game 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.360
 Good, it's easy, you stay in a 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.130
 excellent situation and you can 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.260
 win even easier 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.820
 calm down, it's going to take a little bit 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.190
 for you to pick up every morning from every 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.630
 map you will even notice that 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.670
 some maps are easier to 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.709
 enjoy some aspects than others and 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.050
 depending on the breed you are 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.660
 play, it's cool, we'll go 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.400
 return to this in the future race by race and 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.410
 so stay tuned for more than 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.180
 training only on this but can 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.239
 get a good broth that we passed 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.340
 today is what it is 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.620
 today you learned how to gain advantage 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.730
 on your opponent using the map 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.290
 your favor 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.050
 next week we will have a day 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.239
 very special so stay tuned 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.590
 thank you for watching and even 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.590
 next training day
