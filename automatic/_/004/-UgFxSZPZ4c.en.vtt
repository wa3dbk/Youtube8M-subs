00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
three-speed transmission the first time

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.170 
three-speed transmission the first time
we<00:01:32.220> were<00:01:32.310> driving<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.760> up<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> road<00:01:33.150> that

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.850 
we were driving it up the road that
started<00:01:33.689> shifting<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.229> kind<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> freaky

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
started shifting it was kind of a freaky

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.560 
started shifting it was kind of a freaky
thing<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.280> after<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.790> realize<00:01:36.210> what<00:01:36.420> it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
thing but after you realize what it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.899 
thing but after you realize what it's
doing<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.200> fantastic<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:38.610> comes

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
doing it's fantastic and it really comes

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
because it's just like a car it's using

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.630 
because it's just like a car it's using
the<00:01:43.080> compression<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.680> engine<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.369> in

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the compression of the engine it's in

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.820 
the compression of the engine it's in
