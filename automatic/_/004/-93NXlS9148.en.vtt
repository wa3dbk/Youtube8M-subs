00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
which is harder rubber it makes you

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.660 
which is harder rubber it makes you
slide<00:01:16.600> more<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.590> lot<00:01:18.009> of<00:01:18.130> car<00:01:18.310> control

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
took a little bit to get a hang of it

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.469 
took a little bit to get a hang of it
started<00:01:23.979> getting<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.280> feel<00:01:24.490> for<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:25.180> started

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
started getting a feel for it I started

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.789 
started getting a feel for it I started
pushing<00:01:25.600> harder<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.080> harder<00:01:26.259> and<00:01:26.560> then<00:01:26.590> in

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.529 
pushing harder and harder and then in
seeding<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.340> qualifying<00:01:27.789> pushed<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.450> little

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
seeding in a qualifying pushed a little

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.090 
seeding in a qualifying pushed a little
too<00:01:28.690> hard<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.259> up<00:01:29.380> sliding<00:01:29.710> through<00:01:30.009> the
