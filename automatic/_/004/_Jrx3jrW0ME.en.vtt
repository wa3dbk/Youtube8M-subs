using free draw within dr. chrono has

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.670 
using free draw within dr. chrono has
just<00:00:03.760> gotten<00:00:03.939> more<00:00:04.210> advanced<00:00:04.780> taking<00:00:05.440> a<00:00:05.529> look

free draw button on say a PDF you can
basically<00:00:11.200> see<00:00:11.679> how<00:00:11.860> advanced<00:00:12.190> free<00:00:12.639> draw<00:00:12.790> has

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
basically see how advanced free draw has

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.480 
basically see how advanced free draw has
gotten<00:00:13.299> so<00:00:13.570> now<00:00:13.599> there's<00:00:13.929> a<00:00:14.019> thumbnail<00:00:14.500> within

there you go and basically within a PDF
you<00:00:28.240> can<00:00:28.270> actually<00:00:28.510> edit<00:00:28.780> it<00:00:29.170> so<00:00:29.200> this<00:00:29.620> is<00:00:29.830> a

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
you can actually edit it so this is a

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.519 
you can actually edit it so this is a
basically<00:00:30.580> a<00:00:30.720> clinical<00:00:31.720> note<00:00:31.870> right<00:00:32.110> here<00:00:32.140> the

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
basically a clinical note right here the

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.140 
basically a clinical note right here the
doctor<00:00:32.980> has<00:00:33.130> printed<00:00:33.370> out<00:00:33.550> this<00:00:33.730> is<00:00:33.880> something

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
doctor has printed out this is something

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.310 
doctor has printed out this is something
that<00:00:34.240> you<00:00:34.360> could<00:00:34.510> submit<00:00:34.930> to<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:35.200> insurance

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
that you could submit to the insurance

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.440 
that you could submit to the insurance
company<00:00:35.650> basically<00:00:36.640> you<00:00:36.760> could<00:00:36.940> draw<00:00:37.180> on<00:00:37.270> this

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
company basically you could draw on this

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.270 
company basically you could draw on this
so<00:00:37.630> I'm<00:00:37.720> going<00:00:37.870> to<00:00:37.900> just<00:00:38.020> draw<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:38.920> you<00:00:39.010> can<00:00:39.130> see

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
so I'm going to just draw so you can see

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.820 
so I'm going to just draw so you can see
here<00:00:39.610> can<00:00:40.360> draw<00:00:40.630> and<00:00:41.530> then<00:00:41.650> there's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
here can draw and then there's

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.410 
here can draw and then there's
positioning<00:00:42.400> so<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:42.790> could<00:00:42.940> zoom<00:00:43.090> in<00:00:43.270> and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
positioning so you could zoom in and

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.180 
positioning so you could zoom in and
zoom<00:00:43.450> out<00:00:43.660> so<00:00:43.720> you<00:00:44.320> can<00:00:44.440> do<00:00:44.590> that<00:00:44.800> there's<00:00:45.130> a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
zoom out so you can do that there's a

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.760 
zoom out so you can do that there's a
positioning<00:00:45.760> that<00:00:45.880> right<00:00:46.480> there<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:47.020> then

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
positioning that right there and then

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.670 
positioning that right there and then
you<00:00:47.920> can<00:00:48.070> go<00:00:48.190> in<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:48.370> do<00:00:48.640> finer<00:00:49.260> drawings<00:00:50.260> you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
you can go in and do finer drawings you

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.160 
you can go in and do finer drawings you
just<00:00:50.860> do<00:00:51.040> this<00:00:51.220> here's<00:00:51.700> a<00:00:51.790> blue<00:00:51.940> one<00:00:52.090> so<00:00:52.870> say

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
just do this here's a blue one so say

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.350 
just do this here's a blue one so say
you<00:00:53.230> want<00:00:53.500> then<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:53.890> click<00:00:54.220> on<00:00:54.340> draw<00:00:54.640> go<00:00:55.210> right

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
you want then you click on draw go right

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.510 
you want then you click on draw go right
there<00:00:55.540> you<00:00:55.690> can<00:00:55.840> draw<00:00:56.020> that<00:00:56.290> so<00:00:57.130> you<00:00:57.220> can<00:00:57.310> see

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
there you can draw that so you can see

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.850 
there you can draw that so you can see
how<00:00:57.640> easy<00:00:57.880> that<00:00:58.030> is<00:00:58.180> so<00:00:58.600> there's<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.870> draw<00:00:59.200> their

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
how easy that is so there's a draw their

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.760 
how easy that is so there's a draw their
position<00:01:00.340> there's<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.579> position<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:02.440> can<00:01:02.560> see

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
position there's a position you can see

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.450 
position there's a position you can see
how<00:01:02.980> many<00:01:04.860> PDFs<00:01:05.860> there<00:01:06.070> are<00:01:06.190> with<00:01:06.430> that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
how many PDFs there are with that

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.640 
how many PDFs there are with that
there's<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:06.880> thumbnail<00:01:07.210> view<00:01:07.690> there's<00:01:08.409> also

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
there's a thumbnail view there's also

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.250 
there's a thumbnail view there's also
this<00:01:09.150> sketch<00:01:10.150> so<00:01:10.390> you<00:01:10.479> can<00:01:10.630> see<00:01:10.780> here<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.110> can

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
this sketch so you can see here you can

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.210 
this sketch so you can see here you can
have<00:01:11.890> larger<00:01:12.430> sketches<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.890> smaller<00:01:14.890> pen

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
have larger sketches and a smaller pen

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.770 
have larger sketches and a smaller pen
sketches<00:01:15.700> where<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:15.909> can<00:01:16.060> just<00:01:16.090> sketch<00:01:16.600> on

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
sketches where you can just sketch on

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.490 
sketches where you can just sketch on
top<00:01:17.049> of<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.380> actual<00:01:17.909> image<00:01:18.909> or<00:01:19.150> PDF<00:01:19.540> right

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
top of the actual image or PDF right

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.710 
top of the actual image or PDF right
here<00:01:20.890> now<00:01:21.220> another<00:01:21.580> thing<00:01:21.700> we<00:01:21.909> have<00:01:22.090> also<00:01:22.360> is

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
here now another thing we have also is

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.490 
here now another thing we have also is
the<00:01:22.930> text<00:01:23.260> field<00:01:23.409> so<00:01:25.320> essentially<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.380> could

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
the text field so essentially you could

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.980 
the text field so essentially you could
go<00:01:26.590> on<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:26.950> say<00:01:27.580> a<00:01:27.610> document<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.479> you<00:01:28.690> have

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
go on to say a document that you have

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.609 
go on to say a document that you have
and<00:01:29.409> you<00:01:29.979> can<00:01:30.130> just<00:01:30.250> start<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:30.670> type<00:01:30.940> a<00:01:31.619> 22

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
and you can just start to type a 22

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.219 
and you can just start to type a 22
right<00:01:32.799> so<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:34.150> can<00:01:34.299> write<00:01:34.420> down<00:01:34.630> on<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:34.990> I'll

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
right so you can write down on this I'll

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.289 
right so you can write down on this I'll
just<00:01:35.350> write<00:01:35.530> done<00:01:35.799> on<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.490> one<00:01:36.760> clinical

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299

just write done on this one clinical
note<00:01:37.500> right<00:01:38.500> there<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.760> you<00:01:39.850> can<00:01:39.940> see<00:01:40.119> that<00:01:40.390> is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
note right there and you can see that is

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.090 
note right there and you can see that is
actually<00:01:41.049> on<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.170> document<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:41.860> can<00:01:42.010> go

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100
