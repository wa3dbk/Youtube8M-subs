 add your favorite apps 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.620
 they will always fall short I found 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.949

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.129

 Here you can change the theme system 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.670
 if you do not like this pattern then you 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.950
 How can you change individually? 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.000
 as it happens in cma 11 and is that it has the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.060
 shop where you can download or buy 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.720
 other themes do not have free options and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.799
 it's also paid options there is not much 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.369
 interesting time 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.070
 here you can change the pp comes with 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.770
 these options here 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.810
 here you can change if you have the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.240
 pt in your gallery you can install by 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.079
 here and here have the wallpapers 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.170
 love 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.759
 so it comes with four options 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.270
 The second option here is to make a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.990
 account is you save your settings 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.180
 of the servers they 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.060
 here you have these three options that you 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.759
 bought the notification bar is the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.549
 dialogue and automatic bar still well 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.950
 nice here on the part of networks 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.299
 there you have access to 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.580
 data as happens on android 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.190
 traditional and there you all 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.539
 bpn mc configuration 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.300
 then you set up the whole 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.700
 net sac god has a iphae control 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.849
 there you have access to your networks 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.610
 here the bluetooth here the sound control 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.010
 this option here the fade in that it creates 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.590
 an effect that actually decreases the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.450
 interval between the sound is very nice there 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.080
 you control a touch system 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.780
 notifications and below you will see 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.940
 play the sound you press the keyboard 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.370
 with you by touching the system item 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.500
 no control and sound and here you 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.170
 control the screen you can control the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.630
 space between the icons in the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.940
 navigation can control the brightness here 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.540
 you connect your smartphone to a TV 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.730
 It is via targeted childcare in the same cane 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.920
 security and control and even locking 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.810
 if you will use the default without this 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.120
 so it's all here 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.709
 here you found the language you have 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.510
 support in Brazilian Portuguese some 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.620
 things he stays Chinese but most 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.900
 It's in Portuguese 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.000
 and then you set the time as well and the 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.500
 keyboard options it comes with keyboard 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.200
 own km 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.250
 but you can use another and here you have 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.780
 access to the applications that are running 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.910
 it's the ones that are running in the background 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.859
 the cache memory and below it informs 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.819
 when the ram line is being consumed 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.739
 with spain have free 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.499
 here you have USB operation and you can also 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.569
 connect external pen drive or hd 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:34.909
 using a tg cable it also recognizes 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.909
 this street is that they have the options of 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.980
 canyon system and that you can see 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.650
 It's bad, it's really cool and it has a look. 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.780
 different and I will show that the dialer 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.519
 here extensive agenda here highlight the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.810
 traditional and then the search is contacts side 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.209
 left and you have a 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.659
 messages down the application issue 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.519
 of basic coming notes you have to shop 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.010
 them then beyond you to the place 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.650
 becomes so far away from 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.599
 My own, it 's really cool and you leave. 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.659
 here you have the file manager 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.359
 he wants very good very organized and 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.430
 by photos and images music and I found 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.609
 very cool better than the android 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.940
 here you have a music player and also 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.370
 you can shop it is their store 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.470
 or you can in the other tab and these 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.050
 songs that are stored in memory 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.729
 internal is you have two options 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.889
 and here in the gallery you have more if 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.320
 create an album is you go adding the 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.289
 your images then none here but you 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.449
 you can mount photo albums with the 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.949
 your image is always nice and the application 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.070
 besides the super user you have access 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.199
 your system and how you pull it 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.110
 you can see it shows only the part of the 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.720
 where you have information to display 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.830
 The rest is transparent. It's pretty cool. 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.979
 here in the camera 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.740
 now here's her speed is a 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.650
 very basic face is like that of amyl 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.900
 so there is not much choice here but she is 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.350
 very quick with you can see there 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.600
 so for those who like an agile camera it is 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.770
 very interesting but understands feature not 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.449
 has much to offer 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:18.389
 so the basics it works great if 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.560
 can see well there is the voice caught in itself is 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.830
 very good 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.410
 it's time to gag her there 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.139
 because one adapted yet and still 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.970
 needs to be improved but it works 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.729
 well you can see with being safe by 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.400
 long in one place is when he 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:39.870
 it focuses on the photo strip also have this 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.900
 option there with respect to the battery is a 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.930
 little less than that of the stock of Nexus 50 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.930
 as an adapted one is not used much 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.419
 but it has a duration of feels and there in the 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.729
 description of the video you check is the 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.000
 link you download on also a side link 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.580
 forum xv close find have a link 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.539
 also from the gapz that the next application 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.970
 a place thor 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:06.330
 In case you're in trouble, just 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:10.139
 you unzip the file and that there 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.400
 you and the seventh is to apply that 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.370
 does that initial setup of the 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.139
 system and must install in good faith only I 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.289
 staying here until the next talk 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.289
 guys
