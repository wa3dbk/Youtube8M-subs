00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
calculate the RF value drawing area and

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.240 
calculate the RF value drawing area and
actual<00:00:16.170> area<00:00:16.470> are<00:00:16.980> given<00:00:18.529> when<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> areas<00:00:20.070> are

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
actual area are given when the areas are

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.420 
actual area are given when the areas are
given<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:21.090> calculate<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> RF<00:00:22.020> value<00:00:22.380> take<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
given to calculate the RF value take the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.660 
given to calculate the RF value take the
square<00:00:23.820> root<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.810> get<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.140> length<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:26.400> here

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
square root to get the length so here

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.849 
square root to get the length so here
after<00:00:26.880> taking<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.420> square<00:00:28.170> root<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.590> both

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
after taking the square root for both

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.429 
after taking the square root for both
numerator<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.519> denominator<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
numerator and denominator so this is the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.060 
numerator and denominator so this is the
drawing<00:00:31.710> length<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> actual<00:00:33.570> length

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
drawing length this is the actual length

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.860 
drawing length this is the actual length

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.830 
the scale so this is the given problem
for<00:01:22.290> start<00:01:22.619> drawing<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> problem<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> first

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
for start drawing the problem the first

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.969 
for start drawing the problem the first
step<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.610> take<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.790> length<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> scale

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
step is take the length of the scale

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.700 
step is take the length of the scale

and maximum length is pi kilometer if

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.810 
and maximum length is pi kilometer if
you<00:01:54.509> divide<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.020> 200<00:01:55.590> mm<00:01:55.770> long<00:01:55.979> lane<00:01:56.250> into

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you divide this 200 mm long lane into

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.350 
you divide this 200 mm long lane into
five<00:01:57.600> equal<00:01:57.780> parts<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.610> each<00:01:59.610> part<00:01:59.640> is<00:02:00.119> 1

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
five equal parts and each part is 1

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.050 
five equal parts and each part is 1
kilometer<00:02:00.920> then<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.399> display<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
kilometer then you can display a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.020 
kilometer then you can display a
magazine<00:02:03.600> length<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.020> 5<00:02:04.259> kilometers<00:02:05.030> hence

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
magazine length of 5 kilometers hence

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.180 
magazine length of 5 kilometers hence
you<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.810> divide<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.140> line<00:02:07.500> into<00:02:07.890> five

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you have to divide that line into five

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.400 
you have to divide that line into five
equal<00:02:08.340> parts

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
equal parts

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.710 
equal parts
this<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.650> the<00:02:10.740> 200<00:02:11.190> long<00:02:11.460> lane<00:02:11.670> then<00:02:12.000> taken<00:02:12.510> mm

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
this is the 200 long lane then taken mm

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.860 
this is the 200 long lane then taken mm

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
large do business with respect to deca

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.540 
large do business with respect to deca
matters<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:35.430> here<00:04:35.790> on<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.330> decameter<00:04:36.840> scale

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550

large<00:04:38.550> division<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.090> matching<00:04:39.510> with<00:04:39.600> this

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
large division is matching with this

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.670 
large division is matching with this
division<00:04:40.560> here<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.400> is<00:04:41.550> 66<00:04:42.240> so<00:04:43.050> subtract

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
division here that is 66 so subtract

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.100
