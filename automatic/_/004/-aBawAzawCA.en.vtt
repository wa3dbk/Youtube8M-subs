00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
the outside and the red one goes on the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.850 
the outside and the red one goes on the
inside<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:45.910> way<00:02:46.900> we<00:02:47.050> don't<00:02:47.170> have<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.440> redo

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
inside that way we don't have to redo

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.010 
inside that way we don't have to redo
everything<00:02:48.220> if<00:02:48.550> we<00:02:48.580> got<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:48.970> backwards<00:02:52.020> okay

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
everything if we got it backwards okay

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.840 
everything if we got it backwards okay
so<00:02:53.920> what<00:02:54.070> we're<00:02:54.160> going<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.340> do<00:02:54.460> now<00:02:54.610> is<00:02:54.670> we're

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
lock in so you can kind of guess where

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.200 
lock in so you can kind of guess where
that<00:04:43.560> supposed<00:04:43.890> to<00:04:43.980> go<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.430> now<00:04:44.760> let's<00:04:45.000> start

that supposed to go and now let's start

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.000 
that supposed to go and now let's start
to<00:04:45.330> feed<00:04:45.540> these<00:04:45.720> wires<00:04:48.170> back<00:04:49.170> in<00:04:49.350> around<00:04:49.620> here

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
to feed these wires back in around here

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.980 
to feed these wires back in around here
kind<00:04:50.730> of<00:04:50.820> get<00:04:50.970> them<00:04:51.090> set<00:04:51.750> back<00:04:51.930> in<00:04:51.960> place

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
kind of get them set back in place

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.060 
kind of get them set back in place
there's<00:04:54.990> some<00:04:55.200> little<00:04:55.440> notches<00:04:55.650> you'll

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
there's some little notches you'll

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.780

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
this enough I remember black is on that

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.430 
this enough I remember black is on that
side<00:06:33.340> raised<00:06:33.760> on<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.090> inside<00:06:34.420> so<00:06:35.230> what<00:06:35.320> we'll

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
side raised on the inside so what we'll

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.590 
side raised on the inside so what we'll
do<00:06:35.560> nails<00:06:35.800> will<00:06:36.040> get<00:06:36.190> some<00:06:36.430> might<00:06:37.270> even<00:06:37.300> be

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
do nails will get some might even be

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.250 
do nails will get some might even be
enough<00:06:37.810> solder<00:06:38.050> on<00:06:38.290> there<00:06:38.530> we'll<00:06:38.680> try<00:06:38.980> it<00:06:39.810> will

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.660

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
that is ready kind of get these wires

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.120 
that is ready kind of get these wires
fed<00:07:03.510> back<00:07:03.780> through<00:07:04.080> here<00:07:04.350> so<00:07:04.650> they<00:07:04.770> won't<00:07:04.950> be

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
fed back through here so they won't be

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.900 
fed back through here so they won't be
in<00:07:05.220> the<00:07:05.250> way<00:07:05.370> or<00:07:05.760> pop<00:07:06.000> out<00:07:06.270> and<00:07:07.020> get<00:07:07.200> ripped<00:07:07.410> out
