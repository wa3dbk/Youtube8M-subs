00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:00.745
 Hello! 

00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:03.990
 Today, here is a classmate who will help me with some tricks ... 

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:06.079
 Eyes ... and Eyes and .. 

00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:07.621
 ... and of course, 

00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:14.689
 and now we will solve a question, how can we make the back side of this deck ... 

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:16.653
 ... of the normal, 

00:00:17.077 --> 00:00:18.602
 ... with this backyard ...... 

00:00:20.193 --> 00:00:22.993
 Here, look at the back, here too ... 

00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:29.667
 Well now we're going to solve it, okay .. so ... so I'll show you ... 

00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:33.036
 ... and the back all, as you see is nothing, 

00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:35.228
 neither here is anything else beyond, 

00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:40.536
 that I have hidden some card, can us .... something can be left. 

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:46.307
 And now what are we going to do ... Hey ... Thaaaa ... 

00:00:48.318 --> 00:00:52.641
 We're going to do something like that here, I'll find a paper one ... 

00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:55.873
 let's say we'll pull a piece of paper, let's say this here 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.475
 the ten .... clover, 

00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:04.005
 So what do we do, I'll put it here, 

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:06.685
 and I will quit !! 

00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:09.210
 Once here, 

00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:17.078
 Well! and will explain us, we will solve this question, 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.082
 - And of course, to show us ... - Here! 

00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:27.807
 You see here, what I showed the magic, the previous ... was normal. 

00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:33.068
 And now what do we do? Well we have ... we have done these things, and now, 

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:36.495
 our preparations, and as you see only one paper is over !!! 

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.233
 And as this paper looks ... 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.922
 ... is the paper ... The Basil. 

00:01:47.043 --> 00:01:51.424
 and I do not have a paper, you see it shake, everywhere, 

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:56.188
 And now, this was our trick. I hope he likes you all, 29 00: 01: 57,808 -&gt; 00: 01: 56,185 We say it the next time, hello!
