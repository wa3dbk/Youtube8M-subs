low-pass filters turned on on both the
ntg-2<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.490> rode<00:01:59.640> videomic<00:02:01.310> forgot<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
ntg-2 and the rode videomic forgot to

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.620 
ntg-2 and the rode videomic forgot to
mention<00:02:02.550> before<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.000> am<00:02:03.300> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.540> be

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.790 
switching and I'm going to be switching
back<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.580> forth<00:02:05.760> between<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.420> two<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:07.500> to

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
back and forth between the two just to

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.930 
back and forth between the two just to
see<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> difference<00:02:08.640> between<00:02:08.760> them<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:10.940> this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
see the difference between them and this

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.210 
see the difference between them and this
is<00:02:12.000> from<00:02:12.300> two<00:02:12.450> feet<00:02:12.600> away<00:02:12.720> with<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.770> Mac<00:02:13.950> with

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
is from two feet away with the Mac with

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.310 
is from two feet away with the Mac with
a<00:02:14.250> volume<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> tascam<00:02:15.360> dr-40<00:02:15.810> turn<00:02:16.080> on

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
a volume of the tascam dr-40 turn on

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:31.450 
a volume of the tascam dr-40 turn on
Macs

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.330 

roughly<00:02:31.850> 20<00:02:32.210> feet<00:02:32.390> away<00:02:32.890> low-pass<00:02:33.890> filters

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
roughly 20 feet away low-pass filters

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:58.720 
roughly 20 feet away low-pass filters
turned<00:02:34.550> on<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.960> maximum<00:02:36.650> volume<00:02:57.070> okay<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:58.460> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
turned on and maximum volume okay so the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.810 
turned on and maximum volume okay so the
low-pass<00:02:59.000> filters<00:02:59.360> are<00:02:59.480> turned<00:02:59.660> off<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.080> I

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
low-pass filters are turned off and I

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.510 
low-pass filters are turned off and I
hope<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:02.720> was<00:03:02.900> informative<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.770> is<00:03:04.370> the
