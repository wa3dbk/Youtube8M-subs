00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.360
 he who deserves today at this very precise time to have to answer to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.210
 a whole series no problem the challenge of the environment how 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.349
 polluting 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.699
 the dj had goals 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.449
 all the experts say the 21st century will be the end of the oil the challenge 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.579
 economic we saw it during the crisis of 2008 the sovereign states 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.449
 hugo help from builders the builders are also under 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.850
 infusion of states 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.930
 and then finally 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.860
 consumers 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.940
 who today are no longer really fit with the car in 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.940
 love question becomes a bit complicated and the car 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.800
 then finally today an object of the return contract where they have new 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.160
 expectations and so it's all of these challenges that today can arise at 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
 the automobile and to everyone 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.340
 I do not know if we are witnessing a global revolution in any case of 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.210
 conceptual revolution the very clearly 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.620
 we must imagine that the electric car we will approach this match 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.260
 com uses his mobile phone at night on his way home which is a 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.690
 true evolution 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.240
 in the report comcom tip talk to the car 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.810
 the consumer who just scared 2-on blv 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.689
 then down in open country in the middle of the night is the table the question 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.250
 of 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.250
 batteries and while working 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.870
 learning and assaulting consumers and 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.290
 motorists probably by the way by passing a trial period and that 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.190
 are dubious it rao raises self-sharing fleets in the cities on 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.280
 will be able to start 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.039
 to simply see touch and get used 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.039
 this new formula 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.610
 many experts believe that the move to the electric car is 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.180
 no doubt a necessary passage 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.840
 that by 2030 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.000
 we will be dealing with many different technologies at a 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.279
 multitude of major and complementary technologies 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.279
 and that we will know if the past without doubt 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:17.019
 petromomitate electromobility we will have the choice of 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.019
 several possibilities 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.239
 the French are ready for electric cars say it 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.089
 in the polls the commission of inquiry is sufficiently autonomous 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:31.969
 provided they are not affected 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.559
 the blockhouse in that sense with the success of the local is disassembled 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:36.870
 actually this trend 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.720
 yes j sustainable mobility 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.720
 but not to anyone 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.989
 what is the art of intelligence no more and no less a road that communicates 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.699
 with a car through educator cameras 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.719
 the main objective is obviously security I was trying to reduce the 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:56.739
 number 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.059
 killed on the roads 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.209
 but also about sustainability and sustainability so you 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:06.019
 set up smart roads that will be clean that will be renewable 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.209
 and we already see it in a number of experimental experiments 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.259
 in terms of traffic management recruitment a real willingness to put 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:18.899
 in place of demand roads that are roads 3
