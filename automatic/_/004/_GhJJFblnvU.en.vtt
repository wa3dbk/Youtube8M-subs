bit for racing other than that it's

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.870 
bit for racing other than that it's
pretty<00:02:34.410> much<00:02:34.650> as<00:02:34.830> close<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.220> bone<00:02:35.400> stock<00:02:35.700> as

you can be other than a wet sump oil
system<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.960> then<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.290> also<00:02:40.440> see<00:02:40.740> our

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.120 
welded together to make a nice cage
around<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.660> driver<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.620> everything<00:03:12.920> in<00:03:13.040> this

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
big thing you'll see on the GT cars it

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.500 
big thing you'll see on the GT cars it
has<00:03:27.740> a<00:03:27.890> rear<00:03:28.190> wing<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.790> has<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:28.970> splitter<00:03:29.420> on

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
has a rear wing and it has a splitter on

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.060 
has a rear wing and it has a splitter on
the<00:03:29.690> front<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.080> car<00:03:30.290> which<00:03:30.710> gives<00:03:30.950> it

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
the front of the car which gives it

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.460 
the front of the car which gives it
quite<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.250> bit<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.520> downforce<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:32.210> the<00:03:32.720> back<00:03:32.960> we

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
quite a bit of downforce in the back we

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.560 
quite a bit of downforce in the back we
actually<00:03:33.830> fuel<00:03:34.130> same<00:03:34.640> way<00:03:34.910> but<00:03:35.240> through<00:03:35.360> this

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
actually fuel same way but through this

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.110 
actually fuel same way but through this
hole<00:03:35.840> here<00:03:36.110> in<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.860> back<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.670> only<00:03:37.760> thing

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
hole here in the back the only thing

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.670 
hole here in the back the only thing
that<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:38.360> two<00:03:38.510> cars<00:03:38.780> actually<00:03:39.050> do<00:03:39.380> have<00:03:39.590> in

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
that the two cars actually do have in

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.980 
that the two cars actually do have in
common<00:03:39.710> is<00:03:40.190> this<00:03:40.670> rear<00:03:40.940> bumper<00:03:41.300> is<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.450> plastic

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
common is this rear bumper is a plastic

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.540 
common is this rear bumper is a plastic
rear<00:03:42.140> bumper<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.560> you<00:03:42.680> would<00:03:42.800> see<00:03:42.980> on<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.250> GS

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
rear bumper that you would see on the GS

rear bumper that you would see on the GS
car<00:03:43.850> this<00:03:44.390> in<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.720> mirror<00:03:44.960> is<00:03:45.050> really<00:03:45.230> the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
car this in the mirror is really the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.160 
car this in the mirror is really the
only<00:03:45.560> two<00:03:45.770> things<00:03:45.920> we<00:03:46.130> have<00:03:46.160> in<00:03:46.400> common<00:03:47.080> on<00:03:48.080> the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
only two things we have in common on the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.750 
only two things we have in common on the
side<00:03:48.410> we<00:03:48.620> have<00:03:48.650> X<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.100> we're<00:03:49.280> allowed<00:03:49.460> to<00:03:49.580> add

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
side we have X so we're allowed to add

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.820 
side we have X so we're allowed to add
ductwork<00:03:50.180> that<00:03:50.870> allow<00:03:51.140> us<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.350> cool<00:03:51.650> our

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
ductwork that allow us to cool our

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.890 
ductwork that allow us to cool our
brakes<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.340> cool<00:03:52.490> our<00:03:52.610> tires<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:53.210> then<00:03:53.780> if

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
brakes and cool our tires and then if

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.530 
brakes and cool our tires and then if
you<00:03:53.990> get<00:03:54.140> inside<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.650> driver<00:03:54.890> compartment

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
you get inside the driver compartment

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.580 
you get inside the driver compartment
you<00:03:56.540> can<00:03:56.660> see<00:03:56.840> something<00:03:57.200> while<00:03:57.350> it's<00:03:57.560> very

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
you can see something while it's very

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.370 
you can see something while it's very
similar<00:03:58.070> is<00:03:58.310> very<00:03:58.520> different<00:03:59.060> full<00:03:59.630> racing

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
similar is very different full racing

gearbox<00:04:10.100> what<00:04:10.910> that<00:04:11.060> means<00:04:11.270> is<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.570> drivers

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
gearbox what that means is the drivers

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.479 
gearbox what that means is the drivers
just<00:04:12.050> keep<00:04:12.260> their<00:04:12.380> foot<00:04:12.560> on<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.770> ground<00:04:12.890> and

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
just keep their foot on the ground and

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.190 
just keep their foot on the ground and
they<00:04:13.580> pull<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.910> lever<00:04:14.120> like<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.360> motorcycle<00:04:15.110> or

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
they pull the lever like a motorcycle or

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.320 
they pull the lever like a motorcycle or
like<00:04:15.350> a<00:04:15.380> video<00:04:15.709> game<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.400> shift<00:04:16.609> gears<00:04:16.880> and

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
like a video game to shift gears and

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.849 
like a video game to shift gears and
then<00:04:17.600> we<00:04:17.720> have<00:04:17.840> two<00:04:18.020> levers<00:04:18.230> in<00:04:18.500> there<00:04:18.680> which

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
then we have two levers in there which

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.340 
then we have two levers in there which
control<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.820> anti-roll<00:04:20.510> bars<00:04:20.750> which

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
control the the anti-roll bars which

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.930 
control the the anti-roll bars which
allows<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.859> drivers<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.280> kind<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.460> adjust<00:04:22.580> the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
allows the drivers to kind of adjust the

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.680 
allows the drivers to kind of adjust the
handling<00:04:23.330> is<00:04:23.510> they<00:04:23.840> go<00:04:23.990> around<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.320> track

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
handling is they go around the track

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.250 
handling is they go around the track
finally<00:04:26.690> up<00:04:26.810> front

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.340 

you'll<00:04:31.830> see<00:04:32.010> another<00:04:32.180> ls3<00:04:33.180> engine<00:04:33.230> but<00:04:34.230> this

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
you'll see another ls3 engine but this

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.020 
you'll see another ls3 engine but this
one<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.740> lot<00:04:34.950> higher<00:04:35.220> has<00:04:35.700> a<00:04:35.730> lot<00:04:36.000> more

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
one is a lot higher has a lot more

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.630 
one is a lot higher has a lot more

tube-frame<00:04:43.020> chassis<00:04:43.080> up<00:04:43.710> here<00:04:43.950> there's

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
tube-frame chassis up here there's

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.550 
tube-frame chassis up here there's
nothing<00:04:44.790> in<00:04:45.180> here<00:04:45.420> that<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.780> anything<00:04:46.380> from

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
nothing in here that is anything from

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.560 
nothing in here that is anything from
the<00:04:46.830> street<00:04:47.100> we're<00:04:47.700> allowed<00:04:47.940> in<00:04:48.090> this<00:04:48.210> series

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
the street we're allowed in this series

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.720 
the street we're allowed in this series
to<00:04:48.720> run<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.870> tire<00:04:49.140> pressure<00:04:49.470> sensors<00:04:50.010> so<00:04:50.490> we<00:04:50.610> can

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
to run a tire pressure sensors so we can

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.790 
to run a tire pressure sensors so we can
monitor<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.240> tire<00:04:51.930> pressures<00:04:52.410> as<00:04:52.560> they<00:04:52.650> go

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
monitor the tire pressures as they go

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.560 
monitor the tire pressures as they go
out<00:04:52.950> on<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.160> track<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.700> it<00:04:54.030> also<00:04:54.180> lets<00:04:54.420> the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
out on the track and it also lets the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.270 
out on the track and it also lets the
drivers<00:04:54.960> know<00:04:55.170> forget<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.500> flat<00:04:55.740> tire

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
drivers know forget a flat tire

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.790 
drivers know forget a flat tire
then<00:04:57.150> finally<00:04:57.540> around<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.810> front<00:04:58.050> you<00:04:58.650> can

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
then finally around the front you can

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.770 
then finally around the front you can
see<00:04:58.980> no<00:04:59.190> headlights<00:04:59.640> it's<00:04:59.910> all<00:05:00.060> flush<00:05:00.390> upfront

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
see no headlights it's all flush upfront

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.990 
see no headlights it's all flush upfront
which<00:05:01.080> increases<00:05:01.620> our<00:05:01.710> downforce<00:05:02.190> and<00:05:02.820> then

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
which increases our downforce and then

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.580 
which increases our downforce and then
this<00:05:03.150> splitter<00:05:03.450> down<00:05:03.690> here<00:05:04.110> increases
