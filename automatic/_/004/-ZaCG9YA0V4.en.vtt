00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
our football team has got seniors that

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.980 
our football team has got seniors that
have<00:00:12.559> seen<00:00:13.559> good<00:00:14.309> examples<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.000> bad<00:00:15.570> examples

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
both from the previous years and I think

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.910

um a lot of stock blocking for our run

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.380 
um a lot of stock blocking for our run
game<00:01:46.320> makes<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.210> hard

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
game makes it it's really not that hard

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.060 
game makes it it's really not that hard
you<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:49.140> your<00:01:49.320> route<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.860> straight

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
you just know your route and go straight

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.550 
you just know your route and go straight
to<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.490> safety<00:01:51.450> um<00:01:52.220> it's<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.899> like<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.110> would

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
to it safety um it's really like I would

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.690 
to it safety um it's really like I would
think<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> quarterback<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
think it's like the quarterback of the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.999 
think it's like the quarterback of the
defense<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.719> we're<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
defense because we get to we're in the

because we get to see more than
everybody<00:02:02.130> else<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.780> more<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> like
