this<00:01:28.939> might<00:01:29.420> require<00:01:29.630> some<00:01:29.869> discussion

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.440 

okay<00:01:46.610> you're<00:01:46.940> going<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.090> want<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.330> keep

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
okay you're going to want to keep

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.180 
okay you're going to want to keep
watching<00:01:47.900> because<00:01:48.080> we're<00:01:48.440> about<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.860> discover

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
watching because we're about to discover

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.870 
watching because we're about to discover
how<00:01:50.110> maneuverable<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.620> canoe<00:01:51.950> can<00:01:52.130> be<00:01:52.250> you

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
how maneuverable a canoe can be you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.940 
how maneuverable a canoe can be you
would<00:01:53.030> think<00:01:53.060> if<00:01:53.810> both<00:01:54.140> people<00:01:54.410> are<00:01:54.620> paddling

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
would think if both people are paddling

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.680 
would think if both people are paddling
on<00:01:55.100> opposite<00:01:55.490> sides<00:01:55.730> of<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.910> canoe<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.540> it

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
on opposite sides of the canoe that it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.710 
on opposite sides of the canoe that it
should<00:01:57.020> go<00:01:57.320> straight<00:01:57.970> but<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.090> always<00:01:59.240> veers

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
should go straight but it always veers

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:10.520 
should go straight but it always veers
away<00:01:59.990> from<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.320> stern<00:02:00.530> paddler<00:02:00.950> side

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.539 

fortunately<00:02:11.530> because<00:02:11.769> canoes<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.400> been

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
fortunately because canoes have been

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.699 
fortunately because canoes have been
around<00:02:12.790> for<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> while<00:02:13.290> folks<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.439> come<00:02:14.560> up

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
you're doing a J stroke your top hand or

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.059 
you're doing a J stroke your top hand or
your<00:03:07.030> grip<00:03:07.480> hand<00:03:07.750> should<00:03:08.260> be<00:03:08.379> rolling<00:03:08.620> over<00:03:08.799> so

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
your grip hand should be rolling over so

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.640 
your grip hand should be rolling over so
that<00:03:09.099> your<00:03:09.310> thumb<00:03:09.370> points<00:03:09.939> down<00:03:10.349> at<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:11.500> end

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
that your thumb points down at the end

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.740 
that your thumb points down at the end
of<00:03:11.769> your<00:03:11.859> J<00:03:12.040> stroke<00:03:12.310> pause<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.359> let<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.599> water

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
of your J stroke pause and let the water

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.990 
of your J stroke pause and let the water
push<00:03:14.169> on<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.440> blade<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:15.250> provides<00:03:15.579> the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
push on the blade that provides the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.939 
push on the blade that provides the
turning<00:03:16.299> motion<00:03:18.870> yeah<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:19.900> know<00:03:20.169> you're<00:03:20.620> saying

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
turning motion yeah I know you're saying

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.349 
turning motion yeah I know you're saying
but<00:03:21.220> you're<00:03:21.340> not<00:03:21.430> pausing<00:03:21.970> at<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.150> end<00:03:22.269> of

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
but you're not pausing at the end of

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.089 
but you're not pausing at the end of
your<00:03:22.449> stroke<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:23.229> J<00:03:23.470> stroke<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:23.919> more

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
your stroke the J stroke is more

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.009 
your stroke the J stroke is more
efficient<00:03:24.609> so<00:03:25.120> your<00:03:25.239> pause<00:03:25.419> is<00:03:25.659> a<00:03:25.690> lot<00:03:25.989> shorter

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
efficient so your pause is a lot shorter

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.559 
efficient so your pause is a lot shorter
if<00:03:26.859> your<00:03:27.069> J<00:03:27.250> stroke<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:27.639> working<00:03:27.970> too<00:03:28.180> well<00:03:28.389> and

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
if your J stroke is working too well and

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.689 
if your J stroke is working too well and
you<00:03:28.690> turn<00:03:28.870> towards<00:03:29.019> your<00:03:29.440> paddling<00:03:29.769> side<00:03:30.010> just

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
you turn towards your paddling side just

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.159 
you turn towards your paddling side just
reach<00:03:30.879> out<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.120> do<00:03:31.359> a<00:03:31.389> paddle<00:03:31.750> stroke<00:03:31.930> out

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
reach out and do a paddle stroke out

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.509 
reach out and do a paddle stroke out
away<00:03:32.440> from<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.650> side<00:03:32.859> of<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.040> canoe<00:03:33.250> it's

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
away from the side of the canoe it's

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.080 
away from the side of the canoe it's
called<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.909> sweep<00:03:35.159> your<00:03:36.159> bowel<00:03:36.459> toddler<00:03:36.879> will

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
called a sweep your bowel toddler will

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.969 
called a sweep your bowel toddler will
quickly<00:03:37.419> get<00:03:37.690> frustrated<00:03:38.260> if<00:03:38.379> they<00:03:38.560> feel<00:03:38.829> that

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979 
quickly get frustrated if they feel that

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.520 
quickly get frustrated if they feel that
they're<00:03:39.159> cobbling<00:03:39.519> all<00:03:39.909> over<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.329> lake<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
they're cobbling all over the lake the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.110 
they're cobbling all over the lake the
trick<00:03:41.769> is<00:03:41.949> to<00:03:42.159> line<00:03:42.459> their<00:03:42.669> head<00:03:42.790> up<00:03:42.909> with<00:03:43.060> a

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
trick is to line their head up with a

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.289 
trick is to line their head up with a
target<00:03:43.540> on<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.900> far<00:03:44.109> shore<00:03:44.139> and<00:03:44.940> then<00:03:45.940> try<00:03:46.180> and

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
target on the far shore and then try and

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.699 
target on the far shore and then try and
keep<00:03:46.419> their<00:03:46.599> head<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:46.989> line<00:03:47.229> with<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.500> target

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
keep their head in line with the target

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.009 
keep their head in line with the target
that<00:03:48.190> will<00:03:48.310> give<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.579> straight<00:03:48.819> line<00:03:49.090> the

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
that will give you a straight line the

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.330 
that will give you a straight line the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
bow paddlers should be working on

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.879
