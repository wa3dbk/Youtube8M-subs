here<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.920> cook<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> we're<00:01:24.390> gonna<00:01:24.479> bring<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.780> all

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
here to cook so we're gonna bring it all

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
here to cook so we're gonna bring it all
the<00:01:24.900> way<00:01:25.080> around<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:26.580> good<00:01:26.670> thing<00:01:26.729> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the way around and the good thing is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100 
the way around and the good thing is
when<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.119> all<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.900> bring<00:01:27.990> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
when you all you have to do is bring it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
when you all you have to do is bring it
to<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> surface<00:01:28.380> press<00:01:28.770> Y<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> cart

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
to the surface press Y and then the cart

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.399 
to the surface press Y and then the cart
and<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.119> submarine<00:01:30.659> will<00:01:30.810> stay<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and then the submarine will stay on the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.560 
and then the submarine will stay on the
surface<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.100> spring<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> over<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.150> press<00:01:33.329> Y

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
surface so spring it over here press Y

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.130 
surface so spring it over here press Y
on<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.250> surfaces

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
on it and as you can see it surfaces

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.810 
on it and as you can see it surfaces
then<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.409> jump<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.770> off<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
then we just jump on off and go to that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.430 
then we just jump on off and go to that
little<00:01:39.000> ladder<00:01:39.270> right<00:01:39.509> there

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.469 

now<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:44.500> need<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:44.979> watch<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:45.880> tutorial<00:01:46.030> on<00:01:46.420> how

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
now you need to watch a tutorial on how

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.000 
now you need to watch a tutorial on how
to<00:01:46.600> climb<00:01:46.840> ladders<00:01:47.260> if<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.470> do<00:01:47.620> not<00:01:47.740> know<00:01:47.920> how

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
to climb ladders if you do not know how

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.070 
to climb ladders if you do not know how
to<00:01:48.040> climb<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.310> ladder<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.870> apparently<00:01:49.870> there's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
to climb a ladder and apparently there's

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.410 
to climb a ladder and apparently there's
a<00:01:50.140> dude<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.560> drip<00:01:50.950> trying<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.460> kill<00:01:51.700> me<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.150> I

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
a dude and drip trying to kill me so I

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.440 
a dude and drip trying to kill me so I
think<00:01:53.050> he's<00:01:53.290> leaving<00:01:53.440> us<00:01:53.680> alone<00:01:53.940> is<00:01:54.940> he<00:01:55.270> though

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
think he's leaving us alone is he though

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.260 
think he's leaving us alone is he though
is<00:01:55.840> he<00:01:55.960> really<00:01:57.450> ok<00:01:58.450> back<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.440> tutorial<00:02:00.270> so

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
is he really ok back to the tutorial so

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.580 
is he really ok back to the tutorial so
all<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:01.450> have<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.630> do<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:01.780> get<00:02:01.960> in<00:02:02.110> our<00:02:02.200> cargo

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
all we have to do is get in our cargo

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.790 
all we have to do is get in our cargo
Bob<00:02:03.630> without<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.840> jet<00:02:05.050> guy<00:02:05.200> coming<00:02:05.530> back<00:02:05.650> and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
Bob without that jet guy coming back and

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.620 
Bob without that jet guy coming back and
killing<00:02:06.100> us<00:02:06.220> hopefully<00:02:06.729> not<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:10.300> we<00:02:10.420> get<00:02:10.539> to

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
killing us hopefully not so we get to

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.720 
killing us hopefully not so we get to
know<00:02:10.720> our<00:02:10.750> cargo<00:02:11.110> Bob<00:02:11.260> we<00:02:11.500> deploy<00:02:12.040> hatch<00:02:12.400> and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
know our cargo Bob we deploy hatch and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.550 
know our cargo Bob we deploy hatch and
then<00:02:13.000> we<00:02:13.120> pick<00:02:13.300> up<00:02:13.540> our<00:02:13.720> submarine<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.380> bring

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
then we pick up our submarine and bring

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.020 
then we pick up our submarine and bring
it<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.709> where<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.010> got<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.190> go<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.520> have<00:02:16.000> a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
it to where we got to go I have a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.280 
it to where we got to go I have a
feeling<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.420> guy's<00:02:16.600> probably<00:02:16.840> gonna<00:02:17.020> wrap

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
feeling this guy's probably gonna wrap

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.080 
feeling this guy's probably gonna wrap
on<00:02:17.500> back<00:02:17.830> around<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.250> probably<00:02:18.550> blow<00:02:18.850> me<00:02:19.060> up

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
on back around and probably blow me up

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.670 
on back around and probably blow me up
but<00:02:19.660> we're<00:02:19.780> gonna<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.110> try<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.320> hook<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.560> any

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
but we're gonna just try to hook in any

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.930 
but we're gonna just try to hook in any
way<00:02:20.800> now<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.070> thing's<00:02:21.250> pretty<00:02:21.430> big<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:21.820> it's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
way now this thing's pretty big so it's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.840 
way now this thing's pretty big so it's
pretty<00:02:22.090> easy<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.660> hook<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:24.310> we're<00:02:24.459> gonna<00:02:24.550> just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
pretty easy to hook so we're gonna just

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.870 
pretty easy to hook so we're gonna just
go<00:02:25.030> blue<00:02:25.650> hook<00:02:26.650> her<00:02:26.770> up<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.130> take<00:02:27.640> her<00:02:27.700> where

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
go blue hook her up and take her where

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.479 
go blue hook her up and take her where
we<00:02:27.940> got<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.209> go<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.070> think<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.310> lost

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
we got to go and I think I lost

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.070 
we got to go and I think I lost
something<00:02:30.820> on<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.270> actually<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:31.720> think<00:02:32.020> i

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
something on it actually I think i

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.720 
something on it actually I think i
mighta<00:02:32.110> lost<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.560> hatch<00:02:32.739> on<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.130> which<00:02:33.280> now

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
mighta lost the hatch on it which now

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.430 
mighta lost the hatch on it which now
it's<00:02:33.880> broken<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.840> watch<00:02:35.019> out<00:02:35.170> for<00:02:35.230> those

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
it's broken so watch out for those

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.170 
it's broken so watch out for those
hatches<00:02:35.650> make<00:02:36.010> sure<00:02:36.130> not<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.400> lose<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.790> hatch

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
hatches make sure not to lose the hatch

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.720 
hatches make sure not to lose the hatch
if<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:38.019> decide<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.560> use<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.830> cargo<00:02:39.160> Bob<00:02:39.310> with

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
if you decide to use the cargo Bob with

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.610 
if you decide to use the cargo Bob with
your<00:02:39.940> submarine<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:41.260> then<00:02:41.380> there's<00:02:41.530> also

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
your submarine but then there's also

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.110 
your submarine but then there's also
another<00:02:41.890> little<00:02:42.280> fun<00:02:42.459> thing<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.730> can<00:02:42.910> do<00:02:43.000> you

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
another little fun thing you can do you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.750 
another little fun thing you can do you
could<00:02:43.239> try<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.390> flatten<00:02:43.870> people<00:02:44.550> with<00:02:45.550> your

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
could try to flatten people with your

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.449 
could try to flatten people with your
submarine<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:47.019> got<00:02:47.200> hooked<00:02:47.500> up<00:02:47.739> that's

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
submarine that you got hooked up that's

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.860 
submarine that you got hooked up that's
why<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.610> try<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:48.940> do<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.269> too<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.420> try<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.690> like
