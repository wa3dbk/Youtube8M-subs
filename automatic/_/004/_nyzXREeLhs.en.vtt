00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.060
 Hello dear friends with you I am 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.390
 screens today we'll talk on such 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.640
 topic like super farm team fighting yes 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.290
 the topic is already sufficient and restrained it is still 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.570
 at the very beginning as soon as team battles 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.760
 everyone appeared to be talking about what was in them 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.150
 you can farm but somehow I was in no hurry 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.559
 make some such your guide or else 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.900
 anything because firstly I'm there on 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.120
 they are not so much riding in the second 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.040
 promised that it will still begin to balance on 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.589
 statistics but now it's past 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.640
 quite a lot of time I skated a lot 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.879
 not one hundred battles 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.470
 namely in the form of command in battles on 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.210
 statistics is now not a balance like us 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.190
 we see on the reindeer we throw against 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.159
 red players and this is quite frequent 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.049
 phenomenon naturally you can get caught 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.850
 on experienced players and then you just 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.630
 hang lyulya but it happens 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.430
 rarely yes of course sometimes happens 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.990
 red merge but in the whole article 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:20.049
 statistics show that the players 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.939
 75 of their cases, they just stand and t 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.970
 feat base they drive off here they are 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.799
 appeared over the circles at the beginning of the cutting 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.380
 they drive off just give back and 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.770
 are all hiding somewhere in the area 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.560
 the red line of course yaga is not 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.380
 the best example but she has of course 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.659
 has its advantages for team battles with her 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.850
 well punched edge as we see i 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.979
 without gold, by the way, problems can 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.499
 there are problems only there with 30 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.149
 foursome or at worst with t30 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:52.600
 twos which is now I'm just 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.999
 it has been spotted constantly in these 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.979
 framework and it is simply impossible to pierce it 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:59.499
 although it will lead me very well 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.450
 don't look i just two in a row 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.280
 getting her into the commander's cupboard and 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.109
 punching but in general she is not 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.939
 punches the commander's turret there 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.789
 constantly miss and just 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.180
 causes an itchy ass feeling from these 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.730
 t32 and so I immediately leave not 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.800
 trying to butt her like on the other 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.640
 not the flank but on the other side on the other 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.870
 sides of the building there are more pleasant enemies to 3 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.700
 4 5 to 30 four lev and 50100 of which 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.040
 easy punch 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.780
 so here if you have no yaga there 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.879
 any type of this three fours you 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.489
 they can generally just bend them 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.500
 we personally make and play without teams 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.140
 no command commander sense 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.940
 The game is simple and consists randomly Seryoga 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.709
 on but we communicate there by skype further 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.019
 we recruit random but we are there about our 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.180
 distracted things we talk and really 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.239
 somehow not every prominent action at all 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.790
 sometimes seryoga or me because of this 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.010
 burns especially when the articles are not 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.840
 exchanging earrings for their replay 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.769
 agate starts whining 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.690
 I also will not lie so that's what I mean 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.440
 there and without special commands and winrate with us 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.970
 there is 70 plus so who does not know 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.230
 by the way in team fights if you 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.920
 you lose almost no money and 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.060
 experience generally there in the zero area you 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.090
 charge so you only need to win 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.650
 for the victory really given some 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.079
 good good so let's say loans 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.370
 good experience is plenty enough 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.739
 comfortable that is not even the point is that 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.209
 in team in team battles constantly 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.910
 confused with commander but principle yes 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:42.340
 it seems that the thing is not clear 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.200
 farm what is increased wanted exactly how 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.180
 Often you get these loans by and 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.579
 last much less they are here 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.160
 10-minute and average battle lasts well 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.139
 there is 5 minutes while random 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.269
 average fight lasts from 7 minutes 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.730
 instead of text shoot from this four 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.829
 which is 248 breaking through 400 single damage 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.079
 shoots 50 soda flour just isn't 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.329
 breaks through act slide well thank you well 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.000
 but that nagged further I will just 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.889
 I disassemble 50 acres, that's what I mean, that is 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.590
 you get about as much as 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:15.280
 in random but at the same time get more for 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.590
 battle to him that battles go faster enemies 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.299
 constantly come across inexperienced but it happens 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.010
 that inexperienced and merge because 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.700
 just relaxing in the more yaga 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.229
 my tank down is not suitable for all maps 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.150
 have to somehow get out 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.889
 and here we see that I occupy enough 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.160
 good position advantageous to yourself 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.410
 here are a bunch of rubbish debris 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.479
 of all this from the buildings they close 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.030
 my lower armor player sticks out a little there 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.730
 only top armor plates iru 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.890
 which I just simply can not 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.840
 punch and so in general you feel 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.110
 comfortable first fights of course on 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.540
 Jagdtigre 88 I spat on the steppes 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.430
 I was driving somewhere, so 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.440
 ever went driving me 1 because 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.800
 that i almost have no understeer 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.190
 no and on the sides of the armor no friends too 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.460
 I just screamed and closed the game with these 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.800
 shouts but then somehow got used to it already 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.630
 I realized that as a hurry somewhere not 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.180
 you need to get moments when you just 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.700
 you don't have time and kill everyone for 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.580
 you but here in ruinberg very 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.800
 Comfortably manifests itself this tank you 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.780
 always have time to always farm and always 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.190
 enjoy this 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.200
 dynamic fast fight 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.940
 5 and a half minutes have passed I already 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.840
 shot there three and a half thousand 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.000
 damage almost got a bunch of credits 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.410
 on farm so let's say therefore I hope 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.210
 was you information for this useful 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.430
 husband someone was afraid to go into command 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.410
 battles did not know what yes there is now but 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.470
 After the patch, all friends can comfortably 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.820
 farm if you want to also pump 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.140
 you do n't want any eighth level 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.820
 come in randomly because you 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.360
 not good if you do not want to merge 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.240
 statu 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.640

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.170
