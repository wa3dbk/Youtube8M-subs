00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.260
 I can see 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.840
 Your eyes 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.740
 Looking out over the horizon 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 Unmanned street corner 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.540
 Silent hug 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.800
 Quiet love is burning 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.420
 Woo I can hear your voice 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:13.580
 Woo I can hear you in my mind 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:24.020
 I remembered when you first remembered the mottled time. 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:33.760
 You are no longer wandering by my side. 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:42.600
 I think of the familiar streets, remembering the beauty of the past. 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 There is only one place where you and I know 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.640
 My heartbeat 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.600
 your smile 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.260
 Quietly rely on me 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.180
 Woo I can hear your voice 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:33.800
 Wowoo, you are an eternal paradise 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:43.340
 I remembered when you first remembered the mottled time. 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:52.600
 You are no longer wandering by my side. 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:01.980
 I think of the familiar streets, remembering the beauty of the past. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.520
 There is only one place where you and I know 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.180
 I think of the time when you first think of mottled time (you look like) 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:50.340
 You are no longer wandering by my side. 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.980
 I think of the familiar street, remembering the beauty of the past. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.620
 There is a place 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.480
 Only you and I know 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.560
 I know 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:27.040
 Only we know
