00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:17.620 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.040 

here's<00:00:18.100> the<00:00:18.310> seventh<00:00:18.730> where's<00:00:19.600> the<00:00:19.810> fifth

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
here's the nine move g-minor then we

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.820 
here's the nine move g-minor then we
have<00:00:26.200> SS<00:00:27.420> or<00:00:28.420> a<00:00:28.480> major<00:00:28.990> we're<00:00:29.590> going<00:00:29.710> to<00:00:29.770> go

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
have SS or a major we're going to go

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.260 
have SS or a major we're going to go
back<00:00:29.950> to<00:00:30.099> D<00:00:30.930> then<00:00:31.930> we<00:00:32.110> have<00:00:32.230> a<00:00:32.500> again<00:00:32.800> or<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.820> SS

really<00:00:34.570> what<00:00:34.870> I'm<00:00:34.960> playing<00:00:35.290> a<00:00:35.500> sus<00:00:35.739> and

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
really what I'm playing a sus and

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.530 
really what I'm playing a sus and
thinking<00:00:36.220> here's<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.760> root<00:00:36.970> of<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.330> chord

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
thinking here's the root of the chord

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.930 
thinking here's the root of the chord
and<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.770> play<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:38.980> sus<00:00:39.280> chord<00:00:39.550> I'm<00:00:39.610> playing<00:00:39.850> a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
and to play a sus chord I'm playing a

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.150 
and to play a sus chord I'm playing a
major<00:00:40.239> triad<00:00:41.080> a<00:00:41.260> whole<00:00:41.440> step<00:00:41.650> below<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.890> root

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
major triad a whole step below the root

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.500 
major triad a whole step below the root
so<00:00:42.430> I'm<00:00:42.489> going<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.699> play<00:00:42.790> it<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.030> in<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.330> left

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
so I'm going to play it a in the left

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.930 
so I'm going to play it a in the left
hand<00:00:43.690> single<00:00:44.110> note<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:45.160> G<00:00:45.520> major<00:00:45.790> chord

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
hand single note and the G major chord

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.320 
hand single note and the G major chord
in<00:00:46.300> my<00:00:46.390> right<00:00:46.570> hand<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:48.190> pattern<00:00:48.489> works

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
in my right hand and that pattern works

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.240 
in my right hand and that pattern works
great<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:49.899> formula<00:00:50.320> works<00:00:50.530> great<00:00:50.829> for<00:00:50.860> a<00:00:51.070> lot

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
great that formula works great for a lot
