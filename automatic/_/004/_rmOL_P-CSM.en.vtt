fluid I poured a whole quart into the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.120 
fluid I poured a whole quart into the
pump<00:01:32.869> which<00:01:33.110> should<00:01:33.320> be<00:01:33.470> enough<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.860> do<00:01:34.010> this

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
pump which should be enough to do this

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.880 
pump which should be enough to do this
job<00:01:34.570> it's<00:01:35.570> always<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:35.900> good<00:01:36.080> idea<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:36.530> consult

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
job it's always a good idea to consult

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.290 
job it's always a good idea to consult
the<00:01:37.100> service<00:01:37.430> manual<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:37.909> see<00:01:37.940> what<00:01:38.180> the

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
the service manual to see what the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.480 
the service manual to see what the
proper<00:01:38.659> pump<00:01:38.930> pressure<00:01:39.200> should<00:01:39.530> be<00:01:39.560> if<00:01:39.950> you're

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
proper pump pressure should be if you're

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.850 
proper pump pressure should be if you're
unsure<00:01:40.640> 10<00:01:41.360> psi<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:42.050> good<00:01:42.200> place<00:01:42.410> to<00:01:42.590> start

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
unsure 10 psi is a good place to start

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.550 
unsure 10 psi is a good place to start
so<00:01:43.700> I'm<00:01:43.790> going<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:43.940> pump<00:01:44.210> this<00:01:44.360> up<00:01:44.420> until<00:01:45.290> I<00:01:45.350> get

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
so I'm going to pump this up until I get

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.499 
so I'm going to pump this up until I get
to<00:01:45.680> 10<00:01:45.890> psi<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:48.740> then<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.880> Machine<00:01:50.180> also

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
to 10 psi and then the Machine also

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.230 
to 10 psi and then the Machine also
comes<00:01:50.750> with<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:51.050> hook<00:01:51.550> which<00:01:52.550> makes<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:53.060> nice

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
comes with this hook which makes it nice

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.300

to<00:01:53.990> hold<00:01:54.200> everything<00:01:54.500> level<00:01:54.890> while<00:01:55.159> you're

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
to hold everything level while you're

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.130 
to hold everything level while you're
bleeding<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.670> brakes<00:01:55.759> now<00:01:56.720> we're<00:01:56.899> ready<00:01:57.050> to

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
bleeding the brakes now we're ready to

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.010 
bleeding the brakes now we're ready to
lift<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.530> vehicle

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.930 

I've<00:02:03.020> securely<00:02:03.440> lifted<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.979> vehicle<00:02:04.430> in<00:02:04.610> this

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
situation I'm only bleeding one brake if

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.680 
situation I'm only bleeding one brake if
you're<00:02:07.460> bleeding<00:02:07.820> more<00:02:07.940> than<00:02:08.090> one<00:02:08.209> brake<00:02:08.450> it's

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
you're bleeding more than one brake it's
