now<00:00:01.410> that<00:00:01.620> you<00:00:01.709> have<00:00:01.740> your<00:00:02.070> first<00:00:02.310> crossing

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
now that you have your first crossing

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.880 
now that you have your first crossing
spoke<00:00:03.179> install<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:04.080> other<00:00:04.259> eight<00:00:04.500> are<00:00:04.529> easy

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
spoke install the other eight are easy

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.700 
spoke install the other eight are easy
just<00:00:05.730> skip<00:00:06.000> one<00:00:06.270> hub<00:00:06.509> hole<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.049> then<00:00:07.379> skip

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
just skip one hub hole and then skip

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.740 
just skip one hub hole and then skip
three<00:00:08.040> rim<00:00:08.250> holes<00:00:08.519> just<00:00:08.790> like<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.389> did<00:00:09.599> when

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
three rim holes just like you did when

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.150 
three rim holes just like you did when
you<00:00:09.870> installed<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> first<00:00:10.650> set<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.889> nine

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
you installed the first set of nine

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.480 
you installed the first set of nine
spokes<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:13.230> next<00:00:13.500> crossing<00:00:13.799> spoke<00:00:14.250> is

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
spokes so the next crossing spoke is

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.670 
spokes so the next crossing spoke is
pulled<00:00:14.820> through<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> hub<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.109> next<00:00:16.379> open

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
pulled through the hub in the next open

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.099 
pulled through the hub in the next open
hole<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.640> hole<00:00:17.850> between<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.330> two<00:00:18.600> crossing

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
hole the hole between the two crossing

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.410 
hole the hole between the two crossing
spokes<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.830> taken<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.340> by<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.550> spoke<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
spokes is taken up by a spoke with the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.460 
spokes is taken up by a spoke with the
head<00:00:21.600> facing<00:00:21.930> you

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
head facing you

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.939 
head facing you
now<00:00:23.160> skip<00:00:23.580> one<00:00:24.090> two<00:00:24.359> three<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.140> install<00:00:25.769> into

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
now skip one two three and install into

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.429 
now skip one two three and install into
the<00:00:26.160> fourth<00:00:26.430> hole<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.689> remember<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.289> lace

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the fourth hole but remember to lace

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.500 
the fourth hole but remember to lace
under<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> last<00:00:29.279> spoke<00:00:29.640> before<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.240> install

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
under the last spoke before you install

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.270 
under the last spoke before you install
into<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> rim<00:00:35.899> as<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.200> install<00:00:37.620> more<00:00:37.649> spokes

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
into the rim as you install more spokes

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.369 
into the rim as you install more spokes
there<00:00:38.879> will<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.059> less<00:00:39.390> thread<00:00:39.750> sticking<00:00:40.110> up

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
there will be less thread sticking up

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.350 
there will be less thread sticking up
past<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> top<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> rim<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> may<00:00:42.329> be

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
past the top of the rim so it may be

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.330 
past the top of the rim so it may be
easier<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:43.050> turn<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> spoke<00:00:43.649> nipple<00:00:44.010> from<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
easier to turn the spoke nipple from the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.680 
easier to turn the spoke nipple from the
side<00:00:44.579> rather<00:00:45.300> than<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> top<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:48.300> two<00:00:48.510> new

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.049 
side rather than the top the two new
spokes<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> gap<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.219> three<00:00:50.820> holes

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
spokes now have a gap of three holes
