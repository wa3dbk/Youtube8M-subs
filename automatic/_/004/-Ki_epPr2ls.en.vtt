have to mix colors will go to an easy
one<00:01:09.280> first<00:01:09.580> let's<00:01:10.000> say<00:01:10.420> i'll<00:01:10.690> click<00:01:10.870> on<00:01:11.020> one<00:01:11.170> of

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
one first let's say i'll click on one of

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.380 
one first let's say i'll click on one of
these<00:01:11.350> random<00:01:11.590> ones<00:01:12.009> and<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.880> nice<00:01:13.030> thing<00:01:13.060> i

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
these random ones and the nice thing i

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.050 
these random ones and the nice thing i
like<00:01:13.570> about<00:01:13.600> this<00:01:13.990> game<00:01:14.320> is<00:01:14.560> there's<00:01:15.060> probably

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
like about this game is there's probably

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.600 
like about this game is there's probably
hundreds<00:01:17.049> of<00:01:17.200> ways<00:01:17.409> you<00:01:17.470> can<00:01:17.979> solve<00:01:18.310> these

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
hundreds of ways you can solve these

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.039 
hundreds of ways you can solve these
levels<00:01:18.970> so<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:20.350> can<00:01:20.590> see<00:01:20.860> that<00:01:20.890> um<00:01:21.340> i<00:01:22.049> started

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
levels so you can see that um i started

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.109 
levels so you can see that um i started
a<00:01:23.079> second<00:01:23.439> one<00:01:23.560> here<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:24.310> there<00:01:24.759> are<00:01:24.790> several

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
a second one here so there are several

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.959 
a second one here so there are several
solutions<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.590> game<00:01:26.829> also<00:01:27.070> allows<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.850> to

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
solutions the game also allows you to

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.789 
solutions the game also allows you to
share<00:01:28.210> solutions<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.079> say<00:01:29.259> i<00:01:29.290> solve<00:01:29.649> this

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
share solutions so say i solve this

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.410 
share solutions so say i solve this
level<00:01:30.189> and<00:01:30.219> i<00:01:30.369> want<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:30.640> share<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:30.880> with<00:01:31.030> the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
level and i want to share it with the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.980 
level and i want to share it with the

here so what you want to do is and this
actually<00:02:06.939> also<00:02:07.359> offers<00:02:07.869> if<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.140> want<00:02:08.320> to

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
actually also offers if you want to

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.190 
actually also offers if you want to
shake<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.649> so<00:02:08.979> I'll<00:02:09.130> shake<00:02:09.729> my<00:02:09.940> phone<00:02:10.200> it'll

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
shake it so I'll shake my phone it'll

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.690 
shake it so I'll shake my phone it'll
let<00:02:11.350> me<00:02:11.440> clear<00:02:11.680> all<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.950> tracks<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.460> way<00:02:12.640> too

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
let me clear all the tracks that way too

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.050 
let me clear all the tracks that way too
or<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.450> could<00:02:13.630> erase<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.490> piece<00:02:15.820> at<00:02:16.000> a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
or you could erase just a piece at a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.240 
or you could erase just a piece at a
time<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.500> I'm<00:02:17.830> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.010> go<00:02:18.160> ahead<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.990> draw

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
time so I'm going to go ahead and draw

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.190 
time so I'm going to go ahead and draw
rack<00:02:21.370> over<00:02:21.670> here<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.780> can<00:02:22.960> do<00:02:23.080> this

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
rack over here and I can do this

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.280 
rack over here and I can do this
different<00:02:23.620> than<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.830> did<00:02:24.010> last<00:02:24.040> time<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.480> then

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
different than I did last time and then

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.370 
different than I did last time and then
you<00:02:26.440> click<00:02:26.620> start<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.130> trains<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:29.200> that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
you click start the trains and that

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.340 
you click start the trains and that
train<00:02:29.650> will<00:02:29.830> go<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.070> that<00:02:30.220> house<00:02:30.960> so<00:02:31.960> it's

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
train will go in that house so it's

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.130 
train will go in that house so it's
telling<00:02:32.590> us<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.070> we<00:02:33.130> solved<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.450> let's

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
telling us that we solved that so let's

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.490 
telling us that we solved that so let's
go<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.500> next<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.610> then<00:02:36.990> let's<00:02:37.990> go<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.260> one

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
go to next and then let's go to one

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.530 
go to next and then let's go to one
that's<00:02:38.800> maybe<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.370> little<00:02:39.760> bit<00:02:40.000> harder<00:02:40.330> where

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
that's maybe a little bit harder where

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.350 
that's maybe a little bit harder where
we<00:02:40.660> need<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.959> combine<00:02:41.200> some<00:02:41.709> colors<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:43.180> let's

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
we need to combine some colors so let's

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.980 
we need to combine some colors so let's
go<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:43.780> one<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:45.510> maybe<00:02:46.510> we'll<00:02:46.810> go<00:02:46.959> over

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
go to this one and maybe we'll go over

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.710 
go to this one and maybe we'll go over
here<00:02:48.810> okay<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:51.010> one<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.700> where<00:02:52.120> okay<00:02:52.540> this

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
here okay so this one is where okay this

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.140 
here okay so this one is where okay this
is<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> good<00:02:53.110> example<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.800> you've<00:02:54.430> got<00:02:54.670> two<00:02:54.910> hubs

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
is a good example of you've got two hubs

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.210 
is a good example of you've got two hubs
in<00:02:55.390> only<00:02:55.540> one<00:02:55.810> station<00:02:56.470> it's<00:02:56.739> only<00:02:57.010> going<00:02:57.160> to

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
in only one station it's only going to

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.729 
in only one station it's only going to
accept<00:02:57.610> one<00:02:57.880> train<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:58.720> let's<00:02:58.989> say<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.260> draw

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
accept one train so let's say I draw

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.380 
accept one train so let's say I draw
these<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.930> have<00:03:02.340> two<00:03:03.340> trains<00:03:03.700> going<00:03:04.239> in

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
these and I have two trains going in

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:13.550 
these and I have two trains going in
here<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.890> second<00:03:12.250> one<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.520> going<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.700> crash

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
here the second one is going to crash

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.350 
here the second one is going to crash
because<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.770> only<00:03:14.920> wants<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.310> accept<00:03:15.700> one<00:03:16.000> so

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
because it only wants to accept one so

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.850 
because it only wants to accept one so
in<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:16.840> level<00:03:17.080> you're<00:03:17.380> going<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.560> have<00:03:17.709> to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
in this level you're going to have to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.460 
in this level you're going to have to
find<00:03:18.070> a<00:03:18.250> way<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:19.270> merge<00:03:19.510> these<00:03:19.870> two<00:03:19.930> trains

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
find a way to merge these two trains

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.010 
find a way to merge these two trains
together<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:21.340> I'll<00:03:21.970> delete<00:03:22.360> all<00:03:22.540> my<00:03:22.690> tracks

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
together so I'll delete all my tracks

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.530 
together so I'll delete all my tracks
and<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:25.360> will<00:03:25.570> go<00:03:25.720> ahead<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:27.180> merge<00:03:28.180> these

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
and I will go ahead and merge these

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:38.670 
and I will go ahead and merge these
together<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:36.519> it's<00:03:37.180> kind<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.989> really<00:03:38.500> have

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
together so it's kind of you really have

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.570 
together so it's kind of you really have
to<00:03:38.860> strategize<00:03:39.160> on<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:39.910> game<00:03:40.320> it's<00:03:41.320> not<00:03:42.310> as

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
to strategize on this game it's not as

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.640 
to strategize on this game it's not as
easy<00:03:42.610> as<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.390> would<00:03:43.930> think<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.320> would<00:03:44.470> be

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
easy as you would think it would be

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.130 
easy as you would think it would be
because<00:03:44.860> you've<00:03:45.100> really<00:03:45.549> gotta<00:03:45.959> think<00:03:46.959> about

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
because you've really gotta think about

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.550 
because you've really gotta think about
timing<00:03:47.620> on<00:03:47.950> these<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:49.360> can<00:03:49.540> switch<00:03:49.870> tracks<00:03:50.290> by

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
timing on these you can switch tracks by

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.800 
timing on these you can switch tracks by
doing<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:52.170> double<00:03:53.170> tap<00:03:53.320> in<00:03:53.530> you<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:54.660> see<00:03:55.660> we

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
doing that double tap in you and see we

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.660 
doing that double tap in you and see we
crashed<00:03:56.110> again<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.100> got<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.340> find<00:03:57.549> a<00:03:57.640> way

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
crashed again so you got to find a way

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.220 
crashed again so you got to find a way
to<00:03:57.880> make<00:03:58.150> these<00:03:58.360> trains<00:03:58.750> meet<00:03:59.110> in<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.410> middle

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
to make these trains meet in the middle

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.100 
to make these trains meet in the middle
to<00:04:02.230> where<00:04:02.640> they'll<00:04:03.640> merge<00:04:03.940> so<00:04:04.420> typically<00:04:04.930> what

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
to where they'll merge so typically what

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.350 
to where they'll merge so typically what
I'll<00:04:05.260> do<00:04:05.470> is<00:04:05.620> I'll<00:04:05.769> see<00:04:05.829> how<00:04:06.340> many<00:04:06.519> grid<00:04:06.790> spaces

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
I'll do is I'll see how many grid spaces

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.350 
I'll do is I'll see how many grid spaces
I<00:04:07.480> have<00:04:07.660> going<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.110> these<00:04:08.290> guys<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.790> maybe<00:04:10.180> I

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
I have going to these guys so maybe I

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:19.509 
I have going to these guys so maybe I
will<00:04:11.340> come<00:04:12.340> down<00:04:12.549> this<00:04:12.760> way

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.460 

and<00:04:20.120> hopefully<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:20.989> will<00:04:21.079> get<00:04:21.229> them<00:04:21.319> to

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
and hopefully that will get them to

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.899 
and hopefully that will get them to
merge<00:04:24.789> there<00:04:25.789> we<00:04:25.940> go<00:04:27.069> and<00:04:28.069> we<00:04:28.340> march<00:04:28.639> two

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:28.909 
merge there we go and we march two

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:33.689 
merge there we go and we march two
trains<00:04:29.240> into<00:04:29.509> one<00:04:30.610> you'll<00:04:31.610> also<00:04:31.849> deal<00:04:32.360> with

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
trains into one you'll also deal with

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.010 
trains into one you'll also deal with
places<00:04:34.699> where<00:04:34.940> you'll<00:04:35.270> have<00:04:35.509> to<00:04:35.720> combine

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
places where you'll have to combine

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.540 
places where you'll have to combine
colors<00:04:36.770> so<00:04:37.580> let's<00:04:37.849> go<00:04:38.030> into<00:04:38.360> one<00:04:38.509> of<00:04:38.569> these

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
colors so let's go into one of these

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.309 
colors so let's go into one of these
this<00:04:40.550> one<00:04:40.759> looks<00:04:41.000> like<00:04:41.090> 10<00:04:41.599> there<00:04:42.020> we<00:04:42.139> go<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:44.960> as

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
this one looks like 10 there we go so as

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.350 
this one looks like 10 there we go so as
you<00:04:45.500> can<00:04:45.650> see<00:04:45.949> you've<00:04:46.280> got<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.490> green<00:04:46.789> hub<00:04:47.090> and

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
you can see you've got a green hub and

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.170 
you can see you've got a green hub and
you've<00:04:48.199> got<00:04:48.349> a<00:04:48.409> blue<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:49.009> a<00:04:49.190> yellow<00:04:49.430> or<00:04:49.879> you've

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
you've got a blue and a yellow or you've

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.850 
you've got a blue and a yellow or you've
got<00:04:50.360> blue<00:04:50.539> and<00:04:50.690> yellow<00:04:50.810> hubs<00:04:51.199> and<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.620> green

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
got blue and yellow hubs and a green

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.649 
got blue and yellow hubs and a green
station<00:04:52.250> so<00:04:52.819> obviously<00:04:53.270> you're<00:04:53.389> gonna<00:04:53.539> have

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
station so obviously you're gonna have

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.480 
station so obviously you're gonna have
to<00:04:53.750> mix<00:04:53.960> these<00:04:54.199> two<00:04:54.409> trains<00:04:54.740> together<00:04:54.979> to<00:04:55.340> make

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
to mix these two trains together to make

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.330 
to mix these two trains together to make
a<00:04:55.520> green<00:04:55.849> train<00:04:56.500> so<00:04:57.500> we<00:04:58.009> will<00:04:59.919> bring<00:05:00.919> this<00:05:01.130> one

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
a green train so we will bring this one

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.189 
a green train so we will bring this one
down<00:05:01.400> here<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:05.360> see<00:05:05.539> right<00:05:05.810> there<00:05:06.020> how<00:05:06.169> I

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
down here and see right there how I

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:13.800 
down here and see right there how I
messed<00:05:06.500> up<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:07.610> go<00:05:07.819> ahead<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.180> erase<00:05:09.050> that

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:28.770 

bring<00:05:14.810> this<00:05:14.990> one<00:05:15.259> up<00:05:15.319> here

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.180 

and<00:05:29.780> you<00:05:29.960> can<00:05:30.110> click<00:05:30.290> the<00:05:30.440> undo<00:05:30.530> button<00:05:30.740> if<00:05:31.100> you

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
and you can click the undo button if you

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.100 
and you can click the undo button if you
just<00:05:31.400> want<00:05:31.610> to<00:05:31.639> unhook<00:05:31.970> one<00:05:32.270> and<00:05:32.570> like<00:05:32.930> I<00:05:33.050> said

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
just want to unhook one and like I said

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.629 
just want to unhook one and like I said
double<00:05:33.650> tapping<00:05:33.889> will<00:05:34.990> change<00:05:35.990> your<00:05:36.110> trains

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
double tapping will change your trains

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.460 
double tapping will change your trains
so<00:05:38.620> soon<00:05:39.730> so<00:05:40.730> that<00:05:40.760> track<00:05:41.180> is<00:05:41.210> too<00:05:41.600> long<00:05:41.870> so

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
so soon so that track is too long so

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:55.090 
so soon so that track is too long so
we'll<00:05:43.370> need<00:05:43.580> to<00:05:43.639> shorten<00:05:44.030> that<00:05:44.330> one<00:05:53.919> maybe<00:05:54.919> we

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
we'll need to shorten that one maybe we

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.230 
we'll need to shorten that one maybe we
can<00:05:55.250> just<00:05:55.400> have<00:05:55.550> a<00:05:55.580> meat<00:05:55.880> right<00:05:56.090> there<00:05:58.240> and

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
can just have a meat right there and

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.390 
can just have a meat right there and
there<00:05:59.540> we<00:05:59.660> go<00:05:59.710> that's<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:00.830> main<00:06:00.979> premise<00:06:01.190> of

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
there we go that's the main premise of

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.129 
there we go that's the main premise of
the<00:06:01.460> game<00:06:01.490> it<00:06:01.880> gets<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.150> lot<00:06:02.270> harder<00:06:02.330> to<00:06:02.900> where<00:06:03.110> I

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
the game it gets a lot harder to where I

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.900 
the game it gets a lot harder to where I
won't<00:06:03.710> solve<00:06:03.979> one<00:06:04.190> of<00:06:04.220> these<00:06:04.400> because<00:06:04.580> it'll

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
won't solve one of these because it'll

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.460 
won't solve one of these because it'll
probably<00:06:05.120> take<00:06:05.389> me<00:06:05.450> a<00:06:05.600> full<00:06:05.840> ten<00:06:06.050> minute<00:06:06.350> video

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
probably take me a full ten minute video

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.830 
probably take me a full ten minute video
I<00:06:07.150> never<00:06:08.150> claimed<00:06:08.419> to<00:06:08.450> be<00:06:08.600> smart<00:06:10.660> you'll<00:06:11.660> get

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
I never claimed to be smart you'll get

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.530 
I never claimed to be smart you'll get
to<00:06:12.500> the<00:06:12.620> point<00:06:12.830> where<00:06:13.310> some<00:06:13.550> of<00:06:13.610> these<00:06:13.820> get<00:06:14.360> to

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
to the point where some of these get to

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.469 
to the point where some of these get to
be<00:06:14.690> a<00:06:14.720> lot<00:06:15.200> more<00:06:15.229> difficult<00:06:16.190> as<00:06:16.370> you<00:06:16.550> go<00:06:16.760> I<00:06:17.120> have

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
be a lot more difficult as you go I have

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.540 
be a lot more difficult as you go I have
only<00:06:17.660> completed<00:06:18.229> a<00:06:18.320> couple<00:06:18.650> levels<00:06:18.860> in<00:06:19.190> here

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
only completed a couple levels in here

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.180 
only completed a couple levels in here
and<00:06:19.760> they<00:06:20.720> get<00:06:20.870> pretty<00:06:21.050> hard<00:06:21.320> pretty<00:06:21.620> quick<00:06:21.919> or

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
and they get pretty hard pretty quick or

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.710 
and they get pretty hard pretty quick or
you<00:06:22.280> can<00:06:22.520> see<00:06:22.790> that<00:06:23.000> you've<00:06:23.180> got<00:06:23.389> several

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
you can see that you've got several

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.140 
you can see that you've got several
different<00:06:24.200> hubs<00:06:24.520> several<00:06:25.520> different<00:06:25.820> colors

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
different hubs several different colors

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.610 
different hubs several different colors
that<00:06:26.360> you<00:06:26.419> have<00:06:26.630> to<00:06:26.780> combine<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.380> get<00:06:27.470> into

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
that you have to combine and get into

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.340 
that you have to combine and get into
the<00:06:27.800> station<00:06:28.070> so<00:06:28.340> it<00:06:29.270> requires<00:06:29.660> they<00:06:30.020> you<00:06:30.320> know

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
the station so it requires they you know

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.870 
the station so it requires they you know
they<00:06:30.440> can<00:06:30.740> make<00:06:30.890> you<00:06:31.010> scratch<00:06:31.250> your<00:06:31.460> head<00:06:31.640> for

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
they can make you scratch your head for

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.400 
they can make you scratch your head for
a<00:06:31.910> while<00:06:32.180> and<00:06:32.360> you<00:06:32.450> lot<00:06:32.600> that<00:06:32.810> you<00:06:32.960> can<00:06:33.080> skip

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
a while and you lot that you can skip

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.050 
a while and you lot that you can skip
around<00:06:33.710> and<00:06:34.039> come<00:06:34.220> back<00:06:34.250> to<00:06:34.610> them<00:06:34.700> which<00:06:34.910> I

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
around and come back to them which I

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.330 
around and come back to them which I
like<00:06:35.289> and<00:06:36.289> if<00:06:36.380> you<00:06:36.470> really<00:06:36.500> get<00:06:36.919> stumped<00:06:37.280> you

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
like and if you really get stumped you

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.950 
like and if you really get stumped you
can<00:06:37.490> always<00:06:37.700> look<00:06:37.910> for<00:06:38.120> a<00:06:38.150> solution<00:06:38.330> or<00:06:38.720> see

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
can always look for a solution or see

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.960 
can always look for a solution or see
how<00:06:39.080> other<00:06:39.289> people<00:06:39.590> solve<00:06:39.890> them<00:06:40.130> so<00:06:40.789> if<00:06:40.850> you

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
how other people solve them so if you

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.770 
how other people solve them so if you
guys<00:06:41.120> picked<00:06:41.419> up<00:06:41.600> this<00:06:41.750> game<00:06:42.050> or<00:06:42.410> if<00:06:42.650> you<00:06:43.370> uh

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
guys picked up this game or if you uh

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.940 
guys picked up this game or if you uh
you<00:06:44.780> know<00:06:44.900> thinking<00:06:45.200> about<00:06:45.410> picking<00:06:45.590> it<00:06:45.830> up

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
you know thinking about picking it up

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.950 
you know thinking about picking it up
and<00:06:46.100> you<00:06:46.190> do<00:06:46.370> let<00:06:47.060> us<00:06:47.090> know<00:06:47.210> what<00:06:47.570> you<00:06:47.660> think<00:06:47.840> in
