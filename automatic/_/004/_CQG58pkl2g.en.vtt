00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.369
 last week I woke up for tomorrow 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.790
 to take me out daily so I see that víctor 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.869
 valdés has said that he leaves not even going 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.610
 to negotiate leaves the boat and I was a 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.789
 little puzzled for 15 minutes 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.890
 thinking devils is a big surprise 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.500
 but I think that there was just no 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.620
 finished my coffee with milk and I gave myself 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.010
 mind that no no víctor is being 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.710
 current with himself explained to me does 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.970
 a while ago I made a report and 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.910
 Robinson with Victor 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.040
 It was a pleasant surprise to meet you 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 because it was a very guy 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.370
 sensitive had always seen that goalkeeper 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.600
 by not as marin and although such a fate 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.060
 then the diff of apparent mood different 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.780
 to your colleagues however once you 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.220
 ras is varnish 50 is a type 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.520
 hypersensitive that throughout his 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.770
 have risen in leaving football is 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.380
 who felt a stupid footballer 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.290
 being a goalkeeper he wanted to play and also 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.070
 He did not like that scene dsk him 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.380
 reasons and many times he wanted to leave and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.490
 fact left the farmhouse and more than a 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.520
 already as a starter with van gaal van 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.610
 gaal where he criticized that for what 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.700
 for from batteries to the kid and such but not a 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.090
 game more there was another big problem 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.670
 and ended up having a very very discussion 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.370
 hard and had to convince to Victor 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.570
 that capitulates more technical and saying 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.909
 those things 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.790
 Viktor thought there had been a 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.870
 great injustice thing that he was not 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.960
 for the border of accepting been pass the 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.920
 years and víctor if a 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.780
 absolutely magnificent career in the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.650
 Barça goal in the golden decade 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.620
 raising three glasses of europe 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.810
 including her being international 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.650
 absolute in a time when it 's almost 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.709
 impossible to play under the sticks of 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.270
 I think that what happens to víctor 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.940
 which is a do not say reluctant with 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.670
 certain concerns maybe I think 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.640
 that not even that is being wrong 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.130
 advised by your agent is very in the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.220
 Victor line when you know of 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.830
 who can tell if ten years in 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.960
 the club win three European Cups 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.590
 and it 's that I want something else I want to know 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.940
 to others in other cultures another language 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.820
 another thing because it is also true that 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.400
 football often does not last steals us 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.530
 education and say or preparation the 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.290
 training because very little of us 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.860
 we have gone through the university because 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.410
 we wanted to be footballers but the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.340
 football also kind of give back what 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.980
 stolen passport footballer with you 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.530
 you can go to the other culture and enriches 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.320
 you like going to college with 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.959
 thirty plus years already and penske víctor 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.480
 and he's happy with his career but 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.270
 Of course he wants to know more things in his 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.420
 life seems perfectly 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.420
 legitimate and also the bar parce out 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.820
 enough time to find another 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.400
 goalkeeper because I do not even know who is 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.010
 question of sitting in negotiate is to remove 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.850
 the same the wine I'm not leaving there's more world 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.490
 I want to have more world in my back 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.890
 having been a wonderful goalkeeper to 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.230
 right channel say hey it's that it's not that 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.220
 I do not want to move forward I just love it 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.320
 I want something else with my life here is 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.510
 how much is it that a football player says it 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.640
 being already holds such holder 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.610
 unquestionable no no questions 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.970
 about him and he plays in the best team in the 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.620
 world and says gives so we have arrived not 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.620
 I want it I want something else
