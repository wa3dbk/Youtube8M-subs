00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
drawbacks is that the decline position

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.520 
drawbacks is that the decline position
really<00:02:03.830> isn't<00:02:04.009> deep<00:02:04.250> enough<00:02:04.369> but<00:02:05.530> switching

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
really isn't deep enough but switching

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.460 
really isn't deep enough but switching
between<00:02:06.860> positions<00:02:07.490> as<00:02:07.700> easily<00:02:08.050> has<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.110> nice

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
between positions as easily has a nice
