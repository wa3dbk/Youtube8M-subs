00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.139
 super soft and super oil sandwiches 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:14.429
 tasty to make them you will need 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.400
 only one kg of 00 flour 4 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.920
 teaspoons of sugar and 4 of salt one 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.119
 Dehydrated brewer's yeast sachet 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.609
 olive oil and water with these doses 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.130
 you will be able to have a perfect cake 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.320
 to be worked as always I put 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.320
 inside a water bowl a 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 ambient temperature together with the yeast 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.280
 sugar and oil michelo all using a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.280
 spoon 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:01:02.400
 add the flour and salt to the meal 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:04.680
 all with your hands once you get in 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.960
 energetically passed the mixture with the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.119
 hands this is the result and face 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.600
 rise until doubled in a 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.600
 warm place 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.400
 this is the result of the dough afterwards 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.400
 having avoided them for a few hours 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.220
 to give the usual shape of the sandwich 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.440
 the dough is vivid and more pieces I give one 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.600
 approximately rectangular shape 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.270
 using your hands and then 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.430
 I'm going to roll it up from the short side of the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.900
 dough after having formed the sandwiches 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.000
 I get angry at the empire of a pan 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.800
 non-stick or with baking paper 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.050

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.720
 leavening completed liszt brush 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.970
 with plenty of olive oil and I make them 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.120
 bake at 200 degrees for about 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.780
 25 30 minutes or until they are well 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.570
