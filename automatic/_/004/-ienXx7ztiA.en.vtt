00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.610
 except all the girls are crias in 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:16.309
 this new video I'll explain how 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.189
 find the island of funds 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:24.020
 then to find it of a world already 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.849
 created it is enough to trek until it is 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.899
 usually located in the middle of the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.239
 sea 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.969
 but if you want absolutely at all 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:35.300
 costs to find one 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:38.469
 you have to create a new world is fine 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.469
 call it whatever you want 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.160
 an example comes mom creative sum 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.230
 the solution of the world the important thing is that 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.820
 here where it says if for the speaker 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:03.299
 of worlds you have to write lost love the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.379
 lost is remarkable if I think they don't go 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.710
 super flat 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.950
 I don't know, I think I don't close anyway 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:17.810
 also because it is right that on how you want 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.810
 created world we wait we wait 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:28.740
 initially it will answer here 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:32.220
 this violet and will always be the same too 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.100
 on creating a new world always putting 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.030
 lost will always save at this point 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.119
 here and there where then you will find a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.210
 small island this house is not read with a 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.420
 mushroom then here the more the thief in the day has 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.569
 got the little one with the water is still 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.489
 more here is bringing the world 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:58.099
 the main island that will always be 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:59.400
 same if you enter lost for the seed 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:03.930
 creator 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:09.570
 yes ok, star will turn this bulb 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:13.350
 precisely this material the mycelium that 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:17.120
 okay anyway there are normal 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.890
 also the coal iron mining everything then 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.550
 particularities of this biome are 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.820
 obviously these big mushrooms that they are 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.590
 only two types these here and these here 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.630
 dishes and these are almost domed 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:43.770
 you can also create them 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:48.480
 you just need the two bottoms and the flour 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:52.760
 redhead then you can and I want it 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.760
 also however on we find immediately 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.020
 let's try here I think it shouldn't be lost 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:05.379
 only on internal murder though 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.629
 facts does not even position itself 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.709
 those already on the ground with those already for 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:14.700
 you can do it in the marshes anyway 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:23.250
 the piazza is always a land of bones 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:27.880
 you double click 93 and grow up 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:32.980
 just big point for me type 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.920
 it's useful because maybe you can do it 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.040
 sniper and bob is still a 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:44.769
 raised platform that protects you from 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:48.840
 mob however you can do for example 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.840
 the scale 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:57.849
 I do a little house as its own self 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.670
 luck so through your yours 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:04.630
 I shelter a lot 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:09.010
 yes these too can be 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.349
 used as home many call it 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.040
 portable home then just do so then 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:17.340
 take either material you want and that 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.340
 put 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.850
 around 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:32.220
 so then go up here for example you can 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:35.600
 put one 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.600
 a trap door is possible 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.820
 here it is 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.820
 understand but can be closed 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.910
 field 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.490
 okay 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.360
 but you have your house here window 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.900
 however, also fort 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.550
 I have so 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.919
 have a little cable stuff for you 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.680
 make yourself to make a home quickly though 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.810
 do you have any mycelium handy? 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.409
 make slice to travel let's say one 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:33.080
 own home this very much 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:35.900
 however the idea is nice after that in 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.409
 this island beginning with mushrooms 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:45.349
 we find these animals that are the 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:47.060
 mustang then this remains what to do 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.979
 then 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:55.840
 if so us 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:59.110
 we kill are strong the more I see how the 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.310
 normal cow are found meat and the 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.620
 skin, however, according to me if they kill them 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.710
 for the meat it is useless for the skin 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.030
 maybe esteem for the home and why Roma 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:16.740
 for the simple reason that if we 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:20.050
 take a bowl 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.090
 here it is we get closer we click the 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.569
 right key 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.669
 we keep the soup a mushroom soup 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:30.159
 and this is the finite, that is, we drink it 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.539
 let's add the bowl now i can't for 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.310
 the entered profession goes 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.580
 and then we fill it so it's always food 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:41.409
 this thing is very useful 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:47.819
 to do it again to produce a make is enough 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:47.819
 wheat we find two glasses 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.730
 where you go 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:00.120
 here and here you are at the little night elise 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.820
 here it is then grows with milk 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:15.450
 I explained to you how to get to this 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.780
 he explains what he knows 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:26.520
 what you find in yes even smokes anyway 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:30.810
 are found and for this video is everything and 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:33.080
 see you at the next video and hello a 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.080
 all
