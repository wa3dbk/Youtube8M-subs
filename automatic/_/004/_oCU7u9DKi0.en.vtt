00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.180
Looks like we're makin' a little progress.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.790
Finally, a little hardware here on the front
door.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.390
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.390
I'm Allen Smith.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.950
Join me as I push the limits with time, budget
and creativity with the Garden Home Challenge,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.640
exclusively on eHow Home.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.960
How's it going there, Tony?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
Pretty good.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.960
Lookin' great.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.960
Okay, alright.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.880
Hey, look at this: Huh, the door's comin'
together.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.070
It's pretty exciting when you finally get
a door knob on the door.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.269
And what we decided to do here is make this
36 inches tall.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.140
So, that's standard height for a door knob.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.609
And if you look here on the back, you can
see, actually, where the old door knobs was,

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.030
which it's about 3 to 4 inches lower.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.640
And this where Tony's sort of covered all
of that up.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.670
And, so you can see, in the past door knobs
were lower–I guess people were just shorter

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.670
then.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.449
You know, I'm overall pleased with the color.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.680
When they delivered this I was a little surprised.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320
It's a little brassier than I thought.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.509
I really wanna go with a pewter or satin nickel
color, so I'm gonna double check that.

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.509
But anyway, it's easy to take on and off.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.149
Tony was just screwing the backside in.

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.380
And what's great about this lock set, which
is really important, is that you can re-key

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.719
it yourself.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.659
You don't have to take it to a locksmith–
'take it', being the key, to the locksmith

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.649
to have this put on.

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.179
So what he's doing here is he's actually putting
on the doorknob, which can be locked here,

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:44.479
and on the backside, just by twisting and
locking it like that–just a typical standard

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.509
knob.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.249
And then, just above it, he's gonna put a
deadbolt on here for extra security.

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:55.979
Now, we could have used a handled knob here
on the front, but I just don't know how much

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.219
traffic they're gonna have coming through
the front door.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.939
But on the inside of the house, I think we
may go with the lever type.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.600
So if you got things in your hands, you're
carrying laundry around, and you can just

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.590
push your hand down on the lever and open
the door and move around.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.550
Those are really easy to use.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.510
If you're enjoying following the updates on
the building of this house, tell a friend

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.510
about it.
