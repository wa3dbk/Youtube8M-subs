00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.240 

now<00:02:31.690> we're<00:02:31.930> using<00:02:32.140> our<00:02:32.350> options<00:02:32.830> are<00:02:33.040> options

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
now we're using our options are options

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.450 
now we're using our options are options
are<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:35.110> plate<00:02:35.320> on<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> high<00:02:35.710> hat<00:02:35.740> instead<00:02:36.280> of

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
are the plate on the high hat instead of

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:49.650 
are the plate on the high hat instead of
just<00:02:36.610> doing<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.390> snare<00:02:37.600> drum<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
just doing it on the snare drum so the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:03:02.970 
just doing it on the snare drum so the
action<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.320> on<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.950> top<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.490> two<00:03:00.420> now<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:02.710> kick

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
action is on the top of two now the kick

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.750 
action is on the top of two now the kick
plays<00:03:03.370> on<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.180> downbeat<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.810> one<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.760> top

plays on the downbeat of one and the top

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.000 
plays on the downbeat of one and the top
of<00:03:07.000> four<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.660> like<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.020> pickup<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.800> beat

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
of four so it's like a pickup in to beat

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.710 
of four so it's like a pickup in to beat
