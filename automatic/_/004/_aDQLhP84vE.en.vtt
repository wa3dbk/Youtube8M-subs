00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
go around for everybody but maybe not

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.770

member really autograph I would assume

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.190 
member really autograph I would assume
it<00:01:55.240> would<00:01:55.330> be<00:01:55.509> since<00:01:55.720> everything<00:01:56.020> should<00:01:56.170> be

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
it would be since everything should be

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.460 
it would be since everything should be
signed<00:01:56.560> but<00:01:56.920> anyway<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.140> end<00:01:59.259> up<00:01:59.289> catching

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
applegate actually I think that's one of

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.220 
applegate actually I think that's one of
the<00:03:34.160> better<00:03:34.670> ones<00:03:34.790> in<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.180> product<00:03:35.630> I<00:03:35.780> have

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
the better ones in the product I have

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.140 
the better ones in the product I have
not<00:03:36.440> seen<00:03:36.800> very<00:03:37.010> many<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.310> her<00:03:37.430> show<00:03:37.640> up<00:03:37.849> so

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
not seen very many of her show up so

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.400 
not seen very many of her show up so
that's<00:03:38.330> actually<00:03:38.690> pretty<00:03:38.840> cool<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:41.319> don't<00:03:42.319> even

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
that's actually pretty cool I don't even

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.750 
that's actually pretty cool I don't even
not<00:03:42.680> even<00:03:42.709> sure<00:03:43.010> if<00:03:43.069> I'd<00:03:43.220> actually<00:03:43.400> seen<00:03:43.730> one

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760

on<00:03:43.940> ebay<00:03:44.150> yet<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:44.840> it's<00:03:45.560> probably<00:03:45.739> one<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:45.980> the

on ebay yet so it's probably one of the
better<00:03:46.250> ones<00:03:46.370> i<00:03:46.670> think<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:46.940> was<00:03:47.030> Britney
