now<00:00:05.180> we'll<00:00:05.450> focus<00:00:05.660> on<00:00:05.990> how<00:00:06.170> to<00:00:06.200> draw<00:00:06.620> fruit<00:00:06.950> and

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
now we'll focus on how to draw fruit and

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.549 
now we'll focus on how to draw fruit and
of<00:00:07.910> course<00:00:08.240> there<00:00:08.510> are<00:00:08.600> many<00:00:08.870> different<00:00:09.380> types

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
of course there are many different types

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.920 
of course there are many different types
of<00:00:09.889> fruit<00:00:10.220> one<00:00:10.610> can<00:00:10.850> draw<00:00:11.090> I'm<00:00:11.330> going<00:00:11.660> to<00:00:11.750> focus

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
of fruit one can draw I'm going to focus

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.710 
of fruit one can draw I'm going to focus
on<00:00:12.230> an<00:00:12.410> apple<00:00:12.860> and<00:00:13.100> when<00:00:13.700> I<00:00:13.730> look<00:00:14.000> at<00:00:14.150> an<00:00:14.269> apple

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
on an apple and when I look at an apple

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.130 
on an apple and when I look at an apple
what<00:00:15.230> I'm<00:00:15.380> seeing<00:00:15.890> initially<00:00:16.369> is<00:00:16.939> an<00:00:17.360> oval

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
what I'm seeing initially is an oval

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.980 
what I'm seeing initially is an oval
type<00:00:18.529> form<00:00:18.980> I'm<00:00:19.310> using<00:00:19.580> vine<00:00:20.029> charcoal<00:00:20.720> and

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
type form I'm using vine charcoal and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.179 
type form I'm using vine charcoal and
I'm<00:00:21.680> going<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.279> first<00:00:22.759> draw<00:00:23.570> this<00:00:24.200> basic<00:00:24.829> form

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
I'm going to first draw this basic form

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.839 
I'm going to first draw this basic form
again<00:00:25.970> just<00:00:26.900> an<00:00:27.140> oval<00:00:27.560> just<00:00:28.070> to<00:00:28.250> get<00:00:28.460> that

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
again just an oval just to get that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.900 
again just an oval just to get that
initial<00:00:29.210> shape<00:00:29.720> in<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:34.070> now<00:00:34.460> I'm<00:00:34.579> going<00:00:34.760> to

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
initial shape in and now I'm going to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.020 
initial shape in and now I'm going to
really<00:00:35.300> focus<00:00:36.079> on<00:00:36.590> two<00:00:37.010> things<00:00:37.039> I'm<00:00:37.640> going<00:00:37.940> to

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
really focus on two things I'm going to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.830 
really focus on two things I'm going to
put<00:00:38.329> in<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.660> circle<00:00:39.440> right<00:00:40.039> at<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:40.340> top<00:00:40.840> where

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
put in a circle right at the top where

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.619 
put in a circle right at the top where
the<00:00:41.989> apple<00:00:42.410> core<00:00:42.710> will<00:00:43.100> at<00:00:43.309> some<00:00:43.730> point<00:00:44.090> go<00:00:44.359> and

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
the apple core will at some point go and

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.930 
the apple core will at some point go and
now<00:00:44.989> I'm<00:00:45.199> going<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:45.530> focus<00:00:45.739> a<00:00:45.980> little<00:00:46.280> more<00:00:46.429> on

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
now I'm going to focus a little more on

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.500 
now I'm going to focus a little more on
the<00:00:47.179> outside<00:00:48.170> lines<00:00:48.620> of<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:48.980> Apple<00:00:49.460> it<00:00:49.879> is

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
the outside lines of the Apple it is

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.689 
the outside lines of the Apple it is
oval-shaped<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.039> there<00:00:52.250> are<00:00:52.339> some<00:00:52.519> more

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
oval-shaped but there are some more

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.119 
oval-shaped but there are some more
specific<00:00:52.940> shapes<00:00:53.780> going<00:00:54.140> on<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.010> I'm<00:00:55.100> just

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
specific shapes going on so I'm just

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.729 
specific shapes going on so I'm just
going<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.609> look<00:00:55.850> at<00:00:56.059> each<00:00:56.629> little<00:00:56.960> area<00:00:57.320> I

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
going to look at each little area I

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.439 
going to look at each little area I
realize<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.519> this<00:00:58.940> line<00:00:59.329> here<00:01:01.149> comes<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.420> a

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
realize that this line here comes to a

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.290 
realize that this line here comes to a
point<00:01:02.929> slightly<00:01:04.840> then<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:05.990> follows<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.620> oval

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
point slightly then it follows the oval

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.210 
point slightly then it follows the oval
and<00:01:08.300> then<00:01:08.450> it<00:01:08.570> comes<00:01:08.840> in<00:01:09.110> slightly<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:12.220> then

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
and then it comes in slightly and then

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.640 
and then it comes in slightly and then
I'll<00:01:13.340> look<00:01:13.490> at<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.790> other<00:01:13.940> side<00:01:14.330> doesn't<00:01:15.290> mean

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
I'll look at the other side doesn't mean

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.640 
I'll look at the other side doesn't mean
that<00:01:15.830> both<00:01:16.070> sides<00:01:16.400> are<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.700> same<00:01:16.730> exact<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:18.500> as

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
that both sides are the same exact so as

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.280 
that both sides are the same exact so as
long<00:01:18.890> as<00:01:18.950> I'm<00:01:19.250> really<00:01:19.880> really<00:01:20.270> looking<00:01:20.900> at<00:01:21.110> the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
long as I'm really really looking at the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.250 
long as I'm really really looking at the
Apple<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:21.920> get<00:01:22.190> all<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.490> my<00:01:22.700> information<00:01:23.260> what

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
Apple I get all of my information what

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.480 
Apple I get all of my information what
it<00:01:24.380> should<00:01:24.590> look<00:01:24.770> like<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:26.240> bottom<00:01:27.160> as<00:01:28.160> many

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
it should look like the bottom as many

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.480 
it should look like the bottom as many
apples<00:01:28.790> do<00:01:29.300> has<00:01:29.900> this<00:01:30.170> little<00:01:30.650> curve<00:01:31.160> and

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
apples do has this little curve and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.550 
apples do has this little curve and
that's<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.210> shape<00:01:32.420> of<00:01:32.600> my<00:01:32.750> Apple<00:01:33.170> I'm<00:01:33.320> going

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
that's the shape of my Apple I'm going

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.520 
that's the shape of my Apple I'm going
to<00:01:33.650> take<00:01:33.860> my<00:01:34.100> eraser<00:01:34.430> or<00:01:34.910> my<00:01:35.270> finger<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:35.960> just

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
to take my eraser or my finger and just

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.660 
to take my eraser or my finger and just
rub<00:01:36.650> out<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:38.270> initial<00:01:38.990> oval<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.710> now<00:01:40.220> I<00:01:40.250> have

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
rub out that initial oval and now I have

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.970 
rub out that initial oval and now I have
the<00:01:41.090> actual<00:01:41.270> lines<00:01:41.900> of<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.230> Apple<00:01:42.650> which<00:01:42.800> are

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
the actual lines of the Apple which are

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.610 
the actual lines of the Apple which are
slightly<00:01:43.520> more<00:01:43.910> detailed<00:01:44.420> if<00:01:44.900> I<00:01:45.200> want<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:45.560> can

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
slightly more detailed if I want I can

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.030 
slightly more detailed if I want I can
take<00:01:45.950> my<00:01:46.190> eraser<00:01:46.960> just<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.260> that<00:01:48.500> what's<00:01:48.710> left

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
take my eraser just so that what's left

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.250 
take my eraser just so that what's left
over<00:01:49.310> are<00:01:49.670> these<00:01:49.880> specific<00:01:50.180> lines<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:51.140> the

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
over are these specific lines of the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.770 
over are these specific lines of the
Apple<00:01:51.650> now<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:52.100> are<00:01:52.340> Apple<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:53.600> you're

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
Apple now you are Apple that you're

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.260 
Apple now you are Apple that you're
looking<00:01:54.200> at<00:01:54.380> will<00:01:55.070> most<00:01:55.370> likely<00:01:55.610> look

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
looking at will most likely look

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.270 
looking at will most likely look
different<00:01:56.690> than<00:01:56.840> this<00:01:56.990> Apple<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:58.100> although

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
different than this Apple so although

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.100 
different than this Apple so although
this<00:01:58.550> is<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.730> base<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.270> really<00:01:59.660> want<00:01:59.870> to<00:01:59.960> focus

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
this is a base you really want to focus

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.230 
this is a base you really want to focus
on<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.560> Apple<00:02:00.980> that's<00:02:01.220> in<00:02:01.370> front<00:02:01.670> of<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:02.030> and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
on the Apple that's in front of you and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.260 
on the Apple that's in front of you and
to<00:02:02.900> really<00:02:03.260> follow<00:02:03.680> those<00:02:04.130> lines<00:02:04.430> we're<00:02:05.090> going

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
to really follow those lines we're going

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.450 
to really follow those lines we're going
to<00:02:05.390> look<00:02:05.540> at<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.930> core<00:02:06.230> now<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:06.980> I'm<00:02:07.280> just

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
to look at the core now so I'm just

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.540 
to look at the core now so I'm just
going<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.790> shade<00:02:08.239> out<00:02:08.629> the<00:02:09.369> circle<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.489> I

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
going to shade out the circle that I

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.090 
going to shade out the circle that I
drew<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:11.180> can<00:02:11.690> allow<00:02:11.930> some<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.530> shading<00:02:12.950> to

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
drew I can allow some of the shading to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.850 
drew I can allow some of the shading to
still<00:02:13.370> shine<00:02:13.700> through<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:15.020> lot<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.560> people

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
still shine through but a lot of people

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.290 
still shine through but a lot of people
will<00:02:16.190> draw<00:02:16.460> an<00:02:16.580> apple<00:02:17.000> like

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
will draw an apple like

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
will draw an apple like
this<00:02:18.820> that's<00:02:19.820> not<00:02:20.150> necessarily<00:02:20.720> an<00:02:20.930> apple

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
this that's not necessarily an apple

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.020 
this that's not necessarily an apple
what<00:02:21.680> we're<00:02:21.890> going<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.160> really<00:02:22.430> look<00:02:22.640> at<00:02:22.850> is

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
what we're going to really look at is

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.170 
what we're going to really look at is
the<00:02:23.270> exact<00:02:23.840> shape<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.650> apple<00:02:25.190> core<00:02:25.430> so

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the exact shape of the apple core so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.200 
the exact shape of the apple core so
there's<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:26.950> little<00:02:27.950> curve<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.640> then<00:02:29.090> it

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
there's this little curve and then it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.750 
there's this little curve and then it
comes<00:02:29.480> up<00:02:29.900> almost<00:02:30.860> like<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.130> straight<00:02:31.520> line

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
comes up almost like a straight line

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.580 
comes up almost like a straight line
where<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.150> little<00:02:32.600> curve<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:36.380> other

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
where is a little curve to it the other

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.310 
where is a little curve to it the other
side<00:02:36.980> comes<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:40.990> then<00:02:41.990> it<00:02:42.140> meets

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
side comes in and out and then it meets

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.610 
side comes in and out and then it meets
at<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.590> top<00:02:42.860> I'm<00:02:43.550> going<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:43.910> erase<00:02:44.420> inside<00:02:45.350> of

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
at the top I'm going to erase inside of

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.850 
at the top I'm going to erase inside of
this<00:02:45.830> little<00:02:46.160> core<00:02:46.550> just<00:02:47.390> because<00:02:47.900> we<00:02:48.680> don't

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
this little core just because we don't

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.620 
this little core just because we don't
want<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.100> see<00:02:49.400> any<00:02:49.670> lines<00:02:49.820> coming<00:02:50.420> through<00:02:50.810> it

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
want to see any lines coming through it

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.810 
want to see any lines coming through it
my<00:02:53.630> last<00:02:54.020> step<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.650> I'm<00:02:55.190> going<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.490> just<00:02:55.610> add<00:02:55.790> a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
my last step is I'm going to just add a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.020 
my last step is I'm going to just add a
little<00:02:56.060> bit<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.960> shading<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:58.520> I'm<00:02:58.760> going<00:02:58.970> to

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
little bit of shading so I'm going to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.630 
little bit of shading so I'm going to
use<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.390> side<00:02:59.750> of<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.200> charcoal<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.460> can

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
use the side of the charcoal and you can

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.610 
use the side of the charcoal and you can
practice<00:03:01.880> on<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.390> side<00:03:02.600> of<00:03:02.630> your<00:03:02.960> paper<00:03:03.200> the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
practice on the side of your paper the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.280 
practice on the side of your paper the
side<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:04.580> charcoal<00:03:05.060> rather<00:03:05.510> than<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.020> tip

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
side of the charcoal rather than the tip

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.250 
side of the charcoal rather than the tip
covers<00:03:06.770> more<00:03:07.280> surface<00:03:07.850> area<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.480> it's<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.230> very

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
covers more surface area and it's a very

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.860 
covers more surface area and it's a very
expressive<00:03:10.010> way<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.580> move<00:03:11.150> through<00:03:11.570> your

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
expressive way to move through your

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.680 
expressive way to move through your
drawing<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:12.980> I'm<00:03:13.340> gonna<00:03:13.520> look<00:03:13.850> at<00:03:14.060> my<00:03:14.090> Apple

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
drawing so I'm gonna look at my Apple

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.520 
drawing so I'm gonna look at my Apple
and<00:03:14.930> find<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.800> areas<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.970> are<00:03:17.150> darker<00:03:17.660> for

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
and find the areas that are darker for

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.090 
and find the areas that are darker for
me<00:03:18.710> the<00:03:19.010> right<00:03:19.280> side<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.000> Apple<00:03:20.680> has<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.739> lot

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
me the right side of the Apple has a lot

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.270 
me the right side of the Apple has a lot
of<00:03:22.130> shadow<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.989> I'm<00:03:24.110> going<00:03:24.320> to<00:03:24.410> move<00:03:24.680> through

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
of shadow so I'm going to move through

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.750 
of shadow so I'm going to move through
my<00:03:25.459> Apple<00:03:26.590> using<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.680> side<00:03:27.920> of<00:03:28.070> my<00:03:28.220> charcoal

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
my Apple using the side of my charcoal

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.740 
my Apple using the side of my charcoal
and<00:03:29.230> blocking<00:03:30.230> in<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:31.180> shading<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.390> see

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
and blocking in the shading that I see

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.170 
and blocking in the shading that I see
there<00:03:33.410> are<00:03:33.440> different<00:03:33.980> areas<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.700> could

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
there are different areas that could

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.840 
there are different areas that could
still<00:03:35.600> be<00:03:35.630> shaded<00:03:36.440> maybe<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.580> little

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
still be shaded maybe just a little

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.780 
still be shaded maybe just a little
lighter<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.590> then<00:03:39.590> areas<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:40.400> are<00:03:40.550> shaded

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
lighter and then areas that are shaded

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.930 
lighter and then areas that are shaded
darker<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.590> play<00:03:42.860> with<00:03:43.130> how<00:03:43.580> hard

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
darker so you can play with how hard

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.090 
darker so you can play with how hard
you're<00:03:44.209> pressing<00:03:44.540> with<00:03:44.930> your<00:03:45.080> charcoal<00:03:45.590> if

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
you're pressing with your charcoal if

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.190 
you're pressing with your charcoal if
you<00:03:46.340> want<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.820> be<00:03:46.940> darker<00:03:47.420> you'll<00:03:47.900> press

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
you want it to be darker you'll press

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.710 
you want it to be darker you'll press
harder<00:03:48.650> if<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.400> want<00:03:49.640> it<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.940> be<00:03:50.120> shaded<00:03:50.570> but

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
harder if you want it to be shaded but

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.080 
harder if you want it to be shaded but
just<00:03:50.930> lighter<00:03:51.230> you'll<00:03:51.680> press<00:03:51.980> softer<00:03:52.550> I'm<00:03:52.850> now

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
just lighter you'll press softer I'm now

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.270 
just lighter you'll press softer I'm now
gonna<00:03:53.270> use<00:03:53.390> my<00:03:53.810> fingers<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.500> I'm<00:03:54.680> really<00:03:54.980> just

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
gonna use my fingers and I'm really just

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.699 
gonna use my fingers and I'm really just
going<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.520> start<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:56.420> move<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:57.110> charcoal

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
going to start to move that charcoal

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.100 
going to start to move that charcoal
around<00:03:57.860> I<00:04:00.850> like<00:04:01.850> to<00:04:02.120> when<00:04:02.360> I'm<00:04:02.510> shading<00:04:02.810> move

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
around I like to when I'm shading move

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.990 
around I like to when I'm shading move
my<00:04:03.440> finger<00:04:03.830> in<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:04.100> circular<00:04:04.520> motion

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
my finger in a circular motion

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.270 
my finger in a circular motion
especially<00:04:05.840> with<00:04:06.380> something<00:04:06.620> like<00:04:06.830> that<00:04:06.980> an

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
especially with something like that an

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.410 
especially with something like that an
apple<00:04:07.730> which<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.720> round<00:04:09.140> my<00:04:09.920> circular<00:04:10.520> motion

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
apple which is round my circular motion

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.960 
apple which is round my circular motion
when<00:04:11.660> I'm<00:04:11.780> shading<00:04:12.320> will<00:04:13.010> lend<00:04:13.220> itself<00:04:13.370> well

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
when I'm shading will lend itself well

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.940 
when I'm shading will lend itself well
to<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.630> shape<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.170> I'm<00:04:15.380> just<00:04:15.620> going<00:04:15.830> to

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
to that shape and I'm just going to

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.800 
to that shape and I'm just going to
start<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.400> add<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.549> little<00:04:17.150> more<00:04:17.359> detail

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
start to add a little more detail

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
start to add a little more detail
there's<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.650> nice<00:04:18.830> shadow<00:04:19.930> cast<00:04:20.930> on<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.410> Apple

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
there's a nice shadow cast on the Apple

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.280 
there's a nice shadow cast on the Apple
I'm<00:04:22.250> going<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.580> put<00:04:22.760> just<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.090> little<00:04:23.120> edge<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:24.110> a

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
I'm going to put just a little edge of a

I'm going to put just a little edge of a
table<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.890> so<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.340> feels<00:04:25.580> like<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.000> Apple<00:04:26.360> is

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
table in so it feels like the Apple is

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.450 
table in so it feels like the Apple is
sitting<00:04:26.840> on<00:04:26.960> something<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.650> I'm<00:04:28.160> going<00:04:28.430> to

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460
