00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.200
 what are the criteria that you have 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.270
 prompted olic and climbed this case 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.890
 and if you want it happened in the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.849
 meaning where we know well saint-dié 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.019
 since it's still very 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.610
 for a long time we are implanted we know 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.889
 on saint dié with the ibis hotel opposite 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.990
 and we bought from the group 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.630
 Accor f1 hotel situated a little further 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.160
 outside and we had 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.400
 said sure saint die what could be 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.900
 rather nice is to say that we are here 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.369
 two types of products with hinds 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.340
 hotel and hotel f1 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.930
 why give me a hotel between 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.390
 two in terms of price in terms of 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.080
 range in terms of comfort that could 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.080
 maybe just 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.130
 how to say agree some other 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 typology of customers and so that's the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.110
 the mayor actually offered us to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.390
 take over this student residence and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.980
 well here's the whole plan of departures is 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.940
 gone on it so market research 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.230
 to say that's why 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.610
 to set up there in addition we are in full 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.410
 center of saint dié finally a few 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.170
 meters from downtown so 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.160
 the opportunity was interesting and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.720
 put an ibis budget 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.720
 it was the best solution for us 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:25.710
 williams takes with the door will walk 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.300
 in fact we are on the fine-tuning it's up to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.980
 to say a little stroke of paint right 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.130
 a touch of paint left a 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.110
 tip of tiling complaints to hand over 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.120
 a little sponge shot to give in the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.160
 corner and that's it for really that 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.600
 this is the point for especially the 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.580
 additional material festival of the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.860
 geography that will start in a 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.860
 fifteen days for the care 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.600
 Medical since it is indeed a 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.070
 big start we made important 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.870
 renovation work since in fact we 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.820
 part of a building that was a 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.530
 former student residence in 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.980
 which in fact we have we have everything 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.050
 converted 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.400
 these were apartments that are 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.780
 transformed into rooms simply 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.780
 so we will aim at one leg 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.030
 there are no more keys are all 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.190
 codes that servers schools everything to 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.920
 do so so here we are we 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.110
 let's get into a room so it's 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.370
 rooms that are very spacious 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.830
 why because it was precisely 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.270
 two old apartments 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.480
 so we really all transformed we have 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.760
 kept the crude and then my friend our 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.830
 concept so what is it a bed in 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.030
 150 two-way with a quilt 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:41.200
 good of course rents or agreements 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:43.220
 any hangers and a flat screen TV 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.830
 all our rooms are well equipped 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:52.070
 sure of minimalist wifi but effective in 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.340
 effect but in a bathroom all 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.310
 comfort with a beautiful vast than a beautiful 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.000
 mirror a beautiful black bay equipped 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.390
 a shower 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.550
 plus the little concept on the shower 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.890
 it is that there are led 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.560
 so that's pretty funny it's his 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.000
 effect actually created a little intimacy 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.760
 what's really nice is the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.940
 led one can find below the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.959
 strip under here no this is not of course 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.300
 a room that is rather nice 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.350
 nice what they practice too 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.489
 is that one and there is no 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.019
 carpet so it was a lot more 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.160
 simple so why not carpeting at 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.370
 ground yeah it's new choices 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.470
 concepts it's healthier more practical 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.590
 we also for for cleaning 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.019
 since since check the prefers so 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.680
 it is true that the rooms are equipped 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.410
 wifi 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.910
 the rooms are equipped with my movies 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.750
 throughout the hotel 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.470
 it's important a breakfast 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.150

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.400

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.050

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.280

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.269

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.090

 because it is a service that is known 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.900

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.340
 hotels formulas with the dac where the 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.020

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.750
 find also and we did this 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.750
 choice here here is
