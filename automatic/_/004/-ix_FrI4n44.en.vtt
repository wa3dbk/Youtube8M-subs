00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
speed somewhere in the middle so we'll

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.340

one<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.820> test<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:42.720> about

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
one is what this test is really about

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.219 
one is what this test is really about
which<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.860> frame<00:01:44.759> rates<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.810> let's<00:01:45.990> select

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
interlaced frames per second and I won't

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.059 
interlaced frames per second and I won't
go<00:02:09.479> into<00:02:09.509> too<00:02:09.780> much<00:02:09.810> technical<00:02:10.170> detail<00:02:10.500> now

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
go into too much technical detail now

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.140 
go into too much technical detail now
but<00:02:11.280> basically<00:02:12.239> that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
but basically that

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.479 
but basically that
shows<00:02:13.269> you<00:02:13.599> twice<00:02:14.079> as<00:02:14.260> many<00:02:14.409> frames<00:02:14.799> as<00:02:15.159> let's

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
shows you twice as many frames as let's

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.780 
shows you twice as many frames as let's
say<00:02:15.670> 30<00:02:16.030> PF<00:02:16.870> but<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.739> only<00:02:17.920> see<00:02:18.250> half<00:02:18.519> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
say 30 PF but you only see half the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.729 
say 30 PF but you only see half the
information<00:02:19.090> per<00:02:19.750> frame<00:02:20.280> 30<00:02:21.280> PF<00:02:21.819> shows

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
information per frame 30 PF shows

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.100 
information per frame 30 PF shows
complete<00:02:23.739> frames<00:02:24.250> per<00:02:24.879> second<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.599> here<00:02:25.989> you

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
complete frames per second so here you

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.699 
complete frames per second so here you
get<00:02:26.260> 30<00:02:26.620> complete<00:02:27.310> frames<00:02:27.700> per<00:02:28.180> second<00:02:28.659> and<00:02:28.840> P

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
get 30 complete frames per second and P

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.750 
get 30 complete frames per second and P
of<00:02:29.829> 24<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.670> 24<00:02:31.299> frames<00:02:31.629> per<00:02:31.810> second<00:02:32.409> PF<00:02:33.099> 24<00:02:33.609> is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
of 24 is 24 frames per second PF 24 is

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.420 
of 24 is 24 frames per second PF 24 is
used<00:02:34.030> for<00:02:34.359> from<00:02:34.840> filmmaking<00:02:35.739> but<00:02:36.129> we<00:02:36.250> don't

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
used for from filmmaking but we don't

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.949 
used for from filmmaking but we don't
need<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.609> worry<00:02:36.790> about<00:02:36.849> that<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:37.510> we'll<00:02:37.659> choose

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
need to worry about that so we'll choose

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.390 
need to worry about that so we'll choose
60<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.829> for<00:02:39.189> this<00:02:39.340> camera<00:02:41.099> that's<00:02:42.099> all<00:02:42.280> we

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
60 I for this camera that's all we

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.569 
60 I for this camera that's all we
really<00:02:42.430> need<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:42.939> do<00:02:43.090> for<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:43.450> camera<00:02:43.870> setup

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
really need to do for the camera setup

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.129 
really need to do for the camera setup
one<00:02:45.579> thing<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:45.940> might<00:02:46.120> be<00:02:46.180> interested<00:02:46.569> in<00:02:46.959> is

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
one thing you might be interested in is

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.199 
one thing you might be interested in is
in<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:47.920> display<00:02:48.400> setup<00:02:48.970> you've<00:02:49.750> got

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
in the display setup you've got

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.539 
in the display setup you've got
something<00:02:52.209> called<00:02:52.569> markers<00:02:53.500> now<00:02:54.220> if<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.400> go

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
something called markers now if you go

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.270 
something called markers now if you go
into<00:02:54.579> markers<00:02:55.359> what<00:02:56.109> I<00:02:56.139> choose<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.889> right<00:02:57.159> at

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
into markers what I choose is right at

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.809 
into markers what I choose is right at
the<00:02:57.400> bottom<00:02:57.879> the<00:02:58.329> grid<00:02:58.810> gray<00:02:59.500> it<00:03:00.129> divides<00:03:00.609> the

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
the bottom the grid gray it divides the

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.660 
the bottom the grid gray it divides the
screen<00:03:01.150> into<00:03:01.359> into<00:03:01.989> three<00:03:02.579> horizontal<00:03:03.579> and

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
screen into into three horizontal and

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.399 
screen into into three horizontal and
vertical<00:03:04.090> lines<00:03:04.329> and<00:03:04.659> that<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.959> helps<00:03:05.290> you

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
vertical lines and that just helps you

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.259 
vertical lines and that just helps you
position<00:03:05.620> things<00:03:06.129> nicer<00:03:06.489> when<00:03:06.849> you're<00:03:07.030> when

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
position things nicer when you're when

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.210 
position things nicer when you're when
you're<00:03:07.299> shooting<00:03:07.629> so<00:03:08.049> let's<00:03:08.230> select<00:03:08.799> that<00:03:08.950> one

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
you're shooting so let's select that one

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.970 
you're shooting so let's select that one
and<00:03:09.510> that's<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.750> really<00:03:11.079> for<00:03:11.439> setting<00:03:11.739> up<00:03:11.859> the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
and that's it really for setting up the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.979 
and that's it really for setting up the
camera<00:03:12.370> than<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.909> date<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.299> time<00:03:13.359> things

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
camera than the date and time things

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.030 
camera than the date and time things
like<00:03:14.079> this<00:03:14.290> which<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.500> should<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.859> course

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
like this which you should of course

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.509 
like this which you should of course
make<00:03:15.280> sure<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.670> correct<00:03:16.169> but<00:03:17.169> that's<00:03:17.379> it<00:03:17.590> so

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
make sure it's correct but that's it so

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.789 
make sure it's correct but that's it so
that's<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.389> finish<00:03:19.690> of<00:03:19.840> setting<00:03:20.620> up<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
that's the finish of setting up the

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.209 
that's the finish of setting up the
camera<00:03:21.099> let's<00:03:21.280> go<00:03:21.489> out<00:03:21.669> and<00:03:21.819> start<00:03:22.000> shooting
