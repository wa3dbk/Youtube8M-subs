00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
so I've got my blog page loaded up here

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.019 
so I've got my blog page loaded up here
where<00:00:24.119> I've<00:00:24.890> explained<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.160> written<00:00:26.640> detail

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
where I've explained in written detail

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.599 
where I've explained in written detail
exactly<00:00:27.269> how<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> do<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.109> I'm<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> skip

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
exactly how to do it I'm going to skip

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.900 
exactly how to do it I'm going to skip
down<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.150> step<00:00:30.750> number<00:00:31.070> three<00:00:32.070> where<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.759> gets

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
down to step number three where it gets

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
down to step number three where it gets
kind<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.860> heavy<00:00:36.469> what<00:00:37.469> you'll<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.920> in

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
kind of heavy what you'll have to do in

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.819 
kind of heavy what you'll have to do in
this<00:00:38.160> step<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.730> close<00:00:39.090> finder<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.620> this

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
this step is to close finder it this

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.160 
this step is to close finder it this
sounds<00:00:41.280> easier<00:00:41.700> than<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.540> don't<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.140> can't

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
sounds easier than it is I don't I can't

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170 
sounds easier than it is I don't I can't
just<00:00:43.649> right<00:00:43.950> click<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.550> press<00:00:44.789> clothes

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
just right click on it and press clothes

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.790 
just right click on it and press clothes
and<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.079> go<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.410> force<00:00:49.410> quit

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and if I go up to the to the force quit

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.139 
and if I go up to the to the force quit
button<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.430> asked<00:00:50.700> me<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> restart

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
button here it just asked me to restart

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.240 
button here it just asked me to restart
so<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.170> load<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> activity

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
so I have to load up the activity

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.279 
so I have to load up the activity
monitor<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.850> where<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> find<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.140> in

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
monitor and where I find that is in

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.250 
monitor and where I find that is in
applications<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.750> down<00:00:57.750> near<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:57.989> bottom

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
applications and down near the bottom

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.389 
applications and down near the bottom
and<00:00:58.530> utilities<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.809> then<00:01:00.949> activity<00:01:01.949> monitor

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and utilities and then activity monitor

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.780 
and utilities and then activity monitor
and<00:01:03.350> searching<00:01:04.350> along<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> list<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.489> see

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and searching along the list here I see

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.899 
and searching along the list here I see
finder<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:07.439> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.680> press<00:01:07.950> quit

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.980 
see that there's no little light
underneath<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.140> finder<00:01:22.770> icon<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.659> i<00:01:24.720> can

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
underneath the finder icon so i can

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.700 
underneath the finder icon so i can
close<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:28.110> reason<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.500> had<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
close that the reason that we had to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.010 
close that the reason that we had to
close<00:01:29.009> finder<00:01:29.670> was<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.540> open<00:01:30.930> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
close finder was so that we can open it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.679 
close finder was so that we can open it
back<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.650> root<00:01:31.939> root<00:01:32.939> remember<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.420> as

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
back up as root root remember is just as

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.050 
back up as root root remember is just as
a<00:01:33.720> massive<00:01:34.259> super<00:01:34.890> user<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.280> has<00:01:35.340> access<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
a massive super user that has access to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.749 
a massive super user that has access to
everything<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.979> finder<00:01:37.979> originally<00:01:38.460> was<00:01:38.610> just

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
everything so finder originally was just

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.240 
everything so finder originally was just
opened<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.329> user<00:01:39.689> account<00:01:40.140> rob<00:01:40.799> brown<00:01:41.040> on

root and the way that I do that is by
going<00:01:46.020> into<00:01:46.259> terminal<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.280> I'm<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.549> go

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
going into terminal so I'm going to go

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.190 
going into terminal so I'm going to go
