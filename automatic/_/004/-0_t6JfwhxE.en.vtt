Christian<00:06:41.330> dollars<00:06:41.630> development<00:06:42.230> my<00:06:42.350> guess

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
Christian dollars development my guess

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.680 
Christian dollars development my guess
is<00:06:42.830> it's<00:06:42.860> not<00:06:43.100> where<00:06:43.160> they<00:06:43.820> wanted<00:06:44.270> is<00:06:44.390> again

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
is it's not where they wanted is again

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.630 
is it's not where they wanted is again
and<00:06:44.960> I'm<00:06:45.590> not<00:06:45.710> surprised<00:06:46.070> by<00:06:46.250> that<00:06:46.370> when<00:06:46.550> he

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
and I'm not surprised by that when he

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.370 
and I'm not surprised by that when he
was<00:06:46.670> drafted<00:06:47.060> we<00:06:47.510> thought<00:06:47.750> that<00:06:47.960> to<00:06:48.170> their

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
was drafted we thought that to their

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.080

work<00:06:48.530> there<00:06:48.830> were<00:06:48.920> concerns<00:06:49.310> about<00:06:49.580> how<00:06:49.850> hard

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090

he<00:06:50.240> would<00:06:50.390> work<00:06:50.570> i'm<00:06:50.720> not<00:06:50.870> sure<00:06:51.110> that<00:06:51.320> he's<00:06:51.920> a

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
he would work i'm not sure that he's a

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.230 
he would work i'm not sure that he's a
guy<00:06:52.160> that's<00:06:52.190> come<00:06:52.520> in<00:06:52.610> and<00:06:52.730> worked<00:06:52.880> as<00:06:53.000> hard<00:06:53.030> as

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
guy that's come in and worked as hard as

they wanted dawkins once again could be

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.890 
they wanted dawkins once again could be
a<00:06:54.950> practice<00:06:55.370> squad<00:06:55.580> guy<00:06:55.760> he<00:06:56.300> could<00:06:56.540> he<00:06:56.870> could

a practice squad guy he could he could

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.360 
a practice squad guy he could he could
divide<00:06:57.230> you'd<00:06:57.440> make<00:06:57.620> the<00:06:57.650> roster<00:06:57.920> but<00:06:58.220> i<00:06:58.310> do

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
divide you'd make the roster but i do

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.980 
divide you'd make the roster but i do
think<00:06:58.520> this<00:06:58.970> i<00:06:59.180> do<00:06:59.240> think<00:06:59.480> the<00:06:59.540> Vikings<00:06:59.870> come

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990

out of this draft other than middle line
Becker<00:07:01.629> given<00:07:02.349> that<00:07:02.379> I<00:07:02.529> still<00:07:02.740> think<00:07:02.949> there's

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.099 
Becker given that I still think there's

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:04.830 
Becker given that I still think there's
a<00:07:03.189> plan<00:07:03.580> here<00:07:03.909> in<00:07:03.969> place<00:07:04.180> I<00:07:04.419> don't<00:07:04.629> think<00:07:04.779> this

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
a plan here in place I don't think this

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.439 
a plan here in place I don't think this
is<00:07:04.900> all<00:07:05.259> based<00:07:05.529> on<00:07:06.029> 2013<00:07:07.029> I<00:07:07.059> think<00:07:07.360> they

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:07.449 
is all based on 2013 I think they

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:09.149 
is all based on 2013 I think they
actually<00:07:07.479> ethics<00:07:08.199> Gilman<00:07:08.559> has<00:07:08.590> held<00:07:08.949> true<00:07:09.129> to

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:09.159 
actually ethics Gilman has held true to

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:10.950 
actually ethics Gilman has held true to
trying<00:07:09.460> to<00:07:09.520> build<00:07:09.729> this<00:07:09.849> roster<00:07:10.270> I<00:07:10.449> do<00:07:10.719> think

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
trying to build this roster I do think

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.119 
trying to build this roster I do think
the<00:07:11.020> Whiteman's<00:07:11.349> come<00:07:11.499> out<00:07:11.620> of<00:07:11.740> this<00:07:11.830> draft

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:12.129 
the Whiteman's come out of this draft

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:14.040 
the Whiteman's come out of this draft
having<00:07:12.370> done<00:07:12.490> a<00:07:12.520> pretty<00:07:12.699> good<00:07:12.819> job<00:07:13.050> it's

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
having done a pretty good job it's

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.570 
having done a pretty good job it's
impossible<00:07:14.650> to<00:07:14.680> put<00:07:14.889> a<00:07:14.919> grade<00:07:15.159> do<00:07:15.339> it<00:07:15.430> right

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
impossible to put a grade do it right

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.670 
impossible to put a grade do it right
now<00:07:15.729> which<00:07:15.849> is<00:07:15.879> just<00:07:16.389> stupid<00:07:16.809> but<00:07:17.349> I<00:07:17.379> do<00:07:17.469> think

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
now which is just stupid but I do think

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.659 
now which is just stupid but I do think
when<00:07:17.830> you<00:07:17.919> look<00:07:17.949> at<00:07:18.159> what<00:07:18.249> they've<00:07:18.400> addressed

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 
when you look at what they've addressed

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.790 
when you look at what they've addressed
three<00:07:18.999> first-round<00:07:19.449> picks<00:07:19.539> I<00:07:19.990> do<00:07:20.289> think<00:07:20.710> that

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
three first-round picks I do think that

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.439 
three first-round picks I do think that
you<00:07:21.699> were<00:07:21.789> concerned<00:07:22.059> about<00:07:22.270> where<00:07:22.389> the

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449 
you were concerned about where the

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.029 
you were concerned about where the
roster<00:07:22.809> was<00:07:22.930> going<00:07:23.349> I<00:07:23.499> think<00:07:23.830> they<00:07:23.889> help

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 
roster was going I think they help

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:25.679 
roster was going I think they help
themselves<00:07:24.189> middle<00:07:24.759> linebacker<00:07:24.879> still<00:07:25.539> be
