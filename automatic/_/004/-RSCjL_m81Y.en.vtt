00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.569
 9 recently, nespresso has a new one 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.690
 Coffee capsule machine on the market 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.139
 nespresso brought it here so the 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.009
 right now to see 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.139
 I want this in this video 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.109
 compare with the espresso pixi which 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.609
 is already since 2011 I want to give 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.880
 briefly explain the differences 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:25.510
 and the similarities the nespresso 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.130
 pixi is also available from de'longhi 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.080
 also from krups that now now the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.119
 krupps machine just like the 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.790
 initiative is also from de'longhi and 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.040
 from cancer I give the two 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.140
 But machines can compare better 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.219
 and I would like to have those here as well 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.340
 machine of krups as I said left 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.800
 the pixi right every year we come 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.010
 First, to the functions in general 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.449
 Both machines can use espresso 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.270
 prepare each have up here 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.449
 key for that is here it is 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.699
 so 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.920
 Here are the buttons a little further out 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.270
 But that also has the reason then the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.460
 also switch on and off 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.070
 that means that cia has no one 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.650
 and switch off more at the pixi's 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.060
 Here behind such a taste with what 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.420
 you turn the machine on and off 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.189
 can 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.290
 where it is he just pushes you here 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.130
 one key is the machine 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.869
 so to speak and heats up what both 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.880
 machines have in common is that 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.409
 you already during the heating time 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.360
 just press the button 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.250
 and then when the machine heats up 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.960
 is the espresso coming out of the machine 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.509
 I am not sure if that 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.310
 similarity is wanted 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.360
 even the machines see each other 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.150
 All in all very similar here too 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.770
 back from the water tank imagine once 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.140
 The initiative is now working together like this 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.790
 smaller of the height at least the 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.350
 but water tank holds just like the 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.930
 pixi 0,7 liter 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.850
 so it is no different to 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.420
 There is material in the material 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.070
 already some differences in the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.820
 initiators of the closure lever off 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.549
 metal every imprint peter is already out 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.909
 plastic something else with the pixi 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.520
 was 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.660
 there is the closure up here 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.800
 lever also made of metal 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.930
 but also everyone from topfit 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.150
 and here are the side walls too 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.970
 made of metal thus affects the pixi 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:27.110
 Of course something high quality and pleases 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:28.820
 me something of the design something better 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.980
 also with the pixi was very nice 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.180
 if you turn it on I have it now 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.250
 not infected and could i do that 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.320
 show behind are so light and the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.400
 shine through the transparent capsule 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.680
 container through when the water tank 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.570
 empty lights the led or the lamps 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.760
 red in it and you can see the water 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.000
 must be refilled that has him 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.680
 is not that means there are no here 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.200
 helps land built 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.210
 in the reason it sees of them also 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.230
 almost identical I do not even know 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.230
 that can see so well now 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.450
 Basically, this is almost almost the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.730
 identical machine here also with the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.440
 Rounding here is the pixi here, too 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.750
 it still a bit riffled the shutter 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.180
 Lever, by and large, are the ones 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.190
 but both machines are very similar 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.950
 what you are already shows that 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.489
 easy if you print each one 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.820
 he compares here that the one 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.920
 year is now completely in black and 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.800
 here the pixi with the transparent 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.720
 But collecting container for the capsules 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.830
 here you can see they really are 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.850
 you could nearly almost identical end 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.920
 say here 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.480
 I'll exchange them and they 'll be there 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.720
 are a bit different from one another 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.790
 Of course it does not work but it falls 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.720
 but this machine will soon be 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.910
 The heating up time is very similar 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.190
 for both machines 25 each 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.650
 seconds on the water tank is the same 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.370
 as I had already said 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.070
 otherwise there are not that many 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.900
 Differences of the two machines 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.340
 which somehow does not surprise me 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.780
 Maybe you just wanted to go again 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.360
 launch a new model on the market 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.519
 or even a replacement for the nespresso 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.810
 pixi in different colors 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.359
 because these are now available, for example 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.669
 also available in blue what is this model 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.450
 that is now sky blue almost goes into 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.760
 greyish 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.450
 and the pixi already exists 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.820
 many years on the market and there it will be 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.230
 time again for something new 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.060
 but the similarity of the two 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.740
 machines that you can do here very well 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.180
 they really see it really clearly and 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.610
 clearly recognizable I'm going again 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.650
 ran a little closer then you see 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.540
 that maybe even better you can see 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.760
 really here the two machines 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.770
 you could almost think that one is 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.680
 pixi in blue and the other is the pixi 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.920
 in black in the reason this is the but 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.860
 industry and this the pixi but the 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.360
 Machines differ so little 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:08.420
 Score that's just incredible 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:11.030
 also here with the fold up from the yard 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.950
 Grid is also just from the pixi 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.330
 copied 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.670
 So a real innovation is theirs 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.840
 is not someone who does not have a coffee capsule 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.690
 machine has for the market 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.360
 maybe be okay but a higher one 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.320
 extra price compared to the pixi I would 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.390
 do not pay for it 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.050
 So the differences are easy 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.880
 too low and with the nespresso pixies 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.700
 even more medium installed and thus 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.860
 It simply affects him higher quality and something 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.010
 noble , which is a bit cheaper 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.150
 Yes, I hope I could help you 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.010
 help a little bit with this comparison 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.570
 you will like this video 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.910
 then it evaluates it or already 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.910
