00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello my dear friends and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.120
 computer game lovers with you i am 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.680
 cavalli at 46 and today I present to you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.580
 great take the car 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.840
 American-made t-34 before 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.059
 how to start your reviews at least 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.310
 thank akela for providing 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.730
 replay akela thank you very much 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.810
 in truth, I have long wanted 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.480
 purchase t-34 me this is your very 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.500
 nice operation mirin like her 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.460
 there are very good qualities and definitely 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.190
 first of all it is her tower killed 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.160
 links to the latest updates on 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.079
 maps here this global where 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.110
 appeared more on the kitchen of these 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.180
 the ruins are often towers can be quite 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.300
 quite well so personal and interpreted 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.480
 very serious opponents 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.020
 well then let's begin our review 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.090
 our unit has a nickname in the game iron and 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.840
 bulldozer well I think it's obvious why 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.940
 sleepless well his forum and if 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.120
 rather his tower 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.390
 its tower is simply huge and 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.790
 maybe some angles bulldozers 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.560
 near impossible life itself 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.170
 really worth something like 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.830
 our machine is very, very 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.640
 impressive amount of 12 thousand gold 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.540
 coins that equates to one thousand 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.560
 400 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.420
 43 rubles for what, to my great regret 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.869
 everyone can afford 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.040
 so expensive and now 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.869
 let's talk about mx 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.350
 our strength is one and a half 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.930
 thousands of canvas is a good indicator 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.649
 for 8 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:02.180
 we can say the average mass is 65 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.649
 tons and a maximum mass of 701 then she 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.009
 agrees with the difficult friend and in 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.060
 with 810 horsepower engine 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.000
 strength and like our power density 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.730
 cars is 12 point forty four 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.730
 hundredths of horsepower and which 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.690
 and from my look whine and show 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.409
 maximum forward speed she 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.010
 is 35 frames an hour ago 12 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.260
 it is also not surprisingly gaining here 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.350
 this speed with my reluctantly and 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.240
 saturday reason what's on us 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.890
 huge armor i 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.430
 on the tower the plowing is not just insane 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.709
 heavy 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.489
 so the dynamics of regret there 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.489
 absolutely no forever turning speed 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.909
 hull around its axis unfortunately 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.790
 also 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:59.390
 we are very saddened she is only 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.329
 only 22 degrees per second now let's 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.310
 talk about armor dropped here has 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.069
 so to speak two sides 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.269
 good and evil good is unconditional 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.639
 solid and evil is the body we will start with 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.709
 bad in the case in front projection 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.169
 we are only 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.750
 102 mm to put under the slope 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:23.209
 very good but unfortunately this 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.299
 too little and punch us corps here 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:32.269
 absolutely everything from 6 is interesting 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:34.430
 a low level in the boards we have only 76 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.090
 millimeters and in feed 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.000
 51 Well, actually, what can you say armor 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.389
 in our case is very mediocre and 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.980
 for the most part okay, well, not everything is so 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.010
 sad eyebrow as it may seem 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:53.209
 at first glance our pride is ours 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.389
 the advantage is our huge and heavy 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.349
 the tower we have with you a huge mask 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:03.319
 tools which takes up almost all 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:06.590
 the area in the tower in front and the thickness of this 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.720
 masks is 279 millimeters this 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.569
 insanely many and we in the mask guns 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.820
 can only punch with gold and 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.389
 either on t 10 level 1 we will spend there 300 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.139
 millimeters 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:24.050
 as a result, if our tower is not under 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.460
 some kind of slope from the boards we have a hundred 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.210
 twenty seven millimeters which is also not 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.710
 may not please 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.290
 right angles us basically 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.060
 many even almost 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.440
 all but under some slopes under 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.520
 regarding us very often not 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:46.030
 punch even from guns 8 9 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.760
 Stern our tower times too very 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.300
 impressive figure is 203 millimeters 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.990
 it's just insane a lot and how can you 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.250
 see and 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.430
 my union of 6 which has already merged clean 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.160
 accidentally shot me in the tower and with 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.400
 their ruler 175 have not struck my 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.350
 203 millimeters saved me from armor we 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.780
 sorted out now let's go to 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.790
 weapons weapons we have very interesting 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.410
 it's stopping millimeter gun 53a one 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.130
 armor penetration is 248 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.880
 millimeters 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:25.240
 normal grandmother and inflict an average of 400 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.500
 halls points conjure we punch 297 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.060
 millimeters and also cause 400 damage 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.980
 the usual high-explosive projectile we punch and 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:38.020
 only 60 millimeters but at 8 515 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.640
 that's all very nice of course 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.900
 but the rate of fire unfortunately 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:47.260
 poured she is only 4 shots 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.270
 close all the review we have 360 â€‹â€‹meters to 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.250
 Sorry not so big 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.670
 figure as we would like and distance 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.790
 connections 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:59.620
 there is already a good 745 meters so what 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.470
 is it best to put modular with you 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.050
 here are two options the first option is 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.510
 sniper for those who like to stand behind 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.730
 backs your allies and shoot at 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:15.870
 someone else's light then you need to take 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:18.880
 stabilizer mixing and of course 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.540
 telescope the second option is 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.220
 option 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:26.700
 attack aircraft you need to take 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:29.710
 stabilizer rammer 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.530
 ventilation and so let's have a quick 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.880
 summarize hold us dignity 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.080
 certainly excellent vertical angles 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.070
 crosstalk that is as much as -10 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.700
 degrees 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:45.040
 powerful weapon and superior tower armor 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.560
 but to obvious shortcomings of course you can 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.460
 include items like a big rumor 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.000
 very bet 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.980
 slow down to 3.4 hundredths of a second and 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.980
 glory booking corps 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.500
 that's basically all i wanted to tell 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.270
 Now the outcome of the battle with you was Oleg in 46 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.510
 put likes subscribe and all bye 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.510
 until
