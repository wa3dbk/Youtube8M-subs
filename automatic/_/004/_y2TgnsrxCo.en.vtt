00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.299
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.009
 tell them about a very disney theory 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.380
 interesting let's start there are theories 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.500
 with good grounds that anahÃ­ elsa de 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.630
 frozen are rapunzel's cousins was in the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.779
 way to rapunzel's wedding where the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.940
 parents of them shipwrecked that ship is 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.400
 which is seen at the beginning of the Little Mermaid 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.170
 but they did not die but they arrived 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.510
 to an island and they gave birth to a son 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.989
 called Tarzan and they were killed by 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.079
 a leopard disney loves to put 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.170
 those surprises well established in their 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.940
 animated movies but sometimes they are the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.879
 fans those who come with their own 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.160
 theories and this one in particular will make 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.949
 never see frozen or tangled again 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.789
 in the same way because you may be 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.750
 movies are in the same universe 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.750
 let's start 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.550
 the little mermaid tangled and frozen are 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.560
 connected three years ago literally 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.530
 the parents of ana and elsa left to a 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.240
 wedding the wedding of eugenio and rapunzel and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.520
 they died in the sea 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.430
 It is worth noting that frozen came out three years 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.440
 after that entangled the shipwreck was 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.210
 the same as ariel in the little mermaid 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.160
 explored until they match geographically 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.920
 the story of the little mermaid take place in 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.080
 the coasts of denmark the kingdom of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.240
 harem from where the 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.369
 story of frozen is based on the city 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.050
 of sandhill located southwest of the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.790
 Norwegian capital 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.399
 so if corona is in germany and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.200
 harem day in norway the ship is supposed 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.900
 that was wrecked near the shores of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.420
 Denmark 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.870
 the parents of ana and elsa are also the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.930
 parents of tarzan this theory yes that you 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.150
 moves the land to many producers 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.340
 of frozen caused controversy when 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.130
 a review fan asked them if the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.880
 theory of the frozen mermaid and tangled 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.740
 his answer was true that the king and the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.200
 harem queen fully died in the 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.180
 shipwreck but they escaped to an island 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.120
 they had a son and then they were 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.430
 killed by a leopard that could 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.900
 mean that the parents of ana and elsa 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.100
 they had another son 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.050
 tarzan who was later raised by gorillas 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.300
 the king of harem of lees in the uncle of 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.910
 rapunzel and magic only affects 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.270
 the blond of the family 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.190
 rapunzel baby and elsa were both blondes 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.470
 if elsa's father were the brother of 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.570
 rapunzel's mother that would explain the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.910
 why he would want to hide the powers 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.160
 from elx to her niece rapunzel was 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.770
 kidnapped by her powers after 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.260
 everything so if these two are girls 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.570
 magicals are blondes it makes sense to say 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.960
 that magic only possesses them 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.900
 Ruby 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.900
 of the family ana had no power 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.470
