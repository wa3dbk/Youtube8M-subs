00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:04.649 
it is a sandblasted and as you can see

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.740 
it is a sandblasted and as you can see
it<00:00:05.649> doesn't<00:00:05.859> take<00:00:06.160> much<00:00:06.370> to<00:00:06.430> have<00:00:07.390> the<00:00:07.540> rest

results<00:00:45.380> the<00:00:45.470> sandblasting<00:00:46.309> we're<00:00:46.760> getting

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
results the sandblasting we're getting

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.720 
results the sandblasting we're getting
ready<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.510> paint<00:00:47.899> removed<00:00:48.739> all<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.130> parts

is making the inspection on so he is put
his<00:00:57.559> blessing<00:00:57.890> on<00:00:58.010> this<00:00:58.329> same<00:00:59.329> time<00:00:59.570> this<00:00:59.750> is<00:00:59.809> a

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
his blessing on this same time this is a

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.020 
his blessing on this same time this is a
difference<00:01:00.379> between<00:01:00.470> a<00:01:01.070> wheel<00:01:01.580> that<00:01:01.610> is<00:01:01.820> be

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
difference between a wheel that is be

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.469 
difference between a wheel that is be
sandblasted<00:01:06.880> then<00:01:07.880> we'll<00:01:08.090> be<00:01:08.210> ready<00:01:08.330> for

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
sandblasted then we'll be ready for

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.880 
sandblasted then we'll be ready for
paint

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620 

and<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.610> will<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.060> hasn't<00:01:12.540> been

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and you will that hasn't been

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.040 
and you will that hasn't been
sandblasted<00:01:14.300> this<00:01:15.300> one<00:01:15.479> has<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> lot<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> work

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
sandblasted this one has a lot of work

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.350 
sandblasted this one has a lot of work
yeah<00:01:16.620> I<00:01:16.710> should<00:01:17.010> take<00:01:17.190> about<00:01:17.310> 20<00:01:17.760> minutes<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
yeah I should take about 20 minutes to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.130 
yeah I should take about 20 minutes to
get<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.470> clean<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.770> ready<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.400> paint

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
get it all clean and ready for paint

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.300 
get it all clean and ready for paint
beauteous<00:01:22.140> san<00:01:22.440> blas<00:01:23.930> after<00:01:25.159> sandblasting<00:01:26.159> at

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
beauteous san blas after sandblasting at

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.100 
beauteous san blas after sandblasting at
night<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.760> can<00:01:26.940> see<00:01:27.150> there's<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> little<00:01:27.540> bit

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
night you can see there's a little bit

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
night you can see there's a little bit
of<00:01:28.170> surface<00:01:28.680> rust<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:29.940> to<00:01:30.000> do

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
of surface rust so what I'm going to do

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.440 
of surface rust so what I'm going to do
is<00:01:30.390> I'm<00:01:30.660> got<00:01:31.170> some<00:01:31.380> phosphoric<00:01:32.040> acid<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.240> I'm

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
is I'm got some phosphoric acid and I'm

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
is I'm got some phosphoric acid and I'm
going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:33.780> ahead<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.050> wipe<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.830> down<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
going to go ahead and wipe that down and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.100 
going to go ahead and wipe that down and
after<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.270> I'm<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.690> go<00:01:36.810> ahead<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
after that I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.070 
after that I'm going to go ahead and
clean<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.220> phosphoric<00:01:39.150> acid<00:01:39.509> off<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.930> some

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
clean the phosphoric acid off with some

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.170 
clean the phosphoric acid off with some
acetone<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.890> at<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.250> point<00:01:41.490> we'll<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.940> ready

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
acetone and at that point we'll be ready

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.029 
acetone and at that point we'll be ready
to<00:01:42.509> go<00:01:43.110> ahead<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.530> use<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.830> rust

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
to go ahead and use the rust

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.760 
to go ahead and use the rust
encapsulator<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:46.560> rust

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
encapsulator so this is the rust

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.620 
encapsulator so this is the rust
encapsulator

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.980 

and<00:01:50.170> what<00:01:50.590> we've<00:01:50.740> done<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.159> we've<00:01:51.719> painted<00:01:52.719> it

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
and what we've done is we've painted it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.109 
and what we've done is we've painted it
red<00:01:53.020> cross<00:01:53.439> bike<00:01:54.310> we're<00:01:54.700> going<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.939> wait<00:01:55.090> for

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
red cross bike we're going to wait for

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.260 
red cross bike we're going to wait for
it<00:01:55.329> to<00:01:55.450> dry<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:56.649> flip<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.039> bike<00:01:57.219> frame<00:01:57.850> over

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
it to dry then flip the bike frame over

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.060 
it to dry then flip the bike frame over
on<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.570> side<00:01:58.810> see<00:01:59.350> if<00:01:59.439> there's<00:01:59.619> any<00:01:59.829> course

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
on the side see if there's any course

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.090 
on the side see if there's any course
we've<00:02:00.340> missed<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:01.200> after<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.229> we're<00:02:02.740> going

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
we've missed and after that we're going

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.950 
we've missed and after that we're going
to<00:02:03.159> go<00:02:03.340> ahead<00:02:03.429> and<00:02:03.670> give<00:02:04.329> it<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.509> couple<00:02:04.719> hours

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
to go ahead and give it a couple hours

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.009 
to go ahead and give it a couple hours
to<00:02:05.259> dry<00:02:05.909> what's<00:02:06.909> this<00:02:07.119> dry<00:02:07.420> we're<00:02:07.780> going<00:02:07.960> to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
to dry what's this dry we're going to

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.479 
to dry what's this dry we're going to
hit<00:02:08.200> with<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:09.630> hit<00:02:10.630> with<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.110> extreme<00:02:12.099> Cassie

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
hit with the hit with the extreme Cassie

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.740 
hit with the hit with the extreme Cassie
black<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.269> polish<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:13.930> up<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:15.450> then<00:02:16.450> we<00:02:16.599> can

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
black to polish it up and then we can
