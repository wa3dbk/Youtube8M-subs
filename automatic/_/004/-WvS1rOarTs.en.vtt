00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
I just pushed it in there so there's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.160 
I just pushed it in there so there's
that<00:01:06.240> new<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:07.580> installed<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.900> next

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that new one is installed and the next

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
that new one is installed and the next
one<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.470> see<00:01:10.770> where<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.400> reason<00:01:11.640> why<00:01:11.760> I

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
one you can see where the reason why I

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.840 
one you can see where the reason why I
was<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.150> starting<00:01:12.720> because<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.670> where

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
was not starting because this is where

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.510 
was not starting because this is where
the<00:01:15.000> new<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.909> new<00:01:18.590> clutch<00:01:19.590> switch<00:01:19.950> will<00:01:20.220> screw

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the new the new clutch switch will screw

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.770 
the new the new clutch switch will screw
into<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:23.009> screws<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.520> there

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
into right here it screws in there

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
into right here it screws in there
obviously<00:01:24.780> when<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.110> push<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.430> clutch<00:01:26.670> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
obviously when you push the clutch in

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.960 
obviously when you push the clutch in
this<00:01:27.810> gets<00:01:28.170> pushed<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.130> car<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.549> start

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
this gets pushed in so the car can start

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.749 
this gets pushed in so the car can start
and<00:01:30.810> when<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> clutch<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.799> released<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and when the clutch is released that

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.859 
and when the clutch is released that
pops<00:01:33.119> back<00:01:33.390> out

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
pops back out

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.350 
pops back out
so<00:01:34.590> obviously<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.430> need<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.790> something<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
so obviously this need is something to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.950 
so obviously this need is something to
push<00:01:36.810> against<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:38.250> push<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.780> which<00:01:39.780> was

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
push against it to push it in which was

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960 
push against it to push it in which was
gonna<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.770> these<00:01:40.950> bad<00:01:41.159> boys<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970

where the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.680 
where the
the<00:02:13.550> clutch<00:02:13.760> switch<00:02:13.910> goes<00:02:14.240> right<00:02:14.450> in<00:02:14.570> there

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
the clutch switch goes right in there

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.320 
the clutch switch goes right in there
when<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.200> press<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.590> pedal<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:16.850> pushes<00:02:17.240> it

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
when you press the pedal it pushes it

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.670
