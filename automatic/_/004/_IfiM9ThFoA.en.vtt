half circle you want to make sure that

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.440 
half circle you want to make sure that
you're<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.630> don't<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.370> if<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.300> do

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
you're you don't like that if you do

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.820 
you're you don't like that if you do
that<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.750> publish<00:01:56.050> it<00:01:56.170> into<00:01:56.260> a<00:01:56.350> fine<00:01:56.590> you're

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
that to publish it into a fine you're

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.770 
that to publish it into a fine you're
never<00:01:57.040> going<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.220> catch<00:01:57.400> it<00:02:02.850> okay<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:04.120> did

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
never going to catch it okay I did

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:30.930 
never going to catch it okay I did
motion<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.070> that's<00:02:06.280> why<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:14.140> don't<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:29.940> like

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
motion so that's why you don't just like

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.740 
motion so that's why you don't just like
