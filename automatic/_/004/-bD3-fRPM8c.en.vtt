with<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.990> hat<00:00:19.199> very<00:00:19.650> very<00:00:20.490> often<00:00:20.789> people

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
with the hat very very often people

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.529 
with the hat very very often people
assume<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.830> tricorn<00:00:23.400> hat<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
assume that this the tricorn hat is a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.380 
assume that this the tricorn hat is a
pirate<00:00:25.140> hat<00:00:25.340> this<00:00:26.340> actually<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.029> baseball

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
pirate hat this actually is the baseball

pirate hat this actually is the baseball
cap<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.500> colonial<00:00:28.830> period<00:00:29.510> it<00:00:30.510> started

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
cap in the colonial period it started

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.040 
cap in the colonial period it started
out<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> military<00:00:31.980> hat<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.600> reason<00:00:33.930> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
out as a military hat and the reason it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.979 
out as a military hat and the reason it
has<00:00:34.079> three<00:00:34.649> sides<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:36.329> when<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> soldier

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
has three sides is that when a soldier

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.389 
has three sides is that when a soldier
went<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.620> fire<00:00:37.860> his<00:00:38.129> gun<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:40.110> lock<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:41.040> so

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
went to fire his gun the lock is here so

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.479 
went to fire his gun the lock is here so
if<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> Hat<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.570> around<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.050> hat<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
if the Hat was around a hat so if the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.119 
if the Hat was around a hat so if the
had<00:00:44.700> came<00:00:45.000> over<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> lock<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:46.649> would<00:00:46.829> happen

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
had came over the lock what would happen

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.889 
had came over the lock what would happen
when<00:00:47.250> he<00:00:47.309> pulled<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.730> trigger<00:00:47.760> he'd<00:00:48.600> burned

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
when he pulled the trigger he'd burned

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.690 
when he pulled the trigger he'd burned
this<00:00:49.110> side<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> Hat<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.160> began<00:00:50.489> by
