more flavorsome we are the orange you
want<00:00:57.579> but<00:00:57.909> you're<00:00:58.030> going<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.239> move<00:00:58.360> part<00:00:59.260> still

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
want but you're going to move part still

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.529 
want but you're going to move part still
flavoursome<00:01:00.489> but<00:01:00.699> not<00:01:00.820> as<00:01:01.000> bothersome<00:01:01.479> and

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
flavoursome but not as bothersome and

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:02.759 
flavoursome but not as bothersome and
then<00:01:01.719> obviously<00:01:01.839> we've<00:01:02.229> got<00:01:02.409> these<00:01:02.559> ones

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
then obviously we've got these ones

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.160 
then obviously we've got these ones
which<00:01:02.920> are<00:01:02.979> just<00:01:03.159> not<00:01:03.280> done<00:01:03.519> yet<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.780> there<00:01:05.049> is

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
which are just not done yet and there is

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.719 
which are just not done yet and there is
a<00:01:05.199> stage<00:01:05.500> where<00:01:05.770> they<00:01:05.860> go<00:01:06.009> from<00:01:06.190> this<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:06.490> a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
a stage where they go from this to a

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.310 
a stage where they go from this to a
darker<00:01:07.180> green<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.659> they<00:01:07.750> can<00:01:07.869> actually<00:01:08.110> come

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
darker green and they can actually come

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.740 
darker green and they can actually come
off<00:01:08.440> then<00:01:08.649> as<00:01:08.799> well<00:01:08.979> but<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:10.420> actually

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
off then as well but there's actually

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.290 
off then as well but there's actually
less<00:01:10.929> he<00:01:11.200> call<00:01:11.619> this<00:01:11.770> like<00:01:12.250> Tom<00:01:12.690> Philly<00:01:15.300> which

carry<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:18.710> ripening<00:02:19.190> when<00:02:19.700> they're<00:02:19.910> off<00:02:20.030> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
carry on ripening when they're off the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.640 
carry on ripening when they're off the
plant<00:02:20.480> but<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.780> knew<00:02:20.960> don't<00:02:21.170> put<00:02:21.320> them<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
plant but I knew don't put them in the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.770 
plant but I knew don't put them in the
fridge<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.100> just<00:02:22.310> leave<00:02:22.460> them<00:02:22.670> into<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.240> sunny

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
fridge you just leave them into a sunny

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.240 
fridge you just leave them into a sunny
window<00:02:24.080> cell<00:02:24.530> while<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.800> put<00:02:24.980> them<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:25.160> a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
window cell while you put them in a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.420 
window cell while you put them in a
brown<00:02:25.460> paper<00:02:25.490> bag<00:02:25.820> with<00:02:26.210> a<00:02:26.240> banana<00:02:26.540> skin<00:02:27.430> they

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
brown paper bag with a banana skin they

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.320 
brown paper bag with a banana skin they
will<00:02:28.610> continue<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.030> ripen<00:02:34.060> some<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.150> them<00:02:35.209> are

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
will continue to ripen some of them are

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.460 
will continue to ripen some of them are
a<00:02:35.390> bit<00:02:35.690> awkward<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.830> get<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.220> do<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:38.140> might<00:02:39.140> not

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
a bit awkward to get to do so might not

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.140 
a bit awkward to get to do so might not
be<00:02:39.620> able<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.770> get<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:39.980> right<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.700> stand

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
be able to get it right to the stand

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:50.710 
be able to get it right to the stand
down<00:02:41.959> there<00:02:43.959> just<00:02:44.959> like<00:02:45.160> take<00:02:46.160> off<00:02:46.510> towards

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.330 

straight

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.679 

obviously<00:02:54.340> with<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.489> plot<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:54.939> we<00:02:55.450> can't

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
obviously with a plot like this we can't

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.089 
obviously with a plot like this we can't
take<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.040> well<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.519> moment<00:02:57.939> pretty<00:02:58.239> good<00:02:58.450> but

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
take it well the moment pretty good but

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.709 
take it well the moment pretty good but
sometimes<00:03:00.099> it<00:03:00.250> grows<00:03:00.519> into<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:01.060> green<00:03:01.390> pipes

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 
sometimes it grows into the green pipes

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.420 
sometimes it grows into the green pipes
I'm<00:03:02.140> gonna<00:03:02.319> be<00:03:02.379> able<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.620> get<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.799> out<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.310> cut

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
I'm gonna be able to get it out to cut

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.280 
I'm gonna be able to get it out to cut
them<00:03:03.609> off<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.239> sort<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.510> out<00:03:04.659> there<00:03:04.689> you

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
them off so you sort of out there you

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.170 
them off so you sort of out there you
could<00:03:05.500> move<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.920> but<00:03:06.099> it's<00:03:06.189> very<00:03:06.459> heavy<00:03:06.700> lean

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
could move it but it's very heavy lean

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:17.250

came from last year's plants which we
reuse<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.550> year<00:04:24.820> so<00:04:25.060> technically<00:04:25.419> they

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
reuse this year so technically they

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.680 
reuse this year so technically they
should<00:04:25.720> move<00:04:25.840> in<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.110> same<00:04:26.289> that<00:04:26.590> they're<00:04:26.710> not

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.810 
it hasn't been put in the window in them
and<00:05:10.600> then<00:05:11.600> using<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.710> oven<00:05:12.830> shabby<00:05:13.460> another

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
and then using the oven shabby another

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.530 
and then using the oven shabby another
video<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.990> we<00:05:15.050> make<00:05:15.200> me<00:05:15.350> powdered<00:05:16.060> i'm<00:05:17.060> using

video and we make me powdered i'm using

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.820 
video and we make me powdered i'm using
a<00:05:17.660> thingy<00:05:18.590> passive<00:05:19.580> mode<00:05:19.730> yes<00:05:20.650> so<00:05:21.650> that's

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
a thingy passive mode yes so that's

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
a thingy passive mode yes so that's
basically<00:05:22.040> it<00:05:22.400> for<00:05:22.610> now<00:05:24.640> hopefully<00:05:25.640> this

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
basically it for now hopefully this

basically it for now hopefully this
plant<00:05:26.090> will<00:05:26.240> now<00:05:26.360> shoot<00:05:26.630> for<00:05:26.840> even<00:05:27.080> more

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
plant will now shoot for even more

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.550 
plant will now shoot for even more
flowers<00:05:27.650> and<00:05:28.220> on<00:05:28.340> about<00:05:28.490> this<00:05:28.850> size<00:05:29.260> you<00:05:30.260> it's

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560
