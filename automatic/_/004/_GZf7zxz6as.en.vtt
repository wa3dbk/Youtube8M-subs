00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.890
 hello to all of you many 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.460
 you asked about this widget 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.420
 where to get it or how to install it 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.060
 well I have designed this widget 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.460
 with the help of this application it is called 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.450
 super and you can find it in google 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.190
 play for approximately one euro 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.260
 as in this application as I have 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.450
 commented what we can do is create 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.360
 our hour widget with 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.120
 weather information alarms good very 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.550
 with many options the truth according to 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.079
 our taste then once what 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.909
 we have installed 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.159
 let's find a menu like 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.070
 this then gives us the option of 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.890
 start a widget from scratch ie 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.600
 So we will have a template in the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.260
 that we can we can add 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.239
 information or choose one of the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.789
 templates that are included and 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.490
 will begin to modify it or adding 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.509
 new new information according to our 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.979
 taste 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.320
 then to make you a little 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.000
 show I'm going to work on one of 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.460
 the templates that are included in 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.270
 the application we can see that good here 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.039
 come different ready-made widgets that 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.649
 we will be able to edit then by 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.429
 example I'm going to select this the simple 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.289
 and we see that it gives us different 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.240
 options here for example color of the 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.619
 background of the widget as we can choose the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.619
 that we want then 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.770
 we choose here 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.560
 we apply and we see that we have here the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.439
 bottom then in disposition so we 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.539
 the data that we are showing appear 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.810
 for example the first thing that appears text 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.659
 the second text refers to the alarm 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.079
 then to the time and the third time the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.929
 third text then it is the clock then 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.970
 for example if we give to the clock we're going 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.360
 to allow editing for example we will 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.510
 allow to move it 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.909
 to our liking up to down 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.909
 or else it also gives us options t 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.580
 reduce the size 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.580
 change the color 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.950
 Add 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.520
 well, blurred 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:42.720
 that is, it gives options 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:45.820
 almost infinite then we can also 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.160
 change the predefined action to the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.320
 time to press for example if we want 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.730
 that by pressing the clock it will take us 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.770
 the time or that we get to the alarm or 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.800
 we can use the chronometer that we can 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.950
 define here is to say we can choose in 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.930
 the application list application 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.709
 that we want to open 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.709
 then 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.340
 let's open it again 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.840
 so we can add more information by 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.120
 example we are here in the menu 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.230
 main we give the most and it allows us 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.569
 they added more text 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.350
 add series forms what is it that we 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.350
 will allow for 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.120
 Let's see if I can show it 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.230
 show then the day of the week 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.230
 remarking what 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.010
 it allows us to separate the good and 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:50.360
 for our taste then other 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:54.050
 options for example we can add 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.550
 and cones for example from the battery let's 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.530
 to choose 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.040
 here for example icon set 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.290
 let's take the battery and see 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.680
 that already appears to us here then 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.680
 simply 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.810
 but we have to scroll to see if 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.810
 we look for the option 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.759
 we see that it appears here in the 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.520
 lateral the same we can change the 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.819
 size increase it we can change the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.819
 colour 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.440
 in this color 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.259
 then we can rotate it if we want 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.310
 put then for example horizontal or 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.310
 vertical or good 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.560
 Well it gives us more options 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:54.740
 we can add images we can add 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.740
 other icons for example for the time 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.410
 we see that time appears here 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.410
 so then again we can move it 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.940
 I was a bit 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.070
 up 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.289
 and now we see how good it covers us a little 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.389
 the battery then what should be done 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.389
 would be to go back to the battery 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.409
 and move it further down 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.180
 then for the right then 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.530
 Well, it's just for you to do 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.590
 an idea of ​​all the possibilities that 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.330
 offers this takes time but what 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.789
 good is that it has a lot of potential 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.919
 say you can create the widget to yours 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.810
 measure according to our needs you can 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.110
 put information of upcoming appointments of 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.860
 temperature calendar the state of 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.919
 the battery remaining minutes of the 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.780
 that is to say they give many options 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.360
 then then you can simply 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.129
 save it 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.930
 giving him this button you can give him the 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:09.620
 name you want and then I will 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.789
 would stay on the main screen like this 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.639
