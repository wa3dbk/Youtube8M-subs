00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.790
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.759
 Another consequence of what's going on in there 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.830
 yes it will follow in the next two 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.109
 go here for the sims 3 page 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.550
 We start today as you are here 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.609
 can sign up 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.699
 and yes, that 's where you go on it 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.099
 Make an account and then call 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.349
 Actually, three pages are on either 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.930
 his e-mail address from origin 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.120
 if you already have one there 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.860
 If you do not have a state there is an account 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.760
 you can also do any other 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.000
 enter the address 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.980
 for example, the e-mail from your own 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.010
 I have an account in my case now 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:57.690
 my email address created for that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:58.949
 whole here de that's the e 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.739
 I am now here for the mailing address 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.320
 will use registrations so 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.290
 important for the e- mail address is also 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.549
 stupid - where sims 3 used here 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.560
 otherwise it will not work if I do 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.869
 have created my account with 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.000
 the same e-mail address then it works 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.080
 light needs an address that never 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.580
 connected to the hill so here you can 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.409
 you read yourselves through what you are the next 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.820
 Steps in detail are the explanation 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.250
 I'll tell you more or less now 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.320
 also so yes here the serial number of the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.420
 but you should do that 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.860
 do not just enter one 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.689
 any serial number from below in 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.380
 Extension pack the main game or 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.500
 mini addon what you have acquired and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.710
 then you have all the features mikrochips 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.439
 features for the sims 3 game or for 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.820
 the side of sims 3 activates her 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.649
 but it does not need it now 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.280
 we make we can for you 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.119
 personality counts go over 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.610
 personality what meant and 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.310
 Although your name you use here 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.280
 it would be easy for me now 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:09.670
 times 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:11.440
 hello test no idea 12 and yes there 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.750
 can you imagine you just name the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.480
 Volt main thing is not yet taken 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.590
 and now also a password for the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.440
 whole story then I take now 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.510
 this here and then you have to 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.620
 enter again 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.830
 so then hopefully it will be the same then 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.489
 you have to pay attention to your date of birth 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.140
 that you definitely 14 years old 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.370
 if I am not mistaken otherwise 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.260
 you can not sign up here 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.250
 I'll give it some now 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.340
 blabla date of birth might be one 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.600
 not bad if the age indicates 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.269
 or unreal date of birth 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.380
 because I think on the side that was there 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.390
 you do not even get any 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.700
 message so because of hearty 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.290
 Congratulations are always sweet and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.860
 That's why I'm right there anyway 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.209
 Honestly, except now kmh, because I'm fine 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.780
 can also have a real date of birth 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.489
 specify 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:14.530
 if you are interested here 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:15.160
 please hamm east so that's mine 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.410
 birthday 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.910
 yes Germany agrees saying it 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.980
 German I am female 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.840
 that should be synonymous in any case 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.299
 truthfully specify otherwise you will be there 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.370
 always displayed wrong because that finds 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.380
 however, attention 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.450
 then enter the number code of the there 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.370
 is displayed to exclude that 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.530
 her a machine since or else 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.700
 Something like the two fields here 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.930

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.090
