father<00:01:03.229> that's<00:01:04.229> about<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.040> will

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
father that's about this this will

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.730 
father that's about this this will
create<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.580> bulk<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> fly

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.590 

rather<00:01:09.340> than<00:01:09.580> just<00:01:09.790> using<00:01:10.409> sparkle<00:01:11.409> flash<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
rather than just using sparkle flash it

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.480 
rather than just using sparkle flash it
means<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:13.900> use<00:01:14.049> less<00:01:14.229> Sparkle<00:01:14.619> flashiness<00:01:15.040> this

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
means I use less Sparkle flashiness this

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.520 
means I use less Sparkle flashiness this
makes<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:15.909> a<00:01:16.030> bit<00:01:16.360> bulkier<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:19.440> about<00:01:20.440> five

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
makes it a bit bulkier about about five

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.270 
makes it a bit bulkier about about five
inches<00:01:21.040> long<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:23.680> 120<00:01:24.430> 25<00:01:24.909> millimeters<00:01:26.280> so

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
inches long about 120 25 millimeters so

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.300 
inches long about 120 25 millimeters so
then<00:01:27.400> when<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.580> tie<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:27.880> in<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.770> lay<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.130> on

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
then when I tie this in just lay it on

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.050 
then when I tie this in just lay it on
top<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.850> do<00:01:31.750> two<00:01:32.050> turns<00:01:32.350> very<00:01:33.190> well<00:01:33.580> three

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
top and do two turns very well three

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.560 
top and do two turns very well three
turns<00:01:34.300> very<00:01:34.509> loosely<00:01:35.550> then<00:01:36.550> I<00:01:37.000> make<00:01:37.420> sure<00:01:37.450> you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
turns very loosely then I make sure you

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.370 
turns very loosely then I make sure you
gonna<00:01:37.720> get<00:01:37.869> my<00:01:38.020> finger<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.680> push<00:01:39.430> it<00:01:39.670> around

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
gonna get my finger and push it around

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.460 
gonna get my finger and push it around
so<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.530> goes<00:01:41.770> both<00:01:42.520> sides<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.330> on<00:01:43.539> top<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.380> I

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
so it goes both sides and on top and I

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.410 
so it goes both sides and on top and I
don't<00:01:44.530> really<00:01:44.830> want<00:01:45.070> too<00:01:45.429> much<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.789> go<00:01:45.940> right

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
don't really want too much to go right

00:01:46.420 --> 00:02:10.850 
don't really want too much to go right
underneath

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
as you can see I don't have a lot on the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.809 
as you can see I don't have a lot on the
bottom<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:14.860> don't<00:02:15.250> want<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> lot<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.730> the

this<00:02:26.709> will<00:02:26.890> be<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.190> underside<00:02:27.910> or<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.239> lower

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
this will be the underside or the lower

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:52.949 
this will be the underside or the lower
half<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.989> fly<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:52.420> then<00:02:52.570> instead<00:02:52.900> of

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
half of the fly and then instead of

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.080 
half of the fly and then instead of
tying<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.470> straight<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:54.130> what<00:02:54.519> I'm<00:02:54.610> gonna<00:02:54.730> do

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
tying that straight on what I'm gonna do

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.710

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
both ends the ends aren't the same so if

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.060 
both ends the ends aren't the same so if
you<00:03:04.360> just<00:03:04.510> see<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.930> I'm<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.410> teasing<00:03:05.980> out
