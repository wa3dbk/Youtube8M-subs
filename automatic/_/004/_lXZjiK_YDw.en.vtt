00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.790
 behind us is protected 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.230
 car ural main key difference 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.600
 this is a car from s first he 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.480
 Russian before we never such 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.140
 did that is our latest designs 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.210
 the last 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.960
 car highly protected is not very 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.939
 high security 6 6 a class 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.590
 Keeps shelling with smacks of four 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.390
 half millimeter is also high 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.440
 mine protection ie car 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.980
 able to hold 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.840
 explosion of 8 kilograms of trotyl valentin this 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.170
 enough for a car like that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.100
 Class Western counterparts will keep from two 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.100
 up to six kilos 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.920
 Maximum vehicle speed 110 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.510
 kilometers per hour which is pretty decent 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.960
 average ground speed 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.500
 roads 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.560
 50 55 kilometers per hour more all 450 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.659
 horsepower i.e. forced 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.610
 engine specifically for these machines and 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.380
 the car is equipped with an automatic 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.640
 technical diagnostics systems 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.009
 which are built into the bios and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.280
 collects all the fault data and 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.090
 transmits them 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.979
 gps channels to the console in real time 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.740
 You can track all machine parameters for 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.740
 technical condition condition 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.310
 on top of it is a hatch with 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.050
 standard mounting sizes from 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.010
 turret machine guns new that is possible 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.610
 injection unit 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.400
 any weapons pony cannon of course but 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.660
 he didn't decently cars passed 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.790
 preliminary tests 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.979
 they fully survived ie they 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.350
 have been going over 50 thousand 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.110
 Kilometers eaten special tests undermining 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.760
 shelling and results are positive in 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.590
 this year plan to finish 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.520
 state tests why the car already for 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.520
 framework orgy
