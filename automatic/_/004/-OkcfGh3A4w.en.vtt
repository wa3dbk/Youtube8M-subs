00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
know the pictures themselves would

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.010 
know the pictures themselves would
suggest<00:02:53.820> characters<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.570> there's<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.840> boy's

covered<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.500> bees<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.610> should<00:02:57.000> make<00:02:57.180> a

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
covered in bees so I should make a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.880 
covered in bees so I should make a
character<00:02:57.570> perhaps<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.290> controls<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.739> beach

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
character perhaps the controls the beach

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.370

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
but the story really had a lot of its

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.250 
but the story really had a lot of its
own<00:03:01.500> momentum<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:02.160> book<00:03:02.340> 2<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.150> much<00:03:04.020> more

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
