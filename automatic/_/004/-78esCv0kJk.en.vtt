00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.390
 how about good friends today I'm going to 

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:07.720
 talk about a return experience 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.630
 with the online sales company called 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.820
 line if you're interested in doing your 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.240
 first purchase online but you have 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.240
 distrust either because you fear 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.890
 never give you the product or that 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.710
 they deliver a different product to you 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.170
 that you bought or even delivered to you 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.880
 a product but that is defective 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.400
 well I inform you that the first two 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.280
 options we will not review them in this 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.100
 video just talk about the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.829
 last option is to say how it went with me 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.920
 line in the return process min 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.489
 friend I talked to you on February 19, I bought 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.010
 this table for 465 mexican pesos 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.889
 after two days I got here to my 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.260
 address these are the photos such as 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:56.839
 He told me by the famous parcel 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.510
 this affects was already waiting for the worst 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.210
 but I proceeded to open my package and this 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.369
 it was what I found the table was 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.920
 very complete, he just lacked a 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.040
 very small detail did not bring legs 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.960
 then I called the inning and they very 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.409
 kindly they gave me a number of 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.149
 report and they asked me if they wanted 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.490
 the return of my money or the 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.950
 replacement of my product as it was my 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.720
 first physical purchase with line them 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.789
 it's clear that they gave me the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.700
 product here I show you an image of 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.780
 how my cart looked on the page 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.720
 line is the date is the cost and is 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.510
 the status of my return then 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.330
 let's summarize 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.580
 the day my February dream buy by 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.340
 Internet 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.520
 Two days later I received the package in my 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.130
 address and that same day I started the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.920
 refund procedure from this 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.770
 date I started receiving a series of 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.470
 emails in which I was informed that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.720
 the collection of my 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.120
 product the wine my site for 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.880
 subsequently deliver it the new 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.390
 product or almost preferred it could carry 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.340
 myself my table to the branch office 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.310
 closest but it had to be 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.920
 necessarily a branch and a post office do not 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.080
 a concessionaire which breaks with all 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.350
 the illusion of buying online and 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.140
 that eliminates comfort was not 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.600
 until March 25 over a month 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.340
 later when I received by mail 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.700
 electronic a series of instructions 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.380
 in which it was reported what to do here 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.110
 It shows you an image of my state of 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.480
 account where I show that the child made the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.820
 charge promised on the date and by 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.370
 agreed amount despite the fact that 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.590
 I had 100% on my table at 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.950
 instructions came two files 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.019
 1 pdf and the other word they said that 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.560
 put everything back in the box and that 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.930
 gave it the pdf file and that the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.610
 word file was for me to sign it 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.950
 who will pick up my package 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.629
 then I did what he told me here 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.140
 I leave you a photo of my master 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.140
 work 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.069
 this same image was the one that sent by 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.019
 mail to line 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.580
 then this party programmed me the 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.400
 first collect but never happened 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.190
 also reprogramme with a courier 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.620
 second collects a week later and 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.170
 a third collects this time together with 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.330
 line and courier and neither did 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.420
 after here the truth is that the 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.420
 emails they received they did not understand me anymore 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.630
 and it was not until the child decided 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.030
 better back send me a second new 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.820
 table without picking me the one I had already 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.460
 sent and it was until the 27th Sunday 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.280
 by the way in which I was delivered by 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.740
 end and my full table I tell you that 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.350
 That same day, do not let the 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.140
 dealer but until I opened the 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.180
 box and will verify all the content in 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.520
 presence of this gentleman which is the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.250
 I recommend you should always do here 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.320
 I leave the evidence that if I 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.350
 they brought two tables they never took the 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.880
 they brought me for the first time that 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.870
 I received it 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.110
 and how do you see my online cart now 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.170
 this region represents the first table 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.690
 delivered and this represents the second 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.270
 table delivered and here is the table already 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.930
 being used winds the 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.090
 conclusions of this experience 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.880
 the first is the most important ever 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.280
 you receive a package if it is hit 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.770
 come back to do it to the one who gives it to you 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.319
 not firm 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.919
 the second the communication system 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.960
 between the child and the post office is a terrible line 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.240
 must necessarily change parcel 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.520
 if you do not want to be affected and not say 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.409
 of internal communication in a post office 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.189
 who does not even exist 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.179
 3 I am very careful 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:02.360
 specifically with parcel 

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:05.860
 Estafeta Mexico has very bad 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.139
 reputation verify it on the internet 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.360
 and the fourth that is more than anything a 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.449
 advice do not let a bad 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.520
 shopping experience on the internet 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.770
 prevent to continue making a greeting 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.889
 friends and keep on having fun until 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.889
 then
