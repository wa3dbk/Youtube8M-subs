 do this fr super method has been able to advance 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.770
 because this opens a restore 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.900
 the last update which is good 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.060
 when you have to make a 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.650
 restore to update 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:09.250

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.900
 reach of 63 m I got 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.760
 finally fennel to expectations 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.160
 the nice puff of wii was wanted 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.060

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.060
 those words did not want 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.880
 the super six and it's not really 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.840
 it's soon applied 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.840
 only systems restriction on my pc 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:54.590
 in bath candle 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:58.110
 it was viewing for a method of 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.100
 recovering a system 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:08.170
 so had for example if you have a 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:12.209
 problem and that we can format you 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:17.310
 your pc you do not have you have 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.310
 could not see 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.530
 luxury knows 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:33.330
 sather what are you going we're going 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:34.890
 do and it 's beggars buddies where 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.319
 I am not a hacker 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.920
 2 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.150
 on the side his pc like that you'll see 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.560
 are void 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.680
 I give it to you the president 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:52.310
 evening consignation between m 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:56.609
 the manceaux costs and I will give you 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:01.020
 a climate therefore becomes for two sailors 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:03.890
 quickly I doubt him too how to do 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.100
 if they have very well it is in any case 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.000
 touch the most affected but fat 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.980
 saving game will not really 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.370
 I may be 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.160
 remain to forget the listened for the 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.160
 bias otherwise you can do 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.410
 finally something 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:30.050
 so imagine you delete example the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.169
 DVD player that 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.990
 what I think but not possible we are 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.270
 well so example or delete it 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.990
 what you did not have the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.270
 DVD player 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.250
 even if you buy another flight 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.759
 would have taken when you have three 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.150
 tickets whose machine that control 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:53.900
 the computer so here it was ten 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.830
 to occupy this reformate camp there are 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.830
