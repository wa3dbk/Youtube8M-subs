00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
okay here we have a right coxal bone and

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.800 
okay here we have a right coxal bone and
you<00:00:03.689> know<00:00:03.810> this<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.170> because<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.810> the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
you know this is because the the

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.720 
you know this is because the the
auricular<00:00:07.080> surface<00:00:07.589> here<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:07.830> always<00:00:08.130> medial

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
auricular surface here is always medial

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.570 
auricular surface here is always medial
and<00:00:09.030> then<00:00:09.179> it's<00:00:09.330> always<00:00:09.570> interior<00:00:10.080> okay<00:00:10.920> first

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
and then it's always interior okay first

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.150 
and then it's always interior okay first
you<00:00:11.759> have<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.230> acetabulum<00:00:13.230> which<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
you have the acetabulum which is the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.609 
you have the acetabulum which is the
little<00:00:15.049> socket<00:00:16.049> right<00:00:16.139> here<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.560> is

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
little socket right here and this is

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.460 
little socket right here and this is
where<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.130> femur<00:00:18.029> would<00:00:18.270> go<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.960> then<00:00:19.320> you

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
where the femur would go in and then you

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.010 
where the femur would go in and then you
have<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.920> ilium<00:00:20.369> which<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.939> cut<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.630> off<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
have the ilium which is cut this off it

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.509 
have the ilium which is cut this off it
would<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.619> top<00:00:22.890> part<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> bone

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
would just be the top part of the bone

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.029 
would just be the top part of the bone
and<00:00:23.730> then<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> Ala<00:00:24.900> which<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.769> right

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and then you have the Ala which is right

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.830 
and then you have the Ala which is right
here<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> Ala<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.119> enclosed<00:00:27.539> by<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
here and the Ala is enclosed by the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.070 
here and the Ala is enclosed by the
posterior<00:00:28.470> gluteal<00:00:29.070> line<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.330> anterior

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
posterior gluteal line and the anterior

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.440 
posterior gluteal line and the anterior
gluteal<00:00:31.679> line<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.009> that's<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.399> Ala<00:00:32.610> then<00:00:33.360> you

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
gluteal line so that's the Ala then you

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.170 
gluteal line so that's the Ala then you
have<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.680> mentioned<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.100> anterior<00:00:35.610> gluteal

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
have as I mentioned the anterior gluteal

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.299 
have as I mentioned the anterior gluteal
line<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.690> then<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.860> anterior

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309

half of the tee makes the pubic bone on

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.560 
half of the tee makes the pubic bone on
this<00:02:24.500> side<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.950> ER<00:02:25.130> here<00:02:25.460> is<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.240> pubic

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
this side of the ER here is the pubic

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.750 
this side of the ER here is the pubic
bone<00:02:26.620> okay<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.830> then<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.040> have<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.250> inferior

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
combines with the pubic tubercle right

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.980 
combines with the pubic tubercle right
there

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
there

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.870
