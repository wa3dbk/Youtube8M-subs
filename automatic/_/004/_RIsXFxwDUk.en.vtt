00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.059
 now i'm marcus collapse and welcome 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.280
 this very short very short 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.290
 tutorial only in the world of the series 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.379
 multiplayer with you that akimbo 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.670
 nanos as you can see they are not 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.789
 left behind I am simply 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.460
 uploading fewer bets 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.630
 having said that I'll show you how that so 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.769
 no no no I'll show you how beautiful 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.430
 sweet 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.610
 having said that I am here to explain a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.730
 a little eroded method but very much 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.530
 effective to get virtually 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.340
 infinite energy step explain it to me 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.980
 then a macerated blade road in the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.809
 macerated king produces let's see if he can 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.210
 see is very slow actually there 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.940
 we should put the upgrades but 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.140
 I can't do it here and I do n't have time 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.400
 to create a creative world ok 5 creates 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 5 perfect blade powder us the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.930
 let's go back into this 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.360
 project table where we put this 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.150
 rendered in this is the minion stone 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.159
 for those who do not know her, she is the sister 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.350
 poor of the philosophers back of the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.280
 equivalent exchange 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.830
 I don't know if this is what we say this 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.979
 let's say this feature this bug is 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 I wanted or not I do not know if they rise up 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.460
 when they will update the scenes 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.610
 the equivalent exchange I know only that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.439
 works the vast we get the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.210
 short of minion kill shows there 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.590
 a small probability and wave line 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.259
 it is done in this way then 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.810
 quite simple to use in 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.369
 this case has been used 888 times e 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.490
 with two black spiders it produces a blade 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.280
 ergo we can feed all the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.390
 our karting machinery industry e 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.180
 rabbits electrical and shine of the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.240
 forestry everything you need 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.970
 or we turn these off 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.340
 everything the boyle needs 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.560
 kraft engines the energy of the bur crack 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.970
 of minecraft joule with this simple 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.819
 system when we put a blitz road ce 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.260
 it returns 5 and therefore apologizes to 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.019
 five powders and therefore we can 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.110
 get 2 blazek by putting two black 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:27.140
 slots we can get 10 and then the 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.519
 we get 4 excuse the 5 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.590
 and so on when we have a big one 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.230
 number as in this case by pressing 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.660
 shift and left mouse button there 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.530
 we will get 64 you directly what 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.480
 we do divide them this way and 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.030
 then we put three quarters of the part e 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.739
 a quarter of the other a quarter it 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.690
 we put in a generator that 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.720
 will produce burning will produce electricity 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.880
 for the bat box that besides feeding 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.940
 all our plants will power the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.450
 macerated the same and we will put the blacks 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.769
 slot inside the macerate that will come 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.780
 quintupled to then be divided by 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.739
 new and therefore give us a difference of the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.690
 2.5 I hope this this 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.790
 explanation may be useful for you 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.560
 our plants currently that I 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.540
 know this is not a method 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.420
 automatic is fine but it is 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.579
 virtually infinite because in the case in 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.000
 where everything stopped you shouldn't 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.959
 do nothing but go here to do so e 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.010
 follow the procedure 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.890
 I am marcus crohn I hope to be there 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.840
 it was useful and sorry for the tired voice but 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.359
 it's night 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.109
 also here and see you soon 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.109
 Hi everyone
