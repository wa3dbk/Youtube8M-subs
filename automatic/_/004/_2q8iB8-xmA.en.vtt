00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
I love black-and-white photography

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.439 
I love black-and-white photography
because<00:00:54.019> I<00:00:54.440> think<00:00:54.500> it<00:00:54.769> distills<00:00:55.449> everything

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
because I think it distills everything

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.520 
because I think it distills everything
down<00:00:56.719> to<00:00:57.339> its<00:00:58.339> most<00:00:58.670> basic<00:00:59.239> form<00:00:59.510> for<00:01:00.260> me<00:01:00.379> it's

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
down to its most basic form for me it's

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.310 
down to its most basic form for me it's
the<00:01:00.800> it's<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.579> essence<00:01:02.059> there's<00:01:02.360> no<00:01:02.539> color<00:01:02.960> to

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
the it's the essence there's no color to

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.980 
the it's the essence there's no color to
distract<00:01:03.829> you<00:01:04.129> there's<00:01:04.430> no<00:01:04.990> decoration

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
distract you there's no decoration

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.280 
distract you there's no decoration
there's<00:01:06.470> no<00:01:06.770> color<00:01:07.549> that's<00:01:08.540> creating<00:01:09.049> eye

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
there's no color that's creating eye

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.670 
there's no color that's creating eye
candy<00:01:09.830> it<00:01:10.040> becomes<00:01:10.460> all<00:01:10.790> form<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:11.899> line<00:01:12.290> and

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
candy it becomes all form and line and

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.550 
candy it becomes all form and line and
shape<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.460> light<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.060> shadow<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:14.840> feel<00:01:15.290> like

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
shape and light and shadow I feel like

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.300 
shape and light and shadow I feel like
if<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:15.979> can<00:01:16.130> capture<00:01:17.049> moments<00:01:18.130> segments<00:01:19.130> of

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
if you can capture moments segments of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.749 
if you can capture moments segments of
life<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.030> preserve<00:01:20.750> them<00:01:21.229> forever<00:01:21.759> you've

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
life and preserve them forever you've

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.520 
life and preserve them forever you've
accomplished<00:01:23.330> something<00:01:23.570> for<00:01:24.140> other<00:01:24.440> people

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
accomplished something for other people

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.880 
accomplished something for other people
and<00:01:25.479> subsequent<00:01:26.479> generations<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.500> look<00:01:27.649> at

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
and subsequent generations to look at

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.800 
and subsequent generations to look at
and<00:01:28.100> study<00:01:28.369> but<00:01:28.759> I<00:01:28.789> feel<00:01:29.060> like<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.509> strength

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
and study but I feel like the strength

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.660 
and study but I feel like the strength
of<00:01:29.960> photography<00:01:30.530> is<00:01:30.679> that<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:30.950> can<00:01:31.250> freeze

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
of photography is that you can freeze

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.380 
of photography is that you can freeze
that<00:01:32.210> moment<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:32.929> can<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.950> can<00:01:34.250> hold<00:01:35.240> it

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
that moment you can you can hold it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.980 
that moment you can you can hold it
there<00:01:35.600> forever<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.319> for<00:01:36.830> me<00:01:37.220> that's<00:01:38.119> what<00:01:38.960> I

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
there forever and for me that's what I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.999 
there forever and for me that's what I
find<00:01:39.440> is<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:40.119> best<00:01:41.119> way<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.770> express<00:01:42.770> myself

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
find is the best way to express myself

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.940 
find is the best way to express myself
through<00:01:43.490> my<00:01:43.550> photography<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:45.770> when<00:01:45.920> I

started in 1989 and I just thought I
would<00:02:14.390> go<00:02:14.599> out<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.020> take<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.739> few<00:02:15.920> pictures<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
would go out and take a few pictures and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.850 
would go out and take a few pictures and
come<00:02:16.970> back<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.690> play<00:02:18.319> with<00:02:18.349> them<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:18.739> my

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
come back and play with them in my

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.650 
come back and play with them in my
darkroom<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.580> move<00:02:19.760> on<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.090> something<00:02:20.300> else

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
darkroom and move on to something else

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.080 
darkroom and move on to something else
and<00:02:21.019> it<00:02:21.680> really<00:02:21.890> put<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.160> hook<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.370> me<00:02:22.730> it

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
and it really put the hook in me it

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.880 
and it really put the hook in me it
became<00:02:23.480> kind<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:23.840> an<00:02:23.959> intensely<00:02:24.530> personal

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
became kind of an intensely personal

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.699 
became kind of an intensely personal
project<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.090> never<00:02:26.330> really<00:02:26.750> had<00:02:26.780> any<00:02:27.349> plans

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
project and I never really had any plans

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.479 
project and I never really had any plans
for<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:29.150> weather<00:02:29.360> is<00:02:29.870> really<00:02:30.530> exciting<00:02:31.370> and

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
for the weather is really exciting and

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.550 
for the weather is really exciting and
dramatic<00:02:32.090> at<00:02:32.269> spring<00:02:32.569> weather<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.230> you've<00:02:33.349> got

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
dramatic at spring weather so you've got

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.880

when you're branding you kind of get the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.259 
when you're branding you kind of get the
most<00:02:42.830> faces<00:02:43.489> in<00:02:43.670> any<00:02:43.819> one<00:02:44.090> spot<00:02:44.860> then<00:02:46.180> then<00:02:47.180> you

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
most faces in any one spot then then you

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.449 
most faces in any one spot then then you
do<00:02:47.390> anytime<00:02:47.629> the<00:02:48.019> year<00:02:48.409> and<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:48.860> gave<00:02:49.280> me

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
do anytime the year and so that gave me

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.199 
do anytime the year and so that gave me
a<00:02:49.489> lot<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:50.230> people<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.560> study<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.370> watch<00:02:52.819> and

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
a lot of people to study and watch and

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.520 
a lot of people to study and watch and

many<00:02:56.530> things<00:02:56.950> have<00:02:57.190> changed<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> past<00:02:58.030> 25

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
many things have changed in the past 25

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.900 
many things have changed in the past 25
years<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:59.319> think<00:02:59.400> when<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.430> started

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
years I think when I started

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.699 
years I think when I started
photographing<00:03:01.150> these<00:03:01.780> ranches<00:03:02.319> in<00:03:02.350> Nevada

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
photographing these ranches in Nevada

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.490 
photographing these ranches in Nevada
there<00:03:03.459> were<00:03:03.550> probably<00:03:03.790> six<00:03:04.270> or<00:03:04.480> seven<00:03:04.780> large

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
there were probably six or seven large

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.070 
there were probably six or seven large
ranches<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.400> would<00:03:06.550> go<00:03:06.700> out<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.930> they

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
ranches that I would go out to and they

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.380 
ranches that I would go out to and they
would<00:03:08.200> have<00:03:08.380> crews<00:03:08.740> of<00:03:09.069> nine<00:03:09.459> ten<00:03:09.819> eleven

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
would have crews of nine ten eleven

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.680 
would have crews of nine ten eleven
twelve<00:03:10.510> people<00:03:11.020> as<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:12.820> would<00:03:12.970> go<00:03:13.120> back<00:03:13.330> year

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
twelve people as I would go back year

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.660 
twelve people as I would go back year
after<00:03:13.720> year<00:03:14.050> these<00:03:14.530> crews<00:03:14.890> would<00:03:15.100> get<00:03:15.310> smaller

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
after year these crews would get smaller

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.870 
after year these crews would get smaller
and<00:03:16.030> smaller<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.810> smaller<00:03:16.900> but<00:03:17.740> I<00:03:17.950> feel<00:03:18.640> like

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
and smaller and smaller but I feel like

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.380 
and smaller and smaller but I feel like
I<00:03:19.209> really<00:03:20.520> got<00:03:21.520> in<00:03:21.820> on<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.900> whole<00:03:24.239> it's<00:03:25.239> a

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
I really got in on the whole it's a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.690 
I really got in on the whole it's a
cliche<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.230> disappearing<00:03:26.830> cowboy<00:03:27.310> but

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
cliche of the disappearing cowboy but

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.990 
cliche of the disappearing cowboy but
certainly<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.270> feel<00:03:28.630> like<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:29.050> happened<00:03:29.500> in

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
certainly I feel like it's happened in

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.550 
certainly I feel like it's happened in
at<00:03:31.000> least<00:03:31.120> in<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:31.420> Great<00:03:31.600> Basin<00:03:31.840> area<00:03:32.140> right

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
at least in the Great Basin area right

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.250 
at least in the Great Basin area right
in<00:03:32.590> front<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.920> my<00:03:33.010> lens
