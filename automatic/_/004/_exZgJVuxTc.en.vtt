00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that way for the fight and yeah I turned

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.960 
that way for the fight and yeah I turned
in<00:00:49.110> his<00:00:49.260> living<00:00:49.530> rooms<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> gym<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
in his living rooms out of the gym and

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.770 
in his living rooms out of the gym and
so<00:00:51.330> it<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:51.990> a<00:00:52.100> mistake<00:00:53.100> he<00:00:53.460> made<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.720> know

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so it was a mistake he made and you know

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.480 
so it was a mistake he made and you know
he<00:00:55.260> almost<00:00:55.410> got<00:00:55.680> lucky<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.160> fight<00:00:56.310> but<00:00:56.430> he

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
he almost got lucky in the fight but he

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.100 
he almost got lucky in the fight but he
still<00:00:56.700> lost<00:00:56.850> 11<00:00:57.329> runs<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.690> fight<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.079> I

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
still lost 11 runs and fight so I

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.870 
still lost 11 runs and fight so I
thought<00:00:58.380> it<00:00:58.470> was<00:00:58.560> an<00:00:58.710> embarrassing<00:00:59.220> loss<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
thought it was an embarrassing loss and

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.250 
thought it was an embarrassing loss and
I<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> fight<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> he<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.140> turn

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I think it's a fight that he can turn

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.870 
I think it's a fight that he can turn
around<00:01:01.440> me<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.040> be<00:01:02.190> when<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.700> fight

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
around me and I be when that fight

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.880 
around me and I be when that fight
easily<00:01:03.329> didn't<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> rematch<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.769> they

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
easily didn't get the rematch if they

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.410 
easily didn't get the rematch if they
did<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> rematch<00:01:05.549> he'd<00:01:05.759> be<00:01:05.880> successful<00:01:06.360> in

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
did have a rematch he'd be successful in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.149
