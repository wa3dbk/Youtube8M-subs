00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:32.369
 moments when we should always be embarrassed 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.540
 calmer by increasing Marus 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.540
 concert nothing 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.180
 co disagree spending 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.350

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:30.539
 started as I wanted it is in what 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.399
 case that's doing the right games 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.799
 removing the drive strongly from the end and when 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.649
 23 or could be saved 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.390
 could it all be of course nobody 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.390
 specially gorati itself all 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.789
 further there was not how much 6 or something else 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.789
 that is, to take such 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.250
 moment it's cool he lost for some reason 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.540
 yours is dangerous if you had 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.820
 ingenious by the way it can cut off 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.170
 mount just lucky thats 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.870
 going back to that stress in the cold you 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.370
 even apologized there was a balm there was no I 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.980
 late did not argue 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.500
 no poison it turned out I wanted to play 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.800
 the body was late in the mine then had to 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.380
 wear it purely automatically so 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.590
 the reactionary movement leave but i'm not 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:36.100
 purely apologized for what is close because 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.640
 what is the knee that nobody wants at all 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.640
 even such 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.700
 how do you comment on the coming dome those 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.860
 the same sock shorter citizen options 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.860
 just arrived 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.530
 meet the team 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.600
 union on the game from me is not a question of your 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.090
 a look that is the last choice there about 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.860
 5j sense you purposely left after the game 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.280
 let's agree so we'll talk 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.190
 about 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.750
 and that's why I'm talking about it 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.390
 This game in your opinion 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.630
 well atlas played but lost lost 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.310
 Well, if we compare there with 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.110
 latest games including why 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.350
 compare well let's we played we 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.810
 played like we have here 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.850
 initially we tried to perform were 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.670
 moment we see magnificent ideally well 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.800
 all right there will be a moment when we 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.400
 would not be able to do what 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.400
 and 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:48.340
 I could not get a plan that drew 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:53.200
 We agreed there are such moments 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.690
 In the game in any there is when we do not play 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.750
 against children game of teams with you 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.710
 today it seems very good 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.260
 team 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.590
 first place squeezed service that is, we 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.540
 we can not do everything and train all about them 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.560
 not zone and take them completely from them 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.900
 great players who are very 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.180
 good 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.460
 talent you two that is of course was 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:25.450
 The moment when to press and we need it 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:29.620
 stand and play with the stats read 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.660
 maintain such moments with us 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.830
 take initiatives and everything that is 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.320
 try it is impossible to pass 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:49.060
 tamer try to reduce it 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:49.060
