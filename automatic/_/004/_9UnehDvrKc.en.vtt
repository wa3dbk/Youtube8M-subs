she was a leader on the court

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.639 
she was a leader on the court
and<00:00:54.270> she<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.780> ran<00:00:54.960> things<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> court

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
and she just ran things on the court

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.959 
and she just ran things on the court
pretty<00:00:55.770> much<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> quarterback<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.760> team

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
pretty much like a quarterback up a team

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.209 
pretty much like a quarterback up a team
she<00:00:57.300> didn't<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.660> focus<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.710> much<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.980> score

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
she didn't really focus so much on score

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.380 
she didn't really focus so much on score
even<00:00:59.520> though<00:00:59.609> she<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.820> think<00:01:00.000> she<00:01:00.090> may<00:01:00.300> have

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
even though she I think she may have

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.959 
even though she I think she may have
averaged<00:01:00.750> maybe<00:01:00.989> nine<00:01:01.199> ten<00:01:01.440> points<00:01:01.800> or<00:01:02.579> more

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
averaged maybe nine ten points or more

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.380 
averaged maybe nine ten points or more
that<00:01:03.270> season<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.290> would<00:01:04.379> double<00:01:04.619> figures<00:01:05.390> but

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that season it would double figures but

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.179 
that season it would double figures but
her<00:01:06.510> main<00:01:06.720> concern<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.680> distributor

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
her main concern was just a distributor

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.010 
her main concern was just a distributor
