00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
we have some information on our flight

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.750 
we have some information on our flight
plan<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.800> which<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.100> could<00:00:50.280> read<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.610> you'd

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
plan here which you could read if you'd

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.670 
plan here which you could read if you'd
like<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.539> let's<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:51.840> right<00:00:52.050> into<00:00:52.230> missions

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
like but let's go right into missions

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.139 
like but let's go right into missions
because<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> pretty<00:00:54.710> involved<00:00:56.149> game

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
because this is a pretty involved game

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.340 
because this is a pretty involved game
that's<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> take<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:58.050> bit<00:00:58.289> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that's going to take a little bit of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.950 
that's going to take a little bit of
time<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.460> explain<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.930> your

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
time to explain so you have your

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.840 
time to explain so you have your
different<00:01:01.440> missions<00:01:01.770> over<00:01:02.039> here<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
different missions over here the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.070 
different missions over here the
simplest<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.510> being<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> Sea<00:01:04.049> of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
simplest one being the Sea of

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
simplest one being the Sea of
Tranquility<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:06.000> hard<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
Tranquility and then as you get hard to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.719 
Tranquility and then as you get hard to
these<00:01:06.930> harder<00:01:07.290> levels<00:01:07.650> there<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.070> more<00:01:08.369> stops

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
these harder levels there are more stops

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.120 
these harder levels there are more stops
that<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.450> make<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.920> those

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that you have to make you can see those

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.670 
that you have to make you can see those
here<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> Reds<00:01:11.939> are<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.450> landing<00:01:12.869> pads<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
here the Reds are the landing pads the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.050 
here the Reds are the landing pads the
Blues<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.119> refueling<00:01:15.960> stations<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
Blues are the refueling stations a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.249 
Blues are the refueling stations a
couple<00:01:18.060> things<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> pay

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
couple things that you have to pay

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.050 
couple things that you have to pay
attention<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.860> when<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:20.610> playing<00:01:20.820> this

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
attention to when you're playing this

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.950 
attention to when you're playing this
game<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.619> your<00:01:23.119> fuel<00:01:24.119> because<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.780> run<00:01:24.930> out

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
game is your fuel because if you run out

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.710 
game is your fuel because if you run out
of<00:01:25.110> fuel<00:01:25.340> you're<00:01:26.340> gonna<00:01:26.460> crash<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.939> burn<00:01:27.119> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
of fuel you're gonna crash and burn so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.140 
of fuel you're gonna crash and burn so
let's<00:01:28.140> go<00:01:28.380> off<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> easy<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
let's go off with the easy one here and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.530 
let's go off with the easy one here and
just<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.990> Sea<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> Tranquility<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> let's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
just do the Sea of Tranquility so let's

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.020 
just do the Sea of Tranquility so let's
hit<00:01:33.750> play<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:38.030> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
hit play here and so as you can see the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.810 
hit play here and so as you can see the
imagery<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.900> really<00:01:40.380> nice<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.549> have

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
imagery is really nice here you have

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.429 
imagery is really nice here you have
your<00:01:42.710> basic<00:01:43.710> renders<00:01:44.509> are<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> exact

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
your basic renders are the in the exact

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.300 
your basic renders are the in the exact
same<00:01:46.710> thing<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.280> would<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:49.009> if<00:01:50.009> we

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
same thing that we would see if if we

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.840 
same thing that we would see if if we
were<00:01:50.460> actually<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:51.090> these<00:01:51.680> these<00:01:52.680> missions<00:01:53.189> so

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
were actually on these these missions so

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.080 
were actually on these these missions so
the<00:01:54.630> object<00:01:55.079> here<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.530> land

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.800 

on<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:59.259> pad<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.479> as<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:02.020> can<00:02:02.200> see<00:02:02.229> we've<00:02:02.649> got

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
on that pad and as you can see we've got

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.929 
on that pad and as you can see we've got
our<00:02:04.810> vertical<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.829> horizontal<00:02:05.950> speeds<00:02:06.729> over

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
our vertical and horizontal speeds over

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.199 
our vertical and horizontal speeds over
here<00:02:07.329> on<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:07.719> side<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.340> those<00:02:09.340> speeds<00:02:09.849> will

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
here on the side and those speeds will

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.750 
here on the side and those speeds will
tell<00:02:10.479> us<00:02:10.509> if<00:02:10.959> they're<00:02:11.739> green<00:02:12.069> they'll<00:02:12.370> tell<00:02:12.610> us

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
tell us if they're green they'll tell us

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.110 
tell us if they're green they'll tell us
that<00:02:12.970> we're<00:02:13.090> coming<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.660> at<00:02:14.379> a<00:02:14.790> at<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.849> good

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
that we're coming in at a at a good

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.330 
that we're coming in at a at a good
speed<00:02:16.390> if<00:02:16.629> they're<00:02:16.780> red<00:02:17.110> they<00:02:17.890> will<00:02:18.069> tell<00:02:18.310> us

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
speed if they're red they will tell us

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.780 
speed if they're red they will tell us
that<00:02:18.670> we<00:02:18.790> are<00:02:18.819> coming<00:02:19.269> in<00:02:19.450> too<00:02:19.780> hot<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.310> here<00:02:21.760> I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
that we are coming in too hot so here I

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.070 
that we are coming in too hot so here I
am<00:02:21.940> lowering<00:02:22.720> myself<00:02:23.110> nicely<00:02:24.099> gently<00:02:24.730> and

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
am lowering myself nicely gently and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.440 
am lowering myself nicely gently and
mission<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.379> accomplished<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:28.120> that's<00:02:28.299> the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
mission is accomplished so that's the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.110 
mission is accomplished so that's the
goal<00:02:28.989> right<00:02:29.290> there<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.980> have<00:02:30.190> your<00:02:30.220> fuel<00:02:30.790> over

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
goal right there you have your fuel over

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.580 
goal right there you have your fuel over
here<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.599> want<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.810> make<00:02:31.959> sure<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.470> you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
here so you want to make sure that you

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.729 
here so you want to make sure that you
do<00:02:32.829> not<00:02:32.980> run<00:02:33.370> out<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.640> fuel<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:35.140> then<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.530> have

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
do not run out of fuel and then you have

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.100 
do not run out of fuel and then you have
your<00:02:36.069> altitude<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:37.180> which<00:02:37.390> shows<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.900> know

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
your altitude here which shows you know

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.770 
your altitude here which shows you know
how<00:02:38.290> far<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.769> are<00:02:38.799> until<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.370> surface

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
how far you are until the surface

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.000 
how far you are until the surface
vertical<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.900> horizontal<00:02:41.019> speed<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:41.920> you

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
vertical and horizontal speed so you

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.610 
vertical and horizontal speed so you
want<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.220> make<00:02:42.250> sure<00:02:42.519> you<00:02:42.730> focus<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.299> those<00:02:43.620> and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
want to make sure you focus on those and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.000 
want to make sure you focus on those and
make<00:02:44.860> sure<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.099> you<00:02:45.430> don't<00:02:46.739> hit<00:02:47.739> anything

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
make sure that you don't hit anything

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.289 
make sure that you don't hit anything
you<00:02:48.700> know<00:02:48.849> too<00:02:49.810> fast<00:02:50.079> so<00:02:50.829> another<00:02:51.670> button<00:02:52.000> over

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
you know too fast so another button over

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.650 
you know too fast so another button over
here<00:02:52.329> when<00:02:52.810> we<00:02:52.930> get<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.970> some<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.090> these<00:02:55.150> harder

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
here when we get to some of these harder

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.110 
here when we get to some of these harder
levels<00:02:56.079> that<00:02:56.379> have<00:02:56.440> more<00:02:57.040> landing<00:02:57.610> zones<00:02:57.879> that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
levels that have more landing zones that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.259 
levels that have more landing zones that
we<00:02:58.269> need<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.989> hit<00:02:59.250> it<00:03:00.250> may<00:03:00.519> become<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.970> little

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
we need to hit it may become a little

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.890 
we need to hit it may become a little
more<00:03:01.299> difficult<00:03:01.660> for<00:03:02.079> you<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.500> find<00:03:03.130> those

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
more difficult for you to find those

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.690 
more difficult for you to find those
because<00:03:04.900> they're<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.260> far<00:03:05.500> away<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.459> can

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
because they're so far away so you can

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.789 
because they're so far away so you can
use<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:07.090> target<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.900> actually<00:03:08.500> move<00:03:08.739> the

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
use this target to actually move the

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.240 
use this target to actually move the
camera<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.730> point<00:03:10.329> it<00:03:10.480> towards<00:03:10.980> where<00:03:11.980> our

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
camera and point it towards where our

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.479 
camera and point it towards where our
next<00:03:12.430> location<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.900> i<00:03:14.349> can<00:03:14.799> hit<00:03:14.950> target

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
next location is so i can hit target

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.670 
next location is so i can hit target
here<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.849> see<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.150> rotated<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.810> camera<00:03:17.290> and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
here and see it rotated the camera and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.890 
here and see it rotated the camera and
it's<00:03:18.010> showing<00:03:18.209> our<00:03:19.209> nearest

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
it's showing our nearest

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.180 
it's showing our nearest
location<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.500> we're<00:03:23.680> going<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:23.860> head<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.160> that

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
location so we're going to head in that

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.430 
location so we're going to head in that
direction<00:03:24.570> one<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.750> neat<00:03:25.930> things<00:03:25.960> that

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
direction one of the neat things that

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.320 
direction one of the neat things that
you<00:03:26.500> can<00:03:26.680> do<00:03:26.860> is<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.130> can<00:03:27.160> rotate<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.850> cameras

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
you can do is you can rotate the cameras

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.150 
you can do is you can rotate the cameras
here<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.460> zoom<00:03:30.460> in<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:30.910> out<00:03:31.030> as<00:03:31.480> well<00:03:32.320> no<00:03:32.860> way

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
here and zoom in and out as well no way

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.590 
here and zoom in and out as well no way
I<00:03:33.190> need<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.550> pay<00:03:33.730> attention<00:03:33.760> here<00:03:34.360> I'm<00:03:34.480> going

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
I need to pay attention here I'm going

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.150 
I need to pay attention here I'm going
to<00:03:34.980> crash<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.220> burn<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.840> this<00:03:38.350> this<00:03:38.830> game

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
to crash and burn so this this game

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.100 
to crash and burn so this this game
really<00:03:39.370> takes<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.910> lot<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.120> finesse<00:03:40.390> because

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
really takes a lot of finesse because

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.130 
really takes a lot of finesse because
you<00:03:41.770> can<00:03:41.950> easily<00:03:42.250> blast<00:03:42.910> right<00:03:43.330> past<00:03:43.660> one<00:03:44.050> of

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
you can easily blast right past one of

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.770 
you can easily blast right past one of
these<00:03:44.320> one<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.280> these<00:03:45.490> zones<00:03:45.760> these<00:03:46.240> landings

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
these one of these zones these landings

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.130 
these one of these zones these landings
and<00:03:47.320> then<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:48.190> course<00:03:48.660> here<00:03:49.660> in<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.870> lot<00:03:50.020> of

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
and then of course here in a lot of

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.250 
and then of course here in a lot of
trouble<00:03:50.500> this<00:03:51.280> is<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.490> very<00:03:51.520> hard<00:03:52.120> game<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.870> play

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
trouble this is a very hard game to play

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.910 
trouble this is a very hard game to play
and<00:03:53.680> record<00:03:53.950> at<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.490> same<00:03:54.730> time<00:03:55.920> without

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
and record at the same time without

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.710 
and record at the same time without
having<00:03:57.130> any<00:03:57.610> issues<00:03:58.030> here

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.020 
make this landing all right
looks<00:04:17.600> like<00:04:17.750> we<00:04:17.900> did<00:04:18.080> it<00:04:18.200> so<00:04:19.160> now<00:04:19.340> I've<00:04:19.550> got<00:04:19.790> one

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
looks like we did it so now I've got one

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.820 
looks like we did it so now I've got one
out<00:04:20.270> of<00:04:20.300> the<00:04:20.420> way<00:04:20.480> but<00:04:20.660> I<00:04:20.840> still<00:04:21.200> need<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.500> fly

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
out of the way but I still need to fly

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.640 
out of the way but I still need to fly
to<00:04:21.890> my<00:04:22.160> other<00:04:22.370> one<00:04:22.700> so<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.840> easy<00:04:24.050> way<00:04:24.380> here

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
to my other one so the easy way here

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.250 
to my other one so the easy way here
would<00:04:24.830> be<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.950> hit<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:25.340> target<00:04:25.640> take<00:04:26.630> off<00:04:26.870> and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
would be to hit that target take off and

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.300 
would be to hit that target take off and
fly<00:04:27.700> now<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.760> have<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.150> keep<00:04:29.300> in<00:04:29.480> mind<00:04:29.750> that<00:04:29.990> i<00:04:30.320> do

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
fly now I have to keep in mind that i do

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.180 
fly now I have to keep in mind that i do
not<00:04:31.490> have<00:04:31.850> any<00:04:32.440> fueling<00:04:33.440> stations<00:04:35.110> between<00:04:36.190> on

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
not have any fueling stations between on

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.370 
not have any fueling stations between on
this<00:04:37.430> level<00:04:37.700> so<00:04:38.030> i<00:04:38.060> need<00:04:38.420> to<00:04:38.450> make<00:04:38.900> sure<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.350> I

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
this level so i need to make sure that I

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.280 
this level so i need to make sure that I
don't<00:04:39.470> use<00:04:39.980> my<00:04:40.660> thruster<00:04:41.660> all<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.080> time

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
don't use my thruster all the time

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.650 
don't use my thruster all the time
because<00:04:42.680> I'm<00:04:42.950> going

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
because I'm going

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.140 
because I'm going
so<00:04:45.320> short<00:04:45.680> bursts<00:04:46.280> are<00:04:46.520> going<00:04:46.790> to<00:04:46.910> be<00:04:47.000> your

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
so short bursts are going to be your

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.690 
so short bursts are going to be your
best<00:04:47.330> game<00:04:47.690> plan<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.830> getting<00:04:49.160> over<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:51.700> the

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
best game plan to getting over to the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.040 
best game plan to getting over to the
other<00:04:52.820> side<00:04:53.950> way<00:04:54.950> too<00:04:55.010> low<00:04:55.720> coming<00:04:56.720> in<00:04:56.840> way<00:04:57.020> too

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
other side way too low coming in way too

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:06.249 
other side way too low coming in way too
hot<00:04:57.320> here<00:04:57.950> too<00:04:58.670> to<00:04:59.590> make<00:05:00.590> it

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.379 

this<00:05:07.259> is<00:05:07.469> very<00:05:07.979> challenging<00:05:10.550> whoa<00:05:11.550> okay<00:05:12.240> I'm

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
this is very challenging whoa okay I'm

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.769 
this is very challenging whoa okay I'm
dead<00:05:12.599> so<00:05:13.199> uh<00:05:13.669> obviously<00:05:14.669> that's<00:05:15.240> what<00:05:15.419> happens

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779 
dead so uh obviously that's what happens

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:20.510 
dead so uh obviously that's what happens
when<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.559> crash<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.219> burn<00:05:18.949> so<00:05:19.949> a<00:05:19.979> couple<00:05:20.309> of

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
when you crash and burn so a couple of

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.639 
when you crash and burn so a couple of
things<00:05:20.580> when<00:05:21.240> you<00:05:21.360> use<00:05:21.629> that<00:05:21.659> target<00:05:22.469> and<00:05:22.499> you

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:22.649 
things when you use that target and you

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:27.139 
things when you use that target and you
actually<00:05:22.889> fly<00:05:23.430> past<00:05:25.580> you're<00:05:26.580> intending

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:27.149 
actually fly past you're intending

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:30.049 
actually fly past you're intending
landing<00:05:27.930> zone<00:05:28.199> the<00:05:28.830> camera<00:05:29.369> will<00:05:29.580> fix<00:05:29.879> upon

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:30.059 
landing zone the camera will fix upon

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:34.399 
landing zone the camera will fix upon
that<00:05:30.659> zone<00:05:31.020> if<00:05:31.319> you<00:05:31.649> have<00:05:31.830> used<00:05:32.479> the<00:05:33.479> target<00:05:33.960> if

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
that zone if you have used the target if

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.739 
that zone if you have used the target if
you<00:05:34.649> have<00:05:34.860> not<00:05:35.069> you'll<00:05:35.849> be<00:05:35.969> kind<00:05:36.389> of<00:05:36.539> flying

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:36.749 
you have not you'll be kind of flying

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:38.779 
you have not you'll be kind of flying
blindly<00:05:37.379> which<00:05:37.589> I<00:05:37.770> would<00:05:37.949> say<00:05:38.159> adds<00:05:38.399> a<00:05:38.610> level

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
blindly which I would say adds a level

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.749 
blindly which I would say adds a level
of<00:05:38.999> difficulty<00:05:39.419> so<00:05:40.039> this<00:05:41.039> would<00:05:41.249> I<00:05:41.279> would<00:05:41.610> say

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
of difficulty so this would I would say

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.339 
of difficulty so this would I would say
would<00:05:41.879> be<00:05:41.939> your<00:05:42.180> help<00:05:42.449> you<00:05:42.839> know<00:05:42.960> if<00:05:43.169> you

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
would be your help you know if you

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.409 
would be your help you know if you
wanted<00:05:43.620> assistance<00:05:44.189> you<00:05:44.460> would<00:05:44.610> use<00:05:44.819> that<00:05:44.849> and

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
wanted assistance you would use that and

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.899 
wanted assistance you would use that and
it<00:05:46.289> would<00:05:46.469> provide<00:05:46.770> assistance<00:05:47.399> but<00:05:47.669> if<00:05:47.819> you

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
it would provide assistance but if you

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.760 
it would provide assistance but if you
did<00:05:48.089> not<00:05:48.240> just<00:05:48.300> wanted<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.110> press<00:05:49.919> your<00:05:50.099> luck

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
obviously don't use it anytime during

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.600 
obviously don't use it anytime during
gameplay<00:05:54.809> you<00:05:55.169> can<00:05:55.469> hit<00:05:55.649> the<00:05:55.770> pause<00:05:55.919> button<00:05:55.979> to

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
gameplay you can hit the pause button to

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.329 
gameplay you can hit the pause button to
stop<00:05:56.939> and<00:05:57.240> pause<00:05:57.779> the<00:05:57.839> game<00:05:58.189> so<00:05:59.189> that

missions saw when they were there years
ago<00:06:20.849> so<00:06:21.389> very<00:06:21.899> good<00:06:23.209> overall<00:06:24.209> gaming

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:24.779 
ago so very good overall gaming

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:27.469

obviously<00:06:27.779> a<00:06:28.349> game<00:06:28.589> you<00:06:28.709> have<00:06:28.830> to<00:06:28.889> concentrate

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:29.339 
obviously a game you have to concentrate

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:32.869 
obviously a game you have to concentrate
a<00:06:29.699> lot<00:06:29.969> on<00:06:30.240> to<00:06:30.479> play<00:06:30.779> and<00:06:31.709> to<00:06:31.949> be<00:06:32.099> successful<00:06:32.309> at

a lot on to play and to be successful at

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:36.379 
a lot on to play and to be successful at
but<00:06:33.569> nonetheless<00:06:33.870> that<00:06:34.589> just<00:06:34.860> makes<00:06:35.069> a<00:06:35.389> more

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:36.389 
but nonetheless that just makes a more

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.070 
but nonetheless that just makes a more
challenge<00:06:36.899> makes<00:06:37.169> it<00:06:37.289> more<00:06:37.409> challenging<00:06:37.469> so

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
challenge makes it more challenging so

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.389 
challenge makes it more challenging so
inexpensive<00:06:40.080> game<00:06:40.289> not<00:06:40.589> very<00:06:40.800> expensive<00:06:41.099> at

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:41.399 
inexpensive game not very expensive at

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:43.369 
inexpensive game not very expensive at
all<00:06:41.490> I<00:06:41.729> recommend<00:06:42.599> that<00:06:42.659> you<00:06:42.749> go<00:06:42.870> check<00:06:43.139> it<00:06:43.259> out
