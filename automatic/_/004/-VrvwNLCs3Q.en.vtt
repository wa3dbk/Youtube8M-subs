00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
colleagues tell me that if they were to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.380 
colleagues tell me that if they were to
find<00:00:40.770> something<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.460> say<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.059> Death

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
find something like this say in Death

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
find something like this say in Death
Valley<00:00:42.420> California<00:00:43.379> or<00:00:43.500> somewhere<00:00:43.800> else<00:00:43.829> dry

they say up there used to be water here
for<00:00:46.320> sure<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.370> they<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.030> Mars

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
for sure so if they see this on Mars

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.819 
for sure so if they see this on Mars
that's<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> conclusion<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.469> come<00:00:49.680> to

and here's lutely they come to it they

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.090 
and here's lutely they come to it they
say<00:00:51.809> bulletproof<00:00:52.289> ears<00:00:52.469> what<00:00:52.620> Steve<00:00:52.860> Squyres

say bulletproof ears what Steve Squyres
he's<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.520> lead<00:00:53.670> researcher<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> spirit

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
he's the lead researcher for the spirit

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.689 
he's the lead researcher for the spirit
opportunity<00:00:55.260> Rover<00:00:55.860> program<00:00:56.219> says<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
opportunity Rover program says this is

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.060 
opportunity Rover program says this is
the<00:00:56.730> single-most<00:00:57.360> bulletproof<00:00:58.289> observation

the single-most bulletproof observation

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.040 
the single-most bulletproof observation
that<00:00:59.250> i<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.820> think<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.480> we've<00:01:00.629> made<00:01:00.870> this

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that i can think of that we've made this

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.950 
that i can think of that we've made this
entire<00:01:01.500> mission<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.850> bulletproof<00:01:03.329> when

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
entire mission is it bulletproof when

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
entire mission is it bulletproof when
you<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.650> say<00:01:04.860> yes<00:01:05.250> definitely

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
you see this to you say yes definitely

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.469 
you see this to you say yes definitely
water<00:01:06.290> well<00:01:07.290> there<00:01:07.799> are<00:01:07.830> possible<00:01:08.820> exotic

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
water well there are possible exotic

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.539 
water well there are possible exotic
physical<00:01:09.990> situations<00:01:10.860> where<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.280> could

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
physical situations where you could

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.950 
physical situations where you could
deposit<00:01:11.880> gypsum<00:01:12.450> under<00:01:12.659> these<00:01:12.780> circumstances

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
deposit gypsum under these circumstances

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.420 
deposit gypsum under these circumstances
but<00:01:14.450> yeah<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.869> pretty<00:01:16.140> bulletproof<00:01:16.380> as<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
but yeah it's pretty bulletproof as I

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.260 
but yeah it's pretty bulletproof as I
said<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:18.409> calling<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> slam<00:01:19.920> dunk

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
said I think calling it a slam dunk

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.760 
said I think calling it a slam dunk
observation<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.420> very<00:01:21.659> good<00:01:21.900> I've<00:01:22.080> seen<00:01:22.530> some

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
observation is very good I've seen some

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
observation is very good I've seen some
of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> evidence<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
of the evidence a little bit not the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
of the evidence a little bit not the
physical<00:01:25.229> stuff<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:25.920> I've<00:01:26.009> read<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
physical stuff but I've read about it

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.030 
physical stuff but I've read about it
and<00:01:26.640> based<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> scientific<00:01:28.040> observations

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and based on the scientific observations

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.690 
and based on the scientific observations
that<00:01:29.610> I've<00:01:29.790> seen<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.479> solid<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.040> explain

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that I've seen it's solid and so explain

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.219 
that I've seen it's solid and so explain
to<00:01:32.970> somebody<00:01:33.180> watching<00:01:33.659> at<00:01:33.750> home<00:01:33.869> they<00:01:34.049> look

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
to somebody watching at home they look

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.359 
to somebody watching at home they look
at<00:01:34.350> these<00:01:34.500> pictures<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.979> they're<00:01:35.220> saying

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
at these pictures and they're saying

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
at these pictures and they're saying
okay<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.030> Rover<00:01:36.420> comes<00:01:36.630> upon<00:01:36.960> its<00:01:37.140> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
okay so this Rover comes upon its in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.810 
okay so this Rover comes upon its in
this<00:01:37.409> crater<00:01:37.710> everything's<00:01:38.549> dry

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
this crater everything's dry

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.569 
this crater everything's dry
everything's<00:01:39.420> dusty<00:01:40.159> you're<00:01:41.159> telling<00:01:41.520> me

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
everything's dusty you're telling me

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
everything's dusty you're telling me
there's<00:01:41.759> water<00:01:42.030> how<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> get<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.869> well

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
there's water how do you get there well

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.429 
there's water how do you get there well
when<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.759> calcium<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.840> sulfur<00:01:46.259> in

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
when you have calcium and sulfur in

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.139 
when you have calcium and sulfur in
these<00:01:46.770> concentrations<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.700> they<00:01:47.909> found

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
these concentrations that they found

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.240 
these concentrations that they found
it's<00:01:48.479> basically<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.320> gypsum<00:01:49.829> stuff<00:01:50.100> now

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
it's basically this gypsum stuff now

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.100 
it's basically this gypsum stuff now
gypsum<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.939> earth<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.240> very<00:01:51.299> common<00:01:51.930> sits

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
gypsum here on earth is very common sits

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.859 
gypsum here on earth is very common sits
very<00:01:52.229> soft<00:01:52.619> powdery<00:01:53.130> thing<00:01:53.570> it's<00:01:54.570> in

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
very soft powdery thing it's in

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.130 
very soft powdery thing it's in
sheetrock<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.189> tofu<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:57.810> in

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
sheetrock it's in tofu it's in

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.800 
sheetrock it's in tofu it's in
home-brewed<00:01:58.710> beer<00:01:59.100> so<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.180> shows<00:02:00.420> up

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
home-brewed beer so it just shows up

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.780 
home-brewed beer so it just shows up
when<00:02:01.140> there<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.710> water<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.460> slowly

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
when there is water and it slowly

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760 
when there is water and it slowly
deposits<00:02:03.479> over<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.719> long<00:02:03.840> period<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.259> time<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
deposits over a long period of time and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.119 
deposits over a long period of time and
then<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.189> water<00:02:05.430> dries<00:02:06.229> leaving<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.649> gypsum

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
then the water dries leaving the gypsum

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.400 
then the water dries leaving the gypsum
rock<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.640> place<00:02:08.970> I'm<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.599> sure<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.289> I'm

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
rock in place I'm not sure I just I'm

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.720 
rock in place I'm not sure I just I'm
not<00:02:10.440> sure<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> wanted<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> learn<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
not sure I wanted to learn that the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.430 
not sure I wanted to learn that the
stuff<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.239> my<00:02:12.360> walls<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.840> also<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.290> my

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
stuff that's in my walls is also in my

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.550 
stuff that's in my walls is also in my
beer

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
beer

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.289 
beer
thanks<00:02:15.560> for<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.799> time<00:02:16.010> sure<00:02:16.700> my<00:02:17.030> pleasure

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
thanks for that time sure my pleasure

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.780 
thanks for that time sure my pleasure
but<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.019> if<00:02:18.200> there's<00:02:18.470> water<00:02:18.739> is<00:02:19.159> there

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
but so if there's water is there

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.089 
but so if there's water is there
necessarily<00:02:20.150> was<00:02:20.810> there<00:02:21.049> necessarily<00:02:21.409> life

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
necessarily was there necessarily life

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.940 
necessarily was there necessarily life
what<00:02:22.939> a<00:02:22.970> great<00:02:23.239> question<00:02:23.739> everywhere<00:02:24.739> on

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
what a great question everywhere on

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.729 
what a great question everywhere on
Earth<00:02:25.280> where<00:02:26.030> we've<00:02:26.209> found<00:02:26.540> water<00:02:26.959> sitting

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
Earth where we've found water sitting

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.229 
Earth where we've found water sitting
around<00:02:28.010> for<00:02:28.280> long<00:02:28.430> periods<00:02:28.459> of<00:02:28.970> time<00:02:29.030> like

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
around for long periods of time like

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.990 
around for long periods of time like
this<00:02:29.599> we've<00:02:29.840> also<00:02:30.049> found<00:02:30.409> life<00:02:30.739> but<00:02:31.430> until<00:02:31.610> we

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
this we've also found life but until we

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.059 
this we've also found life but until we
actually<00:02:32.150> get<00:02:32.510> solid<00:02:32.840> evidence<00:02:33.079> it's<00:02:33.560> really

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
actually get solid evidence it's really

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.130 
actually get solid evidence it's really
really<00:02:34.400> hard<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.790> say<00:02:34.970> for<00:02:35.000> sure<00:02:35.239> there<00:02:35.959> is

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
really hard to say for sure there is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.319 
really hard to say for sure there is
actually<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.709> spacecraft<00:02:37.340> moving<00:02:37.819> on<00:02:37.970> its<00:02:38.209> way

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
actually a spacecraft moving on its way

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.530 
actually a spacecraft moving on its way
to<00:02:38.390> Mars<00:02:38.629> now<00:02:38.959> it's<00:02:39.260> called<00:02:40.510> Curiosity<00:02:41.510> rover

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
to Mars now it's called Curiosity rover

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.899 
to Mars now it's called Curiosity rover
and<00:02:42.049> in<00:02:42.500> about<00:02:42.709> eight<00:02:42.950> months<00:02:43.189> it<00:02:43.489> will<00:02:43.640> land

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
and in about eight months it will land

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.490 
and in about eight months it will land
with<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.209> most<00:02:44.420> sophisticated<00:02:44.599> scientific

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
with the most sophisticated scientific

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.170 
with the most sophisticated scientific
equipment<00:02:46.220> that's<00:02:46.340> ever<00:02:46.609> been<00:02:46.849> on<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
equipment that's ever been on the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.210 
equipment that's ever been on the
surface<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.599> Mars<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:47.989> hopefully<00:02:48.739> we'll<00:02:49.099> get

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
surface of Mars and hopefully we'll get

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.009 
surface of Mars and hopefully we'll get
even<00:02:49.489> more<00:02:49.640> concrete<00:02:50.120> evidence<00:02:50.420> from<00:02:50.629> that<00:02:50.840> in

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
even more concrete evidence from that in

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.869 
even more concrete evidence from that in
just<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.319> very<00:02:51.349> short<00:02:51.739> time<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.370> help<00:02:52.609> me<00:02:52.760> with

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
just a very short time and help me with

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.250 
just a very short time and help me with
the<00:02:53.000> difference<00:02:53.329> in<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.450> technology<00:02:53.840> because

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
the difference in the technology because

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.390 
the difference in the technology because
I'd<00:02:54.379> be<00:02:54.560> amazed<00:02:54.799> when<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.010> was<00:02:55.129> reading<00:02:55.370> about

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
I'd be amazed when I was reading about

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.250 
I'd be amazed when I was reading about

of people criticize how much money to
these<00:03:02.120> things<00:03:02.329> cost<00:03:02.599> what<00:03:02.900> value<00:03:03.170> do<00:03:03.230> we<00:03:03.290> get

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
these things cost what value do we get

thing's been up there looking for

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.080 
thing's been up there looking for
evidence<00:03:06.139> for<00:03:06.680> eight<00:03:06.799> years<00:03:06.980> obviously<00:03:07.909> if

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
evidence for eight years obviously if

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.460 
evidence for eight years obviously if
that<00:03:08.359> has<00:03:08.599> been<00:03:08.750> there<00:03:08.870> for<00:03:08.900> eight<00:03:09.109> years<00:03:09.290> and

yes how much more advanced will the new
research<00:03:14.720> be<00:03:14.930> well<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:16.159> can<00:03:16.760> give<00:03:16.909> a<00:03:16.940> brief

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
research be well I can give a brief

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.369 
research be well I can give a brief

with<00:03:58.129> the<00:03:58.310> riddle<00:03:58.609> you<00:03:58.699> say<00:03:58.879> everywhere<00:03:59.299> on

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
with the riddle you say everywhere on

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:00.970 
with the riddle you say everywhere on
Earth<00:03:59.480> where<00:03:59.989> there's<00:04:00.139> been<00:04:00.290> water<00:04:00.470> there's

Earth where there's been water there's

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.789 
Earth where there's been water there's
been<00:04:01.190> life<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:02.449> how<00:04:02.659> do<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:02.900> go<00:04:03.049> about<00:04:03.079> the

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
been life so how do you go about the

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.680 
been life so how do you go about the
question-and-answer<00:04:04.370> process<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.299> find<00:04:05.480> out

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
question-and-answer process to find out

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.839 
question-and-answer process to find out
if<00:04:05.810> that's<00:04:05.989> also<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.470> case<00:04:06.500> on<00:04:06.799> Mars<00:04:07.040> that's<00:04:07.699> a

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
if that's also the case on Mars that's a

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.800 
if that's also the case on Mars that's a
great<00:04:08.030> question<00:04:08.239> when<00:04:09.169> you<00:04:09.199> have<00:04:09.590> biological

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
great question when you have biological

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.110 
great question when you have biological
things<00:04:11.810> around<00:04:12.620> evidence<00:04:13.340> say<00:04:13.699> none<00:04:13.909> of<00:04:14.030> these

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
things around evidence say none of these

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.339 
things around evidence say none of these
things<00:04:14.150> are<00:04:14.389> likely<00:04:14.569> to<00:04:14.720> be<00:04:14.810> alive<00:04:15.109> today

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
things are likely to be alive today

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.199 
things are likely to be alive today
because<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.919> surface<00:04:16.250> of<00:04:16.340> Mars<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.760> very<00:04:16.820> old

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
because the surface of Mars is very old

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.360 
because the surface of Mars is very old
and<00:04:17.449> very<00:04:17.539> dry<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.019> very<00:04:18.260> inhospitable<00:04:18.590> but

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
and very dry and very inhospitable but

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.029 
and very dry and very inhospitable but
you'll<00:04:19.909> find<00:04:20.209> fossilized<00:04:21.049> evidence<00:04:21.650> maybe

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
you'll find fossilized evidence maybe

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.700 
you'll find fossilized evidence maybe
things<00:04:22.490> that<00:04:22.610> might<00:04:23.180> look<00:04:23.479> like<00:04:23.539> the<00:04:24.050> bacteria

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
things that might look like the bacteria

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.950 
things that might look like the bacteria
that<00:04:25.130> existed<00:04:25.669> here<00:04:25.700> on<00:04:25.880> earth<00:04:26.030> billions<00:04:26.599> of

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
and are now currently fossilized you

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.570 
and are now currently fossilized you
might<00:04:29.330> use<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:30.080> something<00:04:30.770> like<00:04:30.890> a<00:04:30.920> microscope

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
might use a something like a microscope

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.790 
might use a something like a microscope
to<00:04:31.760> see<00:04:31.790> what<00:04:32.060> they<00:04:32.180> look<00:04:32.210> like<00:04:32.390> or<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:33.590> might

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
to see what they look like or you might

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.980 
to see what they look like or you might
use<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.460> spectrometer<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.510> kind<00:04:35.750> of<00:04:35.810> thing

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
use a spectrometer the kind of thing

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.570 
use a spectrometer the kind of thing
that<00:04:36.020> was<00:04:36.260> used<00:04:36.470> also<00:04:36.830> here<00:04:37.070> on<00:04:37.100> this<00:04:37.370> little

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
that was used also here on this little

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.630

vein of gypsum by opportunity and maybe

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.610 
vein of gypsum by opportunity and maybe
look<00:04:40.910> at<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.180> chemical<00:04:41.450> composition<00:04:41.840> see<00:04:42.560> if

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
look at the chemical composition see if

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.060 
look at the chemical composition see if
we<00:04:42.710> can<00:04:42.890> find<00:04:43.240> evidence<00:04:44.240> of<00:04:44.420> DNA<00:04:45.080> proteins

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
that we can get it sooner rather than

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.900 
that we can get it sooner rather than
