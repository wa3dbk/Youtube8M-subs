00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.859
 Welcome to the national league derby 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.220
 between the hsc and blue-white killers 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.099
 the game association bad pyrmont after 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 a thirsty course, the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.329
 pyrmonter last Saturday 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.700
 was impressively back with a 5 0 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.710
 alfeld swept off the field and of course 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.579
 Philipp Kaste's team also wanted 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.520
 the last compulsory game this year 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.550
 successfully complete no easy 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.460
 task because the swallows wanted 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.579
 definitely the three points at home here 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 do not keep on one 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.340
 to have to winter downhill 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.159
 The better start, however, caught 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.229
 the guests in the white jersey the twelfth 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.330
 minute free kick christopher loges a 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.970
 unpredictable flatterball is know 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.080
 Surprised is not a good figure 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.060
 zero to one for the game association 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.250
 do then struggled playfully got 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.729
 However, the team of Siege Motzner does not 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.680
 a lot of the 22 minutes 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.770
 a little exception nice 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.820
 ball treatment of about ulrich the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.259
 conclusion is rather 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.680
 to be improved the kurstÃ¤dter 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.520
 on the other hand extremely compact and 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.079
 Focused on the front and purposefully read 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.490
 You can get there on the right side of the fairway 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.850
 Great entry and a terrific 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:59.369
 graduation from christopher loges 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.350
 horny gate 0 to 2 after 25 minutes that 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.049
 was really great football serves the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.119
 Men in white jersey here 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.879
 presented crisis loges with von matt 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.120
 how off teller sent on the trip 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:16.150
 could get out in time and explained 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.590
 ultimately on the line it remained so 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.510
 at 0 2 halftime 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.159
 the ambulatory therapy center of antifa 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.810
 klink in bad pyrmont helps you 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.349
 a sports injury back to the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.000
 legs 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.799
 a focus of one of the largest 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.480
 outpatient therapy center in the district 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.489
 is the physiotherapeutic care 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.140
 of athletes and teams 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.390
 grab here as well as practical 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.610
 Experiences from professional sports with the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.120
 HSG Blomberg-Lippe return visit 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.340
 wanted to give us up in bad pyrmont the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.040
 but do not swallow anything here for a long time 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.489
 immediately after the page change free kick 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.000
 ugur aydin and Piontek heads the 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.920
 play equipment to the latte only a few 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.709
 seconds later the next one 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.799
 chance beckmann puts in the ball 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.440
 little too far ahead 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.909
 this stormy phase of the host 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.909
 but took a relatively fast one the end 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:16.359
 52 minutes a brilliant bit of 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:19.780
 dull as often on benedikt hagemann and 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:23.530
 his first goal of the season may be 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.840
 really let's see 0 to 3 for the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.569
 Spielvereinigung Bad Pyrmont 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.940
 but it was still a little too early 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:36.540
 to speak of a preliminary decision 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:39.370
 the 68 minute rico stack up 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.940
 fantastic gate of the skin the thing there 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.190
 just ice cold in the stitches 1 to 3 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.930
 the connection hit was maybe 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.410
 something else in it for the blue ones 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.769
 The answer is no, because pyrmont 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.139
 played the whole sovereign down and 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.349
 even had some good ones here 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.650
 bullet options dull as often 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:06.329
 only hits the outer post and so on 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.299
 it stays at the end of one to three 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.069
 a deserved victory for the pyrmonter 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:18.220
 The captain also saw that in a similar way 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:20.620
 benedikt hagemann yes i thought we were 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.789
 actually already clearly better each 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.780
 first quarter of an hour in the first in the 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.180
 second half had a bit 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.130
 But problems solved us quite well 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.310
 and then too 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.440
 at the right time, the goals you done 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.990
 scored the goal for the 3 0 scored 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.950
 I am particularly happy or already 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.340
 No longer taken that now 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.580
 my preparation 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.440
 the conclusion for this year yes I think 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.580
 we have not even twelve points 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.380
 more than last year at the time 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.510
 Game had a good season 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.480
 small in between have us 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.590
 but finally brought out again and 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.190
 now always by two victories last 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.190
 brought and
