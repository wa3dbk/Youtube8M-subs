00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
so let's take a look we have removing

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:12.230 
so let's take a look we have removing
the<00:01:01.680> box<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.540> users<00:01:03.540> value<00:01:05.210> amplified<00:01:06.210> antenna

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:23.750 

Oh<00:01:16.920> rap<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.510> see<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.760> in

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
Oh rap and we can see that in

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.740 
Oh rap and we can see that in
addition<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.420> two<00:01:24.630> antennas<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> side

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
addition to the two antennas on the side

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.260 
addition to the two antennas on the side
you'll<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.080> an<00:01:29.119> AC<00:01:30.119> adapter<00:01:30.450> hole<00:01:31.080> and

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
you'll you have an AC adapter hole and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:41.770 
you'll you have an AC adapter hole and
antenna<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> hole<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.950> coax<00:01:41.610> cable

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
antenna out the hole and the coax cable
that's<00:01:42.780> included<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:49.550> looks<00:01:50.550> like<00:01:50.640> AC

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that's included and looks like AC

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.500 
that's included and looks like AC
adapter

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.720 

there's<00:01:59.170> an<00:01:59.320> amplification<00:01:59.680> knob<00:02:00.160> over<00:02:00.430> here

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
there's an amplification knob over here

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.490 
there's an amplification knob over here
you<00:02:01.270> could<00:02:01.420> turn<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.900> adjust<00:02:02.380> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
you could turn it to adjust the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.990 
you could turn it to adjust the
amplification<00:02:02.890> level<00:02:03.610> from<00:02:04.510> low<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:05.230> high<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
amplification level from low to high the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.820 
amplification level from low to high the
power<00:02:07.210> switch<00:02:07.420> right<00:02:07.810> over<00:02:08.020> here<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.410> turn<00:02:08.619> on

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
power switch right over here to turn on

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:17.000 
power switch right over here to turn on
and<00:02:08.980> off<00:02:09.040> and<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.970> fine<00:02:10.360> antenna<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:13.120> again

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:26.720 

plugging<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.250> coax<00:02:18.640> cable<00:02:23.820> into<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:25.030> antenna

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
plugging the coax cable into the antenna

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:37.650 
plugging the coax cable into the antenna
the<00:02:27.730> rear<00:02:27.940> antenna<00:02:34.500> plug<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.770> coax<00:02:36.640> into<00:02:37.540> the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
the rear antenna plug this coax into the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:51.510 
the rear antenna plug this coax into the
back<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.110> television

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.930 

next<00:02:52.330> we<00:02:53.200> plug<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.740> AC<00:02:53.890> adapter<00:02:56.130> into<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.490> TV

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
next we plug the AC adapter into the TV

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:08.210 
next we plug the AC adapter into the TV
antenna<00:03:03.540> hand<00:03:04.540> into<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:04.960> parse<00:03:05.230> tree<00:03:05.440> for

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.170 

best<00:03:09.220> reception<00:03:10.170> what<00:03:11.170> we'll<00:03:11.320> do<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.620> raise

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
best reception what we'll do is raise

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:21.780 
best reception what we'll do is raise
listen<00:03:16.530> back<00:03:17.530> which<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:19.090> not<00:03:19.300> very<00:03:19.570> long<00:03:20.790> looks

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
listen back which is not very long looks

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.310 
listen back which is not very long looks
like<00:03:22.290> maybe<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.470> feed<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:23.710> half<00:03:23.980> or<00:03:24.160> so
