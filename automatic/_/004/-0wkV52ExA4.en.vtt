 in this video I bring you one of what 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.510
 they gave me on my birthday 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.330
 was the voice that was a birthday on 9 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.640
 May and this is also I have a show of 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.470
 some things that sent me from Sami 3 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.599
 point like so let's start with 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.670
 the Sami things back because they are more 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.910
 little and if you want to see my blog 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.579
 birthday I leave the links here better 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.040
 here because here I get tapas here you can 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.590
 click on the 9th and the 10th of May 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.180
 that I celebrated it two days one with my 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.010
 husband and he studies it with my family like this 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.200
 if you want to see the blogs click 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.500
 here or if not also I leave the link 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.120
 Abajito in the description box 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.290
 good to tell what I'm going to start 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.450
 with this blouse that is white sleeve 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.299
 long and it's kind of a bit tight in the 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.250
 waist and then a little more loose 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.040
 coming as more to the chain a 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.790
 little more loose and I really like here 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.290
 neck that has makes me very father 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.970
 those lights that you can use either in 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.980
 winter or in summer because it's not very 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.800
 thick nor is it too skinny 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.410
 but if it is very little transparent like that 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.480
 I like that I almost did not like it but 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.510
 I do not know if I can put it as with a 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.060
 bottom down or a strapless blouse 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.800
 white so that it does not look like everything 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.810
 transparent the next thing that I 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.410
 they sent that I loved a lot is this 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.820
 blouse of fabric and as you can see they are 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:46.840
 beautiful are such large flowers and it is a 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.700
 light so loose the truth a little big 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.400
 I'm pretty big 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.650
 especially here in front is from 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.900
 those things that are loose as well as 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.700
 big 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.190
 and this I think was a measure they did not have 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.290
 as a medium size or anything like that girl 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.280
 It was just a measure but I like that 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.770
 bring a little downstairs then where is 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.840
 transparent is up here I fancy 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.210
 put on the set to follow a side 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.850
 that is like a color so strong 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.060
 striking something like more 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.250
 as more playful not so serious or also 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.570
 its advantage to put me the top of the suit 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.330
 of bathroom that is made that would look 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.370
 much cuter would make them cooler and 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.110
 perfect for summer and the last thing 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.950
 they sent me from this micro it was this 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.660
 watch that is very beautiful I loved it already 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.180
 I wanted a watch as well as 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.100
 gold color and this is in black 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.110
 then these colors I do that 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.790
 They go very well because they combine with everything and 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.160
 because if you have that and piedritas 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.930
 around and it makes me very very cute and 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.690
 What I liked most is that I have the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.000
 very thin doll then many 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.300
 bracelets and watches are too much 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.360
 large and this is the measure just 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.760
 perfect if you have dolls and small 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.650
 as I recommend it a lot and can 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.380
 see when the little boy closes like this 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.320
 it is so that if it was barely left to 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.470
 me to my doll good now let's go to the 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.130
 birthday hubble and I received this bag 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.320
 You see I loved being pretty and 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.200
 they fit a lot of space and now 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.460
 they condemn liking these beige colors and 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.010
 Golden 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.780
 it's like that I just wanted what 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.390
 hit and so I like it more because 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.280
 it has is here as pompom looks like this 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.640
 as well I do not know how well feminine well 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.220
 so well chic the following was this 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.260
 portfolio and I also needed a 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.670
 portfolio so in everything that I 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.710
 They gave him a shot because they arrive 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.930
 things that I wanted or needed 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.450
 then I needed a portfolio and color 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.760
 black I liked it as very simple but 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.850
 elegant at the same time perfect fit you 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.880
 many things and the skin is fine 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.220
 soft as they can attract for many 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.140
 cards and I have many cards like that 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.360
 like from stores like from bolt and it gets and 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.450
 all that then I always like 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.490
 load them and here to put money already 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.290
 they know a portfolio like it is but yes I 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.150
 loved loved I loved what 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.370
 next they gave me and I bring it 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.140
 put and it is this chain of a 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.060
 little heart that is very beautiful is 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.010
 does as well tender and did not have 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.870
 hearts as well as open had 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.200
 heart of closed but not open like that 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.290
 that the next thing was this scarf 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.690
 is very nice the color is black 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.510
 but it has these little strands as green or 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.110
 golden I do not know what color they are but you see 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.300
 beautiful beautiful as well as when you 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.210
 paste the light can be seen as 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.010
 completely green or gold or black 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.900
 then it's really smooth it's looking 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.220
 I loved too much in these scarves 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.500
 that are called an ending and that only 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.180
 makes a circle then it has several 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.560
 ways in which you can put it the 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.160
 next to see they won were 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.740
 accessories nice and cute like 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.200
 these earrings here in silver color 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.030
 They are beautiful I like them because they do not 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.950
 they are heavy they are in gambling dens so 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.880
 they will not hurt me in the ear what 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.940
 Next is this silver bracelet 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.040
 also like with pearls it comes beautiful 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.860
 I had never seen a bracelet like that 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.080
 like it because it also fits tight 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.090
 my wrist is not too big nor 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.920
 It makes a lot of noise and nothing is 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.140
 heavy is considered heavy but not 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.170
 is very light and the last of 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.240
 accessories is this other bracelet when 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.580
 I saw it I thought it was a necklace but it was not 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.289
 it's bracelet I had hope as of 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.539
 that the chain was here and 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.740

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:42.360

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:42.449
 soft little thing is not strong so it 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:45.299
 I highly recommend them and it also came 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.819
 with this bag if you bought a 

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:50.099
 perfume they give you a bag and I chose 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:52.349
 this bag because as I tell you we had 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:55.379
 you want a bag to sybase and also what 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.749
 what I liked is that this way against the sun 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:59.909
 see as another color as golden as 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:02.189
 Champagne color more well and that 's because 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:04.889
 It has hilitos as well as metallic as 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:07.469
