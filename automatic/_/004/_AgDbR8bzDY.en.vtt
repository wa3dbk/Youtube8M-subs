hi<00:00:01.079> I'm<00:00:01.439> Johanna<00:00:01.770> and<00:00:02.040> I'm<00:00:02.370> Steeve<00:00:02.700> and<00:00:03.120> this

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hi I'm Johanna and I'm Steeve and this

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.050 
hi I'm Johanna and I'm Steeve and this
is<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.470> test<00:00:04.740> tube<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:05.040> liquid<00:00:05.279> nitrogen<00:00:05.580> and

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
is the test tube of liquid nitrogen and

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.810 
is the test tube of liquid nitrogen and
this<00:00:06.470> is<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.529> test<00:00:07.919> tube<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.130> liquid<00:00:08.309> oxygen

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
this is a test tube of liquid oxygen

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.060 
this is a test tube of liquid oxygen
let's<00:00:09.690> see<00:00:09.840> what<00:00:09.990> happens<00:00:10.380> when<00:00:10.559> we<00:00:10.679> pour<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
let's see what happens when we pour the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.950 
let's see what happens when we pour the
liquids<00:00:11.429> past<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.969> poles<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.660> strong

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
liquids past the poles of a strong

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.310 
liquids past the poles of a strong
magnet<00:00:13.440> okay

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
magnet okay

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.019 
magnet okay
now<00:00:16.320> liquid<00:00:16.560> nitrogen<00:00:17.039> isn't<00:00:17.609> normally

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
now liquid nitrogen isn't normally

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.939 
now liquid nitrogen isn't normally
magnetic<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:19.050> each<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> nitrogen

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
magnetic but each of the nitrogen

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.189 
magnetic but each of the nitrogen
molecules<00:00:19.980> acts<00:00:20.730> like<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> tiny<00:00:21.480> magnet<00:00:21.779> when

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
molecules acts like a tiny magnet when

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.650 
molecules acts like a tiny magnet when
it's<00:00:22.350> exposed<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.100> magnetic<00:00:23.250> field<00:00:23.820> this

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it's exposed to a magnetic field this

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.320 
it's exposed to a magnetic field this
effect<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.199> known<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.410> diamagnetism<00:00:26.340> that's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
effect is known as diamagnetism that's

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.060 
effect is known as diamagnetism that's
just<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.660> fancy<00:00:27.900> way<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> saying<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.859> each<00:00:29.039> of

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
just a fancy way of saying that each of

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640 
just a fancy way of saying that each of
the<00:00:29.310> nitrogen<00:00:29.640> molecules<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.599> repelled<00:00:31.349> by

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the nitrogen molecules is repelled by

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.100 
the nitrogen molecules is repelled by
the<00:00:31.710> magnets<00:00:32.189> magnetic<00:00:32.669> field<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.540> when<00:00:34.020> I

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the magnets magnetic field so when I

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.690 
the magnets magnetic field so when I
pour<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.500> liquid<00:00:34.620> nitrogen<00:00:34.920> past<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
pour the liquid nitrogen past the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.889 
pour the liquid nitrogen past the
magnets<00:00:36.090> poles<00:00:38.149> it<00:00:39.149> doesn't<00:00:39.540> look<00:00:39.719> like

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
magnets poles it doesn't look like

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.319 
magnets poles it doesn't look like
anything<00:00:40.290> special<00:00:40.320> happens<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.820> nitrogen

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
anything special happens the nitrogen

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.290 
anything special happens the nitrogen
just<00:00:42.570> falls<00:00:42.809> past<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.379> magnet<00:00:44.300> that's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
just falls past the magnet that's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
just falls past the magnet that's
because<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> diamagnetic<00:00:46.440> effect<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:47.190> very

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
because the diamagnetic effect is very

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.529 
because the diamagnetic effect is very
weak<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:48.899> normally<00:00:49.050> observe<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:50.539> all

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
weak so we don't normally observe it all

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.910 
weak so we don't normally observe it all
materials<00:00:52.230> are<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:52.440> least<00:00:52.590> slightly

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
materials are at least slightly

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.700 
materials are at least slightly
diamagnetic<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:54.539> because<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> effect<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.559> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
diamagnetic but because the effect is so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.660 
diamagnetic but because the effect is so
tiny<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.699> don't<00:00:56.969> normally<00:00:57.390> notice<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.899> just

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.789 

like<00:01:02.670> nitrogen<00:01:03.059> oxygen<00:01:03.480> isn't<00:01:04.290> normally

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
like nitrogen oxygen isn't normally

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.920 
like nitrogen oxygen isn't normally
magnetic<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.570> nitrogen

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
magnetic and it's just like nitrogen

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.289 
magnetic and it's just like nitrogen
each<00:01:07.530> molecule<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.189> oxygen<00:01:08.340> behaves<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
each molecule of oxygen behaves like a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.060 
each molecule of oxygen behaves like a
tiny<00:01:09.659> magnet<00:01:09.960> when<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.500> exposed<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
tiny magnet when it's exposed to a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.460 
tiny magnet when it's exposed to a
magnet's<00:01:11.430> magnetic<00:01:11.460> field<00:01:12.170> oxygen<00:01:13.170> behaves

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
magnet's magnetic field oxygen behaves

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
magnet's magnetic field oxygen behaves
differently<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.100> nitrogen<00:01:14.520> though<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.450> way

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
differently the nitrogen though the way

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.859 
differently the nitrogen though the way
oxygen<00:01:16.110> behaves<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.590> called<00:01:16.860> para<00:01:17.340> magnetism

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
oxygen behaves is called para magnetism

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.330 
oxygen behaves is called para magnetism
that's<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.020> fancy<00:01:19.290> way<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.530> saying<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.040> each

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that's a fancy way of saying that each

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.460 
that's a fancy way of saying that each
molecule<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.939> oxygen<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.540> attracted<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.439> a

molecule of oxygen is attracted to a

molecule of oxygen is attracted to a
magnet's<00:01:22.890> magnetic<00:01:23.009> field<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.869> when<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.680> pour

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
magnet's magnetic field so when I pour

the liquid oxygen between the poles of
the<00:01:27.900> magnet<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:30.750> sticks<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.869> we<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.320> even

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the magnet it sticks and we can even

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.020 
the magnet it sticks and we can even
make<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:34.979> bridge<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.729> liquid

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
make a little bridge out of liquid

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.630 
make a little bridge out of liquid
oxygen<00:01:36.320> that'll<00:01:37.320> stay<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:37.950> until<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
oxygen that'll stay there until the
