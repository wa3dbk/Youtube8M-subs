hi<00:00:06.660> this<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.960> made<00:00:07.260> of<00:00:07.380> content<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:07.920> this<00:00:08.010> is

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.190 
hi this is made of content and this is

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.630 
hi this is made of content and this is
my<00:00:08.370> radiographic<00:00:09.090> position

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:10.640 
my radiographic position

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.390 
my radiographic position
1:22<00:00:11.330> this<00:00:11.630> will<00:00:11.780> be<00:00:11.900> the<00:00:12.170> thoracic<00:00:12.710> and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
1:22 this will be the thoracic and

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.330 
1:22 this will be the thoracic and
a<00:00:14.429> dog<00:00:14.839> we're<00:00:15.839> going<00:00:15.959> to<00:00:16.049> start<00:00:16.320> by<00:00:16.590> measuring

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
a dog we're going to start by measuring

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.070 
a dog we're going to start by measuring
the<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:19.110> the<00:00:19.199> VD<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:21.750> we're<00:00:21.930> going<00:00:22.050> to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
the for the VD and we're going to

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.659 
the for the VD and we're going to
measure<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.590> deepest<00:00:22.919> part<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.430> chest

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
measure the deepest part of the chest

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.690 
measure the deepest part of the chest
here<00:00:24.289> and<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.529> determined<00:00:25.950> that<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.250> 25

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
here and we determined that to be 25

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.870 
here and we determined that to be 25
centimeters<00:00:27.329> and<00:00:27.570> then<00:00:28.470> from<00:00:28.710> lateral<00:00:29.009> we're

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
centimeters and then from lateral we're

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.160 
centimeters and then from lateral we're
going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> measure<00:00:32.300> across<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.480> Avenue<00:00:33.809> here

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
going to measure across the Avenue here

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:45.979 
going to measure across the Avenue here
and<00:00:35.930> that's<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.589> be<00:00:40.790> 18<00:00:42.559> all<00:00:43.559> right<00:00:44.989> so

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and that's going to be 18 all right so

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.289 
and that's going to be 18 all right so
we<00:00:46.110> refer<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.559> our<00:00:46.650> technique<00:00:47.070> chart<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:48.299 
we refer to our technique chart for the

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.280 
we refer to our technique chart for the
thoracic<00:00:49.309> 25<00:00:50.360> centimeters<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.479> kvp<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.110> going

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
thoracic 25 centimeters the kvp is going

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.490 
thoracic 25 centimeters the kvp is going
to<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.409> set<00:00:52.589> at<00:00:52.739> 120<00:00:53.369> and<00:00:53.580> 2.5<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.170> I'm<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
to be set at 120 and 2.5 so I'm going to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:06.370 
to be set at 120 and 2.5 so I'm going to
change<00:00:55.769> this<00:00:57.080> the<00:00:58.080> settings<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.619> 120

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.999 
dishonor and our thyroid cover I place
our<00:01:21.350> leg<00:01:21.530> gloves<00:01:21.770> on<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:24.159> position<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.310> dog

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
our leg gloves on and position the dog

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.210 
our leg gloves on and position the dog
all<00:01:28.009> right

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
all right

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:47.550 
all right
should<00:01:28.579> be<00:01:28.759> about

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.320 

we're<00:01:48.560> going<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.800> collimate

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.170

thrust illness and the last rib and that
helps<00:02:00.370> reduce<00:02:00.520> scatter<00:02:00.940> radiation<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.670> would

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
helps reduce scatter radiation and would

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.889 
helps reduce scatter radiation and would
restrain<00:02:09.000> lateral<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.660> what<00:02:10.780> we're

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
restrain lateral is that what we're

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.080 
restrain lateral is that what we're
doing<00:02:10.990> OVD<00:02:11.590> for<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.310> video<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.760> would<00:02:12.910> be

doing OVD for the video this would be
for<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.330> video<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.110> then<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.950> lateral

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
for the video and then for the lateral

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.440 
for the video and then for the lateral
we<00:02:16.540> said<00:02:16.750> latter<00:02:17.050> was<00:02:17.440> 18<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.580> we<00:02:19.090> would<00:02:19.240> change

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
we said latter was 18 so we would change

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.830 
we said latter was 18 so we would change
the<00:02:19.690> settings<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:21.600> technique<00:02:22.600> chart

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
here 18 would be setting the kbps at 80

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:48.740 
here 18 would be setting the kbps at 80
and<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:27.310> MAS<00:02:27.730> at<00:02:27.910> 6.0<00:02:39.090> are<00:02:40.090> settings<00:02:40.450> there
