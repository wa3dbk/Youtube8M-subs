die<00:00:26.250> rise<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.300> anyways<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.050> mainly

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
die rise and but anyways this is mainly

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.710 
die rise and but anyways this is mainly
for<00:00:28.800> season<00:00:29.400> pass<00:00:29.519> holders<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.330> don't

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
for season pass holders I think I don't

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
for season pass holders I think I don't
know<00:00:30.810> anyone<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.529> has<00:00:31.560> got<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.920> Regan<00:00:32.369> Mac

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
know anyone that has got the Regan Mac

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.120 
know anyone that has got the Regan Mac
to<00:00:33.030> without<00:00:33.809> season<00:00:34.260> pass<00:00:34.440> yet<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.010> think

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
to without season pass yet so I think

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.860 
to without season pass yet so I think
this<00:00:35.399> season<00:00:35.579> pass<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.059> required<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.660> at

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
this season pass it is required just at

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.799 
this season pass it is required just at
the<00:00:36.960> moment<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.489> an<00:00:38.610> exclusive

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
the moment as it is like an exclusive

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.080 
the moment as it is like an exclusive
fala<00:00:39.809> season<00:00:40.230> pass<00:00:40.379> holders<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:41.340> once<00:00:41.940> it
