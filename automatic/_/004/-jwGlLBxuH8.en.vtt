00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
a contact based method the idea is the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.590 
a contact based method the idea is the
doctors<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.640> patients<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:36.059> interact<00:00:36.480> with

doctors and patients can interact with

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
doctors and patients can interact with
each<00:00:36.660> other<00:00:36.930> through<00:00:37.340> teleconferencing

each other through teleconferencing

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.569 
each other through teleconferencing
maybe<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.910> skype<00:00:39.469> but<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> big<00:00:40.890> problem<00:00:41.370> here

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
maybe to skype but the big problem here

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.850 
maybe to skype but the big problem here
is<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> doctor<00:00:42.600> perform<00:00:43.079> all<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> tests

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
is can the doctor perform all the tests

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.250 
is can the doctor perform all the tests
that<00:00:43.890> are<00:00:44.100> required<00:00:44.520> over<00:00:45.420> Skype<00:00:45.750> over<00:00:46.110> this

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that are required over Skype over this

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.959 
that are required over Skype over this
mediated<00:00:46.890> medium<00:00:47.280> that's<00:00:47.700> like

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
mediated medium that's like

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.090 
mediated medium that's like
teleconference<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.140> idea<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
teleconference the idea is that the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
teleconference the idea is that the
small<00:00:50.430> intensity<00:00:51.059> changes<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.899> your<00:00:52.230> skin

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
small intensity changes in your skin

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.860 
small intensity changes in your skin
because<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.699> amount<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.090> blood<00:00:54.149> changes

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
because the amount of blood changes

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.650 
because the amount of blood changes
underneath<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.980> skin<00:00:56.190> surface<00:00:56.399> these<00:00:57.329> small

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
underneath the skin surface these small

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.000 
underneath the skin surface these small
intensity<00:00:58.199> changes<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:58.829> actually

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
intensity changes we can actually

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.939 
intensity changes we can actually
reliably<00:00:59.940> measure<00:01:00.359> them<00:01:00.690> using<00:01:01.559> an<00:01:01.680> algorithm

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
reliably measure them using an algorithm

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.280 
reliably measure them using an algorithm
and<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.420> algorithm<00:01:03.420> essentially<00:01:03.809> takes

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and the algorithm essentially takes

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.590 
and the algorithm essentially takes
multiple<00:01:04.920> different<00:01:05.369> pixels<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.330> face

multiple different pixels on your face

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.070 
multiple different pixels on your face
and<00:01:07.460> coherently<00:01:08.460> combines<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.330> signals<00:01:09.720> in

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and coherently combines the signals in

and coherently combines the signals in
these<00:01:10.350> multiple<00:01:10.799> different<00:01:10.950> pixels<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
these multiple different pixels to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.990 
these multiple different pixels to
enhance<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.260> vital<00:01:13.920> sign<00:01:14.100> signature<00:01:14.580> things

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
enhance the vital sign signature things

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
enhance the vital sign signature things
like<00:01:15.270> heart<00:01:15.479> rate<00:01:15.750> heart<00:01:16.170> rate<00:01:16.350> variability

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
doctor would like to know to see whether

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.780 
doctor would like to know to see whether
you<00:01:21.450> are<00:01:21.630> healthy<00:01:22.250> those<00:01:23.250> things<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.670> can

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you are healthy those things we can

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.730 
you are healthy those things we can
directly<00:01:24.180> measure<00:01:24.360> from<00:01:24.750> nothing<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.530> your

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
directly measure from nothing but your

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
directly measure from nothing but your

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
laptop is that one could easily design

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.889 
laptop is that one could easily design
applications<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:40.970> which<00:01:41.970> user<00:01:42.299> permission

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
applications which which user permission

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.859 
applications which which user permission
could<00:01:43.409> take<00:01:44.060> readings<00:01:45.060> throughout<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.720> day

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
could take readings throughout the day

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.880 
could take readings throughout the day
so<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> certain<00:01:48.180> conditions

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
so that if you have a certain conditions

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.950 
so that if you have a certain conditions
let's<00:01:49.890> say<00:01:49.950> high<00:01:50.100> blood<00:01:50.310> pressure

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
let's say high blood pressure

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.530 
let's say high blood pressure
hypertension<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.909> constant<00:01:53.909> monitoring<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
hypertension a constant monitoring is

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.510 
hypertension a constant monitoring is
highly<00:01:55.320> recommended<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.070> those<00:01:56.250> conditions

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
highly recommended in those conditions

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.980 
highly recommended in those conditions
so<00:01:57.270> however<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.850> not<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.689> it's

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so however it's it's a it's not you it's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.359 
so however it's it's a it's not you it's
not<00:02:01.110> easy<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.560> patients<00:02:01.920> who<00:02:01.950> actually<00:02:02.130> use

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
not easy for patients who actually use

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.190 
not easy for patients who actually use
current<00:02:02.790> devices<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.780> case<00:02:03.960> there

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
current devices so in this case there

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.620 
current devices so in this case there
could<00:02:04.229> be<00:02:04.530> working<00:02:04.829> throughout<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.430> day<00:02:05.630> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
could be working throughout the day and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.199 
could be working throughout the day and
their<00:02:06.930> devices<00:02:07.290> could<00:02:07.590> actually<00:02:07.970> get<00:02:08.970> their

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
their devices could actually get their

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.650 
their devices could actually get their
vital<00:02:09.599> signs<00:02:11.239> regularly<00:02:12.239> priority

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
vital signs regularly priority

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.580 
vital signs regularly priority
throughout<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.170> day<00:02:13.290> mult
