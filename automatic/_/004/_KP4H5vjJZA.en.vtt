00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.889
 moss is normal, it 's just alexandre salts and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.420
 this is the pilot channel in 2010 we 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.220
 we created a project a place where 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.350
 aviators and aviation students 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.630
 entertainment and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.449
 details on aeronautical training and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 people content and to see two and so 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.610
 the pilot channel was born, surrounded by good 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 people they will help whenever 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.489
 can and you will have the pleasure of doing the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.170
 even when they need it 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.809
 then, ladies and gentlemen, we will 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.050
 importance of friendship and what 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.719
 indicates in the universe of aviation 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.789
 It feels like there's history. 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.100
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.850
 understand that this is where the universe of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.070
 Aviation is a large village from the Keys in the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.320
 sense that it is a small and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.439
 that everyone knows everyone is 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.309
 directly or through 12 contacts 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.320
 distance 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.409
 therefore the most important things that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.409
 have you focused your first step on the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.320
 theoretical course is to build your character 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.509
 your image of your circle of friends and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.759
 I say from the theoretical course already because 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.580
 every pilot who is influential today has a 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.390
 career also began with the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.400
 beginning 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.400
 for example imagine a student who did 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.380
 friendship with your flight instructors 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.180
 the time went by they evolved 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.119
 were several different locations but 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.680
 always keeping in touch until certain 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.869
 The day he wants a flight instructor 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.960
 comments that he lost his job is already 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.689
 for a month without flying then the one who already 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.030
 was one day he comments that although he did not 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.220
 There's a car there to indicate he knows. 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.439
 the friend who knows the entrepreneur who 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.689
 is looking for a pilot with the same 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.479
 that this individual has a 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.960
 least experienced pilot helping the most 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.820
 experienced as the world goes round is not 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.030
 It is important to mention that the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.330
 in this case the person making friends that a 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.080
 Maybe that day maybe turn around. 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.240
 who listened to 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.420
 because believe the person who starts a 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.670
 friendship already thinking about an indication is so 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.360
 as a 2-year-old child in 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.430
 a crystal store and now we have the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.250
 turnaround in this matter because in a 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.960
 universe as closed as aviation to 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.530
 thing you have to avoid to the maximum 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.390
 are enemies because in this scenario the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.760
 Only thing as strong as gratitude. 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.330
 of a friendship is the grudge of a 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.520
 enmity and yes this word exists of 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.700
 in the dictionary and speaking from this side 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.710
 negative I do not feel the term anger hate 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.660
 and no rancor because the environment 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.430
 like this 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.950
 this other person will not go out talking 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.350
 ill off you the site winds but she will 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.810
 do something as harmful as what 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.209
 Stop talking about yourself. 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.430
 citing again a famous example that 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.440
 the chief pilot of a company is 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.930
 helping the administrator to filter 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.730
 some candidates for a future 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.750
 interview that among the several 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.730
 files 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.590
 he sees two pilots he has already met 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.900
 previous jobs with the same 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.780
 portfolios and experience 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.940
 one is a standard pilot and the other is say 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.620
 not the most skeptical 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.030
 therefore this chief pilot who has the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.790
 power to advise that he 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.800
 administrator, he could speak every 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.690
 negative points of that other pilot 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.519
 so he did not go there in that selection 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.739
 but instead they simply 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.040
 points to that other pilot's 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.989
 standard pilot and talk I know he's a 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.760
 good professional point 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.980
 so see that it was not necessary 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.769
 speak badly of the other colleague he did not come down 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.019
 at his level but only because of 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.180
 he has issued a recommendation and has 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.780
 quoted the recommendation that was 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.570
 deserving of it already was the difference 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.790
 then the moral of today's fable is whether 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.010
 surrounded by good people they will help 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.430
 whenever they can and you will have the pleasure 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.160
 to do the same when they need it 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.640
 and you, what stories of helping friends 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.620
 Friends, have you ever attended or participated? 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.400
 I have my stories but through 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.890
 of the comments I want to know yours and how 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.850
 always read the book the plane and never 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.560
 forget about having more agile 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.560
 here 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.460
 The pilot channel is part of the 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.120
 network with the largest publisher and 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.120
 brazil aviation
