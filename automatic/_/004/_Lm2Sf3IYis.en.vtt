00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.379
 Unfortunately, then say the hardest 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:48.640

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.470

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.980

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.790

 how should he follow the race if you 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.950
 would not drive so slowly 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.570
 Yes 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.570
 Bye I've been there before 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.400

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:25.240
 Yeah, just stop that shit 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:32.520
 here so 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:35.440
 good ok fourth please second complaint 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:42.580
 the drive so bidding or 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:50.770
 I am the second sled 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:52.270
 yes the first well if you take the first 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.740
 is and they do not push around anymore 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.720
 can 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.860
 then it is actually when you enter 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.100
 makes a few mistakes 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.100
 Yes 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.670
 I can drive so well 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.079
 I know that's exactly where I think I am 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.890
 there is no one who does not run 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.890
 could win 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.880
 that was her already from the race that was 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:29.710
 not really a minute 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.720
 I've been a minute and 20 for a while 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:37.690
 5 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.540
 well the federal won and already 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.670
 past 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.850
 he was really hard like next 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.880
 coming 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.370
 then I believe bullshit missions 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.870
 there are a few more sweet and then 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.910
 we would have here in lausanne tus 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.220
 already done the mission and then 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:03.540
 it's going to be the bethlehem beggar in 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.370
 the beds in power will be fine 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.370
