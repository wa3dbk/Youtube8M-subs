 let's put the meat 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.280

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.260

 here and here I have 4 liters and a half but 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.700
 It all depends on how much you are going to 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.140
 do we are going to add the meat 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.390
 Florence is already washed 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.580
 We are going to add the meat and I'm going to 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.250
 add onion and garlic I do not know if they are 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:43.510
 I commented I do not think 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.510
 I 'm going to add garlic onion and salt 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.340
 we're going to let her go and try to go 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.340
 the thing 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.210
 medium heat until I'm well 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.210
 Cooked 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.540
 we're going to cover it, I 'm going to add the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.600
 onion and garlic and salt 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.550
 come to taste remember 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.710
 and let it boil 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:21.440
 it's fine I already have the chopped vegetables 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.450
 pumpkin this chayote and carrot 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.900
 so the pique more or less there are people who 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.210
 the chopped more in four pieces or in two 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.230

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.270
 the corn and cabbage might also be 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.069
 add if they like in the lot goes 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.010
 when the car is already a little more 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.670
 known because this one is harder than 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.670
 all these 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.400
 already after an hour and a half 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.940
 depending on how much meat they have 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.720
 I'm going to put the vegetables these 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.460
 nothing else this is ok 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.460
 be careful because splashes 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.810
 and we are going to move it 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.730
 we are going to move it and we are going to leave it here 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.120
 for about 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.950
 when it will be 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.890
 about 30 about 20 to 25 minutes after you 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.670

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.879
 vegetables on time 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.379

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.450
 two tablespoons and that's how it goes and 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.370
 also the lack of coriander 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.590
 you like you can put more broth 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.350

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.510
