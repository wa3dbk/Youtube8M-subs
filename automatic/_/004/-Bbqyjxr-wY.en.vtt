00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:31.839 
rural trout I'd say if you're making a

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.380 
rural trout I'd say if you're making a
profit<00:06:32.139> 15<00:06:32.800> to<00:06:32.919> 20<00:06:33.219> k<00:06:33.370> an<00:06:33.520> hour

last part of the guy that I want to talk
about<00:07:06.400> briefly<00:07:07.210> is<00:07:07.480> um<00:07:08.050> flip<00:07:09.040> merging<00:07:09.520> um<00:07:09.730> a

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
about briefly is um flip merging um a

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.380 
about briefly is um flip merging um a
lot<00:07:11.260> of<00:07:11.440> people<00:07:11.770> think<00:07:12.430> that<00:07:12.580> it's<00:07:12.880> harder

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
lot of people think that it's harder

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.670 
lot of people think that it's harder
than<00:07:13.600> it<00:07:13.990> really<00:07:14.350> is<00:07:14.530> on<00:07:15.070> free<00:07:15.640> to<00:07:15.760> play<00:07:15.880> arm

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
than it really is on free to play arm

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.810 
than it really is on free to play arm
I'm<00:07:17.680> not<00:07:17.920> going<00:07:18.100> to<00:07:18.160> go<00:07:18.250> into<00:07:18.370> too<00:07:18.610> much<00:07:18.640> detail

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
I'm not going to go into too much detail

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.450 
I'm not going to go into too much detail
about<00:07:19.210> it<00:07:19.390> because<00:07:19.980> I'm<00:07:20.980> probably<00:07:21.130> going<00:07:21.370> to

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
about it because I'm probably going to

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.570 
about it because I'm probably going to
just<00:07:21.640> end<00:07:21.790> up<00:07:21.880> making<00:07:22.120> a<00:07:22.180> video<00:07:22.360> on<00:07:22.690> it<00:07:22.840> but

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
just end up making a video on it but

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.560 
just end up making a video on it but
pretty<00:07:24.580> much<00:07:24.640> I<00:07:25.210> find<00:07:26.050> it<00:07:26.200> easiest<00:07:26.560> to<00:07:27.570> flip

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.570 
pretty much I find it easiest to flip

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.260 
pretty much I find it easiest to flip
