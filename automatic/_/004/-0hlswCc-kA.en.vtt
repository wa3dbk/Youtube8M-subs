I'm mixing it all my dry ingredients and
I'm<00:00:50.489> mixing<00:00:50.700> my<00:00:51.059> egg<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.629> my<00:00:51.840> milk<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:54.320> I'll

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
I'm mixing my egg with my milk and I'll

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.680 
I'm mixing my egg with my milk and I'll
be<00:00:55.500> stirring<00:00:55.829> both<00:00:57.469> combinations<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:02.690> then

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
putting them together to make them a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:31.890 
putting them together to make them a
batter

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.100 

all<00:01:32.900> right<00:01:37.240> now<00:01:38.240> just<00:01:38.510> because<00:01:38.750> I'm<00:01:38.870> pretty

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
all right now just because I'm pretty

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.990 
all right now just because I'm pretty
picky<00:01:39.380> about<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.890> way<00:01:40.010> my<00:01:40.220> batter<00:01:40.490> is<00:01:40.790> I<00:01:40.940> think

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
picky about the way my batter is I think

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.590 
picky about the way my batter is I think
what<00:01:41.390> I'm<00:01:41.479> going<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.810> do<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:43.270> put<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.390> in

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
what I'm going to do is put this in

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.020 
what I'm going to do is put this in
slowly<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.890> make<00:01:45.920> sure<00:01:46.370> that<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:46.760> haven't

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
slowly to make sure that I haven't

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.660 
slowly to make sure that I haven't
gotten<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.540> too<00:01:47.750> thin<00:01:51.490> depending<00:01:52.490> on<00:01:52.550> your

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
gotten it too thin depending on your

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.580 
gotten it too thin depending on your
temperature<00:01:53.060> your<00:01:53.540> altitude

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
temperature your altitude

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.010 
temperature your altitude
how<00:01:55.009> much<00:01:55.160> humidity<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.759> in<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:55.970> air<00:01:56.180> it

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
how much humidity is in the air it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.160 
how much humidity is in the air it
really<00:01:57.440> does<00:01:57.680> change<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.720> texture<00:01:59.720> of<00:01:59.960> your

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
really does change the texture of your

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:11.450 
really does change the texture of your
batter

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.130 

this<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.210> coach<00:02:12.420> it's<00:02:12.570> going<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.780> take<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.110> a
