the top which is suspended with the
ratchet<00:01:20.900> strap<00:01:21.250> it<00:01:22.250> may<00:01:22.430> work<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:23.150> may<00:01:23.210> not<00:01:23.530> but

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
ratchet strap it may work it may not but

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.620 
ratchet strap it may work it may not but
the<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.550> big<00:01:25.729> tires<00:01:26.000> on<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.360> look<00:01:27.910> like<00:01:28.910> they

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the the big tires on it look like they

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.760 
the the big tires on it look like they
was<00:01:29.869> doing<00:01:30.170> in<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.290> summer<00:01:32.290> anyway<00:01:33.290> let's

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
was doing in the summer anyway let's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:02:18.390 
was doing in the summer anyway let's
give<00:01:33.979> this<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.160> shot

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:53.790 

a<00:02:18.430> little<00:02:19.030> higher<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.450> front<00:02:19.599> will<00:02:19.930> do

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.020 

so<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:54.890> was<00:02:54.980> decided<00:02:55.520> it<00:02:55.610> would<00:02:55.730> be<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.850> good

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
so it was decided it would be a good

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.120 
so it was decided it would be a good
time<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.330> take<00:02:56.600> this<00:02:56.810> hard<00:02:57.110> top<00:02:57.440> off<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.830> Jeep

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
time to take this hard top off the Jeep

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.130 
time to take this hard top off the Jeep
if<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.490> thought<00:02:58.700> it'd<00:02:58.850> be<00:02:58.880> cool<00:02:59.210> just<00:02:59.990> a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
if you thought it'd be cool just a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.620 
if you thought it'd be cool just a
ratchet<00:03:00.590> strap<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.340> ceiling<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.510> then

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
ratchet strap it to the ceiling and then

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.900 
ratchet strap it to the ceiling and then
drive<00:03:02.900> away<00:03:03.200> which<00:03:03.950> really<00:03:04.280> worked<00:03:04.490> well<00:03:04.700> but

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
drive away which really worked well but

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.250 
drive away which really worked well but
now<00:03:05.060> it's<00:03:05.240> gonna<00:03:05.360> figure<00:03:05.600> out<00:03:05.720> how<00:03:05.960> to<00:03:06.020> get<00:03:06.170> it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
now it's gonna figure out how to get it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.250 
now it's gonna figure out how to get it
down<00:03:06.500> from<00:03:07.280> said<00:03:07.610> ceiling<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:10.610> into<00:03:11.570> storage

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
down from said ceiling and into storage

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.590 
down from said ceiling and into storage
you<00:03:13.220> missed<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:13.580> first<00:03:13.790> few<00:03:14.150> really<00:03:14.360> good

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
you missed the first few really good

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.570 
you missed the first few really good
ones<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.230> thought<00:03:15.530> I'd<00:03:15.650> catch<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.100> rest<00:03:16.340> on

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
ones so I thought I'd catch the rest on

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:54.760 
ones so I thought I'd catch the rest on
the<00:03:16.790> video<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.590> proof

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:08.880 

they're<00:03:55.310> gonna<00:03:55.490> do<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> good<00:03:55.910> one<00:03:56.120> this<00:03:56.240> time
