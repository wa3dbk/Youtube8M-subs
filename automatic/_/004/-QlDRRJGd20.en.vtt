far looking at the second lot that was

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.420 
far looking at the second lot that was
maybe<00:02:24.480> waiting<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.350> kiss<00:02:25.560> stall<00:02:25.830> finishing

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
maybe waiting and kiss stall finishing

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.790 
maybe waiting and kiss stall finishing
together<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.030> she<00:02:27.960> looked<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.440> million

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
together and she looked a million

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.620 
together and she looked a million
dollars<00:02:29.070> maybe<00:02:29.340> she<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:30.120> did<00:02:30.150> take<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
dollars maybe she really did take the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.120 
dollars maybe she really did take the
eye<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:30.990> particular<00:02:31.800> piece<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:31.980> work

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130

eye on that particular piece of work
yeah<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.760> think<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.209> Joseph<00:02:33.660> was<00:02:33.750> happy<00:02:34.020> as<00:02:34.170> well

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.110 
yeah I think so Joseph was happy as well
so<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.390> think<00:02:37.340> Ryan<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.550> well<00:02:38.700> was<00:02:38.880> happy

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
so that I think Ryan as well was happy

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.840 
so that I think Ryan as well was happy
and<00:02:39.270> we're<00:02:39.630> waiting<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.110> Pat<00:02:40.800> was<00:02:41.280> happy<00:02:41.580> okay

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
you think she's improved a great deal

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.130 
you think she's improved a great deal
from<00:02:47.730> two<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.120> three<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.360> she<00:02:48.630> was<00:02:48.780> pretty

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
from two to three and she was pretty

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.520 
from two to three and she was pretty
awesome<00:02:49.290> up<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.450> maybe<00:02:51.450> yeah<00:02:52.080> listen

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
awesome up to and maybe yeah listen

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.220 
awesome up to and maybe yeah listen
she's<00:02:52.709> done<00:02:52.950> very<00:02:52.980> well<00:02:53.310> physically<00:02:54.230> but

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
she's done very well physically but

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.460 
she's done very well physically but
obviously<00:02:56.780> it'll<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.870> interesting<00:02:58.110> when<00:02:58.350> she

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
obviously it'll be interesting when she

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.550 
obviously it'll be interesting when she
comes<00:02:58.620> home<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:58.860> where<00:02:59.700> she<00:02:59.910> wherever<00:03:00.239> we

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
comes home and where she wherever we

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.750 
comes home and where she wherever we
decide<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.680> run<00:03:01.770> race<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.160> was<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.550> how<00:03:02.700> much

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
decide to run race it was and how much

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.310 
decide to run race it was and how much
she<00:03:02.910> improves<00:03:03.300> on<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.750> but<00:03:03.870> she<00:03:03.989> seems<00:03:04.200> to

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
she improves on to that but she seems to

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.930 
she improves on to that but she seems to
be<00:03:04.410> fine<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.680> they<00:03:05.130> could<00:03:05.370> be<00:03:05.459> happy<00:03:05.640> with<00:03:05.850> her

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
be fine and they could be happy with her

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.880 
be fine and they could be happy with her
she's<00:03:06.180> at<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> moment<00:03:06.750> here's<00:03:06.900> would<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:07.800> be

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
she's at the moment here's would you be

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.640 
she's at the moment here's would you be
thinking<00:03:08.070> more<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:08.550> terms<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:09.330> here<00:03:10.140> rather

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
thinking more in terms of here rather

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.280 
thinking more in terms of here rather
than<00:03:10.860> new<00:03:11.010> market<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.550> her<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.110> guineas<00:03:13.110> was

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
than new market for her the guineas was

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.440 
than new market for her the guineas was
and<00:03:13.770> it's<00:03:14.130> nervously<00:03:14.550> new<00:03:14.820> market<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.239> the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
and it's nervously new market is the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.600 
and it's nervously new market is the
first<00:03:16.290> possibility<00:03:16.769> for<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.280> mall<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
first possibility for the mall and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.580 
first possibility for the mall and
obviously<00:03:18.000> it's<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.360> before<00:03:19.019> here<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.470> know

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
obviously it's it's before here you know

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.680 
obviously it's it's before here you know
but<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:20.010> think<00:03:20.700> all<00:03:20.940> those<00:03:21.090> options<00:03:21.299> are<00:03:21.540> open

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
but I think all those options are open

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.240 
but I think all those options are open
to<00:03:21.959> them<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.140> like<00:03:22.440> obviously<00:03:22.590> we'll<00:03:23.010> see<00:03:23.160> how

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
to them and like obviously we'll see how
