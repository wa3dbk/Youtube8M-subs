00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.560
Hello, I'm here to talk about
Motorway Safety.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.400
Recently I saw a video on another
Deaf Group - Deaf Opinions,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.840
talking about what happens
if you break down

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.640
and I thought we need more
information, so here it is.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.820
First, let's talk about the
hard shoulder

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.740
you know, the lane on the left
of the motorway for emergencies

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.700
It's not a safe place and you need
to know it can be dangerous;

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.140
that's why you only stop there
in an emergency.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.620
You're not allowed to stop there for
food, drink or to check your route;

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.420
You're not allowed to stop
to use your phone;

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.800
You only stop for emergencies
like if you break down or are ill.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.620
If your car is not going well,
think before and get off the motorway.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.220
If you stop in emergency and
want to contact recovery,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.040
possibly you are a member,
for example, the AA or RAC

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.640
you can text them. Members
will know the text number;

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.820
but if you have no signal or
you don't know the number

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.140
on the motorway they have
SOS telephones like this:

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:35.895
[Emergency Roadside Telephone]

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.940
Deaf people can use the
SOS Emergency Phone

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.260
in two different ways;

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.460
First, if you use a hearing aid
switch to the T position

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.080
it will link to it and work fine.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.980
The motorway is a noisy place
so switch to the T position.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.500
If profoundly deaf and you can't
use a voice phone

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.120
then pick up the handset
and wait ...

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.820
the Controller can change
to text

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.840
[Text Display at top]

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.220
This means you can read
the text

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.060
The first question is:
"Do you understand English?"

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.120
You reply 'Yes' or 'No' by
using the tick or cross buttons;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.060
Tick means YES,
Cross means NO

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.120
They ask: "Do you understand English?"
You reply, "Yes".

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.760
Next question: broken down?
"Yes" ... and so on.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.040
They're all Yes/No questions.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.520
If you answer the first question:
'Do you understand English?'

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.420
you reply "No", then it will
ask you in French!

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.780
So it's important you think:
'understand English?', "Yes".

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.600
Other languages are French,
Spanish, Italian and Welsh

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.160
The phones work fine
for Deaf people

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.500
If you break down, they will know
your location from the number.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.820
Maybe you wonder where is the
nearest SOS phone?

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:43.620
On the motorway, there are posts
every 100 metres, like this:

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.760
[Motorway Marker Post - see the phone?]

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.940
The picture of the phone and arrow
points to nearest phone.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.780
Never cross the motorway.
Always stay on the same side.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.060
It's important to think about
your safety on the motorway.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.680
If you break down, get out of
your vehicle on the left

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.500
If there is a barrier, it's safer
to wait over the barrier

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.540
Any questions, please ask
below and we'll reply.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.720
For now, thank you.
