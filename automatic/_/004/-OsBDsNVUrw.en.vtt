00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
only have the contours on course we can

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.730 
only have the contours on course we can
change<00:01:35.570> all<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.110> right<00:01:36.170> here<00:01:36.530> in<00:01:36.650> the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
change all that right here in the

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.360 
explorer and take a look at our civil
model<00:01:59.550> we'll<00:02:00.550> expand<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.660> file<00:02:01.870> name<00:02:02.370> and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
model we'll expand the file name and

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.330 
model we'll expand the file name and
expand<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:04.030> Reyn<00:02:04.210> models<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.950> can<00:02:06.130> see

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
expand to Reyn models and you can see

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.020 
expand to Reyn models and you can see
now<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.560> terrain<00:02:08.890> model<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.730> we<00:02:12.850> just

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
now that the terrain model that we just

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.080 
now that the terrain model that we just
imported<00:02:13.420> is<00:02:13.930> listed<00:02:14.860> here<00:02:15.130> in<00:02:15.340> our<00:02:15.700> civil
