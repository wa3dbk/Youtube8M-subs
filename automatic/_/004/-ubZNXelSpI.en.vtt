brighter than your standard cell phone
camera<00:01:01.829> flash<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:02.879> would<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.090> pretty<00:01:03.270> cool

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
and so the whole thing with the loop

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.770 
and so the whole thing with the loop
this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.820> my<00:01:05.880> first<00:01:06.090> time<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.360> hands-on
