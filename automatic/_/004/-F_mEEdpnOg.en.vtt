00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.250 

so<00:03:22.640> okay<00:03:23.120> what's<00:03:23.390> wrong<00:03:23.660> with<00:03:23.870> this<00:03:24.050> picture

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
so okay what's wrong with this picture

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.729 
so okay what's wrong with this picture
well<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:25.760> piece<00:03:26.000> may<00:03:26.300> sound<00:03:26.840> legit<00:03:27.379> in<00:03:27.560> that

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
well this piece may sound legit in that

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.559 
well this piece may sound legit in that
it's<00:03:27.890> played<00:03:28.250> in<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.519> way<00:03:28.670> that's<00:03:28.910> idiomatic

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
it's played in a way that's idiomatic

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.660 
it's played in a way that's idiomatic
for<00:03:29.750> guitar<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.349> occasionally<00:03:31.160> there<00:03:31.610> is

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
for guitar and occasionally there is

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.119 
for guitar and occasionally there is
some<00:03:31.910> guitar<00:03:32.300> like<00:03:32.540> clues<00:03:32.900> such<00:03:33.260> as<00:03:33.470> fret<00:03:33.860> buzz

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
some guitar like clues such as fret buzz

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.759 
some guitar like clues such as fret buzz
but<00:03:34.879> anyway<00:03:35.209> here's<00:03:35.599> what's<00:03:35.840> going<00:03:36.050> on<00:03:36.319> in

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
but anyway here's what's going on in

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.860 
but anyway here's what's going on in
this<00:03:37.040> first<00:03:37.340> measure<00:03:37.670> there's<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.120> whole<00:03:38.450> slew

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
this first measure there's a whole slew

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.449 
this first measure there's a whole slew
of<00:03:38.900> notes<00:03:39.260> here<00:03:39.500> where<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:39.830> played<00:03:40.220> with

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
of notes here where I played with

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.479 
of notes here where I played with
increasing<00:03:41.420> velocities<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.290> crescendo<00:03:43.250> and

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
increasing velocities a crescendo and

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.940 
increasing velocities a crescendo and
sure<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.480> volume<00:03:45.019> increases<00:03:45.440> slightly

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
sure the volume increases slightly

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.280 
sure the volume increases slightly
during<00:03:46.550> those<00:03:46.670> notes<00:03:46.970> but<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.720> tambour<00:03:48.140> of

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
during those notes but the tambour of

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.140 
during those notes but the tambour of
the<00:03:48.410> sound<00:03:48.620> doesn't<00:03:49.010> get<00:03:49.130> any<00:03:49.340> brighter<00:03:49.819> or

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
the sound doesn't get any brighter or

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.850 
the sound doesn't get any brighter or
more<00:03:50.180> intense<00:03:50.780> as<00:03:51.080> you'd<00:03:51.290> expect<00:03:51.709> to<00:03:51.830> hear

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
more intense as you'd expect to hear

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.190 
more intense as you'd expect to hear
from<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.370> real<00:03:52.519> guitar<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.780> same<00:03:53.959> thing

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
from a real guitar and the same thing

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.530 
from a real guitar and the same thing
happens<00:03:54.560> in<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.830> second<00:03:55.220> measure<00:03:55.340> too<00:03:55.730> now<00:03:56.360> in

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
happens in the second measure too now in

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.750 
happens in the second measure too now in
the<00:03:56.660> third<00:03:56.900> measure<00:03:57.200> things<00:03:57.890> get<00:03:58.190> noisy

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
the third measure things get noisy

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.460 
the third measure things get noisy
because<00:03:58.910> I'm<00:03:59.239> playing<00:03:59.480> hard<00:03:59.989> enough<00:04:00.260> to

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
because I'm playing hard enough to

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.350 
because I'm playing hard enough to
trigger<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:00.829> set<00:04:01.130> of<00:04:01.250> samples<00:04:01.700> that<00:04:01.760> have<00:04:02.060> lots

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
trigger a set of samples that have lots

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.660 
trigger a set of samples that have lots
of<00:04:02.599> string<00:04:02.930> buzz<00:04:03.200> in<00:04:03.410> them<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.400> part

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
of string buzz in them so that part

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.729 
of string buzz in them so that part
sounds<00:04:05.000> pretty<00:04:05.209> legit<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:06.260> last<00:04:06.470> measure

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
sounds pretty legit and the last measure

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.710 
sounds pretty legit and the last measure
sounds<00:04:07.130> okay<00:04:07.400> because<00:04:07.579> I<00:04:07.730> didn't<00:04:08.090> do<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.209> severe

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
sounds okay because I didn't do a severe

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.630 
sounds okay because I didn't do a severe

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
decrescendo where I would have expected

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.490 
decrescendo where I would have expected
to<00:04:10.940> hear<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.120> more<00:04:11.299> delicate<00:04:11.569> tone<00:04:12.049> at<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.260> end

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
to hear a more delicate tone at the end

to hear a more delicate tone at the end
if<00:04:12.739> this<00:04:12.920> was<00:04:13.099> played<00:04:13.310> on<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.489> real<00:04:13.700> guitar<00:04:13.910> so

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
if this was played on a real guitar so
