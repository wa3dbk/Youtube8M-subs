bottom<00:02:21.450> edge<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.990> triangle<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.340> how

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
bottom edge of the triangle this is how

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.660 
bottom edge of the triangle this is how
I<00:02:23.610> do<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.440> find<00:02:25.440> most<00:02:25.620> anything<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.459> that

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
I do it I find most anything I like that

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.780 
I do it I find most anything I like that
seems<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.630> will<00:02:28.110> look<00:02:28.320> good<00:02:28.530> for<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.430> radius

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
seems to be will look good for a radius

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.100 
seems to be will look good for a radius
this<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.120> about<00:02:30.330> three<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.750> quarter<00:02:30.959> inches

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
this is about three and a quarter inches

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.699 
this is about three and a quarter inches
across

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
across

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.370 
across
I<00:02:33.890> used<00:02:34.890> laid<00:02:35.190> out<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.600> just<00:02:36.630> lay<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.200> in

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
I used laid out and I just lay that in

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.090 
I used laid out and I just lay that in
the<00:02:37.440> corner<00:02:39.170> take<00:02:40.170> an<00:02:40.290> exacto<00:02:40.830> knife<00:02:41.070> or

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
the corner take an exacto knife or

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.250 
the corner take an exacto knife or
whatever<00:02:41.700> you're<00:02:42.030> using<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.480> trim<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:42.900> some

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
whatever you're using to trim with some

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.960 
whatever you're using to trim with some
people<00:02:43.530> use<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.680> hot<00:02:43.920> knife<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.459> would<00:02:44.820> normally

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
people use a hot knife I would normally

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.320 
people use a hot knife I would normally
but<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.920> just<00:02:47.100> fine<00:02:47.580> because<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.209> gonna

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
but this is just fine because it's gonna

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.050 
but this is just fine because it's gonna
have<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.540> lot<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:50.810> energy<00:02:51.810> around<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.940> I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
have a lot of energy around it and I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.400 
have a lot of energy around it and I
just<00:02:54.239> round<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.630> corner<00:02:54.660> off<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.350> don't

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
just round the corner off so I don't

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.860 
just round the corner off so I don't
have<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> square<00:02:56.190> corner<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.820> deal<00:02:57.090> with<00:02:57.360> as<00:02:57.600> I'm

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
have a square corner to deal with as I'm

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.900 
have a square corner to deal with as I'm
putting<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.560> seaming<00:02:59.130> for<00:02:59.340> hems<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.820> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
putting this seaming for hems in the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.860 
putting this seaming for hems in the
edges<00:03:01.550> okay<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:02.610> here's<00:03:03.000> what<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.360> triangle

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
edges okay so here's what the triangle

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.500 
edges okay so here's what the triangle
looks<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.260> after<00:03:04.709> it's<00:03:04.860> been<00:03:05.040> laid<00:03:05.280> out<00:03:05.510> em

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
looks like after it's been laid out em

has been folded into it and you can see

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.479 
has been folded into it and you can see
what<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.660> use<00:03:09.900> for<00:03:09.930> four<00:03:10.530> quick<00:03:10.709> layouts<00:03:11.040> here

the short side of this triangle
measuring<00:04:31.120> squared<00:04:31.870> it<00:04:31.990> up<00:04:32.110> on<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.380> cutting

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
measuring squared it up on the cutting

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.170 
measuring squared it up on the cutting
pad<00:04:33.790> here<00:04:34.410> measuring<00:04:35.410> this<00:04:35.860> way<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.100> have<00:04:36.700> now

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
pad here measuring this way I have now

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.510 
pad here measuring this way I have now
turned<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.750> into<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:38.020> 26<00:04:38.830> inch<00:04:41.250> triangle<00:04:42.250> for

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
turned it into a 26 inch triangle for

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.909 
turned it into a 26 inch triangle for
the<00:04:42.550> foot<00:04:42.820> box<00:04:43.030> after<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.720> put<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.200> 3/8<00:04:44.620> inch

okay<00:04:51.430> this<00:04:51.669> is<00:04:51.850> what<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.270> triangle<00:04:52.960> looks

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
okay this is what the triangle looks

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.140 
okay this is what the triangle looks
like<00:04:53.380> after<00:04:53.830> it's<00:04:53.949> been<00:04:54.160> hemmed<00:04:54.490> along<00:04:55.000> the
