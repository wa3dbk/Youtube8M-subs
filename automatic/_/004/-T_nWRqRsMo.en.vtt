on<00:00:24.970> French<00:00:25.390> braiding<00:00:25.689> in<00:00:25.840> general<00:00:26.289> I<00:00:26.529> actually

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
on French braiding in general I actually

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.570 
on French braiding in general I actually
decided<00:00:28.210> to<00:00:28.330> record<00:00:28.900> me<00:00:29.710> giving<00:00:30.220> you<00:00:30.369> guys

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
actually getting the braid to be you

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.479 
actually getting the braid to be you
know<00:01:00.149> braid<00:01:01.149> I<00:01:01.480> don't<00:01:01.870> know<00:01:02.019> a<00:01:02.289> nice<00:01:03.070> smooth

beautiful<00:01:03.850> French<00:01:04.809> braid<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:06.369> easier<00:01:06.670> just

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
beautiful French braid it's easier just

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.630 
beautiful French braid it's easier just
to<00:01:07.270> have<00:01:07.450> it<00:01:07.570> fall<00:01:07.810> into<00:01:08.080> place<00:01:08.550> instead<00:01:09.550> of

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
to have it fall into place instead of

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.669 
to have it fall into place instead of
having<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:09.940> tighten<00:01:10.179> it<00:01:10.509> while<00:01:11.080> you're<00:01:11.259> doing

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679

utilize<00:01:49.230> telekinesis<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:51.610> you're<00:01:51.970> using<00:01:52.420> the

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
utilize telekinesis if you're using the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.460 
utilize telekinesis if you're using the
force<00:01:54.510> and<00:01:55.510> then<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:55.720> just<00:01:55.840> segregate<00:01:56.350> it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
force and then you just segregate it

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.830 
force and then you just segregate it
into<00:01:56.770> three<00:01:57.040> different<00:01:57.450> strands<00:01:58.450> while

you put the middle one over and you pull

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.180 
you put the middle one over and you pull

look<00:02:27.280> like<00:02:27.340> scissors<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.000> look<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.240> I'm

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
look like scissors I look like I'm

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.870 
look like scissors I look like I'm
cutting<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.020> all<00:02:29.140> off<00:02:32.400> kind<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.460> brush<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.700> out

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
cutting it all off kind of brush it out

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.270 
cutting it all off kind of brush it out
again<00:02:34.180> keeping<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.750> clean<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.470> really

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
again keeping it clean is really

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.340 
again keeping it clean is really

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
controversial like Disney but I might

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.500 
controversial like Disney but I might
subconsciously<00:05:35.020> think<00:05:35.320> that<00:05:35.470> there's<00:05:35.680> not<00:05:35.920> a

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
subconsciously think that there's not a

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.000 
subconsciously think that there's not a
little<00:05:37.510> complicated<00:05:38.050> humans<00:05:38.920> are

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
little complicated humans are

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.580 
little complicated humans are
complicated<00:05:39.450> this<00:05:40.450> wig<00:05:40.690> is<00:05:40.720> not<00:05:41.170> complicated

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
complicated this wig is not complicated

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.770 
complicated this wig is not complicated
at<00:05:42.010> this<00:05:42.160> point<00:05:42.520> there's<00:05:42.760> really<00:05:42.820> not<00:05:43.450> much

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
at this point there's really not much

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.870 
at this point there's really not much
for<00:05:44.080> me<00:05:44.200> to<00:05:44.350> continue<00:05:44.800> to<00:05:44.920> talk<00:05:45.130> about<00:05:45.460> I<00:05:45.490> mean

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
for me to continue to talk about I mean

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.050 
for me to continue to talk about I mean
it's<00:05:46.120> it's<00:05:46.960> you<00:05:47.290> know<00:05:47.580> essentially<00:05:48.580> making<00:05:48.850> a

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
it's it's you know essentially making a

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.690 
it's it's you know essentially making a
braid<00:05:49.330> but<00:05:49.900> pulling<00:05:50.290> from<00:05:51.120> either<00:05:52.120> side<00:05:52.660> and

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
braid but pulling from either side and

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.690 
braid but pulling from either side and
just<00:05:54.700> going<00:05:55.270> with<00:05:55.480> it<00:05:55.630> I<00:05:56.020> mean<00:05:56.140> it's<00:05:56.500> not<00:05:56.700> well

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
just going with it I mean it's not well

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.460 
just going with it I mean it's not well
again<00:05:58.000> it's<00:05:58.180> not<00:05:58.300> rocket<00:05:58.660> science<00:05:59.020> but<00:05:59.110> it<00:05:59.350> is

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
again it's not rocket science but it is

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.000 
again it's not rocket science but it is
what<00:05:59.650> it<00:05:59.770> is<00:05:59.890> it<00:06:00.250> can<00:06:00.550> be<00:06:00.760> difficult<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.270> learn

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
what it is it can be difficult to learn

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.250 
what it is it can be difficult to learn
it<00:06:03.010> can<00:06:03.340> be<00:06:03.490> taxing<00:06:03.940> to<00:06:04.150> learn<00:06:04.330> you<00:06:04.720> always

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
it can be taxing to learn you always

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.730 
it can be taxing to learn you always
always<00:06:06.160> want<00:06:07.090> to<00:06:07.150> not<00:06:07.420> do<00:06:07.660> what<00:06:07.840> I<00:06:07.870> did<00:06:07.960> here
