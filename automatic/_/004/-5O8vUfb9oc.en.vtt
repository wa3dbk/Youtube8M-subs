00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
this is where our starter bolt would be

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.790 
this is where our starter bolt would be
where<00:02:04.970> we<00:02:05.000> would<00:02:05.239> come<00:02:05.450> up<00:02:05.509> from<00:02:05.929> behind<00:02:06.410> the

engine on the passenger side and then we

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.040 
engine on the passenger side and then we
get<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.739> from<00:02:09.890> right<00:02:10.099> there<00:02:10.629> so<00:02:11.629> this<00:02:11.780> was<00:02:11.930> an

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
get it from right there so this was an

my<00:02:52.680> opinion<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.700> MP<00:02:54.030> replacement<00:02:54.599> carburetor

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
my opinion the MP replacement carburetor

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.680 
my opinion the MP replacement carburetor
is<00:02:55.170> trash<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.430> we'll<00:02:56.700> be<00:02:56.819> giving<00:02:56.909> that<00:02:57.209> back<00:02:57.420> to

the<00:03:04.890> only<00:03:05.099> other<00:03:05.280> thing<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.519> got<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.790> do<00:03:05.909> is<00:03:06.120> go

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
the only other thing I got to do is go

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.940 
the only other thing I got to do is go
ahead<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.540> install<00:03:06.629> my<00:03:07.080> head<00:03:07.290> or<00:03:07.440> back<00:03:07.680> into

ahead and install my head or back into
the<00:03:08.159> engine<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.879> see<00:03:09.060> where<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.329> goes

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
the engine you can see where it goes

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.559 
the engine you can see where it goes
right<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.849> reason<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.180> haven't<00:03:12.360> done

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
right here but the reason I haven't done

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.420 
right here but the reason I haven't done
that<00:03:12.629> yet<00:03:12.780> because<00:03:13.140> I'm<00:03:13.319> debating<00:03:13.950> where

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
that yet because I'm debating where

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.530 
that yet because I'm debating where
there<00:03:14.579> ought<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.849> go<00:03:14.970> ahead<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.269> just<00:03:15.360> buy<00:03:15.510> a

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
there ought to go ahead and just buy a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.289 
there ought to go ahead and just buy a
brand<00:03:15.930> new<00:03:16.019> header<00:03:16.319> for<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:17.090> header<00:03:18.090> and

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
brand new header for that header and

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.119 
brand new header for that header and
muffler<00:03:18.720> since<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.110> one's<00:03:19.290> old<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.739> rotted

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
muffler since that one's old and rotted

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.089 
muffler since that one's old and rotted
and<00:03:20.280> it's<00:03:20.370> kind<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.329> rusty<00:03:21.659> looking<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.379> nasty

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
and it's kind of rusty looking and nasty

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.470 
and it's kind of rusty looking and nasty
so<00:03:23.519> we'll<00:03:23.700> probably<00:03:23.790> go<00:03:24.030> ahead<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.360> buy<00:03:24.450> a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
so we'll probably go ahead and buy a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.630 
so we'll probably go ahead and buy a
brand<00:03:24.810> new<00:03:24.870> one<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.230> those<00:03:25.440> now<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.280> reason<00:03:26.579> I

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
brand new one of those now the reason I

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.740 
brand new one of those now the reason I
didn't<00:03:26.849> go<00:03:26.970> through<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.239> procedure<00:03:27.599> of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
didn't go through the procedure of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.720 
didn't go through the procedure of
actually<00:03:28.200> jacking<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.739> motor<00:03:28.920> up<00:03:29.160> into<00:03:29.609> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
actually jacking the motor up into the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.750 
actually jacking the motor up into the
vehicle<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.329> because<00:03:31.370> we<00:03:32.370> would<00:03:32.549> have<00:03:32.579> been

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
vehicle is because we would have been

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.699 
vehicle is because we would have been
watching<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.239> repeat<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.690> actually<00:03:34.200> taking<00:03:34.620> it

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
watching a repeat of actually taking it

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.979 
watching a repeat of actually taking it
out<00:03:34.859> once<00:03:35.160> again<00:03:35.519> all<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.209> got<00:03:36.629> to<00:03:36.750> remember

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
out once again all you got to remember

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.589 
out once again all you got to remember
is<00:03:37.349> do<00:03:37.829> everything<00:03:38.340> in<00:03:38.489> Reverse<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:39.209> what<00:03:39.450> you

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
is do everything in Reverse of what you

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.300 
is do everything in Reverse of what you
did<00:03:39.810> when<00:03:40.079> you<00:03:40.170> pulled<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> motor<00:03:40.739> out<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.040> the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
did when you pulled the motor out of the

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.509 
did when you pulled the motor out of the
car<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:43.049> means<00:03:43.290> once<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.680> motors<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.040> just

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
car that means once the motors in just

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.490 
car that means once the motors in just
start<00:03:44.819> by<00:03:45.000> putting<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.420> bolt<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.959> last<00:03:46.200> bolt

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
start by putting the bolt the last bolt

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.130 
start by putting the bolt the last bolt
in<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.040> took<00:03:47.220> out<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.840> work<00:03:48.840> your<00:03:49.019> way

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
in that you took out and work your way

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.849 
in that you took out and work your way
down<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.980> wires<00:03:50.250> are<00:03:50.579> very<00:03:50.609> very<00:03:51.030> easy<00:03:51.120> to

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
down the wires are very very easy to

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.110 
down the wires are very very easy to
understand<00:03:52.859> there's<00:03:53.129> only<00:03:53.220> three<00:03:53.640> wires<00:03:53.849> that
