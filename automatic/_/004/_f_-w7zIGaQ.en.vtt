with me I happen to mention that I would

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.779 
with me I happen to mention that I would
be<00:00:17.640> doing<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.119> continental<00:00:18.840> style<00:00:19.170> and

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
be doing it continental style and

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.099 
be doing it continental style and
everyone<00:00:20.789> kind<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.119> spoke<00:00:21.359> up<00:00:21.539> about<00:00:21.810> that

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
everyone kind of spoke up about that

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.290 
everyone kind of spoke up about that
what<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.650> continental<00:00:23.070> knitting<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.939> some

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
what is continental knitting and some

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.910 
what is continental knitting and some
people<00:00:24.570> knew<00:00:24.750> how<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.439> their<00:00:25.619> new

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
people knew how to do it with their new

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.890 
people knew how to do it with their new
abed<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:26.550> didn't<00:00:26.789> know<00:00:26.849> how<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.029> do<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.420> so

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
abed but didn't know how to do it so

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.240 
abed but didn't know how to do it so
today<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.320> thought<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.680> would<00:00:28.920> show<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
today I thought I would show you the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.820 
today I thought I would show you the
difference<00:00:29.609> between<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.240> two<00:00:30.830> continental

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
difference between the two continental

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.549 
difference between the two continental
knitting<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.219> faster<00:00:32.850> which<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
knitting is faster which I like and the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.620 
knitting is faster which I like and the
other<00:00:34.590> reason<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:35.820> it

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
other reason I like it is because it

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.740 
other reason I like it is because it
helps<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.710> knit<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.430> little<00:00:39.210> more<00:00:39.360> loosely

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
helps you knit a little more loosely

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.959 
helps you knit a little more loosely
which<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.590> me<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.770> good<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.610> usually

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
which for me is good because I usually

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.959 
which for me is good because I usually
have<00:00:42.329> very<00:00:42.570> tense<00:00:43.050> tight<00:00:43.530> little<00:00:43.890> stitches<00:00:44.370> so

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
have very tense tight little stitches so

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.180 
have very tense tight little stitches so
this<00:00:45.149> helps<00:00:45.420> me<00:00:45.539> loosen<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.140> bit

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
this helps me loosen up a little bit

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.459 
this helps me loosen up a little bit
one<00:00:47.789> note<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> first<00:00:48.899> project<00:00:49.200> I've

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and really to knit one stitch takes four

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.600

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
it slide the needle towards the front

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.060 
it slide the needle towards the front
and<00:01:31.340> slide<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.520> stitch<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:33.470> again<00:01:34.500> left<00:01:34.860> or

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.310 
right
wrap<00:01:36.439> slide<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.619> out<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.100> off<00:01:38.930> left<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.110> right

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
wrap slide it out and off left to right

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.530 
wrap slide it out and off left to right
wrap<00:01:40.799> bring<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> back<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> way<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.270> came

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
wrap bring it back just the way it came

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.319 
wrap bring it back just the way it came
and<00:01:42.869> slide<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.740> off<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and slide it off and this is the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.840 
and slide it off and this is the
traditional<00:01:45.930> method<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.439> knitting<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.860> most

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
traditional method of knitting that most

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.200 
traditional method of knitting that most
people<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.930> recognize<00:01:49.640> this<00:01:50.640> thrower

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
people see and recognize this thrower

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:06.520 
people see and recognize this thrower
technique

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.960 

so<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> hardest<00:02:08.009> part<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.369> continental

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
so the hardest part of continental

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.479 
so the hardest part of continental
knitting<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> tension<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
knitting is going to be the tension and

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.759 
knitting is going to be the tension and
keeping<00:02:11.970> your<00:02:12.090> tension<00:02:12.629> steady<00:02:13.379> throughout

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
keeping your tension steady throughout

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.240 
keeping your tension steady throughout
your<00:02:14.010> stitches<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:16.680> comes<00:02:16.950> from<00:02:17.040> how

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
your stitches and that comes from how

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.699 
your stitches and that comes from how
