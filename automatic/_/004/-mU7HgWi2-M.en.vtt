 United States and want to acquire a 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.219
 iphone because simply here is more 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.530

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.170
 economic than in our countries and up 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.570
 no Martians come to buy iphone and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.820
 I see that they have many doubts and many 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.710
 Some questions also send a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 familiar to buy iphone a greeting for 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 everyone so I want to make a video 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.340
 super ultra informative clarifying all 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:38.850
 the doubts that exist when you go to 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.430

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.200
 I went to several bet or did not have that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.430
 row they have in the bet of the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.379
 fifth avenue in may 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.320
 I have told them and I repeat them all 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.719
 the years that are there only 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.140
 they want to be popular or many only 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.149
 they are selling or promoting a 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.539
 device because the post of the fifth 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.840
 avenue 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.000
 is the most famous and vain bidder and not 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.500
 I understand why but I understand 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.940
 why but I do not know 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.500
 users like you or like me Sara 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.350
 guys the points I'm going to say here 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.900
 maybe apply for devices that 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.510
 have android but the video is not 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.300
 focused on android because they do not exist 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.450
 stores as well as physical ones that come 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.560
 Android devices ok that's done here 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.270
 I want to acquire a device 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.760
 android i go to a verizon store 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.560
 a sprint store but I can not go 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.480
 to a store like this a physical store of 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.100
 google for example to get all 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.370
 those devices so that's why 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.340
 this video will be focused on what is 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.200
 the bidder ok guys let's understand 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.400
 how is the support system in the first 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.120
 place we have to understand that the 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.700
 iphone is only officially 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.770
 being sold by four companies ok 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.530
 I will mention it in order of which 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.280
 they were getting the iphone agent's and 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.260
 verizon sprint and t-mobile these are the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.080
 four companies that currently sell 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.840
 the iphone and in an apostle when you go 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.210
 you have to ask for the iphone for a 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.280
 of those companies although you want it 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.050
 locked or unlocked you have to 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.750
 do as well restaurant style 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.860
 as I want an iphone of 16gb and the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.660
 iphone 6 white color gold color x 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.460
 company even if you want it 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.680
 unlocked we understand from that point 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.770
 every seller who is in the apostle 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.650
 must sell and activate t know that 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.500
 cellular in those four companies and you 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.870
 explains the plans of the dead when 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.820
 you ask for the phone he leaves and you 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.140
 bring one of those phones and there he says 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.220
 well I want it blocked or 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.210
 unlocked pay full price or pay the 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.220
 price 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.610
 sox age that is a price with a 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.380
 contract that you get for 299 dollars per 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.980
 example you can see there in the 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.250
 bidder $ 299 with contract 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.260
 two years those are not unlocked or 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.020
 that comes with a contract that is not the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.910
 actual price of the device there are many 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.110
 who want to come and buy it with a 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.030
 contract being from venezuela or being from 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.100
 Mexico to acquire a device with 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.680
 contract you must be the resident 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.120
 legal of the us because they're going to check 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.980
 your credit will see 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.170
 shopping history will they see if you 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.110
 you're a good person paying and that's how it is 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.030
 that they sell it to you at that price 299 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.549
 dollars with the promise that you're going to 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.159
 last two years with the device 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.230
 paying the phone bill ok that's 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.879
 the idea ok that's why it's cheap to 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.980
 that price thinking that they are going to 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.500
 recover that investment that are 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.599
 doing with you when choosing 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.819
 company I can leave you an article 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.170
 here below with the prices of iphone 6 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:50.030
 for example 299 with contracts 649 without 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.879
 good contracts I made several videos already 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.879
 explaining if you want 64 gb are 100 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:58.099
 dollars more if you want the plus are 100 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.620
 dollars plus that's with contract or without 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.709
 contract does not change ok now when you what 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.500
 purchases without a contract there are certain 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.870
 companies that give it unlocked and 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.879
 others that are blocked there is that 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.799
 is the truck and this is the most 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.420
 important of the video now none 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.130
 company tells you that he sells it 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.350
 unlocked that everything from going to the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.419
 store and tell him I want to pay him to 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.820
 full price I will explain how 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.020
 makes each of the companies in you and 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.349
 offers you the price 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:31.340
 let's say the 299 dollars full price 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:32.900
 eye with the contracts does not come 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.759
 unlocked the tooth and comes 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.759
 blocked at your cost the price 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:40.490
 complete there are forms that you can 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.500
 unlock but it's not the same as me 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.319
 I recommend because it will cost you and 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.060
 you have to have headaches with 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:50.060
 the client and so let's continue with the 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.460
 next sprint equal price with contract 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.009
 299 and without contract the full price 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.590
 but the sprint guys yo 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.289
 personally I have not seen a device 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.539
 sprint unlocked ok come 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.479
 blocked from factory even if you pay 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:08.330
 the full price or even if you pay 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.220
 the contract and the good with another for 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.310
 logical if you pay with the contract to 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.919
 come blog blocked the you mobile on 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.289
 the apostle's shop comes unlocked 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.300
 If you pay the full price some 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.340
 no and you have to call to it 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.229
 unblock it now the verizon that 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.069
 this is the one that they recommend guys 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:30.440
 comes unlocked even if you pay the 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.690
 contract or even if you pay 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.900
 the without contract so for more 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.450
 security for us buy the one from 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.420
 verizon if you are going to use it outside of 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.190
 the us if you already want to use it here 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.260
 which company you prefer that is already 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.840
 for another video that's another analysis more 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.580
 deep but it is very convenient to 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.650
 verizon up if you are thinking 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.420
 buy it to use it here because the day 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.250
 that you want to break that contract with 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.900
 the company although verizon is going to have the 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.370
 right to block the device if 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.020
 you do not pay the phone is 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.790
 unlocked if you buy the one from 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.070
 verizon here you are a user that what 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.870
 will use here in the usa if you 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.730
 wants to travel to Mexico you can go to 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.050
 Mexico simply and change the 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.090
 card and it will work because 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.460
 come unlocked from the factory by a 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.440
 law that a problem that Verizon had and 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.020
 all your devices is the iphone 5 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.780
 they are unlocked from the factory that is 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.960
 the full point of the video when you 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.960
 ask one will come any capacity 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.420
 that you want without a contract and it's already 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.710
 something that I have to show it to me here 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.120
 is to travel this life is here boy and 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.979
 I hope the video liked it 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.360
 if the bid the taste remember a little hand 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.580
 up and tell me in the comments of 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.870
 you will see if the video was useful for you 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.240
 you know that the idea of doing 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.260
 videos is to help them marciano found 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.449
