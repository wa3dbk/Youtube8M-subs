00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.267
 My father was a big man. 

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:12.498
 Hero. 

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:17.853
 But sometimes the world no longer needs another hero. 

00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:23.057
 Sometimes he needs ... 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.790
 ...monster. 

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.494
 My prince. 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.979
 I missed you. 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.450
 Something's bothering you? 

00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:38.886
 The Sultan is preparing for battle. 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.219
 And it requires one thousand boys in its army. 

00:00:44.113 --> 00:00:45.683
 Including your son. 

00:00:47.403 --> 00:00:48.643
 Run for mother. 

00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:50.811
 Don't look. 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.930
 You can't protect us. 

00:00:55.803 --> 00:00:57.483
 I'll find a way. 

00:00:57.872 --> 00:00:59.772
 TO FIGHT AGAINST GOLD 

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:06.295
 I've been waiting for eternity ... 

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:07.785
 SE HRDINA 

00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:10.718
 ... to a man strong enough to come here. 

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.488
 DARKNESS 

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:20.137
 What are you looking for here? 

00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:24.291
 I want to destroy my enemies and save my family. 

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:30.387
 Drink 

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:31.609
 Drakulo 

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:40.551
 THIS AUTUMN 

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:42.823
 What's wrong with you? 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.309
 I'm the thing that's scared. 

00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:46.561
 No ghost ... 

00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:47.631
 ...something else. 

00:01:52.435 --> 00:01:54.135
 I see the devil in it! 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.637
 Do you think you're alive because you can fight? 

00:02:02.474 --> 00:02:08.520
 You're alive for what I did to save you. 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.416
 Dracula: Unknown legend 

00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:20.432
 Never forget who I am!
