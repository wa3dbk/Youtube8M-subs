00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.960 
okay and so when you put me fan anyway
if<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.610> think<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:27.940> way<00:02:28.090> there<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.540> go<00:02:29.849> if<00:02:30.849> you

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
if I think of a way there you go if you

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.050 
if I think of a way there you go if you
do<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.239> really<00:02:31.480> weakly<00:02:32.019> maybe<00:02:32.489> yes<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:33.910> let's

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
do it really weakly maybe yes so let's

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.460 
do it really weakly maybe yes so let's
see<00:02:34.120> how<00:02:34.269> they<00:02:34.390> handle<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.989> not<00:02:35.140> much<00:02:35.260> about

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
see how they handle is not much about

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.270
