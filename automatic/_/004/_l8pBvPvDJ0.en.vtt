00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
seed and apparently it was patched and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.580 
seed and apparently it was patched and
build<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.450> look<00:00:49.020> where<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.559> now

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
build for and look where we are now

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.490 
build for and look where we are now
alpha<00:00:50.280> build<00:00:50.520> six<00:00:51.090> guys<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.170> let's<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.469> ahead

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
alpha build six guys so let's go ahead

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.910 
alpha build six guys so let's go ahead
and<00:00:52.739> generate<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.640> world<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.410> basically

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and generate the world so it's basically

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.330 
and generate the world so it's basically
at<00:00:56.430> spawn<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> you're<00:00:58.320> spotting<00:00:58.770> right<00:00:58.949> here

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
at spawn so you're spotting right here

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.090 
at spawn so you're spotting right here
and<00:01:00.260> apparently<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.350> glitched<00:01:01.680> out<00:01:01.890> right

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and apparently I'm glitched out right

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.469 
and apparently I'm glitched out right
now<00:01:02.250> hopefully<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.910> fixes<00:01:03.180> itself<00:01:03.390> real<00:01:04.080> quick

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
now hopefully it fixes itself real quick

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.149 
now hopefully it fixes itself real quick
or<00:01:06.479> else<00:01:06.540> I'm<00:01:06.930> gonna<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> render<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
or else I'm gonna have to render it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.719 
or else I'm gonna have to render it
again<00:01:08.460> or<00:01:09.140> I'll<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.890> exit<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> app

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
again or I'll just have to exit the app

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.570 
again or I'll just have to exit the app
real<00:01:12.030> quick<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.860> end<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:14.070> back<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:16.580> we
