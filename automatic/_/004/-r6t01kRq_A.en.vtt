we talk about design at four we talk

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.359 
we talk about design at four we talk
about<00:00:16.470> something<00:00:17.470> that<00:00:17.500> we<00:00:17.710> call<00:00:18.070> in<00:00:18.280> the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
about something that we call in the

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.240 
about something that we call in the
design<00:00:18.700> world<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:19.150> DNA<00:00:19.630> what<00:00:20.500> is<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:20.770> DNA<00:00:21.220> of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
design world the DNA what is the DNA of

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.460 
design world the DNA what is the DNA of
four<00:00:21.700> and<00:00:22.240> how<00:00:22.480> does<00:00:22.540> it<00:00:22.840> relate<00:00:22.960> to<00:00:23.350> the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
four and how does it relate to the

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.679 
four and how does it relate to the
product<00:00:23.920> you<00:00:24.430> look<00:00:24.640> at<00:00:24.790> the<00:00:24.910> front<00:00:25.119> end<00:00:25.480> a

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
product you look at the front end a

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.620 
product you look at the front end a

predominant grill of course the grill we

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.180 
predominant grill of course the grill we
took<00:00:28.840> it<00:00:29.020> up<00:00:29.200> I<00:00:29.439> so<00:00:30.430> it<00:00:30.970> looks<00:00:31.240> proud<00:00:31.779> and

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.190 
took it up I so it looks proud and

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.390 
took it up I so it looks proud and

up<00:01:10.090> one<00:01:10.720> line<00:01:11.020> I'm<00:01:11.290> particularly<00:01:12.159> happy<00:01:12.400> with

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
up one line I'm particularly happy with

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.320 
up one line I'm particularly happy with
is<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.930> hood<00:01:14.140> line<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:15.190> hood<00:01:15.430> line<00:01:15.670> comes<00:01:16.120> up

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
is the hood line that hood line comes up

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.870 
is the hood line that hood line comes up
into<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.900> a-pillar<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.590> then<00:01:18.250> comes<00:01:18.640> up

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
into the a-pillar and then comes up

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.260 
into the a-pillar and then comes up

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.170 
shoots back given the car in a side view
a<00:01:22.810> creative<00:01:23.560> silhouette<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:24.610> gives<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.030> a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
a creative silhouette it gives it a

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.600 
a creative silhouette it gives it a
sense<00:01:25.480> of<00:01:25.630> uniqueness<00:01:25.930> and<00:01:26.770> that's<00:01:27.310> something

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
sense of uniqueness and that's something

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.290 
sense of uniqueness and that's something
that<00:01:27.790> we<00:01:28.060> strive<00:01:28.390> for<00:01:28.810> when

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
that we strive for when

an urban more of an SUV look another
thing<00:02:36.020> that<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.230> very<00:02:36.350> important<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.190> this

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
thing that is very important to this

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.120 
thing that is very important to this
part<00:02:37.940> has<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.150> swing<00:02:38.600> gate<00:02:38.840> as<00:02:39.320> when<00:02:39.560> gave<00:02:39.830> that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
part has a swing gate as when gave that

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.350 
part has a swing gate as when gave that
open<00:02:41.060> side<00:02:41.330> way<00:02:41.650> versus<00:02:42.650> opening<00:02:43.160> upward<00:02:43.360> of

open side way versus opening upward of
course<00:02:44.570> as<00:02:44.750> soon<00:02:44.930> as<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.170> put<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.410> door<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.890> got

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
course as soon as you put a door you got

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.290 
course as soon as you put a door you got
to<00:02:46.130> have<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> door<00:02:46.520> handle

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
to have a door handle

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.750 
to have a door handle
we<00:02:47.810> put<00:02:47.990> a<00:02:48.020> door<00:02:48.260> handle<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.010> rear<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.580> was

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
we put a door handle on the rear it was

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.910 
we put a door handle on the rear it was
going<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.030> flutter<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.420> design<00:02:50.930> we<00:02:51.500> wanted<00:02:51.800> to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
going to flutter the design we wanted to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.730 
going to flutter the design we wanted to
streamline<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.570> we<00:02:53.720> incorporated<00:02:54.110> the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
streamline this so we incorporated the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.450 
streamline this so we incorporated the
door<00:02:54.920> handle<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:56.180> tail<00:02:56.660> lamp<00:02:56.990> as<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:58.280> can
