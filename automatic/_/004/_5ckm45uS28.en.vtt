00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello did you know that man was like that 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.580
 clever is always automatic 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.170
 any problems investigated itself into 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.880
 know that's me now lately 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.650
 spontaneously noticed earlier in school 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.450
 Of course, homework was clearly part of the job 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 or any such shit or hey me 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.690
 must write a clerk but with me 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.130
 is already for some time the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.390
 school over and I thought okay 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.210
 cool I have such violent 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.529
 problems no longer but not so because 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.420
 I wish you seen the well so 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.010
 it was clear that if it has no problems 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.420
 a lot of small things are looking for 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.099
 then it will be really fat problems 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.390
 are like last time what were they 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.070
 oh yes I have the world totally 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.750
 Looked online and the dazzle yes 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 in between, I somehow something three times 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.469
 in this 40 minutes following advertising 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.850
 one or more advertising 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.129
 Do not skip someone in a row 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.660
 Can I then watch what I am after 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.120
 ten minutes is the first commercial 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.950
 about some such epic trailer to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.320
 film or something that we just stop 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.550
 so yes is okay has nice movie 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.890
 the mood is set by the trailer 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.360
 good witness blamabler all this advertising 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.710
 passed by and afterwards 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.170
 nor my advertising I watch me this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.149
 and notice that come over character 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.739
 said private is exactly that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.059
 same advertising, however, research then 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.100
 again this advertising with this 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.479
 epic mood like what is generated 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.040
 I know blah blah blah blah and after that 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.820
 the second time directly and as a to 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.409
 a bit ridiculous 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.850
 this advertising comes over there is even more 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.740
 Advertising now you can guess what that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.330
 Nice advertising was really still money 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.950
 cabinet trainers advertising about this 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.270
 movie now i like the movie i want 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.259
 I do not even look through this 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.299
 Advertising here three times in a row 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.259
 averted 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.670
 but I say you have any 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.290
 all the problems you gave you must 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.820
 doing homework or what I mean 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.380
 family velvet 400 then this would have me 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.729
 advertising is not so excited now has the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.479
 I'm so excited that I'm back 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.860
 great 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.030
 I find that he was generally put 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.710
 pretty awesome that you mean mine 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.659
 Watch videos and if I'm for mine 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.250
 video itself I am always excited 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.750
 the least important chance on the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.700
 smallest things I just talk about 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.170
 what concerns me and you have to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.390
 yes, be mad 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.649

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.649

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.280
 that's the way it 's always album 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.100
 behind each other 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.259
 franziska pin or tan asks me can 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.680
 to reach you on skype that is so 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.060
 a 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.770
 mindscape username is one 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.300
 description that stands yes there you can 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.740
 Add me yes , the thing is 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.510
 just stop that I'm really only really 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.130
 come on skype online when i am 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.720
 already outside of skull me with it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.700
 to have someone to talk to 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.660
 that means when I'm online and you 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.950
 then write me 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.810
 then I usually have no time 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.950
 because I already requested that and if 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.300
 I'm not talking I'm not 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.920
 online yes I have to see if I'm there 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.660
 somehow change something but in principle 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.459
 yes I am already accessible via skype 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.720
 it is when I talk to other people 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.980
 because I am also such a person 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.810
 honestly, no buck has it all the time 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.400
 to be reachable that means I want 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.080
 not the whole day in the background 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.400
 Everybody has to run me randomly 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.209
 can then write if he wants 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.800
 yes there I am at whatsapp 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.060
 reachable but there I could only 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.920
 the people reach my number 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.690
 and so far it is at least that way 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.070
 that only people have my number 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.720
 who are allowed to reach me and not 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.730
 are you stranger so are you? 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.770
 question to answer no you can me 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.850
 as well write but Skype then 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.680
 I would have to go that way someday 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.850
 set an appointment or yes exactly what 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.410
 Do you think of this idea if you are the one 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.060
 box of I can my own next 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.610
 videos just say an appointment like that 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.250
 in so many days I am 18 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.600
 reachable until 19 o'clock and every one of what 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.830
 I want to call me there then 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.180
 In this time she has then 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.530
 interest in that tells me then 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.480
 just like that then come already 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.549
 in the end it pays for the christof 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.500
 Weather so happy to answer and that 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.600
 now a classic media question 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.340
 you would rather not have an internet so never 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.560
 more internet or no mobile so never 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.130
 I'm curious to say my cellphone actor 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.130
