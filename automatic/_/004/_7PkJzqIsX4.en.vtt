00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello welcome to do science and 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.490
 here is a summary with the news 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.280
 world's most outstanding science of 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.769
 the last week let's start scientists 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
 they created an electronic skin capable of 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.690
 offer a sixth sense to humans 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.000
 concretely allows to perceive the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.859
 magnetic fields the invention contains 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.930
 a series of sensors that detect 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.240
 static and dynamic magnetic fields 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.970
 the information is transmitted in a 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.920
 wireless to an external device that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.570
 It has led indicators giving a 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.850
 visual representation of the field 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.739
 magnetic in the future it is expected that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.170
 this technology can be used in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.329
 biometric implants like in muscles or 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.670
 artificial joints to be able 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.860
 detect anomalous behaviors be 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.469
 used in robots or professionals that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.110
 work with magnetic fields the ship 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.090
 new horizon has sent a new photo of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.100
 Pluto and his brother 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.809
 caronte the probe that is traveling to 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.660
 through the solar system to the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.940
 extremely high speed of 50 thousand 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.280
 kilometers per hour after having 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.890
 traveled almost 5 billion of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.760
 kilometers since its launch in 2006 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.100
 state 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.410
 now closer to his goal the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.390
 dwarf planet pluton it is about the 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.250
 first probe that will study the planet 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 in detail send photos of your 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.750
 surface and is expected to reach it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.290
 in July of this year it has been discovered 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.240
 a sea slug that steals genes from algae 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.420
 and so I knew that this species called 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.850
 elisa criticism was photosynthetic but 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.920
 until now it was not known how he did it 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.900
 has found that it ingests the algae and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.210
 once inside your body 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.370
 incorporates the genes that allow you to do 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.050
 photosynthesis to your cells 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.700
 these sea slugs are one of the 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.250
 only known examples of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.710
 transfer of functional genes between 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.080
 multicellular species and mechanisms 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.790
 Until now they were unknown without 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.610
 But now a great advance has been made 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.650
 in what could be the answer to how 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.870
 has been able to evolve life so 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.330
 quickly throughout the history of 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.090
 the earth hopeful and encouraging 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.850
 news for space exploration the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.950
 white house asked the pot that destine 30 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.890
 million dollars from the budget of 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.030
 2016 in developing a mission towards 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.100
 Europe 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.260
 bigger ones of jupiter and 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.540
 possibly the place where there is more 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.670
 possibilities of finding life in the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.800
 solar system outside the given earth 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.990
 that the moon contains tectonics 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 active plates and it is even believed that there 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.370
 a vast ocean beneath its surface 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.800
 foresees that the mission be launched in the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.959
 2020s a team of scientists 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.690
 has discovered a new kind of 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.620
 bacteria on the high seas that has remained 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.590
 without evolving two billion years 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.050
 to put this in perspective two thousand 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.239
 millions of years are almost half of the 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.459
 age of our planet although I can 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.170
 it seems otherwise this creature helps 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.850
 to endorse one of the principles of 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.310
 Charles Darwin's theory about the 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.510
 evolution that establishes that if the means 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.730
 environment in which a 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.500
 organism does not change the biology of 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.540
 The body in question does not change either 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.310
 nothing in this aspect like the environment of 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.380
 the bacteria in the study that 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.390
 feed sulfur has not changed in 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.280
 more than 2000 million years has not 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.580
 there have been biological changes in these 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.709
 microorganisms or therefore evolution 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.630
 a group of scientists claimed to have 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.810
 Found the reset button 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.790
 of the biological clock in mice what is 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.520
 He believes it could help cure 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.190
 adverse effects of jobs that 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.140
 require nighttime hours to control 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.050
 the activity of neurons in mice 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.970
 the biologists introduced in their DNA a 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.430
 responsible for the synthesis of the 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.380
 proteins sensitive to light after 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.420
 through very fine optical fibers and 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.310
 introduced directly into the brain 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.800
 Animal scientists 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.080
 they put in the cells laser beams for 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.150
 activate or suppress your activity by 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.640
 course in its current form this method 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.080
 it can not be applied in humans but 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.120
 researchers believe that in the 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.800
 future when it is easy and safe 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.660
 enter the desired genes in 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.330
 any cell of an adult organism 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.820
 as well as use for the lighting of 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.340
 the same implants in miniature said 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.470
 therapy will be possible in humans 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.620
 discovered on the coast of the united kingdom- 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.750
 a forest submerged under the sea 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.790
 forest about ten thousand ago 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.370
 years was part of a land mass 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.740
 prehistoric known as de gerland 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.870
 that united the united kingdom- to the continent 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.210
 European however the level 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.760
 went up and kept it hidden so far 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.470
 besides these thick forests where the 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.199
 Cndh would have consisted of salt 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.900
 hills and estuaries the region was so 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.860
 vast that hunters and gatherers 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.650
 prehistoric people who lived there in the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.680
 past they had been able to travel to 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.199
 foot to germany last week supposed 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.900
 the beginning of a new era of 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.150
 assisted reproduction the camera of the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.370
 of the united kingdom - voted the week 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.830
 passed in favor of legalizing the use of 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.020
 mitochondrial donor donors for 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.270
 in vitro fertilization which will allow 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.820
 the creation of children that will have three 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.590
 biological parents allow the process 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.810
 mothers who have certain conditions 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.090
 genetic have children that share the 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.160
 most of its genetic code but 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.560
 without the component that could lead to 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.330
 terrible diseases the decision without 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.820
 However, it has generated much controversy 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.370
 about the ethical limits of the 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.440
 science is fine that we can design 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.570
 our children to come out as 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.889
 we want and here the video 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.080
 this week I hope you liked it 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.820
 if you liked it, let me like it 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.529
 subscribe if it's the first time 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.449
 you come from science and do not forget 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.579
 share the video remember also that 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.439
 you have here below in the description the 

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:39.749
 links to all the news in case 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:41.849
 you want to know a little bit more about me 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:45.729
 part nothing else we see the week that 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:48.210
 comes with more news goodbye 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.210
 or not
