00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.610
 and what we are going then the best moment 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.060
 of this tremendous environment party the 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.060
 tribunes 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.189
 and here comes a play where the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.189
 ball is stopped by water 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.140
 that you no longer commented to the more right than 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.570
 how can you get like that like that 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.910
 especially 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.070
 knowing what 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.380
 the land of the game are no longer the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.559
 circumstances marvin wants to play 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.030
 go on the ball but can not do not 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.580
 contact with him there is also kamax time and 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.610
 in the end syndrome but hold it over 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.199
 all because about the center day closing 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.330
 the Grenadian in clear but what happens 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.060
 already it has spent six days going to get 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.910
 to the ball and good are circumstances 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.560
 of play that in the area does not have 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.950
 standard that is spoken we say in that 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.899
 you know what you want 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.310
 and try to get to the ball and I think 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.360
 I was not there 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.950
 in the channels 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.439
 you can not come first in the final 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.210
 waiting for the indication of the carp 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.210
 attention grab and pulse hits them 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.049
 all right 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.900
 Oh 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.170
 in the eight cores 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.259
 marked the first story 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.910
 streams on the rope on the left 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.340
 in the channel is it stops in front of the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.340
 ball with a lot of personality and there it is 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.819
 center 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.819
 to right 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.450
 but the Argentines 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.580
 about almost 8 minutes is winning in the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.120
 final being the 100 short tournaments for 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.530
 in the channel is there they have it on screen 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.440
 neither to the left nor to the right about 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.379
 the center shot where also the each 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.120
 roll is released as was the logical thing about 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.370
 the left sector and there it was 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.110
 scoring is the first of the game very 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.110
 the coca marker opens early 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.660
 and will come to Jonathan eagle with the 16th 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.660
 Alejandro Bentos goes with the 9 good 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.590
 the firm has attention seeks the shot 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.599
 goal goal 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.519
 and review it because it claims 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.140
 in terms I understand that we are going to wait 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.319

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.070
 second I will confirm who they are 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.530
 those who leave but if he took the red one to 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.670

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.110
 there was no hand sir 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.739
 head hand 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.420
 in that way to be human to have here 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.000
 is 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.590
 the play from the right comes the 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.519
 past center 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.230

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.690
 that goes to the bottom of the network here is born 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.740
 the play the center of mederos the 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.590
 headbutton and if there is a touch in the hand of 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.870
 max guevara the referee does not see it 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.730
 the referee does not consider perhaps that it has been 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.730
 intentional here we're going to see hernandez 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:50.629
 and he should not have told of his 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.189
 head his life-giving extended hand that 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:55.300
 the reaction of leading to that in following 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.300
