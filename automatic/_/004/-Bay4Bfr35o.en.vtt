are all taken but I could always have

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.109 
are all taken but I could always have
that<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:06.210> non-official<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> tag

that as like a non-official to a tag

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.060 
that as like a non-official to a tag
team<00:01:09.270> title<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.380> held<00:01:10.500> by<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.680> Divas

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
team title to just be held by the Divas

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.880 
team title to just be held by the Divas
and<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:12.299> there<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.600> anyone<00:01:12.960> who<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> guess<00:01:13.619> would

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and if there is anyone who I guess would

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.289 
and if there is anyone who I guess would
go<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.549> would<00:01:14.640> probably<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> be

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
go for that it would probably have to be

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.240 
go for that it would probably have to be
the<00:01:15.479> bellows<00:01:15.810> because<00:01:16.200> they're<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the bellows because they're really the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
the bellows because they're really the
only<00:01:17.340> deepest<00:01:17.759> acting<00:01:18.119> I'd<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> form

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
only deepest acting I'd have to form

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.730 
only deepest acting I'd have to form
another<00:01:19.650> one

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590 

I'm<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.549> exactly<00:01:23.759> sure<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.299> want<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> do

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
I'm not exactly sure what I want to do

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600 
I'm not exactly sure what I want to do
it<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:24.840> them<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.860> gonna<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.460> been

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
it at them but I'm just gonna have been

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.289 
it at them but I'm just gonna have been
around<00:01:27.680> don't<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:29.820> willing<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.119> do

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
around don't know what I'm willing to do

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.100 
around don't know what I'm willing to do
with<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:31.610> but<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.090> see<00:01:33.270> i<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.810> going

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
with that but as you can see i was going

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.810 
with that but as you can see i was going
for<00:01:34.140> something<00:01:34.470> or<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.890> global<00:01:35.340> wrestling

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
for something or like a global wrestling

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.969 
for something or like a global wrestling
and<00:01:36.080> I<00:01:37.080> was<00:01:37.229> gonna<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> separate

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and I was gonna have a separate

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.340 
and I was gonna have a separate
television<00:01:38.520> title<00:01:38.720> but<00:01:39.720> then<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.869> figured<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
television title but then I figured that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.660 
television title but then I figured that
would<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.560> too<00:01:40.860> many<00:01:41.009> titles<00:01:41.189> i<00:01:41.430> wouldn't<00:01:41.610> be

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
would be too many titles i wouldn't be

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.910 
would be too many titles i wouldn't be
able<00:01:41.729> used<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.149> know<00:01:42.439> because<00:01:43.439> i<00:01:43.770> was

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
able used to know because i was

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.460 
able used to know because i was
originally<00:01:44.159> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:45.330> also<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.259> see

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
originally going to also have a you see

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.429 
originally going to also have a you see
if<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.100> say<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.640> WCW<00:01:48.390> show<00:01:48.750> i<00:01:48.990> was<00:01:49.110> gonna<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.409> it

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
if you say a WCW show i was gonna do it

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.730 
if you say a WCW show i was gonna do it
four<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:49.920> five<00:01:50.330> main<00:01:51.330> shows<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.590> then<00:01:52.710> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
four or five main shows but then a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.160 
four or five main shows but then a
figure<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.130> wasn't<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> good<00:01:53.520> idea<00:01:53.959> well<00:01:54.959> one

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
figure that wasn't a good idea well one

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.719 
figure that wasn't a good idea well one
thing<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.459> all<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
thing I would have to make up all the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.289 
thing I would have to make up all the
paper<00:01:56.850> booze<00:01:57.149> which<00:01:57.539> i<00:01:57.750> could<00:01:57.869> probably<00:01:58.200> get

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
paper booze which i could probably get

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.870 
paper booze which i could probably get
the<00:02:00.299> clashes<00:02:00.869> clash<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.709> Champions<00:02:01.770> dark<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the clashes clash of Champions dark and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.760 
the clashes clash of Champions dark and
then<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.330> could<00:02:03.479> probably<00:02:03.630> find<00:02:04.319> some<00:02:04.649> more

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
then I could probably find some more

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.550 
then I could probably find some more
diversity<00:02:05.250> paper<00:02:05.580> views<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.959> didn't<00:02:07.350> want

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
diversity paper views but I didn't want

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.930 
diversity paper views but I didn't want
to<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:09.119> mainstream<00:02:09.450> shoes<00:02:10.489> ok<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.549> now

to have to a mainstream shoes ok so now

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.340 
to have to a mainstream shoes ok so now
as<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.299> see<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.690> customization<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:14.330> the

as you can see the customization of the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.840 
as you can see the customization of the
cruiserweight<00:02:16.350> tag<00:02:16.560> team<00:02:16.799> titles<00:02:17.250> now<00:02:17.580> right

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
cruiserweight tag team titles now right

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.020 
cruiserweight tag team titles now right
here<00:02:18.739> didn't<00:02:19.739> know<00:02:19.830> exactly<00:02:20.069> what<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.700> wanted

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
here didn't know exactly what I wanted

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.309 
here didn't know exactly what I wanted
to<00:02:21.120> go<00:02:21.239> with<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:21.569> figured<00:02:21.840> I'd<00:02:21.930> go<00:02:22.049> with<00:02:22.140> that

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
to go with but figured I'd go with that

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.650 
to go with but figured I'd go with that
one<00:02:22.380> because<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.769> knew<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.819> other<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.360> i

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
one because I knew the other one i

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.240 
one because I knew the other one i
figured<00:02:25.140> i<00:02:25.170> would<00:02:25.290> use<00:02:25.410> for<00:02:25.440> television<00:02:26.099> title

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
figured i would use for television title

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.039 
figured i would use for television title
which<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.610> what<00:02:26.760> i<00:02:26.790> did<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.150> i<00:02:27.750> had<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> little

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
which is what i did and i had a little

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.780 
which is what i did and i had a little
bit<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.260> tough<00:02:28.590> choice<00:02:28.859> on<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.190> strap<00:02:29.519> color

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
bit of tough choice on the strap color

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.000 
bit of tough choice on the strap color
here<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.090> almost<00:02:30.450> went<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.989> blue<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
here I almost went with the blue but a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.039 
here I almost went with the blue but a
figure<00:02:32.250> Dwight<00:02:32.549> would<00:02:32.850> go<00:02:33.000> well<00:02:33.480> because<00:02:33.720> it's

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
figure Dwight would go well because it's

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.750 
figure Dwight would go well because it's
the<00:02:34.230> cruiserweights<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.489> thought<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
the cruiserweights and I thought the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.000 
the cruiserweights and I thought the
plating<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.510> look<00:02:36.630> good<00:02:36.840> for<00:02:37.109> you<00:02:37.739> know<00:02:37.829> like

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
plating just look good for you know like

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.340 
plating just look good for you know like
a<00:02:38.040> cruiserweight<00:02:38.519> title<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:39.090> seems<00:02:39.329> sort<00:02:40.290> of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
a cruiserweight title it seems sort of

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.500 
a cruiserweight title it seems sort of
simple<00:02:41.120> compact<00:02:42.200> small<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:45.239> isn't

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
simple compact small but this isn't

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.349 
simple compact small but this isn't
going<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.900> major<00:02:46.200> title<00:02:46.709> though<00:02:47.359> it's

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
going to be a major title though it's

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.360 
going to be a major title though it's
just<00:02:48.600> gonna<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.290> want<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.739> have<00:02:49.859> it<00:02:49.980> around<00:02:50.190> for

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
just gonna I want to have it around for

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.220 
just gonna I want to have it around for
a<00:02:50.400> little<00:02:50.549> bit<00:02:50.670> because<00:02:51.480> there<00:02:51.900> aren't<00:02:52.049> too

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
a little bit because there aren't too

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.470 
a little bit because there aren't too
many<00:02:52.260> cruiserweight<00:02:52.890> tag<00:02:53.100> teams<00:02:53.400> unless<00:02:54.329> I

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
many cruiserweight tag teams unless I

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.780 
many cruiserweight tag teams unless I
could<00:02:54.630> get<00:02:54.810> some<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.799> then<00:02:56.220> plus<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.609> TAC

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
could get some and then plus the TAC

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.160 
could get some and then plus the TAC
teams<00:02:57.030> are<00:02:57.150> divided<00:02:57.480> out<00:02:57.600> between<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.959> shows

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
teams are divided out between the shows

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.009 
teams are divided out between the shows
and<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:59.400> don't<00:02:59.579> want<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.819> have<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.239> can't<00:03:00.810> have

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
and I don't want to have I can't have

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.099 
and I don't want to have I can't have
one<00:03:01.500> title<00:03:02.100> for<00:03:02.370> all<00:03:02.640> three<00:03:03.000> shows<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.510> there

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
one title for all three shows so there

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.009 
one title for all three shows so there
have<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.410> be<00:03:04.470> at<00:03:04.590> least<00:03:04.620> two<00:03:05.010> tag<00:03:05.250> titles<00:03:05.639> and

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
have to be at least two tag titles and

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.240 
have to be at least two tag titles and
that<00:03:07.019> would<00:03:07.139> probably<00:03:07.170> split<00:03:07.799> for<00:03:08.100> one

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
that would probably split for one

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.000 
that would probably split for one
smackdown<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.389> mean<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.440> don't<00:03:10.560> know<00:03:10.799> I'm

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
smackdown so I mean I don't know I'm

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.360 
smackdown so I mean I don't know I'm
gonna<00:03:11.220> happen<00:03:11.609> I'm<00:03:12.180> gonna<00:03:12.329> use<00:03:12.540> these<00:03:12.720> for<00:03:13.049> now

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
gonna happen I'm gonna use these for now

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.949 
gonna happen I'm gonna use these for now
because<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.609> mean<00:03:14.760> they<00:03:14.850> look<00:03:15.060> cool<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.600> think

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
because I mean they look cool I think

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.150 
because I mean they look cool I think
the<00:03:16.019> crew<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.470> idea<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.829> cruiserweight

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
the crew the idea of a cruiserweight

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.210 
the crew the idea of a cruiserweight
tags<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.609> title<00:03:17.880> is

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
tags and title is

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.940 
tags and title is
is<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.400> great<00:03:18.640> idea<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:19.930> was<00:03:20.440> originally<00:03:20.620> going

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
is a great idea I was originally going

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.510 
is a great idea I was originally going
to<00:03:21.010> go<00:03:21.130> with<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.400> WCW<00:03:21.970> Cruiserweight<00:03:22.690> tag<00:03:22.870> team

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
to go with a WCW Cruiserweight tag team

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.320 
to go with a WCW Cruiserweight tag team
because<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.610> was<00:03:24.730> planning<00:03:24.850> on<00:03:24.970> having<00:03:25.150> a

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
because I was planning on having a

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.500 
because I was planning on having a
Debbie<00:03:25.510> CW<00:03:25.930> show<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.280> figured<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:28.030> couldn't

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
Debbie CW show but I figured I couldn't

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.630 
Debbie CW show but I figured I couldn't
really<00:03:28.660> have<00:03:28.900> monday<00:03:29.290> nitro<00:03:29.560> on<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.070> Wednesday
