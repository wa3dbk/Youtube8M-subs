around 100 files and queens and this of
course<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.600> because<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> bong<00:00:58.530> hall<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.859> a

silver player and they are a lot rarer
on<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> market<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:01.949> does<00:01:02.280> mean<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
on the market so that does mean a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.130 
on the market so that does mean a
bungled<00:01:03.090> does<00:01:03.300> actually<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.719> an<00:01:03.809> inflated

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
bungled does actually have an inflated

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.490 
bungled does actually have an inflated
price<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> 73<00:01:05.939> rated<00:01:06.390> player<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:07.200> looking

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
price for a 73 rated player then looking

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
price for a 73 rated player then looking
at<00:01:07.680> their<00:01:07.860> weak<00:01:08.040> foot<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> skill<00:01:08.850> moves<00:01:09.090> both

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
at their weak foot and skill moves both

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.240 
at their weak foot and skill moves both
players<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.720> exactly<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> same<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.979> four

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
players have exactly the same with four

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.429 
players have exactly the same with four
star<00:01:11.520> weak<00:01:11.729> foot<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.150> free<00:01:12.570> star<00:01:12.869> skill<00:01:13.200> moves

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
star weak foot and free star skill moves

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.590 
star weak foot and free star skill moves
then<00:01:13.979> finally<00:01:14.490> regarding<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> work<00:01:15.270> rates

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
then finally regarding the work rates

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.330 
then finally regarding the work rates
again<00:01:15.780> both<00:01:16.229> players<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.650> exactly<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> same

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
again both players have exactly the same

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.539 
again both players have exactly the same
with<00:01:17.820> medium<00:01:18.270> attacking<00:01:18.720> unmediated<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> this

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
with medium attacking unmediated so this

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.850 
with medium attacking unmediated so this
isn't<00:01:20.820> exactly<00:01:21.240> ideal<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:22.049> strikers<00:01:22.560> because

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
isn't exactly ideal for strikers because

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.100 
isn't exactly ideal for strikers because
normally<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.280> want<00:01:23.580> them<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.909> em<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.509> high

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
normally you want them to have em a high

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.960 
normally you want them to have em a high
attacking<00:01:25.770> work<00:01:26.040> read<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.729> nevertheless

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
attacking work read but nevertheless

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.149 
attacking work read but nevertheless
medium<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.720> medium<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.380> still<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> lot<00:01:28.979> better

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
medium and medium is still a lot better

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.490 
medium and medium is still a lot better
than<00:01:29.640> having<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.180> low<00:01:30.509> attacking<00:01:30.810> work<00:01:31.259> rate

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
than having a low attacking work rate

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.069 
than having a low attacking work rate
especially<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> striker<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.020> are

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
especially for a striker so we are

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.840 
especially for a striker so we are
moving<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.799> second<00:01:35.250> part<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> video

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
moving on to the second part the video

will get on the end of pretty much every
single<00:03:17.910> one<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.630> just<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.020> quick<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.350> no

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
single one it's just so quick that no

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.490 
single one it's just so quick that no
defenders<00:03:20.190> can<00:03:20.220> keep<00:03:20.610> all<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.000> also<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> bong

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
defenders can keep all of it also a bong

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.260 
defenders can keep all of it also a bong
horse<00:03:22.800> finishing<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.490> actually<00:03:23.850> very<00:03:23.880> good

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
horse finishing is actually very good

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.690 
horse finishing is actually very good
this<00:03:24.480> year<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.840> fifa<00:03:25.230> 14<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.920> even<00:03:26.520> though<00:03:26.610> it

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
this year on fifa 14 and even though it

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.480 
this year on fifa 14 and even though it
does<00:03:26.880> only<00:03:27.060> say<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.390> 72<00:03:28.020> full<00:03:28.200> rated<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:29.130> his<00:03:29.250> in

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
does only say a 72 full rated on his in

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.520 
does only say a 72 full rated on his in
game<00:03:29.670> stats<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.270> don't<00:03:31.020> believe<00:03:31.140> this<00:03:31.320> is

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
game stats I don't believe this is

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.260 
game stats I don't believe this is
reflective<00:03:32.160> of<00:03:32.190> his<00:03:32.520> in-game<00:03:32.700> abilities

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
reflective of his in-game abilities

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.600 
reflective of his in-game abilities
because<00:03:33.510> he<00:03:34.080> does<00:03:34.290> score<00:03:34.590> pretty<00:03:34.920> much<00:03:35.160> every

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
because he does score pretty much every

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.130 
because he does score pretty much every
one<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:35.820> one<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.180> get<00:03:36.330> him<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.600> with<00:03:37.110> a

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
one on one you get him and with a

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.810 
one on one you get him and with a
bungler<00:03:37.590> who<00:03:37.620> does<00:03:38.010> actually<00:03:38.220> have<00:03:38.520> many

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
bungler who does actually have many

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.760 
bungler who does actually have many
one-on-one<00:03:39.390> opportunities<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.620> is

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
one-on-one opportunities and this is

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.620 
one-on-one opportunities and this is
simply<00:03:41.040> because<00:03:41.430> he<00:03:41.760> can<00:03:41.910> blitz<00:03:42.180> through<00:03:42.390> all

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
simply because he can blitz through all

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.480 
simply because he can blitz through all
the<00:03:42.780> defense's<00:03:43.260> with<00:03:43.470> his<00:03:43.590> pace<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.040> get

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
the defense's with his pace and get

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.370 
the defense's with his pace and get
himself<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:45.060> one-on-one<00:03:45.450> with<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.900> goalkeeper

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
himself a one-on-one with the goalkeeper

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.920 
himself a one-on-one with the goalkeeper
but<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.950> be<00:03:47.100> fair<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.820> do<00:03:47.880> believe<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.660> all

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
but to be fair I do believe that all

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.020 
but to be fair I do believe that all
finishing<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.590> overpowered<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.460> fifa<00:03:50.790> 14

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
finishing is overpowered on fifa 14

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.540 
finishing is overpowered on fifa 14
simply<00:03:51.930> because<00:03:52.020> pretty<00:03:52.470> much<00:03:52.620> every<00:03:53.220> finesse

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
simply because pretty much every finesse

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.910 
simply because pretty much every finesse
shot<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.940> take<00:03:54.150> goes<00:03:54.420> in<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:55.110> even<00:03:55.710> though<00:03:55.740> it

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
shot you take goes in so even though it

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.190 
shot you take goes in so even though it
does<00:03:56.070> say<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.280> 74<00:03:57.090> rated<00:03:57.450> on<00:03:57.600> its<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:58.020> game

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
does say is 74 rated on its in game

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.260 
does say is 74 rated on its in game
stats<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.680> believe<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.610> higher<00:03:59.850> when<00:03:59.880> you

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
stats I believe this is higher when you

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.930 
stats I believe this is higher when you
do<00:04:00.450> take<00:04:00.690> finesse<00:04:01.020> shot<00:04:01.080> with<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> bong<00:04:01.890> bong<00:04:02.220> so

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
do take finesse shot with a bong bong so

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.610 
do take finesse shot with a bong bong so
then<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.330> does<00:04:03.510> actually<00:04:03.630> bring<00:04:04.020> onto<00:04:04.500> the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
then that does actually bring onto the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.320 
then that does actually bring onto the
part<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.130> video<00:04:05.430> where<00:04:05.460> talk<00:04:05.970> about<00:04:06.210> the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
part of the video where talk about the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.880 
part of the video where talk about the
amount<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.630> goals<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.140> assists<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.770> each

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
amount of goals and assists that each

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.650 
amount of goals and assists that each
player<00:04:08.220> got<00:04:08.460> within<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.880> same<00:04:09.060> month<00:04:09.270> games

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
player got within the same month games

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.140 
player got within the same month games
and<00:04:09.930> in<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.530> episode<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:11.250> played<00:04:11.790> 10<00:04:12.120> games

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
and in this episode I played 10 games

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.270 
and in this episode I played 10 games
with<00:04:12.720> both<00:04:12.960> players<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.530> they<00:04:13.920> were<00:04:13.980> also

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
with both players and they were also

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.310 
with both players and they were also
both<00:04:14.700> in<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.180> same<00:04:15.360> team<00:04:15.600> when<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:15.870> was<00:04:16.109> using

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
both in the same team when I was using

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.020 
both in the same team when I was using
them<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.739> that's<00:04:17.070> because<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.460> did<00:04:17.790> play<00:04:18.000> a

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
them and that's because I did play a

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.220 
them and that's because I did play a
formation<00:04:18.450> with<00:04:18.840> two<00:04:19.109> strikers<00:04:19.470> up<00:04:19.799> for

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
formation with two strikers up for

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.920 
formation with two strikers up for
so<00:04:20.830> I<00:04:20.860> can<00:04:21.460> see<00:04:21.670> benteke<00:04:22.360> managed<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.840> get

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
so I can see benteke managed to get

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.080 
so I can see benteke managed to get
himself<00:04:23.080> an<00:04:23.440> incredible<00:04:23.980> 10<00:04:24.250> goals<00:04:24.490> in<00:04:24.730> 10

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
himself an incredible 10 goals in 10

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.270 
himself an incredible 10 goals in 10
games<00:04:25.270> as<00:04:25.690> well<00:04:26.020> as<00:04:26.200> picking<00:04:26.560> up<00:04:26.710> seven

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
games as well as picking up seven

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.070 
games as well as picking up seven
assists<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.390> my<00:04:28.510> opinion<00:04:28.630> this<00:04:29.020> is

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
assists and in my opinion this is

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.290 
assists and in my opinion this is
absolutely<00:04:29.710> ridiculous<00:04:30.120> because<00:04:31.120> not<00:04:31.270> only

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
absolutely ridiculous because not only

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.360 
absolutely ridiculous because not only
did<00:04:31.660> he<00:04:31.720> manage<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:32.110> score<00:04:32.350> himself<00:04:32.740> one<00:04:33.160> goal

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
did he manage to score himself one goal

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.310 
did he manage to score himself one goal
per<00:04:33.640> game<00:04:33.880> he<00:04:34.330> also<00:04:34.510> managed<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.080> get<00:04:35.170> himself

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
per game he also managed to get himself

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.740 
per game he also managed to get himself
seven<00:04:36.010> assists<00:04:36.400> on<00:04:36.610> top<00:04:36.850> of<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.090> which<00:04:37.330> is

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
seven assists on top of that which is

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.560 
seven assists on top of that which is
pretty<00:04:38.380> ridiculous<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.880> they're<00:04:40.060> moving<00:04:40.240> on

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
pretty ridiculous so they're moving on

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.390 
pretty ridiculous so they're moving on
to<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.750> bongo<00:04:41.170> whore<00:04:41.350> again<00:04:41.530> this<00:04:41.920> guy<00:04:42.100> also

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
to a bongo whore again this guy also

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.130 
to a bongo whore again this guy also
actually<00:04:42.910> managed<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.240> get<00:04:43.360> himself<00:04:43.510> quite<00:04:44.080> a

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
actually managed to get himself quite a

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.290 
actually managed to get himself quite a
lot<00:04:44.410> of<00:04:44.530> goals<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.040> I<00:04:45.310> just<00:04:45.640> conceit<00:04:46.030> nine

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
lot of goals and I just conceit nine

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.690 
lot of goals and I just conceit nine
goals<00:04:46.570> in<00:04:46.690> 10<00:04:47.080> games<00:04:47.290> which<00:04:47.830> is<00:04:47.980> almost<00:04:48.190> won

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
goals in 10 games which is almost won

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.550 
goals in 10 games which is almost won
gold<00:04:48.940> per<00:04:49.210> game<00:04:49.480> which<00:04:49.900> is<00:04:50.080> very<00:04:50.290> good

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
gold per game which is very good

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.740 
gold per game which is very good
especially<00:04:50.980> for<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.520> silver<00:04:51.940> player<00:04:52.150> but<00:04:52.720> a
