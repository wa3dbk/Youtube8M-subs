it's yeah I guess it and and jackie chan

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.760 
it's yeah I guess it and and jackie chan
i<00:01:14.950> get<00:01:15.950> there<00:01:16.100> are<00:01:16.220> big<00:01:16.400> superstars<00:01:16.909> here

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.250 

it<00:01:21.770> looks<00:01:21.980> like<00:01:22.250> they<00:01:22.430> decided<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.270> ask<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:24.140> a

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
it looks like they decided to ask and a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.830 
it looks like they decided to ask and a
luggage<00:01:24.710> or<00:01:24.920> everyone<00:01:25.520> who<00:01:25.670> has<00:01:25.880> nothing<00:01:26.540> to
