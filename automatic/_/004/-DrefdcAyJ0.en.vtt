00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
this uh this jump with a pretty big gap

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.410 
this uh this jump with a pretty big gap
in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> middle<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.770> kill<00:00:47.160> ball<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> then

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
in the middle and a kill ball and then

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.880 
in the middle and a kill ball and then
at<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> beginning<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> goes

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
at the beginning it just kind of goes

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.560 
at the beginning it just kind of goes
and<00:00:50.190> rolls<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.670> then<00:00:50.760> falls<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> water<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
and rolls and then falls in the water it

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.660 
and rolls and then falls in the water it
takes<00:00:51.750> its<00:00:51.930> time<00:00:52.170> responding<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:53.430> set<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
takes its time responding it's set to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.160 
takes its time responding it's set to
one<00:00:53.879> second<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.600> falls<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> water<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
one second but it falls in the water it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.510 
one second but it falls in the water it
really<00:00:55.350> takes<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.860> don't<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.129> 15

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
really takes more like I don't know 15

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
really takes more like I don't know 15
or<00:00:56.550> 20<00:00:56.910> seconds<00:00:57.180> roughly<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:58.199> two

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
or 20 seconds roughly and then two

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
or 20 seconds roughly and then two
minutes<00:00:58.739> into<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> game<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.550> halfway<00:00:59.789> through

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
minutes into the game so halfway through

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.959 
minutes into the game so halfway through
this<00:01:00.510> bridge<00:01:00.989> will<00:01:01.260> spawn<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> kill<00:01:02.789> ball

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
this bridge will spawn so the kill ball

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.170 
this bridge will spawn so the kill ball
will<00:01:03.149> roll<00:01:03.180> down<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.549> or<00:01:05.549> it'll<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:05.880> launched

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
will roll down and or it'll get launched

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.370 
will roll down and or it'll get launched
over<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.450> roll<00:01:06.600> down<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> bridge<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.260> I'll

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
over to roll down the bridge and I'll

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.350 
over to roll down the bridge and I'll
hit<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> man<00:01:07.740> cannons<00:01:08.070> again<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.760> get

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
hit the man cannons again and get

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.230 
hit the man cannons again and get
launched<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.729> makes<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.909> whole<00:01:12.030> lot<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
launched and it makes for a whole lot of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.730 
launched and it makes for a whole lot of
explosions<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.530> little

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
explosions I think just in that little

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.499 
explosions I think just in that little
clip<00:01:13.920> there<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.400> uh<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:15.360> about

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
clip there it uh I think there about

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.999 
clip there it uh I think there about
seven<00:01:15.750> people<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> ended<00:01:16.470> up<00:01:16.560> dying<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.890> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
seven people that ended up dying in it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.310 
seven people that ended up dying in it
and<00:01:17.210> here<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.600> little<00:01:18.689> pile<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.140> it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and here you see this little pile up it

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.170 
and here you see this little pile up it
happens<00:01:19.770> every<00:01:20.250> single<00:01:20.369> time<00:01:20.549> no<00:01:20.909> matter<00:01:21.000> if

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
happens every single time no matter if

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.399 
happens every single time no matter if
the<00:01:21.240> people<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.570> played<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> map<00:01:21.990> before<00:01:22.140> or

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the people have played the map before or

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.530 
the people have played the map before or
not<00:01:22.610> every<00:01:23.610> time<00:01:23.790> there's<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> pile<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
not every time there's a pile up at the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.109 
not every time there's a pile up at the
very<00:01:24.570> beginning<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.759> because<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.909> don't<00:01:27.060> know

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.399 
it's kind of fun really but uh so you
just<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.750> get<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.900> point<00:01:31.110> every

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
just go up and you get a point every

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.719 
just go up and you get a point every
time<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.740> make<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.189> opposite<00:01:32.549> end

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
time you make it to the opposite end

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.770 
time you make it to the opposite end
it's<00:01:33.090> set<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.390> race<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.290> there's<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:35.420> one<00:01:36.420> set<00:01:36.689> at

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it's set in race so there's a one set at

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.080 
it's set in race so there's a one set at
spawn<00:01:36.990> sequence<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.590> spawn<00:01:37.890> sequence<00:01:38.189> two<00:01:38.430> so

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
spawn sequence one spawn sequence two so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.550 
spawn sequence one spawn sequence two so
they<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.689> keep<00:01:39.780> alternating<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.439> whole

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
they just keep alternating the whole

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.710 
they just keep alternating the whole
time<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.009> kind<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.060> wanted<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> make<00:01:42.630> this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
time I kind of wanted to make this

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.210 
time I kind of wanted to make this
compatible<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.350> battle<00:01:43.649> tracks<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.070> I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
compatible with battle tracks because I

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.499 
compatible with battle tracks because I
thought<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.490> would<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.700> been<00:01:44.759> sweet<00:01:45.000> but

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
thought that would have been sweet but

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.160 
thought that would have been sweet but
there's<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.350> no<00:01:46.560> way<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.740> could<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
there's really no way I could do it and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.139 
there's really no way I could do it and
if<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.350> figure<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> way<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
if I do figure out a way and I have the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.910 
if I do figure out a way and I have the
motivation<00:01:51.570> or<00:01:51.840> whatever<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.439> I'll<00:01:52.860> just

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
motivation or whatever then I'll just

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.410 
motivation or whatever then I'll just
release<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> new<00:01:53.399> video<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> guys

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
release a new video of it if you guys

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.270 
release a new video of it if you guys
have<00:01:54.600> any<00:01:54.720> ideas<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.320> how<00:01:55.409> i<00:01:55.890> could<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
have any ideas on how i could do that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.830 
have any ideas on how i could do that
realistically<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.600> still<00:01:57.780> be

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
realistically to have it still be

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.990 
realistically to have it still be
chaotic<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.549> you're<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.790> going

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
chaotic and not so you're just going

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.330 
chaotic and not so you're just going
around<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.479> NASCAR<00:02:01.020> style<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:01.619> uh<00:02:01.649> just

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
around like NASCAR style but uh just

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.170 
around like NASCAR style but uh just
leave<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.729> comments<00:02:02.909> I'll

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
leave that in the comments I'll

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.149 
leave that in the comments I'll
definitely<00:02:03.299> take<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.659> look<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.159> usually

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
definitely take a look at it usually

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.620 
definitely take a look at it usually
after<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.430> upload<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> video<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> half

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
after I upload a video for like a half

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.089 
after I upload a video for like a half
hour<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.200> respond<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.740> every<00:02:08.069> single

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
hour I just respond to every single

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.230 
hour I just respond to every single
comment<00:02:08.640> so

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
comment so

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.570 
comment so
even<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.320> later<00:02:10.500> I'll<00:02:10.710> still<00:02:11.130> respond<00:02:11.460> if

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
even if it's later I'll still respond if

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.460 
even if it's later I'll still respond if
you've<00:02:11.670> got<00:02:11.850> some<00:02:12.000> nice<00:02:12.180> input<00:02:12.510> whatever<00:02:12.870> so

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
you've got some nice input whatever so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.220 
you've got some nice input whatever so
it's<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:14.040> nice<00:02:14.790> little<00:02:14.970> 4-minute<00:02:15.690> game<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:16.080> I

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
it's a nice little 4-minute game as I

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.520 
it's a nice little 4-minute game as I
said<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.710> every<00:02:17.040> 45<00:02:17.610> seconds<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:19.080> might<00:02:19.290> see

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
said and every 45 seconds you might see

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.560 
said and every 45 seconds you might see
that<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.830> walls<00:02:20.100> will<00:02:20.760> get<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.270> little<00:02:21.480> bit

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
that the walls will get a little bit

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.050 
that the walls will get a little bit
closer<00:02:21.840> or<00:02:22.170> narrower<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.580> map<00:02:23.820> will<00:02:23.940> get

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
closer or narrower the map will get

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.570 
closer or narrower the map will get
narrower<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> used<00:02:25.590> every<00:02:25.770> wall<00:02:26.070> Coliseum

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
narrower so I used every wall Coliseum

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.120 
narrower so I used every wall Coliseum
it's<00:02:26.760> not<00:02:26.940> modded<00:02:27.360> or<00:02:27.540> anything<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.020> just

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
it's not modded or anything it's just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.470 
it's not modded or anything it's just
however<00:02:29.130> many<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.520> have<00:02:29.610> what<00:02:29.820> 50<00:02:30.300> I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
however many going to have what 50 I

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.550 
however many going to have what 50 I
think<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.160> worked<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.240> out<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.660> at<00:02:33.990> 45

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
think so I worked it out so that at 45

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.040 
think so I worked it out so that at 45
seconds<00:02:35.130> 90<00:02:35.880> seconds<00:02:36.480> hundred<00:02:36.870> and

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
seconds 90 seconds hundred and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.250 
seconds 90 seconds hundred and
thirty-five<00:02:37.560> seconds<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.160> then<00:02:38.780> 180<00:02:39.780> seconds

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
thirty-five seconds and then 180 seconds

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.220 
thirty-five seconds and then 180 seconds
the<00:02:40.680> walls<00:02:40.890> will<00:02:41.270> keep<00:02:42.270> coming<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.990> so

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the walls will keep coming in on you so

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.840 
the walls will keep coming in on you so
it<00:02:43.830> gets<00:02:44.160> narrow<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.550> there's<00:02:44.700> more

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
it gets narrow and there's more

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.100 
it gets narrow and there's more
collisions<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.450> all<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.870> gets<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:46.020> little

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
collisions and all that it gets a little

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.190 
collisions and all that it gets a little
bit<00:02:46.290> more<00:02:46.380> chaotic<00:02:46.740> it's<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.790> good<00:02:47.940> time

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
bit more chaotic it's a it's a good time

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.510 
bit more chaotic it's a it's a good time
the<00:02:49.200> only<00:02:49.380> real<00:02:49.590> problem<00:02:49.800> with<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.490> that

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
the only real problem with that is that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.270 
the only real problem with that is that
you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.480> get<00:02:52.170> stuck<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.770> wall<00:02:52.920> if<00:02:53.160> you're

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
you can get stuck in the wall if you're

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.070 
you can get stuck in the wall if you're
just<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.580> sitting<00:02:53.970> there<00:02:54.210> but<00:02:54.930> that's

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
just like sitting there but that's

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.430 
just like sitting there but that's
usually<00:02:55.380> not<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.530> problem<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:57.080> it's<00:02:58.080> more<00:02:58.260> fun

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
usually not a problem and it's more fun

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
usually not a problem and it's more fun
if<00:02:58.530> people<00:02:58.770> go<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.010> middle<00:02:59.220> anyway

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
if people go in the middle anyway

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.410 
if people go in the middle anyway
because<00:02:59.580> then<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.850> could<00:02:59.970> run<00:03:00.120> into<00:03:00.300> people

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
because then you could run into people

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.480 
because then you could run into people
and<00:03:00.600> die<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.110> all<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.620> everybody<00:03:02.130> loves

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
and die and all that and everybody loves

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.590 
and die and all that and everybody loves
that<00:03:02.640> right<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:04.550> you'll<00:03:05.550> see<00:03:05.790> there<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.060> I

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
that right so you'll see there that I

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.840 
that right so you'll see there that I
got<00:03:07.320> hit<00:03:07.650> or<00:03:07.680> whatever<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.280> flipped<00:03:08.550> over<00:03:08.700> and

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
got hit or whatever I flipped over and

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.150 
got hit or whatever I flipped over and
then<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.180> tried<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.660> make<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.900> jump<00:03:10.140> from<00:03:10.230> part

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
then I tried to make the jump from part

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.460 
then I tried to make the jump from part
of<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> way<00:03:11.460> already<00:03:12.240> there<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:13.140> barely

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
of the way already there and I barely

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.740 
of the way already there and I barely
made<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.740> over<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.010> jump<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.790> really<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.540> works

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
made it over the jump so really it works

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.230 
made it over the jump so really it works
out<00:03:15.960> to<00:03:15.990> where<00:03:16.290> if<00:03:16.560> somebody<00:03:17.130> hits<00:03:17.460> you<00:03:17.610> when

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
out to where if somebody hits you when

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.340 
out to where if somebody hits you when
you're<00:03:18.420> about<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.690> go<00:03:18.780> over<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.960> jump<00:03:19.200> like

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
you're about to go over the jump like

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.510 
you're about to go over the jump like
that<00:03:19.380> guy<00:03:19.710> just<00:03:19.860> hit<00:03:20.070> right<00:03:20.220> there<00:03:20.250> I

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
that guy just hit right there I

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.340 
that guy just hit right there I
guarantee<00:03:20.940> he<00:03:21.060> died<00:03:21.240> and<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.200> know<00:03:22.320> I

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
guarantee he died and then you know I

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.750 
guarantee he died and then you know I
get<00:03:22.530> some<00:03:22.650> nice<00:03:22.770> little<00:03:22.980> instant<00:03:23.310> karma<00:03:23.610> this

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
get some nice little instant karma this

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.130 
get some nice little instant karma this
guy<00:03:23.880> thought<00:03:24.060> it'd<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.180> hilarious<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.750> push<00:03:24.990> me

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
guy thought it'd be hilarious to push me

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.390 
guy thought it'd be hilarious to push me
in<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.230> kill<00:03:25.380> ball<00:03:25.560> kill<00:03:25.740> us<00:03:25.860> both<00:03:26.070> but

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
in the kill ball kill us both but

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.460 
in the kill ball kill us both but
whatever<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.300> basically<00:03:27.960> you<00:03:28.140> have<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.290> have<00:03:28.440> a

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
whatever so basically you have to have a

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.840 
whatever so basically you have to have a
pretty<00:03:28.710> good<00:03:28.770> amount<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.100> speed<00:03:29.430> because

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
pretty good amount of speed because

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.490 
pretty good amount of speed because
that's<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.210> way<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.450> jump<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.750> set<00:03:30.900> up<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:31.080> if

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
that's the way the jump is set up so if

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.100 
that's the way the jump is set up so if
you<00:03:31.980> do<00:03:32.220> hit<00:03:32.430> somebody<00:03:32.790> or<00:03:33.300> some<00:03:33.630> obstacles

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
you do hit somebody or some obstacles

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.660 
you do hit somebody or some obstacles
that<00:03:34.170> you'll<00:03:34.290> see<00:03:34.470> later<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.770> uh<00:03:34.980> then

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
that you'll see later that uh then

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.370 
that you'll see later that uh then
you'll<00:03:35.820> have<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.060> back<00:03:36.240> up<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.600> bit<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.080> then

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
you'll have to back up a bit and then

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.990 
you'll have to back up a bit and then
get<00:03:37.800> your<00:03:37.890> speed<00:03:38.160> back<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.580> all<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.820> and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
get your speed back and all that and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.220 
get your speed back and all that and
then<00:03:39.060> you'll<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.570> able<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.840> actually<00:03:39.930> make<00:03:40.140> it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
then you'll be able to actually make it

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.610 
then you'll be able to actually make it
over<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.440> jump<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:42.390> main<00:03:42.720> things<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:43.200> spawn

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
over the jump the main things that spawn

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.440 
over the jump the main things that spawn
or<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.130> walls<00:03:44.340> making<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.000> narrower<00:03:45.270> of

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
or the walls making it narrower of

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.450 
or the walls making it narrower of
course<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:45.960> can<00:03:46.080> see<00:03:46.260> how<00:03:46.410> he's<00:03:47.280> already

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
course you can see how he's already

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.860 
course you can see how he's already
encroached<00:03:47.880> on<00:03:48.090> about<00:03:48.390> half<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:50.720> half<00:03:51.720> of

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
encroached on about half of the half of

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.230 
encroached on about half of the half of
the<00:03:51.960> 5<00:03:52.140> by<00:03:52.320> 5<00:03:52.950> s<00:03:53.160> on<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.340> sides<00:03:53.550> there<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.030> it's

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
the 5 by 5 s on the sides there and it's

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.390 
the 5 by 5 s on the sides there and it's
just<00:03:54.510> 35<00:03:54.990> by<00:03:55.170> 5's<00:03:55.500> side<00:03:55.800> by<00:03:55.950> side<00:03:56.130> so<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.310> can

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
just 35 by 5's side by side so you can

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.980 
just 35 by 5's side by side so you can
see<00:03:56.640> how<00:03:56.670> big<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:56.970> middle<00:03:57.210> it<00:03:57.300> is<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.630> then

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
see how big the middle it is and then

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.660 
see how big the middle it is and then
you<00:03:58.080> can<00:03:58.230> see<00:03:58.470> only<00:03:58.740> about<00:03:59.010> half<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.520> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
you can see only about half of the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.550 
you can see only about half of the
outside<00:04:00.060> ones<00:04:00.270> so<00:04:00.840> that's<00:04:01.020> just<00:04:01.080> a<00:04:01.230> reference

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
outside ones so that's just a reference

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.620 
outside ones so that's just a reference
of<00:04:01.710> how<00:04:01.920> much<00:04:02.100> thinner<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.000> maps<00:04:03.180> getting<00:04:03.480> you

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
of how much thinner the maps getting you

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.060 
of how much thinner the maps getting you
might<00:04:03.750> not<00:04:03.900> notice<00:04:04.140> as<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.380> go<00:04:04.560> along<00:04:04.650> but

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
might not notice as you go along but

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.800 
might not notice as you go along but
every<00:04:05.970> time<00:04:06.090> I've<00:04:06.240> played<00:04:06.270> it<00:04:06.570> I've<00:04:06.660> heard

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
every time I've played it I've heard

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.530 
every time I've played it I've heard
people<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:07.200> go<00:04:07.350> whoa<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.490> mad<00:04:08.670> leg<00:04:08.910> is<00:04:09.420> it

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
people just go whoa so mad leg is it

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.990 
people just go whoa so mad leg is it
getting<00:04:09.630> smaller<00:04:10.110> or<00:04:10.410> something<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.640> then<00:04:11.880> you

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
getting smaller or something so then you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.610 
getting smaller or something so then you
see<00:04:12.180> there<00:04:12.330> in<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.630> ground<00:04:12.840> hidden<00:04:13.170> are<00:04:13.350> some

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
see there in the ground hidden are some

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.440 
see there in the ground hidden are some
two<00:04:13.890> by<00:04:14.040> two<00:04:14.100> steeps<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:15.150> are<00:04:15.270> slightly

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
two by two steeps that are slightly

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.170 
two by two steeps that are slightly
submerged<00:04:15.990> there's<00:04:16.680> spawn<00:04:16.980> at<00:04:17.160> 180<00:04:17.760> seconds

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
submerged there's spawn at 180 seconds

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.479 
submerged there's spawn at 180 seconds
and<00:04:18.330> if<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.510> hit<00:04:18.630> them<00:04:18.690> like<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:19.070> OOP<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.400> do

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
and if you hit them like this OOP you do

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.000 
and if you hit them like this OOP you do
a<00:04:20.520> barrel<00:04:20.880> roll<00:04:20.910> it's<00:04:21.359> really<00:04:21.890> not

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
a barrel roll it's really not

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.680 
a barrel roll it's really not
like<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.190> trick<00:04:23.670> on<00:04:23.820> purpose<00:04:24.180> it's<00:04:24.360> supposed<00:04:24.630> to

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
like a trick on purpose it's supposed to

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.390 
like a trick on purpose it's supposed to
just<00:04:24.840> make<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.380> when<00:04:25.920> you're<00:04:26.040> trying<00:04:26.310> to

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
just make it so when you're trying to

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.650 
just make it so when you're trying to
head<00:04:26.520> over<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.820> jumps<00:04:27.090> then<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.300> hit<00:04:27.420> it<00:04:27.540> and

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
head over the jumps then you hit it and

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.730 
head over the jumps then you hit it and
then<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.900> lose<00:04:28.050> your<00:04:28.170> speed<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.440> then<00:04:28.650> you're
