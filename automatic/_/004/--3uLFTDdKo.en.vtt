00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.240
 welcome to a long life so the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.090
 series in which the scale of extensions 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.860
 to get well prepared in this one 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.320
 episode we take the stupid plus 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.089
 in-line skating 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.150
 mark horsten and lars sheenstra no 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.010
 explanation and three tips to get yourself through that 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
 to learn on a cat 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 well i guess we don't have that moment at home 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.650
 really know what a book by rusty 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.470
 not exactly 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.170
 are you going to be able to explain that , I read 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.520
 can make a try about it is the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.870
 intent by zucchini when you get to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.550
 the regular sales that you go to the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.620
 side that goes with skates too 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.020
 if you are at a time when you feel like it 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.730
 done your stand drop, and with 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.230
 the other leg a pendulum inside 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.270
 make out 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.879
 there are your right holes you sit normally 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.129
 and stretch out a little that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.350
 down and then manage the deduction it now 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.530
 move to the left that you are more 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.360
 and of course it will skate 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.620
 or rollerblading this case from the inside 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.710
 and then with your nice set more 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.619
 over and over , fiction creates why 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.299
 do you do this it is a piece of sales 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.229
 see you wanted to continue and it is 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.450
 a bit of relaxation 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.220
 so if you run long 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.570
 for example a marathon then it gives 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.210
 also a bit of relaxation in the battle 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.140
 because if you only skate on 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.630
 the skaters then do it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.630
 yes for that you will use you very quickly 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.950
 it at any distance and a female 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.240
 long distances use it like 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.460
 mark you also have something more 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.470
 relaxation and then you just love more 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.130
 dynamic battle day 2 what is her 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.540
 fast 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.250
 it depends on your run when you 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.200
 be able to perform it properly 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.390
 your body is also suitable then 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.040
 then you can get the most out of it 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.360
 heart but I told you personally 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 Some people do it my sister 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.659
 michel mulder does not and they are 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.850
 so at world level 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.390
 and you do much more polish than 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.070
 sheep I think yes I try to do it 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.420
 also do on the sprint distances i want me 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.130
 should not have the fat legs 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.490
 so really still the technology so me 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.649
 train a lot up and had the ek wk the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.689
 results are getting better so it 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.700
 it helps if you were to zoom 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.710
 must explain in a step-by-step plan 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.659
 a beginner how which steps would 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.619
 for balkan you can take a three 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.149
 explain steps 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.039
 all is is very important you on one on 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.140
 your legs on you due to problem 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.260
 so you have almost stability 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.630
 which role in a straight line and then 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.390
 next step after the balance is it 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.640
 it is important that you can both go on a twink 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.740
 so the ideal exercise for that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.930
 is the slalom I want you to start whole 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.610
 calm down and try at the last pawn 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.590
 so they generate a lot of speed 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.720
 by depositing ever harder 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.980
 to do on one leg music that forms the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.830
 are all pawns 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.360
 or so and in between you go yes yes 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.310
 simple it really can't just be 10 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.230
 putting down pawns quietly and on 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.910
 ab the in between and then 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.410
 generate speed both with the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.200
 outer sales 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.180
 as the inner cat and then have the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.950
 final step 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.209
 yes bella step is important so if you 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.500
 continuous 3% 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.720
 You are practicing that people can just do it 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.640
 they really only go 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.500
 a few now in the cat they go they go 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.080
 train and they forget their regular 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.160
 closes the regular sales 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.630
 remains in fact still the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.700
 most important sales if you don't 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.290
 doing well then you still love it completely 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.510
 no fast it you only you do this you 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.930
 normal outlet your stretch by you come on 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.180
 your standing leg and you get too far past five 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.560
 your let your body weight let you on 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.510
 the outside 4 leg fall on one 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.910
 bit like a manager stretch with you 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.380
 first sale 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.030
 here is the sales you get and that 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.130
 moment you catch up 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.350
 stretch that from your hips you stretch 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.610
 tie a bow tie through 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.040
 and then you fall back and it starts 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.780
 again and moments at half past 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.730

 that his tribe with him exactly under the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.430
 shoulder comes gives the opportunity to 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.510
 that they really help and also help 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.510
 right and marketing
