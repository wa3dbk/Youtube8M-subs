I<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.610> were<00:01:35.700> things<00:01:36.000> work<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.390> what

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
I know what were things work and what

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
I know what were things work and what
doesn't<00:01:36.659> work<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:36.930> my<00:01:37.020> body<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.470> always

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
doesn't work for my body I always

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.730 
doesn't work for my body I always
believe<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> basics<00:01:39.470> which<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
believe in the basics which is going to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.120 
believe in the basics which is going to
be<00:01:40.799> your<00:01:41.040> your<00:01:41.850> arginine<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.930> creatine<00:01:43.170> your

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
be your your arginine your creatine your

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.050 
be your your arginine your creatine your
branch<00:01:44.399> change<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:45.479> glutamine<00:01:45.960> okay<00:01:47.060> those

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
branch change your glutamine okay those

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.569 
branch change your glutamine okay those
are<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> make<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.950> consist<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
are going to make up the consist of the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.330 
are going to make up the consist of the
extra<00:01:50.970> base<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.930> my<00:01:52.170> pre-workout<00:01:52.409> stack<00:01:52.950> stack

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
extra base of my pre-workout stack stack

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.399 
extra base of my pre-workout stack stack
so<00:01:53.700> that's<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.030> top<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.930> razor<00:01:55.140> eight

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
so that's on top of the razor eight

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.440 
so that's on top of the razor eight
supplementation<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.030> said<00:01:57.180> I'm<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> little

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
supplementation like I said I'm a little

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.670 
supplementation like I said I'm a little
bit<00:01:57.570> bigger<00:01:57.689> guy<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
bit bigger guy and I like to have a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.020 
bit bigger guy and I like to have a
little<00:01:58.770> bit<00:01:58.950> more<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.189> concentration<00:01:59.909> of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
little bit more of a concentration of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.480 
little bit more of a concentration of
certain<00:02:00.869> ingredients<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.310> why<00:02:02.460> I

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
certain ingredients so that's why I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.249 
certain ingredients so that's why I
start<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> razor<00:02:03.149> 8<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> which<00:02:04.079> already

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
start with a razor 8 and which already

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.080 
start with a razor 8 and which already
contains<00:02:04.710> all<00:02:04.979> those<00:02:05.159> ingredients<00:02:05.340> except

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
contains all those ingredients except

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.150 
contains all those ingredients except
for<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.270> glutamine<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.140> I'll<00:02:07.259> add<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.649> 10

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
for the glutamine so I'll add in 10

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.820 
for the glutamine so I'll add in 10
grams<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.610> glutamine<00:02:09.110> add<00:02:10.110> in

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
grams of glutamine add in

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.760 
grams of glutamine add in
five<00:02:11.610> grams<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.120> arginine<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:13.470> add<00:02:13.620> in

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
five grams of the arginine and I add in

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.070 
five grams of the arginine and I add in
10<00:02:14.070> grams<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.550> l<00:02:14.940> glutamine<00:02:15.090> most<00:02:15.870> people

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
even use glucose to glycogen um so you

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.970 
even use glucose to glycogen um so you
want<00:03:12.900> them<00:03:12.990> I<00:03:13.110> would<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> make<00:03:13.770> sure<00:03:13.950> my

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
want them I would like to make sure my

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.650 
want them I would like to make sure my
body<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.490> saturated<00:03:14.970> some<00:03:15.090> creatine<00:03:15.360> so

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
body is saturated some creatine so

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.509 
body is saturated some creatine so
therefore<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.050> ATP<00:03:16.410> conversion<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.100> and

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
therefore the ATP conversion of and

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.540 
therefore the ATP conversion of and
expenditure<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.900> being<00:03:19.230> met<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.739> being<00:03:20.459> able

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
expenditure is being met and being able

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.270 
expenditure is being met and being able
to<00:03:20.790> recover<00:03:21.150> between<00:03:21.600> sets<00:03:21.840> as<00:03:22.110> well<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.890> then

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
to recover between sets as well and then

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.030 
to recover between sets as well and then
glue<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.820> glutamine<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.510> most<00:03:25.350> abundant

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
glue the glutamine is a most abundant

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.880 
glue the glutamine is a most abundant
amino<00:03:26.220> acid<00:03:26.550> found<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.820> muscle<00:03:27.300> tissues<00:03:27.630> and

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
amino acid found in muscle tissues and

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.620 
amino acid found in muscle tissues and
it's<00:03:28.890> great<00:03:29.220> for<00:03:29.370> not<00:03:29.550> only<00:03:29.670> at<00:03:30.420> boosting

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
it's great for not only at boosting

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.540 
it's great for not only at boosting
immune<00:03:30.810> system<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:32.100> as<00:03:32.330> it's<00:03:33.330> for<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:34.550> muscle

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
immune system but as it's for a muscle

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.310 
immune system but as it's for a muscle
recovery<00:03:35.760> agent<00:03:36.239> as<00:03:36.330> well<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:36.870> when<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.230> keep

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
recovery agent as well so when you keep

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.500 
recovery agent as well so when you keep
your<00:03:37.470> glutamine<00:03:37.769> stores<00:03:38.040> up<00:03:38.360> basically<00:03:39.360> your

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
your glutamine stores up basically your

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.430 
your glutamine stores up basically your
bought<00:03:39.660> your<00:03:39.810> muscly<00:03:39.959> able<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.260> recover

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
bought your muscly able to recover

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.380 
bought your muscly able to recover
quicker<00:03:40.769> you<00:03:40.980> don't<00:03:41.130> get<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> sore<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.880> things

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
quicker you don't get a sore and things

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.790 
quicker you don't get a sore and things
of<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.510> nature<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:43.080> glutamine<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.560> branch

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
of that nature so glutamine and branch

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.509 
of that nature so glutamine and branch
chains<00:03:44.010> are<00:03:44.190> great<00:03:44.940> for<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.360> muscle<00:03:45.720> recovery

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
chains are great for a muscle recovery

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.400 
chains are great for a muscle recovery
not<00:03:47.519> through<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> fast<00:03:47.970> gainer<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.450> would

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
not through a fast gainer I would

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.650 
not through a fast gainer I would
recommend<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.940> serving<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.120> car<00:03:51.269> by<00:03:51.450> on

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
recommend a serving of the car by on

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.630 
recommend a serving of the car by on
which<00:03:52.110> is<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.290> blend<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.590> some<00:03:52.769> carbohydrates

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
which is a blend of some carbohydrates

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.340 
which is a blend of some carbohydrates

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.790 
now we got um the cream magnaval and
team<00:04:52.620> no<00:04:53.040> vol<00:04:53.250> okay<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.230> those<00:04:55.230> are<00:04:55.260> basically

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
team no vol okay and those are basically

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.620 
team no vol okay and those are basically
this<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.400> your<00:04:56.610> no.2<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:57.450> is<00:04:57.600> a

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
this is your no.2 this is a

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.480 
this is your no.2 this is a
concentration<00:04:58.140> time-released<00:04:58.950> amount<00:04:59.280> of

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
concentration time-released amount of

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.910 
concentration time-released amount of
l-arginine<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.240> this<00:05:01.080> is<00:05:01.230> time<00:05:01.410> release<00:05:01.650> of

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
l-arginine and this is time release of

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.820 
l-arginine and this is time release of
creatine<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:03.570> I'll<00:05:04.020> actually<00:05:04.260> take<00:05:04.590> those

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
creatine and so I'll actually take those

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.640 
creatine and so I'll actually take those
in<00:05:05.160> addition<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.760> my<00:05:06.260> my<00:05:07.260> powdered

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
use l-carnitine a lot of different

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.320 
use l-carnitine a lot of different
things<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.230> an<00:06:07.500> alpha<00:06:07.770> lipoic<00:06:07.919> acid<00:06:08.160> to<00:06:09.120> round

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
things and an alpha lipoic acid to round

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.080 
things and an alpha lipoic acid to round
out<00:06:09.480> this<00:06:09.630> my<00:06:09.900> pre-workout<00:06:10.320> stack<00:06:10.830> is<00:06:11.070> a<00:06:11.130> it's

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
out this my pre-workout stack is a it's

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.490 
out this my pre-workout stack is a it's
a<00:06:12.180> great<00:06:12.360> antioxidant<00:06:12.690> it<00:06:13.140> helps<00:06:13.320> the<00:06:13.410> body

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
a great antioxidant it helps the body

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.090 
a great antioxidant it helps the body
create<00:06:13.890> a<00:06:13.919> kill<00:06:14.310> free<00:06:14.460> radicals<00:06:14.880> so<00:06:15.030> basically

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
create a kill free radicals so basically

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.470 
create a kill free radicals so basically
when<00:06:17.100> i'm<00:06:17.190> working<00:06:17.310> out<00:06:17.580> your<00:06:17.880> body's<00:06:18.150> correct

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
when i'm working out your body's correct

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.150 
when i'm working out your body's correct
causing<00:06:18.840> a<00:06:18.900> lot<00:06:19.020> of<00:06:19.050> cellular<00:06:19.560> destruction

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
causing a lot of cellular destruction

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.010 
causing a lot of cellular destruction
okay<00:06:20.400> you<00:06:20.460> guys<00:06:20.730> are<00:06:20.910> is<00:06:21.210> cutting<00:06:21.780> a<00:06:21.810> lot<00:06:21.900> of

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
okay you guys are is cutting a lot of

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.330 
okay you guys are is cutting a lot of
micro<00:06:22.260> tears<00:06:22.470> a<00:06:22.590> lot<00:06:22.740> of<00:06:22.800> trauma<00:06:22.980> inside<00:06:23.190> the

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
micro tears a lot of trauma inside the

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.880 
micro tears a lot of trauma inside the
muscle<00:06:23.640> tissue<00:06:23.820> and<00:06:24.120> so<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.590> alpha<00:06:25.770> lipoic

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
muscle tissue and so the alpha lipoic

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.010 
muscle tissue and so the alpha lipoic
helps<00:06:26.280> to<00:06:26.400> neutralize<00:06:26.580> that<00:06:26.880> so<00:06:27.540> it<00:06:27.630> kills<00:06:27.840> the

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
helps to neutralize that so it kills the

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.720 
helps to neutralize that so it kills the
free<00:06:28.169> radicals<00:06:28.590> it<00:06:28.800> also<00:06:29.190> another<00:06:29.310> great<00:06:29.490> um

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
free radicals it also another great um

free radicals it also another great um
bonus<00:06:30.540> of<00:06:30.660> the<00:06:30.750> alpha<00:06:30.990> lipoic<00:06:31.110> acid<00:06:31.290> is<00:06:31.770> that

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
bonus of the alpha lipoic acid is that

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.580 
bonus of the alpha lipoic acid is that
helps<00:06:32.820> with<00:06:32.940> insulin<00:06:33.240> sensitivity<00:06:33.630> so<00:06:34.440> while

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
helps with insulin sensitivity so while

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.560 
helps with insulin sensitivity so while
I'm<00:06:34.680> training<00:06:34.979> my<00:06:35.280> muscles<00:06:36.030> bellies<00:06:36.300> become

very sensitive
insulin<00:06:38.230> sensitive<00:06:38.620> and<00:06:38.800> they're<00:06:38.890> going<00:06:39.010> to

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100 
insulin sensitive and they're going to

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.710 
insulin sensitive and they're going to
be<00:06:39.250> more<00:06:39.490> receptive<00:06:39.760> on<00:06:40.030> taking<00:06:40.360> in<00:06:40.480> a<00:06:40.570> lot<00:06:40.600> of
