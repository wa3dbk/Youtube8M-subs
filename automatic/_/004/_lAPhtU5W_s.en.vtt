00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
stood still for a couple of seconds and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.840 
stood still for a couple of seconds and
this<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> worst<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.159> member<00:01:32.460> i<00:01:32.490> usually

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this is the worst a member i usually

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.359 
this is the worst a member i usually
play<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> 3<00:01:33.479> sensitive<00:01:33.930> yeah<00:01:34.530> 3<00:01:34.860> sensitivity

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
play on a 3 sensitive yeah 3 sensitivity

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.030 
play on a 3 sensitive yeah 3 sensitivity
and<00:01:35.520> i<00:01:35.909> switched<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.750> 7<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:37.650> while

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and i switched up to a 7 because while

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.530 
and i switched up to a 7 because while
sniping<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> need<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> little<00:01:39.150> higher

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
sniping you need a little higher

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.630 
sniping you need a little higher
sensitivity<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.320> when<00:01:40.920> i<00:01:40.950> use<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> machine

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
sensitivity and when i use a machine

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.850

hold also that's why my aim is kind of

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.539 
hold also that's why my aim is kind of
weird<00:01:46.350> when<00:01:46.560> I'm<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.799> using<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.189> sniper<00:01:47.430> rifle

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
weird when I'm not using a sniper rifle

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.149 
weird when I'm not using a sniper rifle

sleight of hand was new and it was
actually<00:01:58.409> quite<00:01:58.740> easy<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.159> quickscope<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> in

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
actually quite easy to quickscope and in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.789 
actually quite easy to quickscope and in
this<00:02:00.149> game<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.479> guess<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:01.110> well<00:02:01.560> although

difficult<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:08.069> sniping<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:08.759> if<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
difficult to be sniping but if you

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.540 
difficult to be sniping but if you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
pretty easy as you will see in this game
