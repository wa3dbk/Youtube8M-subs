comm and I'm going to show you how to
hook<00:00:05.490> up<00:00:05.700> your<00:00:06.200> automatic<00:00:07.200> water<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:08.160> a

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
hook up your automatic water to a

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.310 
hook up your automatic water to a
typical<00:00:08.639> garden<00:00:09.179> hose<00:00:09.389> or<00:00:09.420> spigot<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.200> this

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
typical garden hose or spigot in this

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.990 
typical garden hose or spigot in this
case<00:00:10.530> I'm<00:00:10.710> going<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.920> use<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> garden<00:00:11.550> hose

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
case I'm going to use a garden hose

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.839 
case I'm going to use a garden hose
so<00:00:12.330> here<00:00:12.509> are<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> parts<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.200> get<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
so here are the parts you get with the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.820 
so here are the parts you get with the
kit<00:00:15.240> we're<00:00:16.109> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> get<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> pressure

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
kit we're going to get a pressure

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.220 
kit we're going to get a pressure
reducer<00:00:17.820> valve<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:19.170> hooks<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.189> end

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
reducer valve it hooks on with this end

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.380 
reducer valve it hooks on with this end
to<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> standard<00:00:22.740> garden<00:00:23.100> hose<00:00:23.519> or<00:00:23.789> spigot<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to a standard garden hose or spigot and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.900 
to a standard garden hose or spigot and
then<00:00:25.380> your<00:00:25.590> simple<00:00:25.980> pressure<00:00:26.279> valve<00:00:26.699> here

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
then your simple pressure valve here

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.609 
then your simple pressure valve here
which<00:00:26.970> will<00:00:27.300> reduce<00:00:27.449> your<00:00:27.900> pressure<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.590> any

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
which will reduce your pressure for any

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.740 
which will reduce your pressure for any
low<00:00:29.010> pressure<00:00:29.369> watering<00:00:29.910> systems<00:00:30.390> such<00:00:30.570> as

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
low pressure watering systems such as

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.600 
low pressure watering systems such as
this<00:00:30.900> pot<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.380> here<00:00:31.859> let<00:00:32.070> me<00:00:32.130> grab<00:00:32.309> this

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
this pot I have here let me grab this

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.850 
this pot I have here let me grab this
hose<00:00:35.329> okay

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
hose okay

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.190

this<00:00:37.860> already<00:00:38.190> has<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> gasket<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
this already has a gasket in it so you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.770 
this already has a gasket in it so you
just<00:00:40.410> hook<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:42.300> your<00:00:42.450> garden

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
