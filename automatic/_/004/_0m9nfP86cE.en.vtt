the<00:03:26.000> screen<00:03:27.160> over<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.280> input<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.660> I've<00:03:29.840> named

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
the screen over the input so I've named

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.410 
the screen over the input so I've named
this<00:03:30.860> one<00:03:31.100> for<00:03:31.489> pro<00:03:32.030> for<00:03:32.420> a<00:03:32.450> GoPro<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:34.420> program

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
this one for pro for a GoPro and program

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.190 
this one for pro for a GoPro and program
for<00:03:36.190> let's<00:03:37.190> change<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:37.790> just<00:03:38.470> camera<00:03:41.200> SDI

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
for let's change that just camera SDI

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.500 
for let's change that just camera SDI
and<00:03:43.060> let's<00:03:44.060> change<00:03:44.269> this<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.720> say<00:03:44.959> GoPro<00:03:46.510> let's

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
and let's change this to say GoPro let's

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.640 
and let's change this to say GoPro let's
set<00:03:47.750> those<00:03:49.420> so<00:03:50.420> now<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.660> have<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.930> media<00:03:51.350> tab

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
set those so now you have a media tab

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.539 
set those so now you have a media tab
you<00:03:52.580> have<00:03:52.610> an<00:03:52.820> audio<00:03:53.180> tab<00:03:53.540> that's<00:03:53.840> pulling

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
you have an audio tab that's pulling

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.819 
you have an audio tab that's pulling
audio<00:03:55.549> off<00:03:55.820> of<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.209> cameras<00:03:56.690> itself<00:03:57.169> you<00:03:57.650> can

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
audio off of the cameras itself you can

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.490 
audio off of the cameras itself you can
also<00:03:57.980> plug<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.609> a<00:03:58.850> mixer<00:03:59.389> if<00:03:59.660> you'd<00:04:00.049> like<00:04:00.230> but

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
also plug in a mixer if you'd like but

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.300 
also plug in a mixer if you'd like but
right<00:04:00.709> now<00:04:00.889> we're

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
right now we're

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.820 
right now we're
keeping<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.390> simple<00:04:02.599> and<00:04:02.930> having<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.410> cameras

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
keeping it simple and having the cameras

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.000 
keeping it simple and having the cameras
pick<00:04:04.040> up<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.310> audio<00:04:05.349> now<00:04:06.349> when<00:04:06.530> we<00:04:06.620> go<00:04:06.770> to<00:04:06.800> the

switcher<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.670> have<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:07.910> program<00:04:08.950> inputs<00:04:09.950> and

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
switcher you have a program inputs and

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.880 
switcher you have a program inputs and
you<00:04:10.970> have<00:04:11.150> preview<00:04:11.750> inputs<00:04:13.630> red<00:04:14.630> for<00:04:15.440> program

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
you have preview inputs red for program

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.690 
you have preview inputs red for program
green<00:04:16.639> for<00:04:16.880> preview<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:18.620> if<00:04:18.950> we<00:04:19.130> switch<00:04:19.669> the

just<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.400> know<00:04:40.550> what<00:04:40.580> cut<00:04:41.000> you're<00:04:41.180> going<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.389> do

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
just to know what cut you're going to do

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.860 
just to know what cut you're going to do
next<00:04:42.490> over<00:04:43.490> here<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.880> have<00:04:44.060> your<00:04:44.180> transition

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
next over here you have your transition

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.040 
next over here you have your transition
styles<00:04:45.410> you<00:04:46.310> can<00:04:46.490> do<00:04:46.610> an<00:04:46.760> auto<00:04:46.970> transition<00:04:47.810> so

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
styles you can do an auto transition so

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.360 
styles you can do an auto transition so
what<00:04:48.229> it's<00:04:48.380> going<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.560> do<00:04:48.770> is<00:04:48.950> take<00:04:49.190> your

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
what it's going to do is take your

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.190 
what it's going to do is take your
preview<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.030> flop<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.479> with<00:04:50.600> your<00:04:50.750> program

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200

just<00:04:52.000> like<00:04:53.000> that<00:04:53.410> or<00:04:54.410> you<00:04:54.830> can<00:04:54.950> just<00:04:55.160> do<00:04:55.340> a

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
just like that or you can just do a

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.110 
just like that or you can just do a
rough<00:04:55.700> cut<00:04:56.000> just<00:04:56.600> cuts<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:57.050> fast<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.850> here's

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
rough cut just cuts it fast so here's

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.460 
rough cut just cuts it fast so here's
some<00:04:59.300> basics<00:04:59.810> of<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.770> a10<00:05:01.400> studio<00:05:01.970> just<00:05:02.660> basic

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
some basics of the a10 studio just basic

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.180 
some basics of the a10 studio just basic
