00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.380 
me see when did I start using hairspray
maybe<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.510> was<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.750> 12<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.119> i've<00:01:09.360> been

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
maybe when I was like 12 so i've been

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.280 
maybe when I was like 12 so i've been
using<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.900> same<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.549> stuff

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
using the same one and it's just stuff

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.310 
using the same one and it's just stuff
it's<00:01:13.580> not<00:01:14.580> helping<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.420> now<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.229> I'm

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320

older<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.310> guess<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.360> why<00:01:18.509> i<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:19.140> know

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
older so I guess that's why i don't know

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
older so I guess that's why i don't know

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
there we go now you can see it I think

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.650 
there we go now you can see it I think
that<00:04:55.530> maybe<00:04:55.740> stuff<00:04:56.070> like<00:04:56.220> that<00:04:56.250> what<00:04:56.669> had<00:04:57.330> I

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
that maybe stuff like that what had I

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.900 
that maybe stuff like that what had I
think<00:04:58.320> that<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.919> would<00:04:59.009> have<00:04:59.220> something<00:04:59.639> to<00:04:59.789> do

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
they would lay off the couch and use the

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.810 
they would lay off the couch and use the
bed<00:06:13.050> they've<00:06:13.259> had<00:06:13.409> beds<00:06:13.680> before<00:06:13.919> I<00:06:14.130> Bo<00:06:14.340> usually

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
bed they've had beds before I Bo usually

takes them and tears them up but I

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.580 
takes them and tears them up but I
thought<00:06:17.759> this<00:06:18.000> one<00:06:18.210> was<00:06:18.360> shaped<00:06:19.289> differently

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
thought this one was shaped differently

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.620 
thought this one was shaped differently
and<00:06:19.949> it's<00:06:20.070> heavier<00:06:20.490> so<00:06:20.820> maybe<00:06:21.060> he'll<00:06:21.300> leave<00:06:21.479> it

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
and it's heavier so maybe he'll leave it

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.620 
and it's heavier so maybe he'll leave it
alone<00:06:22.070> and<00:06:23.330> it's<00:06:24.330> by<00:06:24.570> happy<00:06:25.530> tails<00:06:26.479> so<00:06:27.479> it's

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
alone and it's by happy tails so it's

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.149 
alone and it's by happy tails so it's
