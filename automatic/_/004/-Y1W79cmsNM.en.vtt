9:00 a.m. 9:30 Sun I'm gonna come out

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.389 
9:00 a.m. 9:30 Sun I'm gonna come out
about<00:00:35.430> every<00:00:35.760> hour<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.270> REM<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:38.280> I'm

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
about every hour and REM this and I'm

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.940 
about every hour and REM this and I'm
thinking<00:00:38.610> five<00:00:39.329> or<00:00:39.480> six<00:00:39.660> hours<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.530> should

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
thinking five or six hours and I should

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.139 
thinking five or six hours and I should
have<00:00:41.100> cooked<00:00:42.000> roast<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:43.730> figured<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> way<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
have cooked roast I figured out a way to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.810 
have cooked roast I figured out a way to
aim<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:47.340> aiming<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.610> most

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
aim this and aiming it is the most

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
aim this and aiming it is the most
important<00:00:51.449> thing<00:00:51.690> besides<00:00:51.870> having

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
important thing besides having

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.459 
important thing besides having
insulation<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.190> reflectors<00:00:54.320> aiming<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
insulation and reflectors aiming it

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.470 
insulation and reflectors aiming it
directly<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> Sun<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.820> really<00:00:57.000> important

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
directly at the Sun is really important

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.959 
directly at the Sun is really important
so<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> added<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.520> right<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:01.969> this

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
so I added this right here and this

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.410 
so I added this right here and this
shadow<00:01:04.610> look<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:05.820> shadow<00:01:06.060> where<00:01:06.330> I'm

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
shadow look at my shadow where I'm

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.130 
shadow look at my shadow where I'm
pointing<00:01:06.810> right<00:01:07.100> there<00:01:08.270> tells<00:01:09.270> me<00:01:09.630> when<00:01:09.990> I've

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
pointing right there tells me when I've

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.050 
pointing right there tells me when I've
got<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.500> aimed<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:12.180> Sun<00:01:13.729> correctly<00:01:14.729> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
got it aimed at the Sun correctly and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.429 
got it aimed at the Sun correctly and
this<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.549> just<00:01:17.549> got<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.030> board<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.350> I'm

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
this I just got a board here and I'm

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.640 
this I just got a board here and I'm
holding<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.130> sort<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.909> beside<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.900> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
holding it up sort of beside this and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.010 
holding it up sort of beside this and
then<00:01:23.130> look<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:23.850> shadow<00:01:24.090> there<00:01:26.720> see<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> Sun

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
then look at my shadow there see the Sun

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.910 
then look at my shadow there see the Sun
adds<00:01:28.229> 10<00:01:28.500> pounds<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.900> when<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
adds 10 pounds you know so when this is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.230 
adds 10 pounds you know so when this is
uh<00:01:32.180> you<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.270> at<00:01:33.479> its<00:01:33.659> smallest<00:01:35.060> watch<00:01:37.520> see<00:01:38.520> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
uh you know at its smallest watch see so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.149 
uh you know at its smallest watch see so
I<00:01:39.270> compared<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.020> angle<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.770> angle<00:01:41.100> that

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I compared that angle to the angle that

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.920 
I compared that angle to the angle that
I<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.479> oven<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.350> how<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
I have the oven and that's how I get the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.810 
I have the oven and that's how I get the
the<00:01:45.930> angle<00:01:46.380> right<00:01:46.820> I'm<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.180> 200<00:01:48.659> degrees<00:01:48.689> in

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
the angle right I'm up to 200 degrees in

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.940 
the angle right I'm up to 200 degrees in
one<00:01:50.820> hour<00:01:53.869> don't<00:01:54.869> know<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.770> this

one hour don't know if you can see this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.990 
one hour don't know if you can see this
because<00:01:56.100> there's<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.700> reflection<00:01:57.649> so

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
because there's so much reflection so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.090 
because there's so much reflection so
trust<00:02:01.000> me<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.600> can<00:02:01.780> trust<00:02:01.990> me<00:02:02.260> it's<00:02:02.650> 200

trust me you can trust me it's 200

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.120 
trust me you can trust me it's 200
degrees<00:02:03.370> and<00:02:03.640> it's<00:02:04.570> just<00:02:05.170> now<00:02:05.290> 10<00:02:05.530> o'clock<00:02:05.710> so

see<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:43.810> been<00:02:44.050> a<00:02:44.080> cloudy<00:02:44.620> day<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.250> clouds

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
see it's been a cloudy day the clouds

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.979 
see it's been a cloudy day the clouds
have<00:02:45.640> been<00:02:45.670> coming<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.150> going<00:02:46.209> all<00:02:46.570> day<00:02:46.600> long

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
have been coming and going all day long

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.130 
have been coming and going all day long
I<00:02:47.850> really<00:02:48.850> expected<00:02:49.330> this<00:02:49.480> thing<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.810> get<00:02:49.930> up<00:02:50.080> a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
I really expected this thing to get up a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.140 
I really expected this thing to get up a
little<00:02:50.290> higher<00:02:50.470> than<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.769> but<00:02:51.040> when<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> get

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
little higher than that but when I get

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.240 
little higher than that but when I get
the<00:02:52.360> corners<00:02:53.080> in<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.910> mylar<00:02:55.360> for

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
the corners in and the mylar for

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.220 
the corners in and the mylar for
reflectors<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.450> have<00:02:58.450> no<00:02:58.630> doubt<00:02:58.840> in<00:02:59.050> my<00:02:59.080> mind

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
reflectors I have no doubt in my mind

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.830 
reflectors I have no doubt in my mind
this<00:02:59.709> thing<00:02:59.890> will<00:03:00.040> get<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.370> well<00:03:00.610> into<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.120> 300s

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
this thing will get a well into the 300s

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.350 
this thing will get a well into the 300s
so<00:03:02.590> I'm<00:03:03.010> gonna<00:03:03.100> take<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.400> out<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.790> bring<00:03:04.269> it
