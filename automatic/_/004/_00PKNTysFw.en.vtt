00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.310
 showed a very good result in 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.149
 In principle, there will be wear if 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:42.989
 do the right thing then they can give 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.070

 what I eat is just doing one highlight and 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.780
 tried the opposite so that they do not rush 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:25.890
 because it was cold, Sarah is in the yard 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.470
 me without heating once without heating 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.079

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.469
 there were but they all rushed to 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:40.310
 lost cracking very often and 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:40.310
 strongly had eggs they also cook 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:49.680
