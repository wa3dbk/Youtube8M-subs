hello Delhi's general welcome to another
Linux<00:00:03.810> gaming<00:00:04.049> benchmark<00:00:04.740> which<00:00:05.400> I'm<00:00:05.609> putting

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
Linux gaming benchmark which I'm putting

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.890 
Linux gaming benchmark which I'm putting
it<00:00:05.970> up<00:00:06.089> against<00:00:06.509> BioShock<00:00:07.170> Infinite<00:00:08.059> so<00:00:09.059> I'm

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
it up against BioShock Infinite so I'm

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.499 
it up against BioShock Infinite so I'm
gonna<00:00:10.139> 7<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.679> right<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.340> open<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.090> 14

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
gonna 7 on the right and open to 14

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.900 
gonna 7 on the right and open to 14
point<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.590> left<00:00:13.860> using<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:15.170> 340<00:00:16.910> 6.47

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.040 
point on the left using the 340 6.47
drivers<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.630> linux<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.650> 340<00:00:20.520> 7.88<00:00:21.359> drives<00:00:21.869> it

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
drivers on linux and 340 7.88 drives it

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.429 
drivers on linux and 340 7.88 drives it
on<00:00:22.199> windows<00:00:22.470> 7<00:00:23.240> ok<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.600> first<00:00:24.630> half<00:00:25.140> I'm

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
on windows 7 ok so the first half I'm

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.820 
on windows 7 ok so the first half I'm
using<00:00:25.980> single<00:00:26.400> screen<00:00:26.910> now<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.170> wait<00:00:28.619> for

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
using single screen now if you wait for

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.529 
using single screen now if you wait for
later<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> video<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.670> actually<00:00:29.880> put<00:00:30.449> it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
later on in the video I actually put it

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.959 
later on in the video I actually put it
up<00:00:30.630> against<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.199> triple<00:00:31.590> screen<00:00:31.859> but<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.880> you

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
up against a triple screen but as you

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.459 
up against a triple screen but as you
can<00:00:33.059> see<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:35.420> frame<00:00:36.420> rate<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.750> expected

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
can see and the frame rate as expected

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.810 
can see and the frame rate as expected
is<00:00:38.239> for<00:00:39.239> well<00:00:39.750> not<00:00:39.989> expected<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:41.340> triple

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
is for well not expected like triple

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850 
is for well not expected like triple
amount<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.870> massive<00:00:43.290> that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
amount for that is massive that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.450 
amount for that is massive that
difference<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:44.460> there<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.860> basically<00:00:46.860> if

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
difference right there and basically if

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.000 
difference right there and basically if
Bioshock<00:00:47.910> represent<00:00:48.239> use<00:00:48.360> using<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.200> Aeon

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
Bioshock represent use using the Aeon

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.880 
Bioshock represent use using the Aeon
rapper<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.539> frame<00:00:52.020> rate<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.289> expected<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
rapper so the frame rate is expected to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.010 
rapper so the frame rate is expected to
be<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> bit<00:00:53.280> lower<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:54.000> didn't<00:00:54.510> expect<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.960> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
be a bit lower but didn't expect it to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.490 
be a bit lower but didn't expect it to
be<00:00:55.460> more<00:00:56.460> than<00:00:56.640> double<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.930> pretty<00:00:58.199> crazy

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
be more than double that is pretty crazy

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.689 
be more than double that is pretty crazy
framework<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.250> Windows<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.030> again<00:01:00.300> nice

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
framework that Windows is again nice

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
framework that Windows is again nice
open<00:01:02.699> lose<00:01:02.850> dipping<00:01:03.629> well<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.320> into

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
open lose dipping well it's going into

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.350 
open lose dipping well it's going into
the<00:01:04.680> 100<00:01:05.280> 0<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.610> every<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.060> again<00:01:06.119> but

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the 100 0 and every now and again but

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.859 
the 100 0 and every now and again but
windows<00:01:07.229> seven<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.590> constantly<00:01:08.070> above<00:01:08.549> 100<00:01:09.479> or

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
windows seven is constantly above 100 or

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.740 
windows seven is constantly above 100 or
even<00:01:10.140> 200<00:01:10.650> frames<00:01:11.220> per<00:01:11.549> second<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
even 200 frames per second so the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.940 
even 200 frames per second so the
difference<00:01:13.020> right<00:01:13.530> now<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> GTX<00:01:14.369> 980<00:01:14.790> is

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
difference right now with the GTX 980 is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950 
difference right now with the GTX 980 is
well<00:01:16.950> pretty<00:01:17.250> massive<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:17.970> honest<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.570> don't

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
well pretty massive to be honest I don't

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
well pretty massive to be honest I don't
know<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.229> guys<00:01:19.350> agree<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
know if you guys agree or not but as you

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.499 
know if you guys agree or not but as you
can<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.729> they're<00:01:21.229> 300<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:22.830> windows<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.509> 137

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
can see they're 300 for windows and 137

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.080 
can see they're 300 for windows and 137
for<00:01:25.080> linux<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.130> massive<00:01:26.549> difference<00:01:26.700> layer

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
for linux so massive difference layer

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.260 
for linux so massive difference layer
and<00:01:27.710> after<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.829> I'll<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.250> moving<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
and after this I'll be moving on to the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.980 
and after this I'll be moving on to the
triple<00:01:30.869> screen<00:01:32.000> little<00:01:33.000> benchmark<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.630> way

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
triple screen little benchmark that way

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.560 
triple screen little benchmark that way
he'll<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.350> there's<00:01:34.710> me<00:01:34.860> twice<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.570> dressing

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
he'll know there's me twice a dressing

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.440 
he'll know there's me twice a dressing
gown<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.960> left<00:01:37.200> how<00:01:37.409> beautiful<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.130> me<00:01:38.450> but

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
gown on the left how beautiful of me but

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.149 
gown on the left how beautiful of me but
yeah<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> say<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.590> using<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.860> Aeon

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
yeah like I say it's using the Aeon

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
yeah like I say it's using the Aeon
wrapper<00:01:41.520> which<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:42.420> used<00:01:42.600> quite<00:01:42.780> well<00:01:43.170> for

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
wrapper which was used quite well for

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.880 
wrapper which was used quite well for
bioshock<00:01:43.829> infinite<00:01:44.130> guy<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:45.119> linux<00:01:45.540> is

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
bioshock infinite guy on linux is

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.399 
bioshock infinite guy on linux is
obviously<00:01:46.890> didn't<00:01:47.189> use<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.640> windows<00:01:48.409> but

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
obviously didn't use it in windows but

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.649 
obviously didn't use it in windows but
you<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.640> gameplay<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> constantly

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you know the gameplay is constantly

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.130 
you know the gameplay is constantly
above<00:01:51.899> 60<00:01:52.290> frames<00:01:52.530> per<00:01:52.590> second<00:01:53.009> defined<00:01:54.140> as

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
above 60 frames per second defined as

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.609 
above 60 frames per second defined as
shown<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.549> benchmark<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.210> well<00:01:57.619> but

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
shown in the the benchmark as well but

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.940 
shown in the the benchmark as well but
obviously<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.850> triple<00:02:00.119> screen<00:02:00.799> this<00:02:01.799> is

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
obviously on the triple screen this is

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.039 
obviously on the triple screen this is
sort<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.189> maximizing<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> performance<00:02:03.360> using

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
sort of maximizing the performance using

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.830 
sort of maximizing the performance using
57<00:02:04.860> 60<00:02:05.040> x<00:02:05.250> 1080<00:02:05.759> which<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.329> massive

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
57 60 x 1080 which is a massive

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.249 
57 60 x 1080 which is a massive
resolution<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.819> well<00:02:08.819> nowadays<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:09.989> not

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
resolution and well nowadays it's not

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.229 
resolution and well nowadays it's not
actually<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.590> big<00:02:10.950> isn't<00:02:11.190> 4k<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.030> stuff

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
actually that big isn't 4k and stuff

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.970 
actually that big isn't 4k and stuff

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
like that free screen 4k

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.940 
like that free screen 4k
is<00:02:14.099> Jesus<00:02:14.879> Christ<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.290> fact<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.590> i'm

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
is Jesus Christ but the fact is i'm

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.759 
is Jesus Christ but the fact is i'm
getting<00:02:17.550> over<00:02:17.849> 30<00:02:18.390> frames<00:02:18.659> a<00:02:18.750> second<00:02:19.140> for<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
getting over 30 frames a second for the

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.220 
getting over 30 frames a second for the
majority<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.700> gameplay<00:02:21.480> 30<00:02:21.840> frames<00:02:22.140> per

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
majority of the gameplay 30 frames per

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.190 
majority of the gameplay 30 frames per
second<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.860> easily<00:02:23.519> playable<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.750> i<00:02:25.049> could

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
second is easily playable so i could

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.500 
second is easily playable so i could
find<00:02:25.379> myself<00:02:25.620> playing<00:02:25.799> this<00:02:26.010> game<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.549> windows

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
find myself playing this game on windows

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.180 
find myself playing this game on windows
or<00:02:27.720> linux<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.549> good<00:02:29.670> sign<00:02:30.709> he<00:02:31.709> even

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
or linux so it's a good sign he even

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.680 
or linux so it's a good sign he even
getting<00:02:32.340> four<00:02:32.670> ish<00:02:32.849> first<00:02:33.180> or<00:02:33.269> second<00:02:33.480> i<00:02:33.540> mean

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
getting four ish first or second i mean

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.059 
getting four ish first or second i mean
i<00:02:33.870> guess<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.230> difference<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.650> still<00:02:34.890> pretty

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
i guess the difference is still pretty

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.880 
i guess the difference is still pretty

well<00:02:40.140> Linux<00:02:40.530> was<00:02:40.650> lagging<00:02:41.010> behind<00:02:41.129> in<00:02:41.430> for

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
well Linux was lagging behind in for

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.470 
well Linux was lagging behind in for
with<00:02:42.060> 40<00:02:42.599> FPS<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:46.519> but<00:02:47.519> yeah<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.940> I'm<00:02:48.329> actually

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
with 40 FPS so but yeah and I'm actually

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.630 
with 40 FPS so but yeah and I'm actually
recording<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.590> audio<00:02:49.950> quiet<00:02:50.250> later<00:02:50.459> on

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
recording this audio quiet later on

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.190 
recording this audio quiet later on
because<00:02:50.849> I've<00:02:50.970> actually<00:02:51.120> installed<00:02:51.840> windows

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
because I've actually installed windows

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.000 
because I've actually installed windows
8<00:02:52.379> now<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.160> 8.1<00:02:53.940> sorry<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.769> hopefully<00:02:55.769> suit

ubuntu<00:02:59.090> 15.0<00:03:00.090> for<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.660> we<00:03:00.750> can<00:03:00.780> test<00:03:01.109> it<00:03:01.319> out<00:03:01.379> on

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
ubuntu 15.0 for so we can test it out on

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.520 
ubuntu 15.0 for so we can test it out on
the<00:03:01.769> latest<00:03:02.250> hardware<00:03:03.209> software<00:03:03.840> sorry<00:03:04.290> so

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
the latest hardware software sorry so

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.319 
the latest hardware software sorry so
that<00:03:04.739> will<00:03:04.829> be<00:03:04.950> quite<00:03:05.549> interesting<00:03:06.030> see<00:03:06.209> if

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
that will be quite interesting see if

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.030 
that will be quite interesting see if
there's<00:03:06.510> any<00:03:06.720> difference<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.829> the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
there's any difference in that the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.039 
there's any difference in that the
performance<00:03:08.340> factor<00:03:08.940> but<00:03:09.629> as<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:09.840> see

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
performance factor but as you can see

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.569 
performance factor but as you can see
and<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.799> there<00:03:11.099> above<00:03:11.870> 40<00:03:12.870> FPS<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.470> linux<00:03:13.799> so

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
and in there above 40 FPS on linux so

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.910 
and in there above 40 FPS on linux so
not<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> best<00:03:15.329> benchmark<00:03:15.810> linux<00:03:16.560> lagging

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
not the best benchmark linux lagging

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.309 
not the best benchmark linux lagging
behind<00:03:17.220> quite<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.700> lot<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.180> expected<00:03:19.079> though

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
behind quite a lot as expected though

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.860 
behind quite a lot as expected though
