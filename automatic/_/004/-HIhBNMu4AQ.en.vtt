basically<00:00:23.500> is<00:00:23.860> we're<00:00:24.190> just<00:00:24.340> gonna<00:00:24.490> start<00:00:24.880> off

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
basically is we're just gonna start off

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.900 
basically is we're just gonna start off
with<00:00:25.080> basic<00:00:26.080> movements<00:00:26.680> of<00:00:26.800> chillin<00:00:27.190> like<00:00:27.400> you

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
with basic movements of chillin like you
