rush<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.729> map<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.180> i<00:01:42.299> think<00:01:42.600> i<00:01:42.930> got<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
rush on this map because i think i got a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.889 
rush on this map because i think i got a
decently<00:01:44.070> good<00:01:44.159> gameplay<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.600> that

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
decently good gameplay that that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.389 
decently good gameplay that that
illustrates<00:01:46.530> some<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> things<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.280> i

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
illustrates some of the things that i

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.179 
illustrates some of the things that i
think<00:01:47.570> would<00:01:48.570> bode<00:01:48.869> well<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.590> terms<00:01:49.890> of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
think would bode well in terms of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.950 
think would bode well in terms of
keeping<00:01:50.490> an<00:01:50.700> overwatch<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> spawns<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
keeping an overwatch on the spawns and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.109 
keeping an overwatch on the spawns and
being<00:01:52.170> able<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.500> fall<00:01:52.770> back<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.280> positions<00:01:53.790> yet

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
being able to fall back to positions yet

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.719 
being able to fall back to positions yet
and<00:01:54.420> still<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.930> an<00:01:55.020> advantage<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and still have an advantage and have it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.700 
and still have an advantage and have it
have<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> sight<00:01:57.630> line<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> enemy<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.560> they

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
have a sight line on the enemy that they

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.200 
have a sight line on the enemy that they
aren't<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.219> expecting<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.850> i<00:01:59.880> think<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
aren't really expecting and i think it

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.789 
aren't really expecting and i think it
would<00:02:00.479> bode<00:02:00.689> well<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> lot<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.320> players<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
would bode well for a lot of players and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.499 
would bode well for a lot of players and
i<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.430> i<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:02.969> see<00:02:03.030> many<00:02:03.210> people

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
i and i really don't see many people

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.600 
i and i really don't see many people
