00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.500
 the black swan black swan is a ribbon 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.330
 from director darren aronofsky I've 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.220
 I watched many movies of this director 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.170
 in fact I only remember the visitor 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.080
 breaking for a train requiem for a 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.660
 dream and do not get yourself a director 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.990
 connects with one and other times not and I think 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.109
 that this is my case with this director is 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.570
 a very talented director very talented and 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.949
 this is demonstrated in his movie black 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.770
 swan where the way he tells us the 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:40.880
 story is entertaining does not get us 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:44.149
 inside the plot and we can see big 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.030
 performances on tape and are good 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.010
 natalie portman who plays a 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.320
 dancer who gets a great 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.420
 opportunity for the ballet more 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.960
 important new york power 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.480
 interpret the protagonist of the lake of 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.340
 the swans and that is a dancer that 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.170
 has to interpret the cinema to the swan 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.570
 white and the black swan 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.210
 somehow the white swan like the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.210
 color indicates it is a character rather 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.909
 as pure noble 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.330
 the black swan 'on the other hand requires 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.750
 how to go to a dark side and take out all 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.490
 those things 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.910
 more passion and more emotion more daring and the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.830
 natalie portman's character looks like 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.500
 much to the white swan but it has nothing 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.229
 of the black swan and then the director 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.580
 of the ballet tries to convert it too 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.820
 in that in that black swan 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.240
 and good the movie in a way narrates 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.270
 this journey from this young lady of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.040
 go from being a white swan to a swan 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.660
 black and it's a movie where one does not 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.600
 he is sure of what he is 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.880
 happening we add a little narrator 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.039
 reliable that is the protagonist 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.830
 and for me I have a problem when the 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.569
 movie starts to get to that extreme 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.239
 that you do not know if what you're seeing in 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.540
 screen really happened or there's no 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.410
 directors who can do it quite 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.760
 interesting even though it is not 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.230
 sure if this is a dream this in 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.209
 actually this is in the head of 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.610
 someone or is really happening but 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.690
 one can get involved 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.700
 unfortunately this does not do this to me 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.700
 happened to me with the movie as soon as 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.720
 I began to see that many of the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.130
 sequences really just was in the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.800
 head of the character and that sometimes 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.860
 then they became relevant I let 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.000
 losing interest ceases to be lost 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.860
 interest I want to say 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.280
 it becomes a kind of movie of 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.420
 terror a bit like karim de brian 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.420
 depalma more than a ballet movie 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.090
 I think the performances are very good 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.130
 Natalie Portman who won the Oscar there 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.930
 a scene from her where it's not so much 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.550
 drama where he telephoning his 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.830
 mom and tell him that he was given the role 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.459
 main for me is the best scene of 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.459
 the movie because I really see one to 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.530
 a very excited young woman who is 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.420
 sharing someone something to the person 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.269
 closest that she has to in that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.760
 case mom but on the other hand one sees the 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.370
 need for the approval of 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.269
 his mom a scene that is very brief that 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.860
 The one shot in a bathroom is the 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.580
 scene that I liked the most 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.290
 think what to do as the director of 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.200
 ballet is also very credible in his 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.090
 character his super power his talent 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.879
 be used to the command 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.310
 and mila kunis who interprets another one 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:48.840
 dancer who joins the company 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.459
 I also find its role interesting 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.560
 as I say technically the movie is 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.720
 very well there is nothing like criticizing him 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.330
 in that aspect but for me it's the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.670
 history the story does not make me 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.580
 interesting enough is not something 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.319
 to call me to see her again and I 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.540
 makes like a kind of fires 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.230
 artificial as a lot of technique 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.480
 a lot of music a lot of interesting editing 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.220
 a lot to keep the viewer guessing 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.730
 what's happening but the story does not 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.160
 it looks solid 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.600
 well that's my comment on the 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.310
 swan black black swan 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.750
 if they like ballet and want to see 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.140
 another movie of a dancer 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:32.400
 obsessed I recommend the red shoes 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.689
 what is a 1948 movie search by 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.319
 there is a very interesting movie 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.319
 this 9
