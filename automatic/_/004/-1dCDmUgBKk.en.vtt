better yet use the communicator that I

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.750 
better yet use the communicator that I
talked<00:00:33.900> about<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.379> other<00:00:34.559> videos<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.610> have

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
talked about in other videos if you have

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.460 
talked about in other videos if you have
one<00:00:35.940> now<00:00:36.480> nice<00:00:36.690> thing<00:00:36.840> about<00:00:36.900> this<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.320> can

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
one now nice thing about this you can

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.410 
one now nice thing about this you can
reuse<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.980> now<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.300> you

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
reuse it now I'm going to have you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.000 
reuse it now I'm going to have you
highlight<00:00:39.870> some<00:00:40.140> numbers<00:00:40.470> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.890> use

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
highlight some numbers you can just use

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.490 
highlight some numbers you can just use
a<00:00:41.040> red<00:00:41.280> marker<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.820> highlight<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.330> or<00:00:42.500> you

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
a red marker you highlight it or you

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.830 
a red marker you highlight it or you
could<00:00:43.650> also<00:00:43.830> use<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.430> black<00:00:44.910> marker<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.629> just

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
could also use a black marker to just

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.569 
could also use a black marker to just
darken<00:00:46.440> things<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.770> or<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:46.890> cross<00:00:47.250> things

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
darken things out or just cross things

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.870 
darken things out or just cross things
out<00:00:47.899> if<00:00:48.899> you're<00:00:49.110> using<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> paper<00:00:49.620> then<00:00:50.280> just

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
out if you're using the paper then just

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.290 
out if you're using the paper then just
use<00:00:51.030> regular<00:00:51.680> pencil<00:00:52.680> pens<00:00:53.579> whatever<00:00:53.880> or<00:00:54.270> even

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
use regular pencil pens whatever or even

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.900 
use regular pencil pens whatever or even
a<00:00:54.630> highlighter<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.469> highlight<00:00:55.760> things<00:00:56.760> in

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
a highlighter to highlight things in

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.250 
a highlighter to highlight things in
here<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.510> right<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.140> let's<00:00:58.290> get<00:00:58.350> started

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
here all right so now let's get started

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
here all right so now let's get started
first<00:01:01.260> off<00:01:01.469> what<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:01.890> sieve<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
first off what is the sieve of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.969 
first off what is the sieve of
eratosthenes<00:01:03.059> well<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:04.050> a<00:01:04.199> procedure<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
eratosthenes well it's a procedure that

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
eratosthenes well it's a procedure that
is<00:01:05.129> used<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.640> find<00:01:06.270> all<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.840> prime<00:01:07.050> numbers

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
is used to find all the prime numbers

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.560 
is used to find all the prime numbers
below<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> certain<00:01:08.310> value<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.210> case<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
below a certain value in this case I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:19.130 
below a certain value in this case I
want<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.590> prime<00:01:10.800> numbers<00:01:11.210> under<00:01:12.210> 100

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.590 

basic<00:01:19.770> procedure<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.490> we're<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.480> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
basic procedure is we're going to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.430 
basic procedure is we're going to
highlight<00:01:22.230> in<00:01:22.560> yellow<00:01:23.930> all<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.990> prime

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
highlight in yellow all the prime

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.710 
highlight in yellow all the prime
numbers<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.730> we<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.120> just<00:01:27.240> black

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
numbers and then we want to just black

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.350 
numbers and then we want to just black
out<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.530> squares<00:01:28.950> now<00:01:29.760> anything<00:01:30.150> we

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
out all the squares now anything we

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.660 
out all the squares now anything we
don't<00:01:30.600> want<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.260> whatever<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.310> left<00:01:32.340> over

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
don't want and whatever is left over

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.210 
don't want and whatever is left over
will<00:01:33.510> be<00:01:33.600> our<00:01:33.720> prime<00:01:33.960> numbers<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.860> first<00:01:38.070> step

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
will be our prime numbers the first step

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.010 
will be our prime numbers the first step
of<00:01:38.280> our<00:01:38.430> procedure<00:01:38.760> is<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.300> just<00:01:39.510> black<00:01:39.870> out

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
of our procedure is it just black out

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.880 
of our procedure is it just black out
completely<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.480> a<00:01:42.510> prime<00:01:42.890> it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
completely the one it's not a prime it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.890 
completely the one it's not a prime it's
not<00:01:44.190> composite<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.570> rid<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.780> it

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
not composite so just get rid of it

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:54.359 
not composite so just get rid of it
right<00:01:45.960> away<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.560> this

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.630 

our<00:01:54.759> first<00:01:55.060> prime<00:01:55.299> number<00:01:55.329> is<00:01:55.780> two<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:57.399> first

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
our first prime number is two so first

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.840 
our first prime number is two so first
let's<00:01:58.119> highlight<00:01:58.329> it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.820 

now<00:02:05.850> let's<00:02:06.060> find<00:02:06.390> all<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.050> even<00:02:07.409> numbers<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
now let's find all the even numbers and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.350 
now let's find all the even numbers and
they're<00:02:08.399> right<00:02:08.550> here

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.150 

now<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.420> don't<00:02:14.660> want<00:02:14.780> these<00:02:15.379> multiples<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.950> two

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
now we don't want these multiples of two

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.559 
now we don't want these multiples of two
so<00:02:16.670> let's<00:02:16.819> go<00:02:16.940> ahead<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.150> black<00:02:17.390> them<00:02:17.540> out

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.949 

our<00:02:23.379> next<00:02:23.620> prime<00:02:23.739> number<00:02:23.769> is<00:02:24.209> three<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:25.810> let's

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
our next prime number is three so let's

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.949 
our next prime number is three so let's
go<00:02:26.049> ahead<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.200> highlight<00:02:26.439> that

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.899 

now<00:02:34.469> we<00:02:34.530> want<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.890> find<00:02:35.040> all<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.310> multiples<00:02:35.819> of

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
now we want to find all the multiples of

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:42.440 
now we want to find all the multiples of
three<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.359> they're<00:02:36.900> right<00:02:37.109> here

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.780 

you<00:02:43.379> may<00:02:43.500> wonder<00:02:43.739> what's<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.099> fast<00:02:44.430> way<00:02:44.640> of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
you may wonder what's a fast way of

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.070 
you may wonder what's a fast way of
finding<00:02:45.030> all<00:02:45.239> these<00:02:45.330> multiples<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.840> three

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
finding all these multiples of three

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.009 
finding all these multiples of three
well<00:02:46.650> actually<00:02:46.800> tell<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:48.510> basic<00:02:48.720> math

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
well actually tell you in the basic math

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.960 
well actually tell you in the basic math
less<00:02:49.260> than<00:02:49.379> four<00:02:49.500> five<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:50.430> use<00:02:50.700> your

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970

other multiples that we'll be using in
this<00:03:02.190> lesson<00:03:03.890> now<00:03:04.890> let's<00:03:05.099> black<00:03:05.340> out<00:03:05.550> all

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
this lesson now let's black out all

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.910 
this lesson now let's black out all
these<00:03:06.269> multiples<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.959> three

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.560 

our<00:03:12.400> next<00:03:13.360> prime<00:03:13.540> number<00:03:13.570> is<00:03:14.070> five<00:03:15.450> let's<00:03:16.450> go

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
our next prime number is five let's go

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.470 
our next prime number is five let's go
ahead<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.840> highlight<00:03:16.990> that<00:03:17.230> right<00:03:17.410> now

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.670 

now<00:03:23.480> let's<00:03:23.690> find<00:03:23.810> all<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.110> multiples<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.530> five

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
now let's find all the multiples of five

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.890 
now let's find all the multiples of five
well<00:03:25.190> they're<00:03:25.670> all<00:03:25.880> right<00:03:26.390> here

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:38.880 

and<00:03:30.280> let's<00:03:31.280> go<00:03:31.400> ahead<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.730> block<00:03:31.879> them<00:03:32.000> out

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.850 

so<00:03:39.400> what's<00:03:39.580> our<00:03:39.670> next<00:03:39.700> prime<00:03:40.030> number<00:03:40.860> that's

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
so what's our next prime number that's

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.180 
so what's our next prime number that's
right

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
right

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.550 
right
seven<00:03:43.000> let's<00:03:43.750> go<00:03:43.870> ahead<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.110> highlight<00:03:44.290> that

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.390 

and<00:03:50.500> this<00:03:51.500> was<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.680> little<00:03:51.830> bit<00:03:51.920> tougher<00:03:52.190> we

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
and this was a little bit tougher we

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.250 
and this was a little bit tougher we
want<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.610> find<00:03:52.850> all<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.420> leftover<00:03:53.810> multiples

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
want to find all the leftover multiples

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.420 
want to find all the leftover multiples
of<00:03:54.319> 7<00:03:54.709> under<00:03:55.550> 100<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.010> might<00:03:58.130> want<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.310> use

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
of 7 under 100 and you might want to use

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.660 
of 7 under 100 and you might want to use
your<00:03:58.520> calculator<00:03:59.020> here<00:04:00.020> they<00:04:00.170> are

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.839 

and<00:04:03.670> let's<00:04:03.940> go<00:04:04.030> ahead<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.300> black<00:04:04.480> about

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.690 

now<00:04:09.749> what's<00:04:09.930> our<00:04:10.049> next<00:04:10.140> prime<00:04:10.409> number<00:04:10.890> well

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
now what's our next prime number well

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.490 
now what's our next prime number well
it's<00:04:11.819> 11<00:04:12.209> seen<00:04:12.870> here

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.250 

but<00:04:18.980> wait<00:04:19.420> we<00:04:20.420> don't<00:04:20.510> have<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.870> do<00:04:20.959> anything<00:04:21.079> of

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
but wait we don't have to do anything of

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.920 
but wait we don't have to do anything of
eleven<00:04:21.620> why<00:04:22.190> is<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:22.480> well<00:04:23.480> there<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:23.780> this

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
eleven why is that well there is this

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.540 
eleven why is that well there is this
little<00:04:24.650> something<00:04:25.010> call<00:04:25.250> prime<00:04:26.210> factor<00:04:26.660> test

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
little something call prime factor test

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.900 
little something call prime factor test
the<00:04:28.550> prime<00:04:28.820> factor<00:04:29.300> test<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:31.130> find<00:04:31.340> candidates

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
the prime factor test to find candidates

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.120 
the prime factor test to find candidates
to<00:04:32.180> use<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.840> find<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.170> prime<00:04:33.440> factors<00:04:33.920> of<00:04:33.950> a

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
to use to find the prime factors of a

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.850 
to use to find the prime factors of a
number<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:35.240> only<00:04:35.540> need<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.110> try<00:04:36.350> those<00:04:36.590> that

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
number you only need to try those that

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.070 
number you only need to try those that
are<00:04:36.950> less<00:04:37.220> than<00:04:37.250> or<00:04:37.550> equal<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.660> square

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
are less than or equal to the square

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.490 
are less than or equal to the square
root<00:04:39.230> of<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.440> number<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:42.080> we're<00:04:42.230> trying<00:04:42.440> to

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
root of a number and we're trying to

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.180 
root of a number and we're trying to
find<00:04:42.710> all<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.370> prime<00:04:43.550> numbers<00:04:44.020> below<00:04:45.020> 100<00:04:45.620> so

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
find all the prime numbers below 100 so

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.460 
find all the prime numbers below 100 so
let's<00:04:46.430> take<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.760> square<00:04:47.120> root<00:04:47.390> of<00:04:48.790> 100<00:04:50.470> what's

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
let's take the square root of 100 what's

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.560 
let's take the square root of 100 what's
that<00:04:51.590> going<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.800> give<00:04:51.919> us<00:04:52.040> well<00:04:52.430> 10<00:04:53.120> that's

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
that going to give us well 10 that's

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.120 
that going to give us well 10 that's
easy<00:04:55.060> so<00:04:56.060> we<00:04:57.020> only<00:04:57.260> need<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.590> check<00:04:57.740> numbers

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
easy so we only need to check numbers

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.300 
easy so we only need to check numbers
less<00:04:58.850> than<00:04:58.880> or<00:04:59.240> equal<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.600> this<00:05:00.290> 10<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:01.100> we

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
less than or equal to this 10 so we

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.340 
less than or equal to this 10 so we
don't<00:05:01.460> have<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.640> even<00:05:01.700> bother<00:05:02.030> with<00:05:02.180> 11<00:05:02.630> so

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
don't have to even bother with 11 so

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.760 
don't have to even bother with 11 so
we're<00:05:03.560> done<00:05:03.800> it<00:05:04.400> would<00:05:04.520> even<00:05:04.760> know<00:05:04.850> it<00:05:05.770> so

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
we're done it would even know it so

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.210 
we're done it would even know it so
let's<00:05:06.890> go<00:05:07.010> back<00:05:07.040> to<00:05:07.190> our<00:05:07.370> grid

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.330 

so<00:05:12.180> all<00:05:12.420> these<00:05:12.570> leftover<00:05:13.020> numbers<00:05:13.320> are<00:05:13.530> our

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
so all these leftover numbers are our

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.890 
so all these leftover numbers are our
primes<00:05:14.670> so<00:05:15.330> let's<00:05:15.450> go<00:05:15.540> ahead<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:15.750> highlight

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
primes so let's go ahead and highlight

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.790 
primes so let's go ahead and highlight
them

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:29.570 

and<00:05:19.800> now<00:05:20.100> let's<00:05:20.250> just<00:05:20.280> list<00:05:20.910> them

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.030 

and<00:05:29.670> we're<00:05:30.390> done<00:05:30.570> we<00:05:30.810> found<00:05:31.170> all<00:05:31.410> our<00:05:31.710> pride

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
and we're done we found all our pride

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:47.180 
and we're done we found all our pride
numbers<00:05:32.340> under<00:05:33.090> 100

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.250
