hey<00:00:05.700> that<00:00:05.940> looks<00:00:06.060> good<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:07.429> want<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.490> add<00:00:08.639> a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
hey that looks good you want to add a

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.900 
hey that looks good you want to add a
little<00:00:09.719> offset<00:00:09.929> tab<00:00:10.469> that's<00:00:10.860> gonna<00:00:11.010> help

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
little offset tab that's gonna help

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.230 
little offset tab that's gonna help
latch<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.630> top<00:00:12.840> cover<00:00:13.110> into<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.440> bottom<00:00:13.830> and

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
latch the top cover into the bottom and

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.369 
latch the top cover into the bottom and
we're<00:00:15.240> gonna<00:00:15.330> make<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> assumption<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.109> we

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
we're gonna make the assumption that we

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.050 
we're gonna make the assumption that we
do<00:00:16.590> lots<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.100> these<00:00:17.220> sheet<00:00:17.430> metal<00:00:17.670> covers<00:00:17.940> in

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
do lots of these sheet metal covers in

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790 
do lots of these sheet metal covers in
our<00:00:18.180> company<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:19.380> do<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.680> we

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
our company and so what we do is we

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.830 
our company and so what we do is we
create<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.340> called<00:00:20.520> form<00:00:20.820> tools<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
create what are called form tools to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.359 
create what are called form tools to
create<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.230> geometry<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.220> any

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
create this geometry and this is any

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.810 
create this geometry and this is any
time<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.939> would<00:00:24.060> use<00:00:24.269> sort<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:25.820> punch

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
time that you would use sort of a punch

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.810 
time that you would use sort of a punch
type<00:00:27.150> shape<00:00:27.420> onto<00:00:27.720> your<00:00:28.050> sheet<00:00:28.230> metal<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.890> the

type shape onto your sheet metal and the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.959 
type shape onto your sheet metal and the
punches<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.480> really<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.430> in<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.669> form

just come with the software as examples

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.000 
just come with the software as examples
and<00:00:41.550> I've<00:00:41.670> got<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.059> few<00:00:42.450> custom<00:00:42.840> ones<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and I've got a few custom ones here and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.410 
and I've got a few custom ones here and
let<00:00:44.190> me<00:00:44.250> open<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.610> file<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.180> show<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
let me open this file just to show you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
let me open this file just to show you
that<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.840> really<00:00:46.140> nothing<00:00:46.500> more<00:00:46.710> than<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
that it's really nothing more than a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.110 
that it's really nothing more than a
solid<00:00:47.700> model

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
solid model

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.940 
solid model
you're<00:00:48.210> gonna<00:00:48.300> model<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.020> using<00:00:49.230> standard

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you're gonna model it up using standard

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.100 
you're gonna model it up using standard
techniques<00:00:50.329> there's<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.449> bit<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.899> additional

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
techniques there's a bit of additional

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.779 
techniques there's a bit of additional
information<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.860> add<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
information you add to it and we have a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.700 
information you add to it and we have a
wizard<00:00:54.180> that's<00:00:54.449> gonna<00:00:54.570> help<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.559> this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
wizard that's gonna help you get this

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.630 
wizard that's gonna help you get this
thing<00:00:55.770> set<00:00:56.190> up<00:00:56.219> properly<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.649> it's<00:00:58.649> um<00:00:59.070> it's

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
thing set up properly and it's um it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.209 
thing set up properly and it's um it's
color-coded<00:01:00.230> mostly<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> red<00:01:01.530> surfaces<00:01:02.100> are

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
color-coded mostly the red surfaces are

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.560 
color-coded mostly the red surfaces are
the<00:01:02.250> most<00:01:02.460> important<00:01:02.940> ones<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> pay<00:01:03.329> attention

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the most important ones to pay attention

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.440 
the most important ones to pay attention
to<00:01:03.809> these<00:01:04.559> red<00:01:04.739> surfaces<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:05.460> instructs

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
to these red surfaces actually instructs

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.100 
to these red surfaces actually instructs
all<00:01:06.510> our<00:01:06.659> side

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
all our side

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.380 
all our side
that's<00:01:07.530> void<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.430> material<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.119> that's<00:01:09.180> going

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that's void of material so that's going

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.149 
that's void of material so that's going
to<00:01:09.450> create<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.720> bit<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.020> clearance<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.770> then

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
to create a bit of a clearance and then

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.190 
to create a bit of a clearance and then
it's<00:01:11.310> gonna<00:01:11.430> form<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> metal<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.780> around

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
it's gonna form the metal up and around

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.429 
it's gonna form the metal up and around
this<00:01:13.680> geometry<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.450> let's<00:01:15.810> watch<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.350> in

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
this geometry here so let's watch it in

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.520 
this geometry here so let's watch it in
action<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.750> use<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.380> just

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
action the way you use them is you just

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
action the way you use them is you just
drag<00:01:19.770> them<00:01:19.890> from<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.130> library<00:01:20.700> into<00:01:21.119> your

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
drag them from your library into your

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600 
drag them from your library into your
part<00:01:21.479> file<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.960> whatever<00:01:22.830> surface<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.430> want

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
part file on whatever surface you want

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.609 
part file on whatever surface you want
it<00:01:23.700> applied<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.840> case<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> be

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
it applied in this case it's going to be

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.670 
it applied in this case it's going to be
on<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.200> okay<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.560> pay

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
on this one here okay then we pay

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
on this one here okay then we pay
attention<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> preview<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.880> important

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
attention to the preview it's important

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.050 
attention to the preview it's important
I'm<00:01:30.780> gonna<00:01:30.960> flip<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.290> alright<00:01:32.130> that's<00:01:32.850> pretty

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I'm gonna flip it alright that's pretty

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.380 
I'm gonna flip it alright that's pretty
good<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.280> rotate<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.850> right<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.240> as

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
good you can rotate it right here as

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.440 
good you can rotate it right here as
well<00:01:36.890> easy<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.159> understand<00:01:38.640> functions<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
well easy to understand functions on the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.200 
well easy to understand functions on the
left<00:01:39.689> here<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.829> click<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.220> position<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.970> can

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
left here if I click on position I can

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.730 
left here if I click on position I can
add<00:01:42.329> additional<00:01:42.479> ones<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.200> want<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.619> by

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
add additional ones if I want just by

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.710 
add additional ones if I want just by
adding<00:01:44.250> additional<00:01:44.340> points<00:01:45.000> very<00:01:45.390> much<00:01:45.540> like

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
adding additional points very much like

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.660 
adding additional points very much like
the<00:01:45.840> whole<00:01:45.990> wizard<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:47.399> should<00:01:47.549> be

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the whole wizard right it should be

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.149 
the whole wizard right it should be
familiar<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.860> I'm<00:01:49.860> gonna<00:01:50.070> actually

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
familiar with that I'm gonna actually

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.490 
familiar with that I'm gonna actually
pattern<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> pattern<00:01:51.840> tool<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.439> I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
pattern that with a pattern tool but I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.960 
pattern that with a pattern tool but I
do<00:01:52.560> want<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> put<00:01:53.009> some<00:01:53.159> dimensions<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.759> here

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
do want to put some dimensions in here

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300 
do want to put some dimensions in here
so<00:01:54.180> here's<00:01:54.420> where<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.810> locate<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.590> with

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
so here's where you locate it with

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.490 
so here's where you locate it with
dimensions<00:01:58.549> in<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> position<00:02:00.509> function<00:02:00.689> okay

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
dimensions in the position function okay

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.550 
dimensions in the position function okay
alright<00:02:04.500> we'll<00:02:04.920> finish<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.250> off<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:07.259> you

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
alright we'll finish that off and you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.859 
alright we'll finish that off and you
can<00:02:07.680> see<00:02:07.710> how<00:02:08.340> much<00:02:08.489> how<00:02:09.239> easy<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
can see how much how easy it is to

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.930 
can see how much how easy it is to
create<00:02:10.020> those<00:02:10.830> types<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.280> forms<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.700> just

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
create those types of forms you just

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.470 
create those types of forms you just
basically<00:02:12.270> drag<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.840> drop<00:02:12.989> them<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.260> and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
basically drag and drop them in and

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.229 
basically drag and drop them in and
to<00:02:13.659> find<00:02:13.900> where<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.110> want<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.319> located<00:02:15.239> the

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
to find where you want it located the

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.899 
to find where you want it located the
pattern<00:02:16.599> is<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:17.170> know<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:17.590> standard

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
pattern is just you know your standard

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.880 
pattern is just you know your standard
pattern<00:02:18.909> tool<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:20.260> works<00:02:20.440> for<00:02:20.650> sheet<00:02:20.860> metal

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
pattern tool it works for sheet metal

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.789 
pattern tool it works for sheet metal
features<00:02:21.489> as<00:02:21.670> well<00:02:21.849> as<00:02:22.030> some<00:02:22.330> as<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.409> does<00:02:23.560> with

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
features as well as some as it does with

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.789 
features as well as some as it does with
your<00:02:24.280> solid<00:02:24.640> features<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.269> we'll<00:02:26.049> give<00:02:26.230> a

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
your solid features and we'll give a

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.280 
your solid features and we'll give a
bigger<00:02:27.760> distance<00:02:28.060> here<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.599> send<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
bigger distance here and send it the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.320 
bigger distance here and send it the
other<00:02:29.409> direction

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
other direction

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330 
other direction
Mearing<00:02:31.330> works<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.660> same<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:31.900> in<00:02:32.310> sheet<00:02:33.310> metal

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
Mearing works the same in in sheet metal

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.440 
Mearing works the same in in sheet metal
as<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.700> dozen<00:02:34.799> in<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:36.489> solid<00:02:36.879> models<00:02:37.180> as<00:02:37.299> well

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
as a dozen in the solid models as well

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.559 
as a dozen in the solid models as well
so<00:02:37.870> Oh<00:02:38.700> let's<00:02:39.700> mirror<00:02:39.910> these<00:02:40.060> around<00:02:40.360> this

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
so Oh let's mirror these around this

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.780 
so Oh let's mirror these around this
plane<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.280> we'll<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.459> mirror<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.700> entire

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
plane and we'll just mirror the entire

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.740 
plane and we'll just mirror the entire
pattern

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
pattern

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.270 
pattern
there's<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.049> preview<00:02:44.470> over<00:02:44.799> here<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.129> this

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
there's the preview over here on this

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.670 
there's the preview over here on this
side<00:02:47.849> looks<00:02:48.849> pretty<00:02:49.060> good<00:02:49.269> see<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.290> also<00:02:50.440> want

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
side looks pretty good see I also want

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.729 
side looks pretty good see I also want
to<00:02:50.709> put<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.190> little<00:02:52.000> grip<00:02:52.569> on<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.290> side<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.650> my

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
to put a little grip on the side of my

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.500 
to put a little grip on the side of my
sheet<00:02:53.980> metal<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.400> that's<00:02:54.549> another<00:02:54.790> form<00:02:55.209> tool

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
sheet metal and that's another form tool

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.449 
sheet metal and that's another form tool
so<00:02:56.170> we<00:02:56.200> can<00:02:56.410> actually<00:02:56.560> make<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.040> easier<00:02:57.430> for

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
so we can actually make it easier for

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.610 
so we can actually make it easier for
the<00:02:57.670> user<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.940> pull<00:02:58.269> this<00:02:58.540> cover<00:02:58.870> off<00:02:59.109> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
the user to pull this cover off the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.530 
the user to pull this cover off the
design<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.310> have<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.579> little<00:03:00.700> indented<00:03:01.299> grip

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
design so I have a little indented grip

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.050 
design so I have a little indented grip
again<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.709> real<00:03:02.950> quick<00:03:03.190> it's<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.760> know<00:03:03.879> it's

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
again this real quick it's you know it's

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.699 
again this real quick it's you know it's
just<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.299> solid<00:03:04.629> model<00:03:04.989> we're<00:03:05.319> gonna<00:03:05.410> form

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
just a solid model we're gonna form

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.800 
just a solid model we're gonna form
metal<00:03:05.890> around<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:07.720> use<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:09.540> drag<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.569> in

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
metal around that to use it drag it in

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.470 
metal around that to use it drag it in
it's<00:03:11.739> actually<00:03:12.010> rotated<00:03:12.519> correctly<00:03:12.970> alright

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
it's actually rotated correctly alright

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.930 
it's actually rotated correctly alright
that<00:03:13.720> looks<00:03:13.750> good<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:15.250> can<00:03:15.280> flip<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.670> if<00:03:15.849> it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
that looks good you can flip it if it

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.720 
that looks good you can flip it if it
needed<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.209> go<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.480> other<00:03:16.569> way<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.730> position

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
needed to go the other way and position

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.890 
needed to go the other way and position
I<00:03:18.940> don't<00:03:19.269> need<00:03:19.599> any<00:03:19.750> additional<00:03:20.880> grips<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.150> just

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
I don't need any additional grips I just

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.530 
I don't need any additional grips I just
want<00:03:23.079> to<00:03:23.169> use<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.590> dimension<00:03:23.769> tool<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.540> define

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
want to use the dimension tool to define

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.229 
want to use the dimension tool to define
where<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:25.810> located<00:03:25.989> we'll<00:03:26.440> make<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:27.239> 25

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
where it's located we'll make this 25

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.460 
where it's located we'll make this 25
down<00:03:28.540> from<00:03:28.810> here<00:03:29.139> and<00:03:29.349> from<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.650> front<00:03:31.470> maybe

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
down from here and from the front maybe

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.740 
down from here and from the front maybe
20<00:03:35.849> okay

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
20 okay

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.729 
20 okay
and<00:03:39.750> let's<00:03:39.930> mirror<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.290> around<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.650> the

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
and let's mirror that around to the

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:49.970 
and let's mirror that around to the
other<00:03:40.800> side<00:03:40.920> as<00:03:41.190> well

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.610 

sure<00:03:50.610> we<00:03:50.780> select<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.930> right<00:03:51.989> kind<00:03:52.379> of<00:03:52.470> thing

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
sure we select the right kind of thing

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.250 
sure we select the right kind of thing
that<00:03:52.650> we<00:03:52.800> want<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.040> beer
