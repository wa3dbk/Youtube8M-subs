 serves it must be unfolded and attached the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.300

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.620
 like that now you will tell me he 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.950
 looks like a small seat 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.170
 but beware this is not a seat 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.399
 it's a cap 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.829
 and yes a gift to stall the back well 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.230

 kidneys it can read without bending

 the neck or talk on the beach too 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.820
 well settled that in his couch he 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.460
 note that the water cal can be 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.920
 also placed under the head in order to make 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.340
 the nap for example but the name of 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.950
 call head did not prevail to be 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.180
 quite honest the real name of this 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.400
 object and customers of the fisherman those are 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.190
 served as the seat for fishing since 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.080
 the beach and it's my grandfather fisherman 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.320
 himself who introduced it into our 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.549
 family all my childhood during the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.270
 summer vacation on the edge of the 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.850
 Mediterranean 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.820
 I saw my parents my uncles and aunts 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.130
 and their friends sitting in a circle discussing 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.430
 quietly stuck in the sand 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.380
 while keeping an eye on 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.900
 we kids who were playing at the edge of 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.939
 water and with my girlfriends we did not like 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.790
 nothing like we sit on those seats 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.310
 always a bit unstable and leave us 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.950
 fall back into the blood 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.770
 it's hellish but covered by a 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.810
 delicious feeling of danger the gift 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.240
 of my grandfather was extremely 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.789
 robust not like those of today who 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.119
 only lasts one season or two 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.940
 to unfold it you had to come to 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.330
 tie together two long hooks and 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.930
 this operation was always complicated 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.870
 with rust 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.519
 the system was seizing up and the holidays at 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.380
 the beach always start with a 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.870
 little fight of my parents with the callus 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.200
 of water they sometimes had to start 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.630
 two to get to block the system 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.220
 of war tired from the second day they 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.489
 did not even bother to 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.049
 fold in the evening at the time there was 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.000
 only one model that we could buy 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.530
 tobacco office 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.410
 the whole beach had the same 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.959
 caldo I let you imagine the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.549
 confusions the embedded caldo by 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.799
 in the evening 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.830
 quasi-police investigations for 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.870
 determine the paternity of a gift 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.720
 some even ended up marking 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.430
 their name on the web 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.739
 teenager I found what she owes 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.140
 perfectly nerdy time he was 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.049
 assimilated to the world of adults who do not 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.049
 think that their comfort we were 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.650
 proud us young people to spread ourselves 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.930
 like pancakes on the sand and then a 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.299
 little older force was to notice 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.810
 than to read and chat with my 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.299
 girlfriends 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.970
 it was pretty handy 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.819
 I tried to dig holes 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.230
 in the sand to put my buttocks 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.200
 to read pressed on an elbow 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.209
 read on your stomach or back to back with a 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.780
 girlfriend not very friendly you in 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.989
 agree nothing was also 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.630
 comfortable so I ended up too by 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.459
 buy my back cal just like my 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.680
 parents my uncles and aunts and their 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.380
 friends and you know what 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.269
 I discovered that this device is 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.950
 as wonderful to ogle 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.200
 quietly with a wink the 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.450
 beautiful boys at the water's edge while 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.410
 chatting sitting in circles with my 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.410
 cousins ​​on the beach
