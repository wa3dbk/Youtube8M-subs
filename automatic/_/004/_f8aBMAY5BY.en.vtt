how<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.079> doing<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.640> TJ<00:00:36.000> tell<00:00:36.600> us<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.809> you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
how we doing and so TJ tell us what you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.569 
how we doing and so TJ tell us what you
think<00:00:36.989> about<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.380> fact<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> iphone<00:00:38.280> for

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
think about the fact that the iphone for

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.450 
think about the fact that the iphone for
potentially<00:00:39.500> leaves<00:00:40.500> lefties<00:00:41.160> out<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
potentially leaves lefties out of the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.030 
potentially leaves lefties out of the
picture<00:00:41.670> well<00:00:42.420> speaking<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.410> lefty<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
picture well speaking as the lefty I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.819 
picture well speaking as the lefty I
think<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.450> conclude<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.260> steve<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
think we all can conclude this steve is

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.000 
think we all can conclude this steve is
not<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:48.270> i<00:00:48.960> asked<00:00:49.170> by<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.410> new<00:00:49.680> industrial

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
not and i asked by the new industrial

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
not and i asked by the new industrial
design<00:00:50.520> which<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.000> totally<00:00:51.360> dig<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
design which I totally dig for the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
design which I totally dig for the
iphone<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.039> fact<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.430> i'm<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> be

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
iphone for the fact that i'm going to be

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.290 
iphone for the fact that i'm going to be
blocking<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> hand<00:00:55.980> i<00:00:56.070> use<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:57.059> cool

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
blocking it with the hand i use not cool

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.569 
blocking it with the hand i use not cool
Steve<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.800> got<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
Steve but what what if you got the the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.099 
Steve but what what if you got the the
band<00:00:59.820> around<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.719> which<00:01:00.960> this

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
band around it like which this

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.229 
band around it like which this
supposedly<00:01:01.620> solves<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> issue<00:01:02.340> within<00:01:02.789> would

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
supposedly solves the issue within would

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.820 
supposedly solves the issue within would
you<00:01:03.329> carry<00:01:03.539> one<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.080> would<00:01:04.589> think<00:01:04.710> about

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you carry one then I would think about

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.700 
you carry one then I would think about
it<00:01:05.189> mm-hmm<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> design<00:01:06.710> alright

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it mm-hmm I do like the design alright

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.230 
it mm-hmm I do like the design alright
so<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.010> let's<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.520> try<00:01:08.729> what<00:01:09.060> they've

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
so now let's just try what they've

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.640 
so now let's just try what they've
lights<00:01:09.479> off<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:12.229> okay<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.290> now<00:01:13.470> we've

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
lights off in here okay so now we've

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.170 
lights off in here okay so now we've
turned<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> lights<00:01:14.310> off<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.790> still<00:01:14.970> have

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
turned the lights off but we still have

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.780 
turned the lights off but we still have
some<00:01:15.360> overhead<00:01:15.750> lights<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.640> we're<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
some overhead lights and we're going to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.960 
some overhead lights and we're going to
see<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.119> there's<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.770> two<00:01:20.040> camera<00:01:20.759> phones

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
see if there's the two camera phones

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480 
see if there's the two camera phones
compare<00:01:21.420> they're<00:01:21.600> both<00:01:21.720> 720p<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.340> is

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
compare they're both 720p but this is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
compare they're both 720p but this is
about<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:24.030> how<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.540> handle<00:01:24.869> low<00:01:25.140> light

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
about just how they handle low light

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.740 
about just how they handle low light
definitely<00:01:25.950> see<00:01:26.100> some<00:01:26.369> green<00:01:27.150> at<00:01:27.540> least

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
definitely see some green at least

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.359 
definitely see some green at least
through<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.930> viewfinder<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.250> droid<00:01:29.790> x

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369
