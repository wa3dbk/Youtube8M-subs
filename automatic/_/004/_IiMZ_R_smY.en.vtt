00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.230 
color I think it's gonna look beautiful
on<00:01:24.350> me<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:24.980> this<00:01:25.550> is<00:01:25.700> what<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.970> back<00:01:26.210> looks

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
on me and this is what the back looks

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.600 
on me and this is what the back looks
like<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:29.000> back<00:01:29.860> definitely<00:01:30.860> gets<00:01:31.100> shorter

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
like so the back definitely gets shorter

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.050 
like so the back definitely gets shorter
and<00:01:31.790> then<00:01:32.330> it<00:01:32.450> cuts<00:01:32.780> in<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:34.340> might<00:01:34.760> have<00:01:34.940> to

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
and then it cuts in so I might have to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.490 
and then it cuts in so I might have to
play<00:01:35.240> with<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:35.510> back<00:01:35.750> just<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:36.200> little<00:01:36.230> bit
