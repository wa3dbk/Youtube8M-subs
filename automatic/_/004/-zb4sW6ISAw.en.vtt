00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.080
 Hello, I showed you a video where I am 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.840
 won the auction 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:17.460
 won it now I will show that is 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:21.529
 car radio for 8 more precisely for the 230 form 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.099
 it's 23 it's 23 cents 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.789
 here and here I received a package 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.219
 They said that not car radio a little later 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.300
 will come and here I am still jewelry 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.050
 won and watch that is now open 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.250
 let's see what will happen here they are in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.649
 principle neatly sealed beautiful 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.789
 ribbon 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:52.789
 so well then we press the site more knife 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.860
 We look that they to us 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:10.910
 sent here nothing else in 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.910
 principle perfectly sealed. 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:24.250
 Here is the way I think it's like 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.250
 would watch so well then look 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:41.490
 here even the price is her 9750 you she will 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:45.000
 see here 9750 Price writes so well, that 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.840
 we have a wooden box 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.760
 by the way, and our watch itself 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:58.320
 let's them just a little closer then 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:04.670
 I think itâ€™s very cool 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:09.390
 I'll show you a little bit back now 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:14.090
 Now I will show you how I won them 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:19.770
 by the way here I was wasted 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.920
 750 one bet on them this is this me 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.590
 now to this 75,000 form 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.550
 that is because it is equal to the machine 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.600
 100 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.720
 itâ€™s 75 dollars so i'm on them 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.190
 it can be said to spend 75 dollars 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.910
 our watches themselves look like this 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:47.310
 and in principle, if we compare them, that is 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.130
 they are birds and by the way they are on cars 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.799
 podzavodki here I now look at 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.210
 them but honestly not very cool can 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.560
 be 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:01.950
 a little bit hard to see because of the light in 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:07.080
 here's an apartment like this 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.090

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:25.200
 administration that is, it costs 2 350 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.890

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.850
 spent a thousand 3 bets on her that is 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.390

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.970
 cents 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.140

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.450

 cost that is 230 the form of this 23 cents 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.640

 here is the watch here we look that is 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:43.880
