00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
well we've been talking about it for

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.130 
well we've been talking about it for
about<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.850> month<00:03:27.150> now<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.540> we<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:27.930> haven't

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
about a month now and we just haven't

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.680 
about a month now and we just haven't
had<00:03:28.200> time<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.680> around<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.760> that's

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
had time to get around to it and that's

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.509 
had time to get around to it and that's
a<00:03:30.810> part<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.140> network<00:03:31.320> whenever<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.250> start

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
a part of the network whenever you start

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.890 
a part of the network whenever you start
finding<00:03:32.700> people<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.299> like<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.480> talk<00:03:33.870> to
