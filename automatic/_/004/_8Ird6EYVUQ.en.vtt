00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.409
 however let's start with your 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:14.429
 return 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.009
 four men made me 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.310
 open the safe 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.630
 In this regard, I do not agree 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.630
 you heard you see that with another club 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.199
 we had to attend to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.320
 meetings of the cycle of Ukraine 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.490
 during the test 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.960
 hard week 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.960
 I also think that all at once 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.230
 what about skip by 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.110
 a glass 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.160
 in the Lugansk year the country is committed 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.550
 memory of their problems 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.580
 most often people are professionals from 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.580
 one district and social stratum 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.340
 Do you live with your parents 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.750
 detained in Moscow 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.890
 for 70 people 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.370
 you revert tasks 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.800
 I thought to change something in the decision 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.800
 now either closes attention 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.710
 Guy Germanic was familiar from whence 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 do you know give work such a gap 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.079
 I have the right to doubt everything 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:23.720
 the city 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.620
 three caught on what 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.180
 play by the same rules 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.320
 saying when appeared 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.730
 pretty girlfriend 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.130
 such money will have to be put 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.360
 if something happens to him 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.310
 however if boy 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.310
 learning doors 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.010
 only she can be at the junction of the novel 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.780
 she saw nothing syrup on her toe 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.840
 you can't call it 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.510
 so find me say type 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.640
 otherwise nabucco seems to be no 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.900
 I'm even on food 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.840
 I'll go 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.030
 before you sign remember thomas 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.509
 world 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.309
 according to the show 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:12.719
 amused 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.719
 34 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.539
 still meet on the table shortage 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.749
 city
