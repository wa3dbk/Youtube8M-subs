00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
you know a lot of people probably would

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.030 
you know a lot of people probably would
get<00:01:17.770> confused<00:01:18.340> with<00:01:18.550> this<00:01:18.820> symbol<00:01:19.300> I<00:01:20.010> mean<00:01:21.010> I

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
get confused with this symbol I mean I

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.360 
get confused with this symbol I mean I
got<00:01:21.400> confused<00:01:22.210> with<00:01:22.360> it<00:01:22.570> but<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.830> easiest

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
got confused with it but the easiest

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.530 
got confused with it but the easiest
thing<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:25.030> tell<00:01:25.270> exactly<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.490> combination<00:01:28.300> or

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
thing to tell exactly the combination or

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.399 
thing to tell exactly the combination or
maybe<00:01:28.900> how<00:01:29.409> it<00:01:29.620> works<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:30.130> getting<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.580> hint

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
maybe how it works is getting the hint

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.840 
maybe how it works is getting the hint
now<00:01:32.409> as<00:01:32.530> you<00:01:32.650> can<00:01:32.770> see<00:01:32.830> it<00:01:33.040> says<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.460> breeding

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
now as you can see it says the breeding

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.480 
now as you can see it says the breeding
pair<00:01:34.150> of<00:01:34.360> Dragons<00:01:34.900> must<00:01:35.170> contain<00:01:35.650> cold<00:01:36.190> and

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
pair of Dragons must contain cold and

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.450 
pair of Dragons must contain cold and
lightning<00:01:37.210> elements<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:37.840> breeding<00:01:38.530> time<00:01:38.950> or

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
lightning elements and breeding time or

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.870 
lightning elements and breeding time or
-<00:01:39.880> I<00:01:40.000> mean<00:01:40.030> breeding<00:01:41.020> must<00:01:41.229> start<00:01:41.530> between<00:01:42.220> 7

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880
