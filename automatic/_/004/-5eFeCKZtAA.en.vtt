pitching okay now we're moving ourselves
around<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.410> horn<00:00:07.620> we're<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.950> move

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
around the horn we're going to move

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.900 
around the horn we're going to move
ourselves<00:00:08.220> now<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.730> third<00:00:09.090> base<00:00:10.700> what<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.730> would

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
ourselves now to third base what I would

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.490 
ourselves now to third base what I would
challenge<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.389> left<00:00:12.570> handers<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.290> kind

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
challenge the left handers to do is kind

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.509 
challenge the left handers to do is kind
of<00:00:13.559> look<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:13.769> you're<00:00:14.099> looking<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
of look like you're looking in the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.720 
of look like you're looking in the
mirror<00:00:14.759> right<00:00:14.820> now<00:00:14.969> as<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.260> as<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:17.250> was

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
mirror right now as this is as this was

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.359 
mirror right now as this is as this was
a<00:00:17.760> first<00:00:18.090> base<00:00:18.270> move<00:00:18.980> what<00:00:19.980> we're<00:00:20.100> gonna<00:00:20.189> do

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
a first base move what we're gonna do

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.060 
a first base move what we're gonna do
here<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.260> that<00:00:22.260> we're<00:00:22.410> gonna<00:00:22.500> work<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.920> our

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
here is that we're gonna work on our

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.099 
here is that we're gonna work on our
angles<00:00:23.430> here<00:00:23.640> I've<00:00:24.359> got<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> line<00:00:24.930> that's

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
angles here I've got a line that's

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.009 
angles here I've got a line that's
approximately<00:00:25.830> 45<00:00:26.279> degrees<00:00:26.869> which<00:00:27.869> is

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
approximately 45 degrees which is

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.679 
approximately 45 degrees which is
technically<00:00:28.699> not<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> rule<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> rule<00:00:30.480> book

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
technically not a rule in the rule book

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.780 
technically not a rule in the rule book
there<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.080> no<00:00:31.289> such<00:00:31.560> thing<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.980> 45<00:00:32.460> degree

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
there is no such thing as a 45 degree

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.600 
there is no such thing as a 45 degree
angle<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.960> you'll<00:00:34.200> often<00:00:34.829> get<00:00:35.190> many<00:00:35.430> umpires

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
angle but you'll often get many umpires

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.170 
angle but you'll often get many umpires
say<00:00:36.120> hey<00:00:36.989> went<00:00:37.260> past<00:00:37.500> 45<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.610> sense<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
say hey went past 45 in a sense it's a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
say hey went past 45 in a sense it's a
bit<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> judgment<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:41.540> what<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> rule<00:00:42.840> rule

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
bit of a judgment on what the rule rule

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.229 
bit of a judgment on what the rule rule
is<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.770> momentum<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.550> my<00:00:44.700> momentum<00:00:45.120> is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
is on momentum so if my momentum is

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.250 
is on momentum so if my momentum is
carrying<00:00:45.570> myself<00:00:45.719> towards<00:00:46.940> home<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.300> can't

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
carrying myself towards home I can't

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.529 
carrying myself towards home I can't
throw<00:00:49.500> back<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.800> third<00:00:50.219> base<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:50.700> vice<00:00:51.510> versa

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
throw back to third base or vice versa

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
throw back to third base or vice versa
on<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> other<00:00:52.230> side<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.710> first<00:00:53.039> base<00:00:53.250> I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
on the other side with first base I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.510 
on the other side with first base I
can't<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:54.030> home<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.860> pick<00:00:55.860> two<00:00:56.129> first

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
can't go home and then pick two first

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.810 
can't go home and then pick two first
base<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.109> I'm<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.670> I'm<00:00:59.670> going

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
base so what I'm going to do I'm going

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.490 
base so what I'm going to do I'm going
to<00:00:59.879> give<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> three<00:01:00.449> levels<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.050> pickoff

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
to give you three levels of this pickoff

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.860 
to give you three levels of this pickoff
and<00:01:01.800> they're<00:01:01.890> more<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.219> setup<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.870> there's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and they're more of a setup and there's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.560 
and they're more of a setup and there's
a<00:01:03.960> couple<00:01:04.140> different<00:01:04.290> phases<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:06.330> first

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
a couple different phases so the first

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.390 
a couple different phases so the first
part<00:01:06.780> I'm<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> work<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.710> basical

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
part I'm going to work on just basical

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.359 
part I'm going to work on just basical
basic<00:01:09.210> straight<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.409> give<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> head

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
basic straight on and give you a head

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.469 
basic straight on and give you a head
movement<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.909> type<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.180> thing<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:13.350> pitcher

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
movement that type of thing as a pitcher

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.210 
movement that type of thing as a pitcher
normally<00:01:15.479> when<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:15.780> pitching<00:01:16.619> home

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
normally when I'm pitching home

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
normally when I'm pitching home
I<00:01:17.250> watch<00:01:18.090> my<00:01:18.119> base<00:01:18.509> runner<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.930> long<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.320> can

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
I watch my base runner as long as I can

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.310 
I watch my base runner as long as I can
last<00:01:19.890> minute<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.460> pick<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> plate<00:01:21.659> there's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
last minute I pick up the plate there's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.320 
last minute I pick up the plate there's
a<00:01:22.380> big<00:01:25.070> I'm<00:01:26.070> not<00:01:26.130> sure<00:01:26.430> exactly<00:01:26.820> what<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
a big I'm not sure exactly what it is

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.200 
a big I'm not sure exactly what it is
but<00:01:27.689> there's<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.439> big<00:01:28.680> thought<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.520> are

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
but there's this big thought that we are

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.999 
but there's this big thought that we are
deceiving<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.990> runner<00:01:31.229> by<00:01:33.110> giving<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.200> big<00:01:34.799> look

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
deceiving a runner by giving a big look

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
deceiving a runner by giving a big look
home<00:01:35.280> or<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.520> big<00:01:35.700> almost<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.630> call<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
home or a big almost like I call it's a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.260 
home or a big almost like I call it's a
big<00:01:37.200> fake<00:01:37.470> home<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.729> we're<00:01:38.850> trying<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.150> do

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
big fake home so what we're trying to do

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.889 
big fake home so what we're trying to do
here<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.500> first<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:41.509> which<00:01:42.509> I'll<00:01:42.689> call

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
here is the first one which I'll call

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.560 
here is the first one which I'll call
say<00:01:43.259> our<00:01:43.439> C<00:01:43.799> move<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.880> we're<00:01:45.180> gonna<00:01:45.270> look

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
say our C move is that we're gonna look

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.889 
say our C move is that we're gonna look
away<00:01:46.500> early<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> pick<00:01:48.479> I'm<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
away early so when I pick I'm going to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.490 
away early so when I pick I'm going to
step<00:01:49.500> directly<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.220> third<00:01:50.670> base<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.380> then<00:01:52.380> I'm

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
step directly at third base and then I'm

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.550 
step directly at third base and then I'm
gonna<00:01:52.649> look<00:01:53.009> away<00:01:53.390> early<00:01:54.390> okay<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.000> big<00:01:57.000> fake

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
gonna look away early okay so big fake
