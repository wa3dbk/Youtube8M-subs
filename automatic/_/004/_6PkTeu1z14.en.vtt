 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.600
 scream ready today I have good for 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.550
 you news namely, I finally 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.040
 I updated my pieces of iron yes I do 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.980
 spent and now I have absolutely 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.040
 empty wallet in the head wind and a little 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.720
 tears but now i have a full 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 HD monitor and video card is not 650-700 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.280
 50 with two gigabytes of video memory 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.590
 which means that I can write to you 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.500
 new games without a loss of quality and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.750
 on the contrary with his even with a butterfly so 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.030
 In general, then full hd for you dear 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.010
 friends for sure don't forget 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.049
 put your thumb up and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.690
 subscribe to the channel if you have 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.989
 not done in the meantime I have for you 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.210
 for a no less significant event 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.020
 prepared a great fight or rather a 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.450
 sunset rst I spoke more video on e50 not 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.549
 so long ago she was but what we see 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.380
 now the game does not start the battle 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.960
 a little bit cut out nothing interesting there 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.760
 It was not until the end of the battle in general 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.189
 nothing interesting you will not see so 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.799
 quietly I will try to look for ways 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.460
 nastrela but let's get a little distracted 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.950
 on topic 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.680
 I talked about medium tanks that is in 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.770
 the game while we have ph drops and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.759
 period other chips are not needed on principle 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.890
 medium tanks 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.990
 Well, rather, of course they are needed but they 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.750
 do not play such a crucial role as 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.079
 let's say some fv 4005 or 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.859
 british conqueror horse so in general 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.990
 then the t-55 and leopard m48 is of course all 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:52.140
 great and you can really play them 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.299
 and often also interesting but bend on 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.969
 them so easy to take and bend alas 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.130
 no, there is no magic stick bent over 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.619
 Alas, we did not put one-time damage 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.289
 small after updating so wild and 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.359
 rate of fire and accuracy no yes there is 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.520
 good speed but excuse me 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.810
 actually what gives us this we can 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.690
 appear where needed 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.060
 but is it always necessary for us of course 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.240
 I do not argue that the competent choice of position 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.040
 on the map it's half the victory probably but 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.770
 don't care how when we are deprived 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.070
 some kind of killer weapon or me 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.140
 armor is actually here already to win 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.780
 it gets harder but what to do 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.970
 if you can't win, somehow 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.850
 try to help your team so that 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.100
 she won for you and vst 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.440
 pitch such a supporting role are wonderful 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.140
 comes out we have a small one-time 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.810
 damage but pretty good dpm pretty 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.520
 often we shoot with this damage 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.860
 after all we can pick it up 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.380
 any heavy tanks and so on 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.270
 by the way here it begins now 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.680
 the interesting part of the battle we stay together 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.970
 all 50 against the storming of the tiger and t-28 which 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.640
 as it turned out speed 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.040
 but in the storming tiger anyway if we 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.320
 we will not act in concert he us 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.510
 just shoot one at a time any 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.000
 esteshka bursts from hitting assault 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.250
 tiger just in 1 if he got normal 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.860
 even if he gets close to the ground then 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.680
 half hp can be lost without problems 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.070
 so that there is a great danger 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.870
 here I do not climb on the rampage waiting for the E50 and waiting 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.940
 when he gets closer 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.320
 warmed up the assault tiger so that I could 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.060
 drive behind him somehow 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.730
 shoot in general now there will be 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.950
 straight tactic tactic tactic nobody 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.680
 the tiger does not want to be stormed 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.660
 get out of my hiding place but 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.660
 what is convenient for him there in his houses 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.610
 highlights it t28 which i decided not to 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.720
 touch well and understandable actually have 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.270
 the problem is more important 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.130
 but he highlights the assault on the tiger and therefore 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.890
 how would that u tiger should know where we are 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.410
 we are therefore I'm trying to find myself here 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.780
 come up with something like me to quit 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.120
 the light and where do I go ? 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.490
 going this way so i think that 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.190
 will enter the other side so in general 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.930
 I'm starting to implement this very tactic 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.930
 but in general, in principle, is not so difficult 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.060
 It was for me an understanding of gwt players 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.400
 comes already somewhere in half a year 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.580
 games so I have everything with this plan 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.919
 quite rich but e50 but that's why he 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.320
 did it broke the perfect 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.990
 opportunity to take and take this assault 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.940
 the tiger is just taking it to the tongs that is two 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.040
 st-shki it can breed it 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.460
 can look at two directions in one 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.350
 same time right can't 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.630
 but here of course I blunted a little 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.970
 too late realized put it 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.979
 on the caterpillar and at the assault the tiger turned out 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.500
 repair kit here I do not dare 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.449
 rolling back of course get 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.490
 splat now when such a responsible 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.500
 I would not want a moment 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.020
 because I'm for storming tigers again 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.930
 shot that once again proves that she and 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.449
 skirmishes need hands and bend over without hands 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.639
 alas you will not work 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.949
 it began but in general let's go further 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.410
 will look after my tactical 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.389
 I certainly act head on to assault 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.639
 Tiger get out I'm afraid I saw that he 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.919
 stopped and looks in my direction a 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.930
 means I better get out of here and 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.949
 far away it was certainly a thought 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.169
 stand on base 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.389
 but then I had a chance that I didn't 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.630
 I have time to detect and he will take me, yes 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.460
 slap and I do not want this outcome 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.590
 I want to win and in order to 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.780
 to defeat I have no one to have this 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.180
 the challenge will have to win over the most 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.340
 so I rely on my optics and 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.440
 game bugs apparently now was 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.690
 precisely tank because the assault tiger somehow 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.210
 there lit up through the house at 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.979
 as far as i know where it is and since i 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.020
 suggested that he would wait for me with 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.300
 the other side will be waiting for me what i am 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.280
 it will go around the well again this 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.020
 just need to know 90 percent of the time 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.659
 players say and do that 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.639
 I go around him back on that side 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.830
 from where I’m no longer waiting 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.460
 in fact, it's just a matter of little 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.620
 it remains to shoot his loin parts 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.139
 gas tanks you are styling and so on and 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.530
 further on the list but see the moment 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.900
 the most interesting I go to him 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.469
 in the back here so they rub it in and here 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.400
 so here 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:15.020
 both turned around and I thought that there 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.630
 right now can get close to the ground 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.000
 swat but thank god lucky here 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.400
 how would bug a little game but nothing 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.530
 correct sooner or later but there was such 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.050
 not exactly a very dangerous situation 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.940
 but the grid to the specific was such 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.099
 pretty interesting pretty 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.990
 volleyball fight but although for me if 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.880
 honestly it was n’t you probably 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.400
 for those who have less experience, yes they would 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.259
 fussed but in principle I assumed 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.870
 where should be the storming tiger and that he 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.210
 will do as he will 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.280
 Well, of course, don't look for a rough plan. 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.440
 Action of course I did not say 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.070
 that my actions were the only 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.380
 faithful 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.540
 I had the right to make mistakes and in principle 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.550
 could die no problem cost him 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.230
 just wait for me from the other side 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.900
 don't turn around or drive off here 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.450
 here in the corner and all my song is sung to me 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.520
 I would have to take it to the base of the left 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.600
 could remember discharge because the base 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.820
 there is no place to hide 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.070
 again this is a miscalculation from the assault 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.170
 tiger but gwt players like i said 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.720
 love not to think about likes to act 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.740
 therefore, actually the one who thinks that 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.270
 can win 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.180
 well in this fight it was 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.490
 demonstrated a t-55 of course 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.730
 car just great as medium 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.310
 tank but but but but alas medium tanks 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.900
 now the game is not so in demand so what 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:33.270
 Well put likes subscribe to the channel 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.270
