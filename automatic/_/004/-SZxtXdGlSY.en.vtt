00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.309

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.780

 how to be happy of life imagine yourself 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.770
 with with the lady babe who are not 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.020
 preparing those delights but we did 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.660
 a break for 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.570
 as we have the meat tell us a little 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.279
 of cattle what kind of cows is what 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.570
 you have here quickly 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.600
 hereford charolais angus can everything 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.850
 what is bought in the auction 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:47.760
 comes to the auctions and buys the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.739
 won and well here we give her 260 days 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.950
 of food for the meat that comes out 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.559
 white blandita andale there is the 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.320
 issue for those of us who do not know about meat 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.120
 and above all so so so so 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.850
 specialized 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.880
 60 days of feeding to get out 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.270
 You say planted it depends on the cow 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.310
 cow entity already well advanced or something of 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.009
 less days or more days very well from 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.619
 animal depends on the unal reach the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.770
 race and it depends on the race very well the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.670
 There is not too much fat in the patent leather 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.440
 angus and that's poses barraza the hereford 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.649
 and I guess it also depends on nothing 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.799
 plus the feeding time but the 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.280
 kind of food that does not get everything 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:40.250
 the supplement of nariño lina my rolled 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.750
 concentrate your vitamins minerals 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.700
 postcards all right, that's the secret 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.710
 I imagine so that the meat a good 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.840
 meat good meat 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.600
 Well, what do you do? 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.970
 this part and then there you told me that 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.790
 Another of your brothers here is your brother 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.940
 your cousin Rodrigo Rodrigo is the one who 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.250
 handles the cuts of the cuts we 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.100
 could show something of how to do it or 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.899
 cohorts like five monkeys and perfect 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.149
 then we will continue to throw him 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.009
 a cial look at all the cattle and go 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.569
 to go with Rodrigo to show us a 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.630
 little bit more about the cuts of 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.970
 carne kinchil in chihuahua longuet now 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.510

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.239
 brother or cousin cousin brother of cousin 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.750
 flat brother and you take care of the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.970
 cut of the meat that part is this 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.100
 this is a quarter back room 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.890
 back part of the cow is us 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.120
 we imagine something that is part of the ass 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:44.239
 it's part of the back leg and its back 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.239
 since you get from this back room 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.570
 of beef meat because first of all 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.790
 here what is the back part of here 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:57.010
 we take loin chop or the rival 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:02.550
 the cut we call we feel 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.550
 very well here is what it is 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.270
 bone in this look like this piece 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.360
 you get these three types of cuts that 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.630
 They are so and so prized and so precious 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.890
 not in an out there in the market 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.090
 summer 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.130
 sir long and the spine or the rival up there is 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.350
 eight is the loin and from here then 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.430
 we remove the back rib and what 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.940
 taste the rib back rib the 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.980
 It will take the leg very well 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.020
 want many times and that is a one doubt 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.870
 that many of us have that part is the 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.000
 ranchera or is it if you showed 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.750
 You can show it with your knife to 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.230
 see it the ranchera 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.520
 part of the fabric that divides the visor 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.890
 green of the red 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.340
 it's a piece I see it there as I say 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.310
 it's a bit let's say there was nothing left 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.790
 it seems that a cloth comes off here 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.950
 from here to back 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.700
 for ahead here forwards is the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.799
 heart liver and lungs already 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.769
 Rodrigo and what part we are going to eat the day 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:17.030
 today we are going to taste a 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:19.910
 simoncito of something squishy teddy aha 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.699
 to please the tooth we are going to 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.210
 to please the grindstone that I liked and 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.460
 let's see and pay attention what it does 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.259
 Rodrigo as he does I'm going to spend 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.860
 on this side forced for our apart 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:36.800
 and that everyone can see and there it is 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.540
 what you did was cut the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.020
 piece 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.470
 to remove the primary cut the cut 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.470
 First 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.300
 this would be active 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:20.779
 there is the cut this is the cut I'm not going 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:24.919
 to take one to show them because it is 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:27.169
 very clear because the name of tivón in 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.749
 English not as you are told in Spanish there is 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.689
 there is some term consul where 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:34.639
 Let's say chuletón el chuletón or ibón 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:38.599
 that our country is already well known 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.909
 for this form of tea that comes that has 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.969
 the meat and that is going to give all that 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:52.270
 taste the fat that also makes it 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:54.680
 juicy and rodrigo here is raw 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.930
 it's going to be something else and I think that if 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.889
 we are going to visit the lady babe not very 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.960
 good you think 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.229

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.740
 work apart from that you explained to us very 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.949
 all right 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.069
 part of what your job is 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.979

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.539
