just trying to get the thing back and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.520 
just trying to get the thing back and
dribbles<00:02:02.820> back<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.509> John<00:02:03.750> makes<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.320> nice

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
dribbles back and then John makes a nice

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.639 
dribbles back and then John makes a nice
reaction<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.899> you<00:02:06.899> know<00:02:06.990> barely<00:02:07.320> gets

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
to it missing almost bounces twice and I

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.020 
to it missing almost bounces twice and I
think<00:02:10.590> he<00:02:10.709> does<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> good<00:02:11.190> job<00:02:11.250> number<00:02:11.790> one<00:02:11.819> to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
think he does a good job number one to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.470 
think he does a good job number one to
keep<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.300> away<00:02:12.510> from<00:02:12.540> me<00:02:12.870> because<00:02:13.020> I'm

that's<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.530> real<00:02:53.890> good<00:02:54.269> possibility<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.599> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
that's a real good possibility it is the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.770 
that's a real good possibility it is the
highest<00:02:55.930> part<00:02:56.349> of<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.500> net<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:57.670> did<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.510> only

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
highest part of the net I did the only

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.050 
highest part of the net I did the only
thing<00:02:59.019> here<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.530> cliff<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.609> know<00:03:00.730> he's

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
thing here is a cliff is you know he's

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.360 
thing here is a cliff is you know he's
really<00:03:01.299> back<00:03:01.690> behind<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.200> service<00:03:02.590> line<00:03:02.769> kind

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
really back behind the service line kind

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.309 
really back behind the service line kind
of<00:03:03.489> hard<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.730> tell<00:03:03.819> from<00:03:04.090> this<00:03:04.299> angle<00:03:04.569> so

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
of hard to tell from this angle so

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.690 
of hard to tell from this angle so
that's<00:03:05.530> going<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.799> make<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.250> little<00:03:06.430> bit

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
that's going to make it a little bit

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.539 
that's going to make it a little bit
tough<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.510> drop<00:03:07.750> shot<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:09.069> then<00:03:09.220> some<00:03:09.519> of

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.390 
about loading up for topspin hear that
you<00:04:09.400> know<00:04:09.430> topspin<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.690> swing<00:04:10.989> shape<00:04:11.410> well

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
you know topspin the swing shape well

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.670 
you know topspin the swing shape well
kind<00:04:12.730> of<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.090> way<00:04:13.389> it<00:04:13.510> works<00:04:13.750> it'll<00:04:14.109> keep<00:04:14.410> you

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
kind of the way it works it'll keep you

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.689 
kind of the way it works it'll keep you
moving<00:04:15.430> out<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.599> the<00:04:16.690> court<00:04:16.959> more<00:04:17.229> and<00:04:17.500> so<00:04:18.190> my

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
moving out of the court more and so my

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.779 
moving out of the court more and so my
thought<00:04:18.940> here<00:04:19.209> is<00:04:19.269> that<00:04:20.340> is<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.579> gotta

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
thought here is that is you gotta

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.310 
thought here is that is you gotta
consider<00:04:22.300> number<00:04:22.659> one<00:04:22.780> where<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.050> want<00:04:23.229> to

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
consider number one where you want to

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.200 
consider number one where you want to
hit<00:04:23.409> it<00:04:23.469> but<00:04:23.740> number<00:04:24.070> two<00:04:24.099> what's<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.940> swing

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
hit it but number two what's the swing

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.240 
hit it but number two what's the swing
shape<00:04:25.450> going<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.780> do

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
shape going to do

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.160 
shape going to do
for<00:04:26.820> your<00:04:26.940> recovery<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.750> think<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.020> this

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
for your recovery and I think in this

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.100 
for your recovery and I think in this
case<00:04:28.230> a<00:04:28.860> little<00:04:29.610> topspin<00:04:30.120> here<00:04:30.450> doesn't<00:04:30.930> help

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
case a little topspin here doesn't help

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.390 
case a little topspin here doesn't help
you<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:31.320> think<00:04:31.680> it<00:04:31.830> pulls<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.190> out<00:04:32.220> of<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
you I think it pulls you out of the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.930 
you I think it pulls you out of the
court<00:04:32.640> more<00:04:32.880> that's<00:04:33.570> why<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:33.930> like<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:35.520> slice

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
court more that's why I like the slice

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.690 
court more that's why I like the slice
and<00:04:36.390> that's<00:04:36.840> what<00:04:37.080> cliff<00:04:37.350> does<00:04:37.650> he<00:04:38.340> plays<00:04:38.670> a

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
and that's what cliff does he plays a

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.470 
and that's what cliff does he plays a
little<00:04:39.180> bit<00:04:39.360> of<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:39.570> slice<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.520> yet<00:04:41.520> look<00:04:42.390> at

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
little bit of a slice and yet look at

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.960 
little bit of a slice and yet look at
that<00:04:42.570> far<00:04:42.840> out<00:04:42.990> of<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.140> core<00:04:43.380> he<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.920> so<00:04:44.700> if

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
that far out of the core he is and so if

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.870 
that far out of the core he is and so if
he'd<00:04:45.240> gone<00:04:45.570> up<00:04:45.900> here<00:04:46.290> with<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:46.710> shot<00:04:47.010> if<00:04:47.700> he'd

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
he'd gone up here with that shot if he'd

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.360 
he'd gone up here with that shot if he'd
gone<00:04:48.090> here<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.320> been<00:04:49.680> that<00:04:49.920> far<00:04:50.160> out<00:04:50.310> of

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
gone here and and been that far out of

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.640 
gone here and and been that far out of
the<00:04:50.460> court<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:50.940> mean<00:04:51.540> you<00:04:51.660> can<00:04:51.840> see<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.140> he's

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
the court I mean you can see that he's

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.170 
the court I mean you can see that he's
not<00:04:52.860> going<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.040> have<00:04:53.160> time<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.340> recover<00:04:53.760> and

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
not going to have time to recover and

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.620 
not going to have time to recover and

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.640 
think this this forehand volley might
have<00:05:44.340> been<00:05:44.490> just<00:05:44.700> a<00:05:44.850> hair<00:05:45.090> deep<00:05:45.410> let's<00:05:46.410> see<00:05:46.560> if

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
have been just a hair deep let's see if

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.140 
have been just a hair deep let's see if
we<00:05:46.770> can<00:05:46.919> stop<00:05:47.190> it<00:05:47.370> right<00:05:47.580> at<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.760> point<00:05:48.000> of
