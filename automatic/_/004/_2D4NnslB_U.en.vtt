00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello good morning 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.189
 relationships let's teach like a little 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.450
 the programming of the whole standard range 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.940
 of sequence 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.760
 here you can see the switch motor 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.230
 to give you current of the assortment of 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.090
 the remote controls and the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.520
 pushbuttons that we can find 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.190
 then good the most important thing for 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.470
 start both programming and 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.720
 U-turn whatever it is with the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.650
 engine is to know where of programming or 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.930
 buts 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.170
 for example this is the remote control 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.359
 of a channel 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.100
 the button but we can find it here 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:41.510
 behind 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.850
 with cited this rubber has 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.960
 we can try it by giving it current 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.960
 we give it twice 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.329
 right now 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.940
 communication 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.380
 this is the button but it does not have a button 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.380
 but if the farts is to give up and to the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.930
 stop at once 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.560
 we remove the motor current 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.560
 the currents 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.320
 up study 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.880
 here we have the command of 15 channels with 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.439
 hour timer 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.610
 the programming is well in the same 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.570
 has the same button but back 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.570
 we remove currents 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.310
 the current 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400
 Y 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.440
 good 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.730
 another distance also from the worn 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.870
 in this case of adding 15 channels 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.350
 we select the each time we arrive 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.350
 program 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.760
 we give it to him and here we would need an object 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.180
 stabbing we would give it twice up and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.180
 if program 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.540
 and we can see a push button 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.130
 15-channel radio frequency 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.350
 we have his life is all for you low 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.180
 we can change the channel and here we have 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.230
 the programming button we give you current 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.230
 both times here 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.720
 we have already worked 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.030
 this is the push button of a channel 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.220
 radio frequency where time force 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.130
 the method comes to be the same has the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.910
 rise in this the advanced and this is the 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.910
 programming button 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.470
 is another connoisseur of another different range 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.780
 also with a timer to 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.209
 schedule of a channel 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.660
 in this case the farts button is the one 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.710
 it's right around the corner 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.340
 let's do the same thing we give 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.340
 current 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.400
 this is the radio frequency button 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.340
 gas model and with this we have 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.530
 the same typology let's say that 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.290
 sued abroad this one does not have 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.290
 button but 24 but look at this for once 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.940
 but the right thing 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.590
 and here we have it 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.700
 is another radio frequency used in this 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.210
 case the farts button is pulled out 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.210
 the embellisher 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.910
 and the button that you have here in the middle is the 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.349
 button but if you enter something sharp 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.819
 just like when the remote control 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.819
 this day 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.900
 very well this is all in terms of 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.740
 gadget programming re 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.740
 differentiated
