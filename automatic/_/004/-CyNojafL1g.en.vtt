00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.389
 Putin has an absolutely accurate goal and in 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.490
 this we all have the same opinion 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.190
 this is his country back to size again 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.490
 which he considers the country deserves 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.330
 and he uses methods that can 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.189
 understand but you can’t accept them 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.960
 example can not accept that shot down 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.380
 Malaysian passenger plane where 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.750
 there were 280 passengers with it too 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.260
 put up with it put up with it 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.790
 can i tell you they shot him down with 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.780
 rocket system which is obvious 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.280
 Russian was delivered to the rebels 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.739
 so I repeat against the supply of weapons 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.829
 I am for us to apply diplomacy to 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.050
 last second but i want us not 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.460
 embellish and events and so I was 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.230
 for sanctions the same as the answer to that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.230
 a decision that I can not accept 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.439
 you can say why you are against 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.240
 sanctions willingly but this is what I can not 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.619
 agree with this so that you are now 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.750
 everyone took and mixed no just so 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.850
 because there is an official 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.770
 investigation about the downed aircraft and we are up 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.890
 today we do not know exactly 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.869
 why who and why I look forward 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.729
 report where the perpetrators are named and we 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.470
 capable of using satellites to read 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.150
 numbers of cars why not 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.700
 evidence that seems to be as it is 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.610
 publish and then everyone will know 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.409
 what happened back to sanctions i 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.420
 I think that we should learn the country 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.570
 the mentality which we are not very good 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.680
 familiar learn can look at it with 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.869
 such a perspective 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.360
 to make it clear what kind of reaction 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:57.210
 It gives them what caused something from 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.369
 we and we need very, very much 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:06.329
 crush to start something that will lead 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:08.399
 some kind of agreement with Kiev and to 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.679
 what should this lead if you think 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.459
 that in the world have achieved sanctions where is not 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.459
 gave the result and 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.770
 someone will say that in south africa but their 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.720
 results, too, I can bet 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.120
 Iran sanctions results too 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.100
 you can argue 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.110
 what do we want then we are basically 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.820
 we want with Russia I think so without 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.520
 Russia can not be but against it and 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.070
 not at all with Russia in Europe 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.260
 reasonable policy and how could 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.680
 think of it even if you agree that 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.760
 sanctions will bring something that they will bring 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.680
 to the world or 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.410
 bring us closer to the solution and although I’m different 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.840
 opinions but you can even talk about it 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.490
 if you need that moment alive 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.630
 It was necessary to take the same and think about 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:02.490
 cancellation strategies you have it 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.980
 and what kind of sanctions were imposed with 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.180
 aim to hit the Russian economy to 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.180
 put them at the negotiating table 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.900
 sorry to put the negotiating table 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.490
 all forms and negotiations were frustrated and not 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.200
 because Putin wanted it 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.200
 but because the west did not want to communicate 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.550
 why do we need advice nato and russia 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.680
 to make coffee drink his work right away 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.100
 stopped Petersburg dialogue one of 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.690
 international public forums in 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.360
 he intervened they allowed us 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.160
 I would meet with pleasure to see 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.830
 here was if you did this with 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.210
 sides of russia on european council russia 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.250
 have taken away the right to vote 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:49.550
 Mr. Leading I can not stop her 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:53.010
 she can not say arguments but I think 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.860
 now you all understand it was a whole 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.720
 a series of evidence that European 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.260
 and especially the German side in 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.700
 Russia has made big mistakes 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.700
 I am always for accuracy and details
