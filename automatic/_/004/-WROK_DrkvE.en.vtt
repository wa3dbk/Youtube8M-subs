00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
another take an embryonic stem cell and

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.470 
another take an embryonic stem cell and
turn<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.040> into<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.250> heart<00:02:19.580> muscle<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.180> we've

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
turn it into a heart muscle and we've

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.390 
turn it into a heart muscle and we've
learned<00:02:20.720> how<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.930> do<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:22.040> these<00:02:22.190> are

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
learned how to do that so these are

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.520 
learned how to do that so these are
undifferentiated<00:02:23.090> human<00:02:23.840> embryonic<00:02:24.140> stem

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
undifferentiated human embryonic stem

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.230 
undifferentiated human embryonic stem
cells<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.130> these<00:02:25.310> would<00:02:25.640> be<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.910> starting

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
cells so these would be the starting

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.780 
cells so these would be the starting
material<00:02:26.780> from<00:02:27.080> which<00:02:27.260> we'd<00:02:27.530> make<00:02:27.740> cells<00:02:28.670> to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
material from which we'd make cells to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.580 
material from which we'd make cells to
treat<00:02:28.940> spinal<00:02:29.180> cord<00:02:29.510> injury<00:02:29.810> or<00:02:30.140> cells<00:02:30.500> to

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
treat spinal cord injury or cells to

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.410 
treat spinal cord injury or cells to
treat<00:02:30.740> heart<00:02:31.010> disease<00:02:31.040> or<00:02:31.520> diabetes<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.270> this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
treat heart disease or diabetes so this

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.390 
treat heart disease or diabetes so this
is<00:02:32.540> essentially<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.140> raw<00:02:33.290> material<00:02:33.890> these

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
is essentially the raw material these

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.100 
is essentially the raw material these
cells<00:02:34.670> are<00:02:34.790> essentially<00:02:35.090> immortal<00:02:35.390> unlike

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
cells are essentially immortal unlike

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.960 
cells are essentially immortal unlike
normal<00:02:36.440> cells<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:37.100> your<00:02:37.130> body<00:02:37.280> these<00:02:37.730> cells

will grow forever as long as we give

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.190

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
them room to grow in nutrients and we

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.720 
them room to grow in nutrients and we
can<00:02:42.320> take<00:02:42.440> advantage<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.070> property<00:02:43.580> then

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
can take advantage of that property then

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.810 
can take advantage of that property then
to<00:02:43.970> expand<00:02:44.390> them<00:02:44.510> as<00:02:44.630> much<00:02:44.780> as<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:45.050> want<00:02:45.820> the

glial cells the glial cells make

with<00:04:07.810> myelin<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.590> protein<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:09.940> enables<00:04:10.480> the

nerve to conduct the impulse without
short-circuiting<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.740> when<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.700> remove

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
short-circuiting and when you remove

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.550 
short-circuiting and when you remove
that<00:04:16.060> insulation<00:04:16.600> from<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.959> spinal<00:04:17.200> cord

that insulation from the spinal cord

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.500 
that insulation from the spinal cord
it's<00:04:17.739> very<00:04:18.160> analogous<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:19.000> removing<00:04:19.480> the

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
insulation from an electrical wire you

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.770 
insulation from an electrical wire you
essentially<00:04:21.730> short<00:04:21.940> out<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.240> signal<00:04:22.600> so<00:04:22.750> you

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
essentially short out the signal so you

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.870 
essentially short out the signal so you
can't<00:04:23.110> transmit<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.070> neural<00:04:24.370> impulses

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
can't transmit that the neural impulses

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.700 
can't transmit that the neural impulses
back<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.240> forth<00:04:25.480> what<00:04:25.900> we<00:04:26.020> learn<00:04:26.230> how<00:04:26.380> to<00:04:26.410> do

back and forth what we learn how to do

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.800 
back and forth what we learn how to do

embryonic<00:04:29.200> stem<00:04:29.500> cells<00:04:29.770> we<00:04:30.430> then<00:04:30.640> put<00:04:30.970> those

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
embryonic stem cells we then put those

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.470

was the first real demonstration of what

the promise of regenerative medicine is

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.940 
the promise of regenerative medicine is
these<00:04:54.340> cells<00:04:55.120> are<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.960> cells<00:04:56.200> we're<00:04:56.590> going<00:04:56.830> to

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
these cells are the cells we're going to

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.310 
these cells are the cells we're going to
use<00:04:57.100> in<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.400> spinal<00:04:57.669> cord<00:04:57.790> injury<00:04:58.210> trial<00:04:58.480> so

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
use in the spinal cord injury trial so

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.290 
use in the spinal cord injury trial so
these<00:04:59.710> cells<00:05:00.070> started<00:05:00.610> as<00:05:00.729> undifferentiated

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
these cells started as undifferentiated

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.180 
these cells started as undifferentiated
cells<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.110> then<00:05:02.380> we<00:05:02.410> used<00:05:02.800> one<00:05:02.979> of<00:05:03.010> our

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
cells and then we used one of our

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.070 
cells and then we used one of our
processes<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:04.000> make<00:05:04.180> them<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.510> cell<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.960> will

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
processes to make them a cell that will

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.440 
processes to make them a cell that will
go<00:05:05.200> on<00:05:05.410> once<00:05:05.740> it's<00:05:05.890> transplanted<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:07.150> go<00:05:07.300> on

go on once it's transplanted to go on

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.870 
go on once it's transplanted to go on
and<00:05:07.720> repair<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.710> damaged<00:05:09.040> spinal<00:05:09.250> cord<00:05:09.640> it'll

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
and repair the damaged spinal cord it'll

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.880 
and repair the damaged spinal cord it'll
essentially<00:05:10.360> put<00:05:10.630> new<00:05:10.810> insulation<00:05:11.229> back<00:05:11.680> on

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
essentially put new insulation back on

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.430 
essentially put new insulation back on
the<00:05:12.010> damaged<00:05:12.370> nerve<00:05:12.610> cord<00:05:12.940> in<00:05:13.210> that<00:05:13.330> case<00:05:13.570> and

the damaged nerve cord in that case and

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.570 
the damaged nerve cord in that case and
they're<00:05:14.620> not<00:05:14.740> much<00:05:14.919> to<00:05:15.130> look<00:05:15.250> at<00:05:15.400> obviously

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
they're not much to look at obviously

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.719 
they're not much to look at obviously
under<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.330> microscope<00:05:16.720> but<00:05:17.590> we're<00:05:18.100> hoping

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
under the microscope but we're hoping

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.700 
under the microscope but we're hoping
that<00:05:18.790> in<00:05:19.330> people<00:05:19.720> they<00:05:20.020> have<00:05:20.200> a<00:05:20.229> very<00:05:20.440> very

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
that in people they have a very very

that in people they have a very very
profound<00:05:20.860> effect

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.680 

we<00:05:24.919> started<00:05:25.610> out<00:05:25.760> to<00:05:26.180> try<00:05:26.389> to<00:05:26.449> make<00:05:26.660> a

we started out to try to make a
myelinated<00:05:27.260> cell<00:05:27.650> but<00:05:28.340> one<00:05:28.490> of<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:28.699> fruits<00:05:29.060> of

myelinated cell but one of the fruits of
that<00:05:29.330> accomplishment<00:05:30.290> is<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.889> recognize<00:05:31.460> that

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
that accomplishment is to recognize that
