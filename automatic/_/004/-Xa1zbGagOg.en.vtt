00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
some of the more nonsensical gender

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.080 
some of the more nonsensical gender
stereotypes<00:00:07.500> originate<00:00:08.160> take<00:00:08.849> for<00:00:09.030> example

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090

the<00:00:09.570> most<00:00:09.780> basic<00:00:10.320> label<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.950> one<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.429> were

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550

especially for toddlers and fair enough

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.720

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
where did it come from because there

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.710 
where did it come from because there
can't<00:00:25.590> be<00:00:25.680> anything<00:00:26.039> inherently<00:00:26.910> masculine

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
shahs infant Department dated 1918 it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.720 
shahs infant Department dated 1918 it
says<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.480> generally<00:00:39.960> accepted<00:00:40.170> rule<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.070> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
says the generally accepted rule is that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.240 
says the generally accepted rule is that
pink<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> boys<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.290> blue<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> girls

pink for the boys and blue for the girls

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.000 
pink for the boys and blue for the girls
the<00:00:45.000> reason<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.660> pink<00:00:46.170> being<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> more

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the reason is that pink being a more

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.430 
the reason is that pink being a more
decided<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.789> stronger<00:00:48.360> color<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.840> more

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
decided and stronger color is more

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.100 
decided and stronger color is more
suitable<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.460> boy<00:00:50.610> while<00:00:51.180> blue<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
suitable for the boy while blue which is

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.619 
suitable for the boy while blue which is
more<00:00:52.260> delicate<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.860> dainty<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.610> prettier<00:00:54.270> for

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
more delicate and dainty is prettier for

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
more delicate and dainty is prettier for
the<00:00:54.719> girl<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.230> fact<00:00:55.500> pink<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:56.010> supposed<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> be

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the girl in fact pink was supposed to be

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520 
the girl in fact pink was supposed to be
similar<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.090> red<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.780> considered

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
similar to red which was considered

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.889 
similar to red which was considered
masculine<00:00:59.100> because<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.910> was<00:01:00.059> associated<00:01:00.420> with

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
masculine because it was associated with

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.170 
masculine because it was associated with
war<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.129> grew<00:01:02.309> up<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> other<00:01:02.969> way

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
war but we grew up with it the other way

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.000 
war but we grew up with it the other way
around<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.780> clearly<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.290> means<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.890> the

them<00:02:21.860> because<00:02:22.190> as<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.430> seven-year-old<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.510> felt

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
them because as a seven-year-old I felt

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.390 
them because as a seven-year-old I felt
that<00:02:24.050> there<00:02:24.230> was<00:02:24.380> something<00:02:24.560> inherently

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
that there was something inherently

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.750 
that there was something inherently
shallow<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.240> fickle<00:02:26.810> about<00:02:27.320> being<00:02:27.740> girly<00:02:28.400> so

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
shallow and fickle about being girly so

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.640 
shallow and fickle about being girly so
I<00:02:28.820> wouldn't<00:02:29.120> do<00:02:29.330> girly<00:02:29.870> things<00:02:30.140> even<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:30.530> I

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
I wouldn't do girly things even if I

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.800 
I wouldn't do girly things even if I
wanted<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.220> because<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.820> felt<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.450> being

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
wanted to because I felt that being

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.990 
wanted to because I felt that being
boyish<00:02:33.410> made<00:02:34.010> me<00:02:34.220> cool

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
boyish made me cool

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
like it gave me street cred but that's

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.990 
like it gave me street cred but that's
not<00:02:38.090> what<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.750> is<00:02:39.170> because<00:02:39.890> GI<00:02:40.310> Joes<00:02:40.700> and
