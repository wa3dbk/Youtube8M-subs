00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.610 

I<00:00:10.660> felt<00:00:11.660> like<00:00:11.720> it<00:00:11.840> was<00:00:11.930> a<00:00:11.960> pretty<00:00:12.110> strong<00:00:12.350> bike

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
I felt like it was a pretty strong bike

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.150 
I felt like it was a pretty strong bike
all<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:12.890> way<00:00:13.010> around<00:00:13.160> I<00:00:13.610> was<00:00:15.160> really

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
all the way around I was really

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.030 
all the way around I was really
impressed<00:00:16.280> with<00:00:16.610> how<00:00:16.880> it<00:00:17.119> climbs<00:00:18.040> especially

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
impressed with how it climbs especially

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.600 
impressed with how it climbs especially
in<00:00:19.580> tight<00:00:19.820> areas<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:20.420> it's<00:00:21.230> an<00:00:21.410> NL<00:00:21.830> defendant

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
in tight areas and it's an NL defendant

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.050 
in tight areas and it's an NL defendant
or<00:00:22.790> defendants<00:00:23.950> both<00:00:24.950> fast<00:00:25.220> and<00:00:25.460> slow<00:00:25.610> speeds

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
or defendants both fast and slow speeds

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.330 
or defendants both fast and slow speeds
I've<00:00:26.810> always<00:00:27.440> felt<00:00:27.770> comfortable<00:00:28.160> in<00:00:28.280> the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
I've always felt comfortable in the

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.180 
I've always felt comfortable in the
cockpit<00:00:28.520> and<00:00:29.140> I<00:00:30.140> never<00:00:30.470> felt<00:00:30.800> like<00:00:30.860> the<00:00:31.010> bike

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
cockpit and I never felt like the bike

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.900 
cockpit and I never felt like the bike
was<00:00:31.400> out<00:00:31.760> of<00:00:31.820> control<00:00:32.620> it's<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.699> frame

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
was out of control it's a the frame

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.130 
was out of control it's a the frame
little<00:00:35.210> bit<00:00:35.300> larger<00:00:35.629> than<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.750> frame<00:00:35.900> i<00:00:35.989> might

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
little bit larger than the frame i might

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.810 
little bit larger than the frame i might
normally<00:00:36.320> ride<00:00:36.650> and<00:00:36.980> i<00:00:37.190> still<00:00:37.580> felt

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
normally ride and i still felt

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.119 
normally ride and i still felt
completely<00:00:38.239> in<00:00:38.390> control<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:38.840> bike<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.320> felt

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
completely in control the bike I felt

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.319 
completely in control the bike I felt
like<00:00:40.899> had<00:00:41.899> a<00:00:41.930> nice<00:00:43.090> positive<00:00:45.579> with<00:00:46.579> geometry

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
like had a nice positive with geometry

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.910 
like had a nice positive with geometry
City<00:00:47.780> my<00:00:47.989> stance<00:00:48.290> but<00:00:48.530> felt<00:00:48.770> really

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
City my stance but felt really

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.350 
City my stance but felt really
comfortable<00:00:49.100> in<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.489> bike<00:00:49.610> my<00:00:49.880> I<00:00:49.910> wasn't<00:00:50.270> too

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
comfortable in the bike my I wasn't too

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.000 
comfortable in the bike my I wasn't too
stretched<00:00:50.660> out<00:00:51.790> it<00:00:52.790> really<00:00:53.710> was<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:54.739> nice

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
stretched out it really was a nice

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.360 
stretched out it really was a nice
balance<00:00:55.370> between<00:00:55.780> what<00:00:56.780> I<00:00:56.840> we<00:00:57.020> call<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.649> race

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
balance between what I we call a race

balance between what I we call a race
geometry<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.270> relaxed<00:01:00.079> well<00:01:00.559> when<00:01:01.129> I<00:01:01.190> was

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
geometry and relaxed well when I was

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:02.830 
geometry and relaxed well when I was
climbing<00:01:01.789> with<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.120> bike<00:01:02.270> I<00:01:02.450> tried<00:01:02.660> climbing

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
climbing with the bike I tried climbing

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.810 
climbing with the bike I tried climbing
a<00:01:03.050> couple<00:01:03.289> different<00:01:03.350> ways<00:01:03.620> I<00:01:03.890> tried<00:01:04.160> climbing

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
a couple different ways I tried climbing

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.969 
a couple different ways I tried climbing
his<00:01:05.210> way<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.420> was<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:05.660> traditionally<00:01:06.050> climb<00:01:06.259> on

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
his way I was a traditionally climb on

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.969 
his way I was a traditionally climb on
my<00:01:07.039> single<00:01:07.789> fee<00:01:07.940> which<00:01:08.149> is<00:01:08.330> just<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:09.920> know

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
my single fee which is just you know

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.100 
my single fee which is just you know
picking<00:01:10.340> my<00:01:10.430> gear<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:10.970> standing<00:01:11.780> up<00:01:11.899> and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
picking my gear and standing up and

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.199 
picking my gear and standing up and
matching<00:01:12.680> up<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.830> climb<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.729> I'll<00:01:13.910> try

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:14.209 
matching up a climb and I'll try

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:17.109 
matching up a climb and I'll try
climbing<00:01:15.429> using<00:01:16.429> the<00:01:16.520> gear<00:01:16.700> sitting

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
climbing using the gear sitting

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.120 
climbing using the gear sitting
comfortably<00:01:17.780> in<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:17.959> seat<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.679> know<00:01:18.800> guiding

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
comfortably in the seat you know guiding

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.919 
comfortably in the seat you know guiding
the<00:01:19.220> front<00:01:19.429> wheel<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:20.569> know<00:01:20.660> putting<00:01:20.840> my

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
the front wheel you know putting my

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.050 
the front wheel you know putting my
weight<00:01:21.110> back<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.709> using<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.399> gear<00:01:22.550> spin<00:01:22.940> up

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
weight back and using the gear spin up

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.779 
weight back and using the gear spin up
climb<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:24.530> was<00:01:24.709> impressed<00:01:25.190> really<00:01:25.670> with

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
climb and I was impressed really with

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.169 
climb and I was impressed really with
both<00:01:25.970> ways<00:01:26.179> I<00:01:26.420> didn't<00:01:26.690> feel<00:01:26.929> a<00:01:27.289> lot<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.179> pedal

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
both ways I didn't feel a lot of pedal

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.070 
both ways I didn't feel a lot of pedal
Bob<00:01:29.330> when<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:29.869> was<00:01:30.140> ended<00:01:30.709> up<00:01:30.830> matching<00:01:31.039> but<00:01:32.030> I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
Bob when I was ended up matching but I

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.300 
Bob when I was ended up matching but I
can<00:01:33.080> certainly<00:01:33.200> say<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.560> strength<00:01:34.069> of<00:01:34.220> the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
can certainly say the strength of the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.240 
can certainly say the strength of the
bike<00:01:34.490> was<00:01:34.899> using<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:35.990> years<00:01:36.259> sitting<00:01:36.890> you

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
bike was using the years sitting you

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.120 
bike was using the years sitting you
know<00:01:37.280> sitting<00:01:37.610> in<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.119> seat<00:01:39.009> guiding<00:01:40.009> that

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
know sitting in the seat guiding that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.010 
know sitting in the seat guiding that
front<00:01:40.340> wheel<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.910> spitting<00:01:41.300> up<00:01:41.420> climbs<00:01:41.660> I<00:01:41.899> was

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
front wheel and spitting up climbs I was

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.760 
front wheel and spitting up climbs I was
able<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.440> I<00:01:43.569> do<00:01:44.569> that<00:01:44.929> by<00:01:45.080> doing<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.530> was

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
able to I do that by doing that I was

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.249 
able to I do that by doing that I was
able<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:46.160> make<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.459> over<00:01:46.490> obstacles<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:47.899> I

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
able to make it over obstacles that I

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.690 
able to make it over obstacles that I
normally<00:01:48.530> would<00:01:49.099> deal<00:01:49.250> with<00:01:49.280> fear<00:01:49.580> and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
normally would deal with fear and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.249 
normally would deal with fear and
probably<00:01:49.970> couldn't<00:01:50.240> hear<00:01:50.360> if<00:01:50.479> I<00:01:50.569> would<00:01:51.170> have

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
probably couldn't hear if I would have

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.419 
probably couldn't hear if I would have
done<00:01:51.380> my<00:01:51.530> traditional<00:01:51.860> standing<00:01:52.250> up<00:01:52.310> and

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
done my traditional standing up and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.160 
done my traditional standing up and
mashing<00:01:52.789> I<00:01:52.970> was<00:01:53.450> able<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.660> guide<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.989> front

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
climbing spinning i would probably big

cities<00:02:06.890> syncline<00:02:07.550> was<00:02:07.819> probably<00:02:08.179> more<00:02:08.569> of<00:02:08.690> a

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
cities syncline was probably more of a

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.080 
cities syncline was probably more of a
drink<00:02:09.020> with<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.229> life<00:02:09.560> than

drink with that life than

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.610 
drink with that life than
there<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> was<00:02:12.540> actually<00:02:12.840> surprised<00:02:13.349> I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
there I was actually surprised I

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.429 
there I was actually surprised I
expected<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.549> bike<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:15.060> not<00:02:15.299> handle<00:02:15.840> that

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
expected the bike to not handle that

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.130 
expected the bike to not handle that
well<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:17.430> being<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.970> size<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.810> bike<00:02:18.900> and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
well one being the size of the bike and

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.130 
well one being the size of the bike and
also<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.439> size<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.799> wheel<00:02:20.450> but<00:02:21.450> it

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
also the size of the wheel but it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.569 
also the size of the wheel but it
handled<00:02:23.269> flow<00:02:24.269> uphill<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:26.220> know<00:02:26.340> tight

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579

clear them all and I was able to clear
things<00:02:30.659> that<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> sometimes<00:02:31.560> don't<00:02:31.739> clear<00:02:32.040> and

not to control the bike that wasn't the

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
case Mike was very easy to control and I

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.860 
case Mike was very easy to control and I
always<00:03:04.680> felt<00:03:04.950> confident<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.700> over<00:03:06.000> going

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
always felt confident going over going

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.210 
always felt confident going over going
over<00:03:07.049> any<00:03:07.230> obstacles<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.889> order<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.129> switch

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
over any obstacles in order to switch

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.879 
over any obstacles in order to switch
back<00:03:08.659> going<00:03:09.659> at<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> fast<00:03:09.959> speed<00:03:10.290> down<00:03:10.620> hill

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.740 
back going at a fast speed down hill
that<00:03:11.760> was<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.239> most<00:03:12.389> impressive

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that was I think the most impressive

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.360 
that was I think the most impressive
because<00:03:13.139> you<00:03:13.470> were<00:03:13.590> really<00:03:13.769> able<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.129> pick

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
because you were really able to pick

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.699 
because you were really able to pick
lines<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:15.150> not<00:03:15.359> even<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.629> best<00:03:15.690> line<00:03:16.019> but<00:03:16.560> you

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
lines and not even the best line but you

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.550 
lines and not even the best line but you
take<00:03:16.919> a<00:03:16.949> lines<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.579> just<00:03:18.090> pull<00:03:18.510> out<00:03:18.660> your<00:03:18.870> bomb

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
take a lines and just pull out your bomb

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.970 
take a lines and just pull out your bomb
downhill<00:03:20.629> the<00:03:21.629> obstacles<00:03:22.169> were<00:03:22.410> completely

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
downhill the obstacles were completely

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.729 
downhill the obstacles were completely
fluid<00:03:23.340> out<00:03:23.489> by<00:03:23.669> the<00:03:23.730> suspension<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.629> it<00:03:25.500> was

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
fluid out by the suspension and it was

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.280 
fluid out by the suspension and it was
really<00:03:26.639> impressive<00:03:26.970> but<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.359> helps<00:03:27.720> my<00:03:28.109> not

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
really impressive but it helps my not

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.770 
really impressive but it helps my not
coming<00:03:28.590> from<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.829> hardtail<00:03:29.340> background<00:03:29.879> so<00:03:30.599> if

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
coming from a hardtail background so if

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.080 
coming from a hardtail background so if
I<00:03:30.930> was<00:03:31.190> completely<00:03:32.190> impressed<00:03:32.669> with<00:03:32.940> how<00:03:33.060> well

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
I was completely impressed with how well

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.089 
I was completely impressed with how well
the<00:03:33.449> bike<00:03:33.569> handled<00:03:33.989> Bobby<00:03:34.440> downhills<00:03:34.829> I<00:03:34.980> would

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
the bike handled Bobby downhills I would

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.670 
the bike handled Bobby downhills I would
absolutely<00:03:35.190> chuckle<00:03:35.790> as<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.690> bounced<00:03:37.139> over<00:03:37.199> you

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
absolutely chuckle as I bounced over you

honestly I be if it's got a pretty nice
component<00:03:59.870> set<00:04:00.019> up<00:04:00.110> I<00:04:00.200> think<00:04:00.260> for<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:01.220> price

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
component set up I think for the price

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.839 
component set up I think for the price
range<00:04:01.760> but<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.510> wouldn't<00:04:02.750> mind<00:04:02.810> seeing<00:04:03.200> a

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
range but I wouldn't mind seeing a

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.089 
range but I wouldn't mind seeing a
little<00:04:04.849> bit<00:04:04.940> higher<00:04:05.150> end<00:04:05.450> maybe<00:04:05.920> crank<00:04:06.920> or

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
little bit higher end maybe crank or

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.390 
little bit higher end maybe crank or
chain<00:04:07.280> rings<00:04:07.519> in<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.760> front<00:04:08.170> but<00:04:09.310> rotten<00:04:10.310> yo

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
chain rings in the front but rotten yo

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.479 
chain rings in the front but rotten yo
just<00:04:10.819> riding<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.540> bike<00:04:11.860> over<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.950> trails<00:04:13.190> I

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
just riding the bike over the trails I

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.550 
just riding the bike over the trails I
really<00:04:14.150> can't<00:04:14.180> pinpoint<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.840> certain<00:04:15.230> weakness

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
really can't pinpoint a certain weakness

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.840 
really can't pinpoint a certain weakness
I<00:04:15.680> didn't<00:04:15.890> feel<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.100> said<00:04:16.280> was<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.430> weakness<00:04:16.789> that

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
I didn't feel I said was a weakness that

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.670 
I didn't feel I said was a weakness that
I<00:04:17.090> could<00:04:17.269> say<00:04:17.479> you<00:04:18.019> know<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.229> handles<00:04:18.650> great

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
I could say you know it handles great

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.939 
I could say you know it handles great
it's<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.549> suspension<00:04:20.539> work<00:04:20.870> way<00:04:21.380> with<00:04:21.530> both<00:04:21.739> do

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
it's a suspension work way with both do

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.659 
it's a suspension work way with both do
so<00:04:22.699> I<00:04:23.090> can't<00:04:23.449> play<00:04:23.660> on<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.810> weakness<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:25.550> know

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
so I can't play on a weakness you know

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.920 
so I can't play on a weakness you know
you<00:04:26.180> could<00:04:26.300> definitely<00:04:26.419> raised<00:04:26.720> from<00:04:26.840> the

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
you could definitely raised from the

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.469 
you could definitely raised from the
spike<00:04:27.139> I<00:04:27.320> had<00:04:27.680> no<00:04:27.889> problems<00:04:28.430> picking<00:04:29.120> up<00:04:29.300> speed

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
spike I had no problems picking up speed

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.120 
spike I had no problems picking up speed
on<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.720> spike<00:04:29.900> is<00:04:30.110> this<00:04:30.289> I<00:04:30.500> fell<00:04:30.979> at<00:04:31.100> the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
on the spike is this I fell at the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.010 
on the spike is this I fell at the
geometry<00:04:31.729> when<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:31.940> was<00:04:32.060> on<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.300> was<00:04:32.419> more<00:04:32.690> it's

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
geometry when I was on it was more it's

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.719 
geometry when I was on it was more it's
kind<00:04:33.229> of<00:04:33.260> in<00:04:33.350> between<00:04:33.440> what<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.220> would<00:04:34.340> call<00:04:34.460> a

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
kind of in between what I would call a

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.120 
kind of in between what I would call a
relaxed<00:04:35.180> geometry<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:36.350> hunch<00:04:36.710> over<00:04:36.830> race

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
relaxed geometry and a hunch over race

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.620 
relaxed geometry and a hunch over race
geometry<00:04:37.639> where<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:37.880> want<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.210> know<00:04:38.270> you're

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
geometry where you want you know you're

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.529

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
kind of geared for speed but obviously

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.150 
kind of geared for speed but obviously
you<00:04:42.080> could<00:04:42.229> play<00:04:42.440> with<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.650> couple<00:04:42.919> components

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
you could play with a couple components

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.420 
you could play with a couple components
if<00:04:43.639> it<00:04:43.880> gets<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.090> few<00:04:44.270> you<00:04:44.419> wanted<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:45.860> if<00:04:46.190> you

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
if it gets a few you wanted so if you

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.640 
if it gets a few you wanted so if you
were<00:04:46.550> someone<00:04:46.970> who<00:04:47.000> was<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.510> serious<00:04:48.169> racer<00:04:48.530> and

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
were someone who was a serious racer and

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.480 
were someone who was a serious racer and
that<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:48.919> that's<00:04:49.039> what<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:49.190> plan<00:04:49.340> on<00:04:49.370> doing

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
that and that's what you plan on doing

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.550 
that and that's what you plan on doing
you<00:04:49.760> might<00:04:49.910> look<00:04:50.060> at<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.630> bike<00:04:50.960> made<00:04:51.229> for<00:04:51.410> that

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
you might look at a bike made for that

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.950 
you might look at a bike made for that
but<00:04:52.190> if<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.340> were<00:04:52.430> someone<00:04:52.760> who<00:04:52.789> you<00:04:53.599> loved

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
but if you were someone who you loved

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.550 
but if you were someone who you loved
riding<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.320> bike<00:04:54.500> on<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.610> weekend<00:04:56.479> basis<00:04:56.900> big

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
riding the bike on a weekend basis big

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.409 
riding the bike on a weekend basis big
rise<00:04:57.800> here<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.220> there<00:04:58.340> hence<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:58.970> mountain

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
rise here and there hence the mountain

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.629 
rise here and there hence the mountain
and<00:04:59.680> sure<00:05:00.680> you<00:05:00.830> might<00:05:00.950> race<00:05:01.099> every<00:05:01.340> now<00:05:01.460> and

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
and sure you might race every now and

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.150 
and sure you might race every now and
then<00:05:01.729> it's<00:05:02.030> like<00:05:02.090> so<00:05:02.389> you<00:05:02.479> might<00:05:02.630> do<00:05:02.810> a<00:05:02.840> Fun<00:05:03.560> Fun

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
then it's like so you might do a Fun Fun

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.969 
then it's like so you might do a Fun Fun
Run<00:05:04.520> 5k<00:05:05.180> every<00:05:05.599> now<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:05.840> then<00:05:05.960> this<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:06.800> could

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
Run 5k every now and then this I could

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.400 
Run 5k every now and then this I could
certainly<00:05:07.160> handle<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:08.080> honestly<00:05:09.080> I<00:05:09.169> think<00:05:09.260> the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
certainly handle it honestly I think the

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.650 
certainly handle it honestly I think the
spike<00:05:09.590> that's<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.950> wide<00:05:10.490> range<00:05:10.729> of<00:05:11.030> possible

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
intermediate to advanced rider you a lot

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.080 
intermediate to advanced rider you a lot
of<00:05:15.620> riding<00:05:15.800> with<00:05:16.190> a<00:05:16.220> lot<00:05:16.370> of<00:05:16.400> racing<00:05:16.849> I

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
of riding with a lot of racing I

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.420 
of riding with a lot of racing I
probably<00:05:17.419> ride<00:05:17.599> over<00:05:18.200> 3,000<00:05:18.710> miles<00:05:18.860> we're<00:05:19.190> on

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
probably ride over 3,000 miles we're on

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.080 
probably ride over 3,000 miles we're on
a<00:05:19.490> mountain<00:05:19.820> bike<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:22.610> spike<00:05:22.820> would<00:05:22.970> be

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
a mountain bike and the spike would be

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.940 
a mountain bike and the spike would be
fine<00:05:23.240> for<00:05:23.270> somebody<00:05:23.630> like<00:05:23.660> myself<00:05:23.900> I<00:05:24.410> think

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
fine for somebody like myself I think

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.450 
fine for somebody like myself I think
it's<00:05:25.190> more<00:05:25.280> an<00:05:25.460> issue<00:05:25.550> of<00:05:25.760> a<00:05:26.270> budget<00:05:26.720> I<00:05:26.870> mean<00:05:27.080> I

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
it's more an issue of a budget I mean I

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.460 
it's more an issue of a budget I mean I
and<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:28.330> light<00:05:28.449> comes<00:05:28.660> in<00:05:28.780> at<00:05:28.930> up<00:05:29.050> around<00:05:29.319> two

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.700 
and the light comes in at up around two
thousand<00:05:29.800> dollars<00:05:30.100> and<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:31.930> would<00:05:32.530> think

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
thousand dollars and I would think

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.939 
thousand dollars and I would think
someone<00:05:33.240> who<00:05:34.240> was<00:05:34.419> running<00:05:34.690> intermediate<00:05:35.470> if

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
someone who was running intermediate if

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.050 
someone who was running intermediate if
you<00:05:36.130> are<00:05:36.220> a<00:05:36.250> beginner<00:05:36.400> looking<00:05:36.819> to<00:05:36.910> get<00:05:37.000> a

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
you are a beginner looking to get a

you are a beginner looking to get a
solid<00:05:37.840> first<00:05:38.289> bike<00:05:38.560> I<00:05:38.590> mean<00:05:39.520> it<00:05:39.639> supposed<00:05:39.910> to

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
solid first bike I mean it supposed to

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.150 
solid first bike I mean it supposed to
be<00:05:40.000> a<00:05:40.060> great<00:05:40.270> bike<00:05:40.710> just<00:05:41.710> know<00:05:41.860> that<00:05:42.009> you're
