00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.710
 today speech 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.139
 mother and about the reason for the great expense 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.150
 fuel and for a long time could not understand why 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.960
 me on the new carburetor and on the old 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.930
 almost the same big expense 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.380
 fuel 10 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.519
 track and though 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:34.710
 there was such a consumption on top of 7 liters 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.240
 I just got drunk 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.660
 here 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:45.100
 show a little inside the carburetor here 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.150
 this is the gate 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:54.700
 sucking well here now i am 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.490
 I pull just choke 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.330
 lever and it will be seen as walking 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.330
 damper 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.060
 here you can see that the flap in place of the myth 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.610
 tables and after cast 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.979
 suction lowest position cause 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.630
 this is now i will show the very reason 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.799
 unscrew the lid of the pan so that it is more convenient 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.159
 was to get to the question for reason 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.159
 panties 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:47.149
 well here risk mounted reason 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.979
 But in this his cables are hard to see 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.979
 Now I will try to show 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.400
 here it is visible cable that he bends 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:21.860
 and not fully determined that is 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:28.100
 The reason it is in this now I cable 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:31.390
 I will not straighten the latch yet 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.390
 she's standing back to the end 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.959
 where the finger a control cable 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.959
 on gets in place 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.680
 that is, this problem can be solved simply 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:54.019
 cutting off the shirt and the cable and you teeth 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:57.189
 asks and doing here a little further now 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.189
 it did 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:09.640
 8 key unscrew lock 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.640
 shirts here fixing rock 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:21.240
 all released 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:21.240
 it remains to unscrew itself clamp hold 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.909
 here 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.230
 visible bend 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.480
 shirt saw such a bent cable 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.530
 Now there I'm building a shirt 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:09.510
 about here at that distance 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:11.910
 no bunch extra bent cable i love 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.770
 we will use it for a long time 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.320
 such a tool for cutting 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:24.590
 success is not very guaranteed that 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.590
 pliers will give exactly cut shirt 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.800
 that's all and he broke the cable we further 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:44.690
 smooth 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.690
 slightly straighten it with pliers 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840
 trim 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.900
 shirt cut 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.160
 measured the time it seemed that a little bit 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.160
 longish. 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.220
 the main one is now screwed 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.050
 nowhere bend but the shirt cable 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.050
 comes here further 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.430
 I went the rope itself bait 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.430
 and reinforcements are worn and the valve itself 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.390
 maximum elongated suction shows that 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.390
 the damper was worn out 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:58.569
 Now the flap is worth as suction 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:06:01.779
 cleaned up ok 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.240
 long fought until you open the lid 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:06.159
 pans 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.679
 it is not clear what was the reason for 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.089
 fuel consumption 

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:16.839
 now it seems like fuel consumption 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:18.009
 ok well on the fuel consumption scale not 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:21.279
 quite clear how much I have 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:25.899
 spent fuel was now she 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:32.520
 worth almost one second slightly in 

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:32.520
 I 'll show you an example 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.930
 there was an arrow 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.190
 on the other side of the mark on the right and 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.840
 about the same distance 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.270
 plan back that is for these two days was 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:52.530
 found 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.530
 about 70 kilometers 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:03.600
 I don't shoot myself anymore 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:08.970
 turned out consumption depending on when it lights 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:14.990
 fuel level light bulb and then already 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.990
 see birds form on the odometer
