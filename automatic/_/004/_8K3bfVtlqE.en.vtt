on the vlog I actually did it so let me
just<00:00:15.480> talk<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.870> through<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.260> process<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the first thing is that this would

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.380 
the first thing is that this would
change<00:00:19.260> considerably<00:00:19.859> if<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.939> didn't<00:00:21.240> have

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
change considerably if you didn't have

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.670 
change considerably if you didn't have
hardware<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.050> was<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.410> literally

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
hardware that was just literally

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.300 
hardware that was just literally
natively<00:00:23.660> supported<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.710> you're<00:00:26.130> going<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
natively supported so if you're going to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.890 
natively supported so if you're going to
build<00:00:26.490> yourself<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.029> hacking<00:00:27.330> torch<00:00:27.539> then<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
build yourself a hacking torch then the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.970 
build yourself a hacking torch then the
first<00:00:28.109> thing<00:00:28.260> you've<00:00:28.410> got<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> make<00:00:28.740> sure<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
luckily this motherboard that I've got

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.740 
luckily this motherboard that I've got
here<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.550> pretty<00:00:44.910> much<00:00:45.059> everything<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
here and pretty much everything in the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
here and pretty much everything in the
box<00:00:46.020> was<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.559> literally<00:00:46.860> fully<00:00:47.190> supported

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
box was just literally fully supported

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.729 
box was just literally fully supported
almost<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.840> box<00:00:49.050> from<00:00:49.289> Mavericks

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
almost out of the box from Mavericks

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.729 
almost out of the box from Mavericks
itself<00:00:50.219> had<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.670> install<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.300> couple<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.260> texts

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
itself had to install a couple of texts

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.150 
itself had to install a couple of texts
but<00:00:52.860> we'll<00:00:53.010> come<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.640> second<00:00:54.030> so

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
but we'll come on to that in a second so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
but we'll come on to that in a second so
basically<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> process<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.180> you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
basically the process was this you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.740 
basically the process was this you
download<00:00:58.260> Mavericks<00:00:58.800> onto<00:00:59.579> an<00:00:59.910> existing<00:01:00.239> Mac

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
download Mavericks onto an existing Mac

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
download Mavericks onto an existing Mac
and<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.260> has<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.370> slash

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
and it has to be in the slash

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.140 
and it has to be in the slash
Applications<00:01:03.480> folder<00:01:04.880> then<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.909> download

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
Applications folder then you download

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.200 
Applications folder then you download
uni<00:01:06.780> beast<00:01:06.990> from<00:01:07.320> Tony<00:01:07.650> Mac's

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
uni beast from Tony Mac's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.300 
uni beast from Tony Mac's
website<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:10.140> basically<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.680> run<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
website and you basically just run that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.149 
website and you basically just run that
and<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:12.930> automatically<00:01:13.530> detects<00:01:13.979> your

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and it automatically detects your

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.399 
and it automatically detects your
Mavericks<00:01:14.670> installation<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.960> put<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
Mavericks installation and then put that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.670 
Mavericks installation and then put that
Union<00:01:16.950> beast<00:01:17.159> plus<00:01:17.820> Mavericks<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> USB

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
Union beast plus Mavericks on to a USB

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
Union beast plus Mavericks on to a USB
stick<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.759> need<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.290> formally

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
stick that you need to have formally

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.060 
stick that you need to have formally
formatted<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.810> creates<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.470> uni<00:01:25.860> beast

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
formatted so that creates your uni beast

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.649 
formatted so that creates your uni beast
installation<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.119> collaboration

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
installation so that's a collaboration

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.020 
installation so that's a collaboration
of<00:01:27.869> uni<00:01:28.200> beast<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.369> Mavericks

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
of uni beast and the Mavericks

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
of uni beast and the Mavericks
installation<00:01:30.780> media<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.189> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
installation media then what you do is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.499 
installation media then what you do is
you<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.369> basically<00:01:32.670> go<00:01:33.030> over<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.390> your

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
you just basically go over to your

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.890 
you just basically go over to your
computer<00:01:33.630> put<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.979> USB<00:01:35.460> stick<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
computer put in the USB stick and it

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.010 
computer put in the USB stick and it
boots<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.500> from<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.670> Uni<00:01:38.970> beast<00:01:39.180> install<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
boots up from the Uni beast install and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.980 
boots up from the Uni beast install and
then<00:01:40.470> starts<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> install<00:01:41.490> Mavericks<00:01:42.360> onto

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
then starts to install Mavericks onto

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
then starts to install Mavericks onto
your<00:01:43.140> machine<00:01:43.470> once<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.340> done<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.970> then

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
your machine once that's done you then

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.389 
your machine once that's done you then

working<00:02:31.319> sound<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.549> working<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.690> see<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
working sound is working you can see the

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.990 
working sound is working you can see the
screen<00:02:34.230> resolution<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:35.250> picked<00:02:35.519> up<00:02:35.670> both

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
screen resolution it's picked up both

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.259 
screen resolution it's picked up both
the<00:02:36.599> ATI<00:02:37.500> graphics<00:02:38.159> card<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.180> could

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
the ATI graphics card so I could

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.119 
the ATI graphics card so I could
essentially<00:02:39.870> use<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.530> over<00:02:40.620> here<00:02:40.890> cuz<00:02:41.040> each

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
essentially use it over here cuz each

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.979 
essentially use it over here cuz each
one's<00:02:41.370> got<00:02:41.549> three<00:02:41.879> ports<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.420> need<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.780> sync

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
one's got three ports so I need to sync

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.819 
one's got three ports so I need to sync
so<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.200> could<00:02:43.440> actually<00:02:43.560> use<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.920> here<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:46.079> it

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
so I could actually use it here so it

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.339 
so I could actually use it here so it
picked<00:02:47.040> up<00:02:47.220> all<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.609> that<00:02:47.730> stuff<00:02:48.060> 32<00:02:49.049> gig<00:02:49.230> of

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
picked up all of that stuff 32 gig of

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.720 
picked up all of that stuff 32 gig of
ram<00:02:49.379> it<00:02:49.709> picked<00:02:49.890> up<00:02:49.980> everything<00:02:50.489> absolutely

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
ram it picked up everything absolutely

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.030 
ram it picked up everything absolutely
perfectly<00:02:51.540> no<00:02:51.810> problems<00:02:52.170> whatsoever<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.829> as

perfectly no problems whatsoever and as
you<00:02:53.190> can<00:02:53.280> see<00:02:53.450> he's<00:02:54.450> at<00:02:54.660> working<00:02:55.290> literally

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
you can see he's at working literally

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.110 
you can see he's at working literally
perfectly<00:02:57.049> so<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.409> was<00:02:58.530> cool<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.730> that's<00:03:00.000> it

that's literally all you do is very very
simple<00:03:01.859> now<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.579> second<00:03:03.060> thing<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.359> I'm

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
simple now the second thing that I'm

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.569 
simple now the second thing that I'm
going<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:03.690> talk<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.079> through<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.560> setting<00:03:05.459> up

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
going to talk you through is setting up

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.000 
going to talk you through is setting up
a<00:03:05.760> cluster<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.170> should<00:03:07.379> really<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.799> some

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
a cluster and I should really do some

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.559 
a cluster and I should really do some
more<00:03:08.159> detailed<00:03:08.549> videos<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.239> if<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.450> want

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
more detailed videos on this if you want

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.979 
more detailed videos on this if you want
me<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.109> kind<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.769> really<00:03:11.040> put<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.400> step-by-step

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
me to kind of really put it step-by-step

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.630 
me to kind of really put it step-by-step
then<00:03:12.989> let<00:03:13.799> me<00:03:13.890> know<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.129> comments<00:03:14.519> and

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
then let me know in the comments and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.599 
then let me know in the comments and
maybe<00:03:14.760> I'll<00:03:14.940> do<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.329> but<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:17.069> clustered

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
maybe I'll do that but this clustered

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:18.949 
maybe I'll do that but this clustered
rendering<00:03:18.060> people<00:03:18.389> have<00:03:18.480> been<00:03:18.599> asking<00:03:18.900> me

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
rendering people have been asking me

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.599 
rendering people have been asking me
endless<00:03:19.380> amounts<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.769> questions<00:03:20.160> about<00:03:20.310> it

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
endless amounts of questions about it

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.309 
endless amounts of questions about it
basically<00:03:21.299> what<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.569> does<00:03:21.599> is<00:03:21.870> he<00:03:21.989> creates

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
basically what it does is he creates

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.770 
basically what it does is he creates
like<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> grid<00:03:22.829> system<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.880> they'll<00:03:24.569> be<00:03:24.660> pretty

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
like a grid system so they'll be pretty

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.390 
like a grid system so they'll be pretty
simpler<00:03:25.169> than<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.319> basically<00:03:25.980> what<00:03:26.099> it<00:03:26.220> does

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
simpler than that basically what it does

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.539 
simpler than that basically what it does
is<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.209> sort<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.720> sets<00:03:27.989> up<00:03:28.139> a<00:03:28.230> listener<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
is it sort of sets up a listener on the

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.690 
is it sort of sets up a listener on the
on<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:30.150> number<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:30.989> hosts<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> number<00:03:32.519> of

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
on the number of hosts so a number of

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.089 
on the number of hosts so a number of
targets<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.359> you<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.650> then<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:34.950> have

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
targets if you like and then you have

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.920 
targets if you like and then you have
like<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.340> controller<00:03:36.180> which<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.629> your<00:03:36.780> main

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
like a controller which is your main

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.809 
like a controller which is your main
machine<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:38.099> when<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.370> bend<00:03:38.639> or

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
machine and then when you bend or

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.339 
machine and then when you bend or
something<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.299> basically<00:03:39.660> send<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
something you basically send it to the

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.650 
something you basically send it to the
cluster<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.340> sends<00:03:41.639> different<00:03:42.120> paths<00:03:42.359> out

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
cluster and it sends different paths out

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.509 
cluster and it sends different paths out
to<00:03:42.870> all<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.109> different<00:03:43.440> machines<00:03:43.739> they<00:03:44.340> all

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
to all the different machines they all

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.979 
to all the different machines they all
render<00:03:44.910> their<00:03:45.060> beer<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.449> then<00:03:45.540> they<00:03:45.660> send<00:03:45.900> it

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
render their beer and then they send it

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.449 
render their beer and then they send it
back<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.199> the<00:03:46.410> middle<00:03:46.680> put<00:03:47.129> it<00:03:47.220> back<00:03:47.310> together

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
back to the middle put it back together

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.580 
back to the middle put it back together
again<00:03:47.669> and<00:03:47.940> you've<00:03:48.090> got<00:03:48.239> your<00:03:48.329> file<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.410> I've

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
again and you've got your file so I've

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.080 
again and you've got your file so I've
been<00:03:49.949> doing<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.250> for<00:03:50.280> quite<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.549> while<00:03:50.730> with<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
been doing it for quite a while with the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.020 
been doing it for quite a while with the
MacBook<00:03:51.449> Pro<00:03:51.829> but<00:03:52.829> now<00:03:53.069> I've<00:03:53.370> been<00:03:53.760> doing<00:03:53.819> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
MacBook Pro but now I've been doing it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.140 
MacBook Pro but now I've been doing it
with<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.209> MacBook<00:03:54.569> Pro<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:56.310> hackintosh

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
with the MacBook Pro and the hackintosh

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.990 
with the MacBook Pro and the hackintosh
and<00:03:57.540> my<00:03:57.870> Mac<00:03:58.109> Pro<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:58.709> essentially<00:03:59.190> I've<00:03:59.280> got<00:03:59.489> 4

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
and my Mac Pro so essentially I've got 4

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.680 
and my Mac Pro so essentially I've got 4
cores<00:04:00.299> 4<00:04:00.449> cores<00:04:00.930> 4<00:04:01.049> cause<00:04:01.889> there's<00:04:02.609> 12<00:04:03.000> cores

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
cores 4 cores 4 cause there's 12 cores

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.159 
cores 4 cores 4 cause there's 12 cores
yeah<00:04:04.470> 12<00:04:04.829> cores<00:04:05.340> all<00:04:06.120> acting<00:04:06.599> as<00:04:06.720> essentially

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
yeah 12 cores all acting as essentially

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.159 
yeah 12 cores all acting as essentially
like<00:04:07.319> one<00:04:07.530> machine<00:04:07.919> so<00:04:08.579> rendering<00:04:09.239> a<00:04:09.299> file<00:04:09.629> is

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
like one machine so rendering a file is

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.470 
like one machine so rendering a file is
just<00:04:10.530> going<00:04:11.060> lightning-fast<00:04:12.060> like

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
just going lightning-fast like

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.900 
just going lightning-fast like
absolutely<00:04:13.019> lightning-fast<00:04:13.980> one<00:04:14.609> thing<00:04:14.790> to

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
absolutely lightning-fast one thing to

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.860 
absolutely lightning-fast one thing to
bear<00:04:15.060> in<00:04:15.120> mind<00:04:15.180> when<00:04:15.449> you're<00:04:15.569> doing<00:04:15.750> this

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
bear in mind when you're doing this

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.560 
bear in mind when you're doing this
you've<00:04:16.079> got<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.349> do<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.829> on<00:04:17.329> ascent<00:04:18.329> well

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
you've got to do it on ascent well

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.020 
you've got to do it on ascent well

doing 1080p or 720p you could

doing 1080p or 720p you could

potentially get away with it but with

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.580 
potentially get away with it but with
the<00:04:30.550> 4k<00:04:30.790> files<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.660> they<00:04:31.900> start<00:04:32.199> with<00:04:32.260> brawler

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
the 4k files and they start with brawler

ATG<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.370> has<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.639> copy<00:04:33.820> bits<00:04:34.389> of<00:04:34.630> that<00:04:34.720> around

ATG it has to copy bits of that around

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.010 
ATG it has to copy bits of that around
so<00:04:35.380> there'd<00:04:35.800> be<00:04:35.860> no<00:04:36.070> point<00:04:36.280> doing<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.729> over

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
so there'd be no point doing that over

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.310 
so there'd be no point doing that over
Wi-Fi<00:04:38.020> so<00:04:38.860> let<00:04:39.250> me<00:04:39.370> quickly<00:04:40.030> give<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.139> a<00:04:41.169> bit

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
Wi-Fi so let me quickly give you a bit

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.780 
Wi-Fi so let me quickly give you a bit
of<00:04:41.410> information<00:04:41.680> about<00:04:42.010> how<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:42.340> actually

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
of information about how that actually

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.580 
of information about how that actually
pans<00:04:43.000> out<00:04:43.300> so<00:04:44.550> what<00:04:45.550> happens<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.350> once<00:04:47.350> you've

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
pans out so what happens is once you've

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.379 
pans out so what happens is once you've
like<00:04:48.250> let<00:04:48.400> me<00:04:48.490> talk<00:04:48.639> you<00:04:48.669> through<00:04:48.850> the

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
like let me talk you through the

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.240 
like let me talk you through the
original<00:04:49.870> file<00:04:50.460> for<00:04:51.460> my<00:04:51.550> 4k<00:04:52.080> was<00:04:53.080> about<00:04:53.560> 80<00:04:53.830> gig

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
original file for my 4k was about 80 gig

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.939 
original file for my 4k was about 80 gig
so<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.550> did<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:54.760> little<00:04:54.940> text<00:04:55.360> 80<00:04:55.570> gigs<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.229> I

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
so I did a little text 80 gigs and I

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.760 
so I did a little text 80 gigs and I
then<00:04:57.280> put<00:04:57.490> that<00:04:57.639> through<00:04:57.850> compressor<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:59.560> it

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
then put that through compressor and it

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.040 
then put that through compressor and it
came<00:04:59.979> out<00:05:00.250> at<00:05:01.169> 2.5<00:05:02.169> gigs<00:05:02.620> in<00:05:03.580> HTC<00:05:04.419> no<00:05:04.600> sorry<00:05:04.870> I

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
came out at 2.5 gigs in HTC no sorry I

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.110 
came out at 2.5 gigs in HTC no sorry I
put<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.380> from<00:05:05.500> Final<00:05:05.889> Cut<00:05:05.919> Pro<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:06.639> it<00:05:06.910> came

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
put it from Final Cut Pro and it came

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.820 
put it from Final Cut Pro and it came
out<00:05:07.330> at<00:05:07.900> 2.5<00:05:08.680> gigs<00:05:09.100> on<00:05:09.419> h.264<00:05:10.419> I<00:05:10.960> sent<00:05:11.650> it<00:05:11.740> off

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
out at 2.5 gigs on h.264 I sent it off

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.340 
out at 2.5 gigs on h.264 I sent it off
to<00:05:11.860> compressor<00:05:12.669> on<00:05:12.850> the<00:05:12.910> highest<00:05:13.510> possible

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
to compressor on the highest possible

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.280 
to compressor on the highest possible
quality<00:05:15.190> that<00:05:15.760> you<00:05:15.850> can<00:05:16.030> choose<00:05:16.270> for<00:05:17.139> both

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
quality that you can choose for both

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.100 
quality that you can choose for both
audio<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.800> video<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.880> it<00:05:19.360> came<00:05:19.539> back<00:05:19.720> at<00:05:19.900> less

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
audio and video and it came back at less

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.440 
audio and video and it came back at less

better than the output of that from

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
Final Cut Pro Plus it was quicker

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.210 
Final Cut Pro Plus it was quicker
because<00:05:27.880> I<00:05:28.090> used<00:05:28.539> the<00:05:28.840> clustered<00:05:29.740> rendering

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.700 
because I used the clustered rendering
so<00:05:30.880> that<00:05:31.300> all<00:05:31.479> worked<00:05:31.690> out<00:05:31.930> pretty<00:05:32.229> well<00:05:32.350> and

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
so that all worked out pretty well and

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.409 
so that all worked out pretty well and
it's<00:05:33.070> so<00:05:33.250> cool<00:05:33.490> because<00:05:33.669> basically<00:05:33.970> what

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
it's so cool because basically what

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.650 
it's so cool because basically what
happens<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:35.280> you<00:05:36.280> kick<00:05:36.490> off<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.760> job<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:37.240> then

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
happens is you kick off the job and then

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.920 
happens is you kick off the job and then
you<00:05:37.780> you<00:05:38.110> look<00:05:38.289> at<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.880> share<00:05:39.880> monitor<00:05:40.330> on

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
you you look at the share monitor on

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.570 
you you look at the share monitor on
each<00:05:41.169> machine<00:05:41.440> and<00:05:41.860> you<00:05:42.220> look<00:05:42.370> at<00:05:42.460> like

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
each machine and you look at like

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.400 
each machine and you look at like
activity<00:05:42.910> monitors<00:05:43.570> to<00:05:43.660> see<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:43.930> processes

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
activity monitors to see the processes

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.320 
activity monitors to see the processes
and<00:05:44.800> all<00:05:45.099> of<00:05:45.160> a<00:05:45.190> sudden<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:45.490> say<00:05:45.669> bang<00:05:45.970> loads

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
and all of a sudden you say bang loads

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.690 
and all of a sudden you say bang loads
of<00:05:46.479> processes<00:05:46.990> go<00:05:47.139> up<00:05:47.289> to<00:05:47.440> like<00:05:47.590> a<00:05:47.979> hundred

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
of processes go up to like a hundred

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.670 
of processes go up to like a hundred
percent<00:05:48.789> age<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.450> it<00:05:49.780> just<00:05:49.960> starts<00:05:50.229> rendering

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
percent age and it just starts rendering

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.680 
percent age and it just starts rendering
so<00:05:51.190> it's<00:05:51.340> pretty<00:05:51.550> cool<00:05:51.789> like<00:05:52.300> I<00:05:52.389> say<00:05:52.539> if<00:05:52.599> you

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
so it's pretty cool like I say if you

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.300 
so it's pretty cool like I say if you
want<00:05:52.720> me<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:52.960> go<00:05:53.139> into<00:05:53.289> more<00:05:53.500> detail<00:05:53.889> about<00:05:53.919> it

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
want me to go into more detail about it

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.860 
want me to go into more detail about it
then<00:05:54.430> maybe<00:05:54.789> I<00:05:54.910> could<00:05:55.030> do<00:05:55.270> like<00:05:55.539> a<00:05:55.570> sort<00:05:55.810> of

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
then maybe I could do like a sort of

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.140 
then maybe I could do like a sort of
screen<00:05:56.610> recording<00:05:57.610> thing<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:57.970> show<00:05:58.090> you

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
screen recording thing and show you

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.610 
screen recording thing and show you
exactly<00:05:58.450> what's<00:05:58.810> happening<00:05:59.110> and<00:05:59.229> how<00:05:59.349> to<00:05:59.410> do

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
exactly what's happening and how to do

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.620 
exactly what's happening and how to do
it<00:05:59.770> but<00:06:00.070> this<00:06:00.849> was<00:06:01.030> just<00:06:01.060> a<00:06:01.210> quick<00:06:01.360> walkthrough

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
it but this was just a quick walkthrough

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.260 
it but this was just a quick walkthrough
and<00:06:02.110> to<00:06:02.889> let<00:06:03.039> you<00:06:03.099> know<00:06:03.190> that<00:06:03.340> I<00:06:03.370> am<00:06:03.610> also<00:06:03.849> going
