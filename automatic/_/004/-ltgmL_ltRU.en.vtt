00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.039
 these eight years, I realized that cooking 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.050
 coffee 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.269
 in our country its culture 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.930
 cooking very bad times especially 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.300

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.780
 we love to cook in Russia express 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.059

 facilitate their work and achieve the perfect 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.090
 cooking a cup for a cup we mine was 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.550
 fragments and dynamometers created 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.460
 which allows you to control 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.620
 effort when training the thing is that this 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.300
 the procedure greatly affects the taste 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.250
 coffee blog 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.100

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 sticking 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.180
 doubt in this regard the correct tempera 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.869
 allows you to adjust the necessary efforts for 1 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.500
 grade 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:12.250

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.500

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.250
 either spin a solid washer 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.530
 pinch here by the way the risks that 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.270
 denote reinforcing kilogram from 8 to 20 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.690
 exhibited need us effort that's how he 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.750
 It works, that is, it clicks and 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.569
 drop to the ground leveled tamper
