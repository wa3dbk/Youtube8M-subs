Chubb they've made a lot of maps and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.370 
Chubb they've made a lot of maps and
they<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> lot<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.359> experience<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.050> they

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
tried their hand at this map and this is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.790 
tried their hand at this map and this is
gonna<00:00:21.510> be<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> linear<00:00:22.020> style<00:00:22.199> infection<00:00:22.680> map

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
gonna be a linear style infection map

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
gonna be a linear style infection map
that<00:00:23.189> plays<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:23.730> well<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.210> very<00:00:24.300> well

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
that plays very well it's very well

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.230 
that plays very well it's very well
structured<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.529> love<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> theme<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.029> has<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
structured I love the theme and it has a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.790 
structured I love the theme and it has a
lot<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.539> cool<00:00:27.750> aspects<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.349> right<00:00:28.500> now<00:00:28.650> we're

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
lot of cool aspects so right now we're

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.099 
lot of cool aspects so right now we're
going<00:00:28.949> along<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> main<00:00:29.580> channels<00:00:30.080> you<00:00:31.080> can

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
going along the main channels you can

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.930 
going along the main channels you can
see<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.410> has<00:00:31.529> lots<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.980> cool<00:00:32.189> cul-de-sacs<00:00:32.790> we

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
see it has lots of cool cul-de-sacs we

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180 
see it has lots of cool cul-de-sacs we
all<00:00:33.030> find<00:00:33.239> weapons<00:00:33.630> has<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> turret<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:35.010> which

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
all find weapons has a turret here which

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.860 
all find weapons has a turret here which
is<00:00:35.340> counterbalanced<00:00:35.670> by<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> fact<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.600> Ami's

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
is counterbalanced by the fact is Ami's

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.030 
is counterbalanced by the fact is Ami's
going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> drop<00:00:37.260> down<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.680> which<00:00:37.800> we'll<00:00:37.950> be

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
going to drop down on it which we'll be

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.459 
going to drop down on it which we'll be
seeing<00:00:38.280> later<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.570> map<00:00:39.750> progresses<00:00:40.290> from

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
seeing later and the map progresses from

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.080 
seeing later and the map progresses from
high<00:00:40.620> ground<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.950> low<00:00:41.070> ground<00:00:41.399> always<00:00:41.700> giving

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
high ground to low ground always giving

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.490 
high ground to low ground always giving
advantage<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> zombies<00:00:43.079> who<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.290> chasing

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
advantage to the zombies who are chasing

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.350 
advantage to the zombies who are chasing
after<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.120> right<00:00:45.300> here

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
after you which you can see right here

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.260 
after you which you can see right here
so<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.809> map<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.530> good<00:00:46.800> i<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> lot

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
so this map is very good i like it a lot

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
so this map is very good i like it a lot
and<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.899> key<00:00:49.200> areas<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.770> gonna<00:00:49.950> be

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and one of the key areas is gonna be

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
and one of the key areas is gonna be
over<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.460> where<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.820> hold<00:00:51.059> out<00:00:51.300> has<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
over here where you can hold out has a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.049 
over here where you can hold out has a
nice<00:00:52.469> collapse<00:00:52.890> rock<00:00:53.160> formation<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:53.789> great

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
nice collapse rock formation here great

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.760 
nice collapse rock formation here great
aesthetics<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.140> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> giant

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
aesthetics and it's kind of like a giant

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.410 
aesthetics and it's kind of like a giant
pit<00:00:56.160> where<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> humans<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.940> hold<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.239> in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
pit where the humans have to hold out in

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.000 
pit where the humans have to hold out in
out<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.170> help<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.379> rockets<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.949> all

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
out with the help of rockets and all

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.619 
out with the help of rockets and all
that<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> zombies<00:00:59.850> jump<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.480> all

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that as the zombies jump in from all

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.599 
that as the zombies jump in from all
directions<00:01:00.750> pushing<00:01:01.710> them<00:01:01.859> back<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
directions pushing them back and the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.009 
directions pushing them back and the
humans<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.149> hold<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.480> until<00:01:03.570> they<00:01:03.870> can

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
humans have to hold out until they can

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.260 
humans have to hold out until they can
move<00:01:04.199> through<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.650> shield<00:01:04.979> or<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.119> they

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
move through that shield or and so they

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
move through that shield or and so they
have<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> cool<00:01:06.720> technique<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.320> spawning<00:01:08.070> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
have a cool technique of spawning in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.350 
have a cool technique of spawning in
another<00:01:08.460> shield<00:01:08.700> or<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.970> allows<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
another shield or that allows you to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
another shield or that allows you to
move<00:01:09.479> forward<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.320> we're<00:01:10.680> gonna<00:01:10.799> go<00:01:10.979> ahead

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
move forward but we're gonna go ahead

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.260 
move forward but we're gonna go ahead
and<00:01:11.189> go<00:01:11.369> back<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:11.820> start<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and go back to the very start of the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.570 
and go back to the very start of the
round<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.500> zombies<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.310> jumping

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
round so you can see zombies are jumping

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.100 
round so you can see zombies are jumping
out<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.909> initial<00:01:15.210> spawns<00:01:15.630> are<00:01:15.780> right<00:01:15.960> above

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
out the initial spawns are right above

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.780 
out the initial spawns are right above
the<00:01:16.229> human<00:01:16.350> spawns<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.310> very<00:01:17.549> clever

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the human spawns and that is very clever

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.820 
the human spawns and that is very clever
it<00:01:18.060> helps<00:01:18.479> prevent<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> humans<00:01:19.290> from<00:01:19.439> camping

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
it helps prevent the humans from camping

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.230 
it helps prevent the humans from camping
at<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.950> beginning<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> zombies

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
at the beginning because the zombies

behind are getting picked off

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.640 
behind are getting picked off
if<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.750> grab<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> sniper<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.500> should

if you grab the sniper what you should

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.899

make<00:02:39.900> your<00:02:39.930> way<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.350> safe<00:02:40.680> house<00:02:40.890> which<00:02:41.130> will

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
make your way to a safe house which will

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.740 
make your way to a safe house which will
be<00:02:41.370> shown<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.700> towards<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.360> end<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.600> map

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
be shown you towards the end of the map

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.470 
be shown you towards the end of the map
and<00:02:43.590> they<00:02:43.709> do<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.860> great<00:02:44.040> job<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.340> forcing<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
and they do a great job of forcing the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.360 
and they do a great job of forcing the
humans<00:02:45.840> back<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.410> said<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:46.860> all<00:02:47.040> downhill

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
humans back as I said it's all downhill

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.710 
humans back as I said it's all downhill
so<00:02:47.910> from<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.209> start

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
so from the start

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.840 
so from the start
zombies<00:02:49.290> get<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.470> height<00:02:49.709> advantage<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.459> from

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
zombies get a height advantage and from

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.070 
zombies get a height advantage and from
there<00:02:50.970> they<00:02:51.090> push<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.450> humans<00:02:51.720> further<00:02:51.930> and

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
there they push the humans further and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.990 
there they push the humans further and
further<00:02:52.200> back<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.950> teleporter<00:02:53.549> system<00:02:53.880> will

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
further back a teleporter system will

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.970 
further back a teleporter system will
also<00:02:54.360> allow<00:02:54.600> them<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:55.019> spawn<00:02:55.320> further<00:02:55.739> along

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
also allow them to spawn further along

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.560 
also allow them to spawn further along
the<00:02:56.160> map<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.790> order<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.150> keep<00:02:57.299> putting

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
the map in order to keep putting

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.880 
the map in order to keep putting
pressure<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.140> humans<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.739> move

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
pressure on the humans as you move

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.710 
pressure on the humans as you move
forward<00:02:59.130> along<00:03:00.000> with<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.209> game<00:03:00.330> type<00:03:00.540> there

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
forward along with the game type there

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.300 
forward along with the game type there
is<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.840> custom<00:03:01.200> powerup<00:03:01.590> at<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.980> zombie

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
is a custom powerup at the zombie

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.060 
is a custom powerup at the zombie
initial<00:03:02.640> spawn<00:03:02.910> which<00:03:03.450> allows<00:03:03.720> them<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.170> get<00:03:05.010> a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
initial spawn which allows them to get a

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.610 
initial spawn which allows them to get a
essentially<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.880> tank<00:03:06.209> who<00:03:06.420> has<00:03:06.690> more<00:03:07.380> health

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
essentially a tank who has more health

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.410 
essentially a tank who has more health
and<00:03:07.799> does<00:03:08.250> more<00:03:08.459> damage<00:03:08.489> because<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.299> this

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
and does more damage because in this

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.479 
and does more damage because in this
version<00:03:09.660> humans<00:03:10.380> 2<00:03:10.530> will<00:03:10.680> take<00:03:10.709> multiple<00:03:11.100> hits

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
version humans 2 will take multiple hits

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.130 
version humans 2 will take multiple hits
to<00:03:11.610> die<00:03:11.760> right<00:03:12.330> there<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.570> can<00:03:12.720> see<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.930> tank

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
to die right there you can see the tank

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.630 
to die right there you can see the tank
