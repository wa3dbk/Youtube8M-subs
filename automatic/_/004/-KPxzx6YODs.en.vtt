also the calipers then removed for
redoing<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.959> brakes<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.339> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.209 
redoing the brakes you can see the
emergency<00:00:56.999> brake<00:00:57.179> line<00:00:57.389> is<00:00:57.569> here<00:00:57.799> so<00:00:58.799> look<00:00:59.100> at

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
emergency brake line is here so look at

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.059 
emergency brake line is here so look at
my<00:00:59.339> other<00:00:59.489> videos<00:00:59.819> for<00:01:00.030> those<00:01:00.120> steps<00:01:00.649> but<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
my other videos for those steps but the

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:03.410 
my other videos for those steps but the
first<00:01:02.249> thing<00:01:02.429> we<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.729> to<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.299> this

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
first thing we have to do and do this

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.509 
first thing we have to do and do this
exact<00:01:04.019> same<00:01:04.080> procedure<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> passenger

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
exact same procedure on the passenger

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.060 
exact same procedure on the passenger
side<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:07.190> pull<00:01:08.190> out<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.880> axle<00:01:09.480> so<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
side is pull out the axle so on the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.740 
side is pull out the axle so on the
automatics<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.910> you<00:01:12.120> can<00:01:12.270> actually<00:01:12.420> just

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
automatics here you can actually just

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.380 
automatics here you can actually just
pull<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.650> rubber<00:01:13.830> boot<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.030> pull<00:01:15.240> it

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
pull the rubber boot you just pull it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.710 
pull the rubber boot you just pull it
towards<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.350> way<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.830> used<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.690> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
towards you this way I used a you know a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.620 
towards you this way I used a you know a
large<00:01:19.400> wrench<00:01:20.400> here<00:01:20.730> and<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.180> grab<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
large wrench here and just grab it and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.080 
large wrench here and just grab it and
pull<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.020> it'll<00:01:22.170> pop<00:01:22.350> off<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.010> then<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> axle

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
pull and it'll pop off and then the axle

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.630 
pull and it'll pop off and then the axle
actually<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.570> comes<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.490> as<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> bunch

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
actually just comes out and as a bunch

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.890 
actually just comes out and as a bunch
of<00:01:26.760> grease<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.180> there's<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.540> careful

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
of grease and there's to be careful

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.720 
of grease and there's to be careful
doesn't<00:01:28.200> drip

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.490 

so<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:38.180> this<00:01:38.450> side<00:01:38.660> is<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.870> passenger<00:01:39.320> side

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
so this this side is the passenger side

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.930 
so this this side is the passenger side
you<00:01:39.590> can<00:01:39.710> see<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.980> axle<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.400> much<00:01:40.520> longer<00:01:40.760> than

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
you can see the axle is much longer than

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.850 
you can see the axle is much longer than
the<00:01:41.060> other<00:01:41.210> side<00:01:41.450> but<00:01:42.170> again<00:01:42.290> they<00:01:42.530> both<00:01:42.650> just

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
the other side but again they both just

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.760 
the other side but again they both just
pop<00:01:43.100> out<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.580> then<00:01:44.000> once<00:01:44.180> we've<00:01:44.330> done<00:01:44.510> that<00:01:44.770> we

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
pop out and then once we've done that we

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.690 
pop out and then once we've done that we
can<00:01:46.100> remove<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:47.620> rear<00:01:48.620> joint<00:01:48.980> here<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:49.430> are<00:01:49.460> by

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
can remove the rear joint here we are by

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.940 
can remove the rear joint here we are by
the<00:01:49.760> rear<00:01:49.910> tire<00:01:50.180> rod<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.320> just<00:01:51.500> take<00:01:51.650> out<00:01:51.770> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
the rear tire rod so just take out the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.970 
the rear tire rod so just take out the
pin<00:01:52.720> take<00:01:53.720> out<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.140> nut<00:01:54.440> here<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:54.770> then

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
pin take out the nut here and then

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.280 
pin take out the nut here and then
you're<00:01:55.070> going<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.250> have<00:01:55.400> to<00:01:55.520> use<00:01:55.960> two<00:01:56.960> or<00:01:57.110> three

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
you're going to have to use two or three

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.360 
you're going to have to use two or three
draw<00:01:57.530> puller<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:58.550> pop<00:01:58.790> this<00:01:59.060> thing<00:01:59.120> out<00:01:59.510> and<00:02:00.370> be

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
draw puller to pop this thing out and be

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.000 
draw puller to pop this thing out and be
careful<00:02:01.730> it's<00:02:01.850> fairly<00:02:02.000> loud<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:03.740> last

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
that hold the ball joint and then once

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.130 
that hold the ball joint and then once
those<00:02:08.270> are<00:02:08.300> all<00:02:08.510> out<00:02:08.660> this<00:02:08.810> thing<00:02:08.990> will<00:02:09.110> just

and removing this this axle now I've

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.810 
and removing this this axle now I've
been<00:02:15.170> told<00:02:15.410> or<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.800> read<00:02:16.040> somewhere<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.520> you

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
been told or I read somewhere that you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.180 
been told or I read somewhere that you
don't<00:02:16.850> want<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.240> spin<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:18.560> bearings<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.130> the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
don't want to spin the bearings in the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.770 
don't want to spin the bearings in the
rear<00:02:19.340> here<00:02:19.580> without<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.970> axles<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.510> or<00:02:20.630> else

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
rear here without the axles in or else

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.890 
rear here without the axles in or else
it<00:02:20.900> will<00:02:20.960> ruin<00:02:21.200> them<00:02:21.490> so<00:02:22.490> make<00:02:22.790> sure<00:02:22.820> that<00:02:23.360> you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
it will ruin them so make sure that you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.540 
it will ruin them so make sure that you
don't<00:02:24.080> do<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.470> after<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.070> if<00:02:25.280> you're<00:02:25.430> going

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
don't do that after you if you're going

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.840 
don't do that after you if you're going
to<00:02:25.640> remove<00:02:25.880> these<00:02:26.120> axles<00:02:27.100> but<00:02:28.100> for<00:02:28.580> now<00:02:28.670> we're

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
to remove these axles but for now we're

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.070 
to remove these axles but for now we're
just<00:02:28.880> going<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.120> leave<00:02:29.300> them<00:02:29.390> in<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:29.810> it'll<00:02:29.930> be

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
just going to leave them in so it'll be

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.550 
just going to leave them in so it'll be
okay

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
okay

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.390 
okay
and<00:02:30.970> those<00:02:31.970> are<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.120> steps
