frame<00:00:09.809> as<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.170> can<00:00:10.320> see<00:00:10.550> you<00:00:11.550> can<00:00:11.700> tilt<00:00:11.910> it

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
frame as you can see you can tilt it

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.340 
frame as you can see you can tilt it
over<00:00:12.210> different<00:00:12.929> angles<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.519> then<00:00:14.519> obviously

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
over different angles and then obviously

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.010 
over different angles and then obviously
this<00:00:16.350> bit<00:00:16.590> turns<00:00:17.010> as<00:00:17.220> well<00:00:17.720> basically<00:00:18.720> giving

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
this bit turns as well basically giving

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.290 
this bit turns as well basically giving
you<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> full<00:00:19.410> engine<00:00:19.830> rebuilding<00:00:20.640> capability

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
you a full engine rebuilding capability

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.050 
you a full engine rebuilding capability
whereby<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.439> turn<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> engine<00:00:24.380> this<00:00:25.380> way

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
whereby you can turn the engine this way

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.429 
whereby you can turn the engine this way
as<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.630> will<00:00:27.840> actually<00:00:27.990> turn

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
as you can see this will actually turn

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.980 
as you can see this will actually turn
either<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.400> know<00:00:29.550> whichever<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.750> want

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
either you know whichever way you want

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.659 
either you know whichever way you want
my<00:00:31.170> motor<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:31.740> bolted<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.340> properly

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
my motor not bolted in properly

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.650 
my motor not bolted in properly
obviously<00:00:34.309> but<00:00:35.540> what<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> piece<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> kit

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
obviously but what a piece of kit

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.560 
obviously but what a piece of kit
bearing<00:00:39.660> under<00:00:39.930> there<00:00:40.250> basically<00:00:41.250> allows<00:00:41.570> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
bearing under there basically allows the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
bearing under there basically allows the
whole<00:00:42.750> motor<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.410> swivel<00:00:45.020> okay<00:00:46.399> you<00:00:47.399> know

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
whole motor to swivel okay you know

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.709 
whole motor to swivel okay you know
obviously<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.940> moment<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.270> locked<00:00:48.510> off

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
obviously at the moment is locked off

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
obviously at the moment is locked off
but<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.559> will<00:00:49.800> actually<00:00:49.980> allow<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> whole

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
but it will actually allow the whole

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.020 
but it will actually allow the whole
motor<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.000> swivel<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.320> stand<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> can

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
motor to swivel on the stand as you can

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.889 
motor to swivel on the stand as you can
see<00:00:54.210> now<00:00:54.449> turn<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> whole<00:00:55.379> motor<00:00:55.620> completely

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
see now turn the whole motor completely

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.380 
see now turn the whole motor completely
on<00:00:57.899> its<00:00:57.930> side<00:00:58.489> okay<00:01:01.010> very<00:01:02.010> strong<00:01:02.390> stand

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
on its side okay very strong stand

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060 
on its side okay very strong stand
obviously<00:01:04.170> that's<00:01:04.320> why<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:04.619> cost<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:04.890> much

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
obviously that's why they cost so much

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.200 
obviously that's why they cost so much
but<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.380> all<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.729> engine<00:01:09.090> now

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
but as you can see all the engine now

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.679 
but as you can see all the engine now
completely<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.810> each<00:01:09.930> side<00:01:13.460> okay<00:01:14.689> simply

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
completely on each side okay simply

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.460 
completely on each side okay simply
achieve<00:01:15.990> by<00:01:16.229> pulling<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.189> pin<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.900> as

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
achieve by pulling this pin out and as

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.840 
achieve by pulling this pin out and as
you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:21.060> boat<00:01:21.240> will<00:01:21.540> lift<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:23.310> extent

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you can see the boat will lift on extent

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.510 
you can see the boat will lift on extent
you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:25.049> here<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> things<00:01:25.680> now<00:01:25.920> 45

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you can see here the things now 45

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:38.620 
you can see here the things now 45
degrees<00:01:27.860> again<00:01:29.720> perfect<00:01:30.720> working<00:01:31.110> conditions

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.389 

absolute<00:01:39.630> must<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.890> you're<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
absolute must if you're going to

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.700 
absolute must if you're going to
seriously<00:01:41.729> work<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.210> Holly<00:01:42.420> engines<00:01:42.869> supposed

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
seriously work on Holly engines supposed

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.359 
seriously work on Holly engines supposed
to<00:01:43.860> try<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.030> funny<00:01:45.299> angles<00:01:46.189> as<00:01:47.189> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to try to get in it funny angles as you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.230 
to try to get in it funny angles as you
can<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.939> allows<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.630> whole<00:01:48.930> engine<00:01:50.240> to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
can see this allows the whole engine to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.969 
can see this allows the whole engine to
be<00:01:51.390> slew<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.079> whatever<00:01:52.380> angle<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.950> want

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
be slew to whatever angle you want

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:01.389 
be slew to whatever angle you want
without<00:01:53.460> falling<00:01:54.090> over<00:01:55.909> as<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:58.970> now

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
without falling over as you can see now

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.690 
without falling over as you can see now
