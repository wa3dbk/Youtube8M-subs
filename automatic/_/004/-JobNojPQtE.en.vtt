00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
do a quick size comparison against the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.769 
do a quick size comparison against the
58<00:00:18.359> 70<00:00:18.900> which<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.289> here<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.430> 58<00:00:20.910> 50<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.750> you

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
58 70 which is here and the 58 50 so you

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.450 
58 70 which is here and the 58 50 so you
can<00:00:22.020> get<00:00:22.170> an<00:00:22.260> idea<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.800> how<00:00:22.949> these<00:00:23.100> cards

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
can get an idea of how these cards

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.519 
can get an idea of how these cards
compare<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.880> each<00:00:23.970> other<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.260> see

this seems to come with all of their

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.289 
this seems to come with all of their
gaming<00:01:35.040> cards<00:01:35.430> easy<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.909> got<00:01:36.060> your<00:01:36.090> little

door hanger not that your mom's actually

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.649 
door hanger not that your mom's actually
going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> pay<00:01:38.729> attention<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.420> she's

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
going to pay attention to that she's

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.080 
going to pay attention to that she's
gonna<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.020> no<00:01:40.200> no<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.650> time<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:40.950> dinner

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
gonna be like no no it's time for dinner

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.420 
gonna be like no no it's time for dinner
we<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:42.780> molex<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.619> PCI<00:01:44.070> Express

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
we have one molex to PCI Express

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.429 
we have one molex to PCI Express
connector<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.659> tells<00:01:45.869> us<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.259> there's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
connector so that tells us that there's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.950 
connector so that tells us that there's
probably<00:01:46.799> only<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.490> power<00:01:48.299> plug<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.810> this

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
probably only one power plug on this

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.230 
probably only one power plug on this
cart<00:01:49.200> we've<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> crossfire<00:01:50.220> bridge<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
cart we've got a crossfire bridge and a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.630 
cart we've got a crossfire bridge and a
DVI<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> VGA<00:01:52.229> adapter<00:01:52.320> should<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.220> still

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
DVI to VGA adapter should you still

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.570 
DVI to VGA adapter should you still
require<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.420> at<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.930> point<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
require that at this point and

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.750 
require that at this point and
we<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:57.450> card<00:01:57.780> itself<00:01:58.410> so<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.370> see

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
we have the card itself so you can see

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.550 
we have the card itself so you can see
that<00:01:59.940> even<00:02:00.330> on<00:02:00.480> the<00:02:00.690> beat-up<00:02:00.990> corner<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.470> our

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
that even on the beat-up corner of our

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.530 
that even on the beat-up corner of our
box<00:02:01.890> which<00:02:02.160> is<00:02:02.310> right<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.030> hasn't<00:02:03.210> even

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
box which is right here it hasn't even

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.200 
box which is right here it hasn't even
gotten<00:02:03.900> close<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.860> card<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.580> there's<00:02:05.850> no

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
gotten close to the card so there's no

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.230 
gotten close to the card so there's no
risk<00:02:06.510> of<00:02:06.720> any<00:02:06.960> damage<00:02:07.500> based<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:09.090> we've

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
risk of any damage based on what we've

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.990 
risk of any damage based on what we've
seen<00:02:09.270> from<00:02:09.630> XFX<00:02:09.960> is<00:02:10.290> packaging<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:11.670> let's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
seen from XFX is packaging here so let's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.800 
seen from XFX is packaging here so let's
get<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.480> anti-static<00:02:13.350> bag<00:02:13.890> out<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.550> there<00:02:15.540> is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
get the anti-static bag out and there is

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.570 
get the anti-static bag out and there is
the<00:02:16.080> card<00:02:16.320> itself<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:16.950> why<00:02:17.070> don't<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:17.310> start

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
the card itself so why don't we start

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.520 
the card itself so why don't we start
let's<00:02:18.210> start<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.600> connectors<00:02:19.020> actually

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
let's start with the connectors actually

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.260 
let's start with the connectors actually
so<00:02:19.950> first<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.370> all<00:02:20.460> you've<00:02:20.610> got<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.970> do<00:02:21.150> I

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
so first of all you've got to do I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.060 
so first of all you've got to do I
connect<00:02:21.690> errs<00:02:21.810> one<00:02:22.140> HDMI<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.920> one

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
connect errs one HDMI and one

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.860 
connect errs one HDMI and one
DisplayPort<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.570> same

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
DisplayPort so this is the same

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.560 
DisplayPort so this is the same
connector<00:02:25.350> set<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.920> 5800<00:02:26.910> series<00:02:26.940> cards

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
connector set as the 5800 series cards

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.850 
connector set as the 5800 series cards
that<00:02:27.750> means<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.170> plug<00:02:28.380> in<00:02:28.530> three

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
that means you can plug in three

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.800 
that means you can plug in three
monitors<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.580> use<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.210> card<00:02:30.510> for<00:02:30.780> I

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
monitors and use this card for I

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.580 
monitors and use this card for I
affinity<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> PCI<00:02:32.670> Express<00:02:33.150> 16<00:02:34.050> X<00:02:34.260> card

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
affinity this is a PCI Express 16 X card

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.470 
affinity this is a PCI Express 16 X card
and<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.190> see<00:02:35.340> we've<00:02:35.520> got<00:02:35.550> again<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.150> same

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
and you can see we've got again the same

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.270 
and you can see we've got again the same
fan<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.990> they're<00:02:37.140> using<00:02:37.320> on<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.830> higher<00:02:38.040> end

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
fan that they're using on the higher end

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.950 
fan that they're using on the higher end
card<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.030> expect<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.570> be<00:02:39.660> quite

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
card so you can expect it to be quite

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.560 
card so you can expect it to be quite
quiet<00:02:40.260> because<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.520> this<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:41.970> another<00:02:42.330> thing

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
quiet because and this is another thing

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.910 
quiet because and this is another thing
you'll<00:02:42.690> notice<00:02:42.870> about<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.230> immediately<00:02:43.800> it

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
you'll notice about it immediately it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.130 
you'll notice about it immediately it
only<00:02:44.130> has<00:02:44.430> one<00:02:44.460> six<00:02:45.090> pin<00:02:45.270> power<00:02:45.450> connector<00:02:45.600> so

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
only has one six pin power connector so

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.930 
only has one six pin power connector so
this<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:46.890> low<00:02:47.130> power<00:02:47.370> consumption

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
this is a very low power consumption

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.910 
this is a very low power consumption
card<00:02:48.360> compared<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.500> top-of-the-range

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920

gaming<00:02:50.580> cards<00:02:50.880> from<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.540> side<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.960> can<00:02:52.110> see

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
gaming cards from the side you can see

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.290 
gaming cards from the side you can see
we've<00:02:52.470> got<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.710> black<00:02:53.040> with<00:02:53.340> red<00:02:53.550> trim<00:02:53.910> sort<00:02:54.180> of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
we've got a black with red trim sort of

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.240 
we've got a black with red trim sort of
look<00:02:54.480> with<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.780> ATI<00:02:55.080> Radeon<00:02:55.170> branding<00:02:56.040> here

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
look with the ATI Radeon branding here

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.840 
look with the ATI Radeon branding here
and<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:57.300> like<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.630> 58<00:02:58.080> 50<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.040> back<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.610> not

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
and just like the 58 50 the back is not

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.670 
and just like the 58 50 the back is not
covered<00:03:00.300> by<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.480> black<00:03:00.810> shroud<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.500> just

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
covered by a black shroud and it just

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.860 
covered by a black shroud and it just
has<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> simple<00:03:02.340> backplate<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.360> also<00:03:03.570> has

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
has a simple backplate and it also has

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.120 
has a simple backplate and it also has
RAM<00:03:04.170> chips<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.800> back

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
RAM chips on the back

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.370 
RAM chips on the back
unlike<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.700> higher-end<00:03:06.000> cards<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:06.989> can

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
unlike the higher-end cards so you can

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.620 
unlike the higher-end cards so you can
actually<00:03:07.590> see<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.670> RAM<00:03:08.850> on<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.060> back<00:03:09.330> should

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
actually see the RAM on the back should

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.960 
actually see the RAM on the back should
you<00:03:09.840> desire<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.920> anyway
