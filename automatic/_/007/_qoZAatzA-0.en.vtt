we're gonna take a look at it afterwards

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.579 
we're gonna take a look at it afterwards
first<00:00:35.000> let's<00:00:35.269> go<00:00:35.390> ahead<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:35.780> take<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.170> look<00:00:36.409> at

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:36.589 
first let's go ahead and take a look at

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:57.950 
first let's go ahead and take a look at
it<00:00:37.120> before

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960

now<00:00:58.530> we're<00:00:58.740> going<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:58.950> start<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.400> up<00:00:59.490> and<00:00:59.730> see

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
now we're going to start it up and see

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:18.520 
now we're going to start it up and see
how<00:01:00.060> it<00:01:00.120> sounds<00:01:00.240> for<00:01:00.840> four<00:01:01.050> hands

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.170 

and<00:01:19.040> yes<00:01:19.360> that's<00:01:20.360> right

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.960 

this<00:01:23.720> runs<00:01:24.140> off<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.380> hundred<00:01:24.890> percent<00:01:25.160> Mitch

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
this runs off a hundred percent Mitch

this runs off a hundred percent Mitch
loyal

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.110 

and<00:01:39.810> that's<00:01:40.290> how<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> sounds<00:01:40.890> before<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.910> now

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
and that's how it sounds before and now

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.300 
and that's how it sounds before and now
we'll<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.450> ahead<00:01:42.480> and<00:01:42.860> listen<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.980> it<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
we'll go ahead and listen to it for a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.740 
we'll go ahead and listen to it for a
second<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:44.910> we'll<00:01:45.060> take<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.330> look<00:01:45.420> after

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
second and then we'll take a look after

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:59.870 
second and then we'll take a look after
it's<00:01:46.110> done

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.399 

these<00:02:00.880> things<00:02:01.119> are<00:02:01.329> very<00:02:01.360> popular<00:02:01.750> here<00:02:02.049> in

this<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.520> part<00:02:35.820> two<00:02:36.060> now<00:02:36.990> we<00:02:37.050> have<00:02:37.350> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
this is part two now we have the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.860 
this is part two now we have the
hush-hush<00:02:39.500> powerpro<00:02:40.970> totally<00:02:41.970> installed<00:02:42.420> now

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
hush-hush powerpro totally installed now

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.080 
hush-hush powerpro totally installed now
we're<00:02:43.050> going<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> take<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> look<00:02:43.680> at<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.250> see

we're going to take a look at it and see

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.640 
we're going to take a look at it and see
the<00:02:45.240> difference<00:02:45.270> first<00:02:46.080> we're<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.470> take

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the difference first we're going to take

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.880 
the difference first we're going to take
a<00:02:46.680> look<00:02:46.950> at<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.880> actual<00:02:48.210> exhaust<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:49.680> guys

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
a look at the actual exhaust the guys

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.370 
a look at the actual exhaust the guys
did<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.550> pretty<00:02:51.000> good<00:02:51.240> job<00:02:51.480> not<00:02:51.780> exactly<00:02:52.170> what

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
did a a pretty good job not exactly what

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:12.869 
did a a pretty good job not exactly what
I<00:02:52.410> wanted<00:02:52.800> but<00:02:53.030> who<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.240> complain

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.059 

it's<00:03:13.329> not<00:03:13.480> precisely<00:03:13.989> where<00:03:14.379> I<00:03:14.409> wanted<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.829> to

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
it's not precisely where I wanted it to

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.000 
it's not precisely where I wanted it to
be<00:03:15.219> sticking<00:03:15.489> out<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:16.409> but<00:03:17.409> it<00:03:17.530> doesn't<00:03:17.859> look

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
be sticking out of but it doesn't look

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:26.630 
be sticking out of but it doesn't look
that<00:03:18.040> bad

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.660 

now<00:03:27.180> let's<00:03:27.360> take<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.630> listen<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.710> we<00:03:29.640> can

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
now let's take a listen to it and we can

00:03:29.670 --> 00:04:13.540 
now let's take a listen to it and we can
see<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.240> difference

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.240 

has<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.180> little<00:04:14.420> bit

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.640 

as<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.820> little<00:04:19.180> bit<00:04:19.299> of<00:04:19.359> more<00:04:19.660> of<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.870> performance

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.670 

and<00:04:24.949> hopefully<00:04:25.370> I'll<00:04:25.760> do<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.060> job<00:04:26.680> compare

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
and hopefully I'll do the job compare

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.980 
and hopefully I'll do the job compare
the<00:04:27.860> cost<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.460> diesel<00:04:28.940> or<00:04:29.180> mercedes-benz

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
the cost to a diesel or mercedes-benz

muffler that costs $500 and then for the

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
noise reducer which is an additional
