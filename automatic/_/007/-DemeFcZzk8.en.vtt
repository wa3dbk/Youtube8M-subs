not sure how much they've acted changed

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.109 
not sure how much they've acted changed
I<00:00:24.630> mean<00:00:25.080> my<00:00:25.350> measurements<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:26.160> about<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
I mean my measurements are about the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.519 
I mean my measurements are about the
same<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.539> two<00:00:27.689> weeks<00:00:27.869> ago<00:00:29.900> for<00:00:30.900> about<00:00:31.289> two

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
same as two weeks ago for about two

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.810 
same as two weeks ago for about two
weeks<00:00:31.560> my<00:00:31.830> weight<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.099> actually<00:00:32.340> had<00:00:32.669> an

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
weeks my weight I actually had an

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.880 
weeks my weight I actually had an
increase<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.570> finally<00:00:34.380> started<00:00:34.739> going

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
increase in and finally started going

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.770 
increase in and finally started going
back<00:00:35.040> down<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.399> week<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:37.230> that's<00:00:38.070> because

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
back down this week and that's because

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.060 
back down this week and that's because
starting<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.739> week<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.100> adjusted<00:00:41.820> my

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
starting for this week I adjusted my

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.260 
starting for this week I adjusted my
macros<00:00:44.690> for<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:46.110> guess<00:00:46.500> an<00:00:46.710> even<00:00:47.520> deeper<00:00:47.670> cut<00:00:48.059> so

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
macros for I guess an even deeper cut so

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.650 
macros for I guess an even deeper cut so
before<00:00:48.629> I'd<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.739> plus<00:00:50.039> 10%<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:52.280> -35

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
before I'd be going plus 10% and -35

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.450 
before I'd be going plus 10% and -35
split<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.840> my<00:00:54.960> training<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.739> workout<00:00:56.070> my

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
split for my training and workout my

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.000 
split for my training and workout my
workout<00:00:57.000> days<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.420> rest<00:00:57.570> days<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:58.739> it's

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
workout days and rest days now it's

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
workout days and rest days now it's
minus<00:00:59.489> 10<00:00:59.730> minus<00:01:00.329> 30

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
minus 10 minus 30

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.670 
minus 10 minus 30
so<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> bit<00:01:02.010> more<00:01:02.039> calories<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:04.110> rest<00:01:04.439> days

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
so a bit more calories on the rest days

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
so a bit more calories on the rest days
but<00:01:05.330> definitely<00:01:06.330> less<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.689> training<00:01:06.960> these<00:01:08.330> so

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
but definitely less on training these so

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.750 
but definitely less on training these so
maybe<00:01:09.479> that's<00:01:09.659> what's<00:01:09.840> working<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:11.130> made<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
maybe that's what's working I made a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.050 
maybe that's what's working I made a
mistake<00:01:11.850> there<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.189> proud<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.400> meet<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
mistake there was a proud to meet that I

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.330 
mistake there was a proud to meet that I
thought<00:01:15.390> was<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.890> weekend's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
thought was going to be this weekend's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.649 
thought was going to be this weekend's
actually<00:01:17.700> two<00:01:17.820> weekends<00:01:18.119> from<00:01:18.180> now<00:01:19.070> so

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
actually two weekends from now so

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.920 
actually two weekends from now so
hopefully<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:22.380> should<00:01:23.119> drop<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.600> couple

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
hopefully I should drop like a couple

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.499 
hopefully I should drop like a couple
more<00:01:25.080> pounds<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.590> I'll<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.770> back<00:01:26.070> down<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
more pounds and I'll be back down to the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.910 
more pounds and I'll be back down to the
weight<00:01:27.689> class<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.320> I'm<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> be

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
weight class that I'm going to be

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.090 
weight class that I'm going to be
competing<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.710> this<00:01:31.710> keeps<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.189> then

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
competing in and this keeps up then

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.080 
competing in and this keeps up then
hopefully<00:01:35.100> I'll<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.189> back<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.610> track

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090

minutes on the treadmill kind of like

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.560 
minutes on the treadmill kind of like

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
thing right now is to either pretty much

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.899 
thing right now is to either pretty much
to<00:01:51.720> run<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.259> didn't<00:01:53.040> make<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> same<00:01:53.310> distance<00:01:53.820> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
to run I didn't make the same distance I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.929 
to run I didn't make the same distance I
did<00:01:54.090> before<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.869> add<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> distance<00:01:56.549> island

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
did before or add to the distance island

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.069 
did before or add to the distance island
in<00:01:57.060> 15<00:01:57.479> minutes<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> far<00:02:00.450> I've<00:02:00.750> managed<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
in 15 minutes so far I've managed to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.730 
in 15 minutes so far I've managed to
keep<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.409> up

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
keep it up

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.410 
keep it up
sometimes<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.700> incredibly<00:02:03.149> tough

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
sometimes it's incredibly tough

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.209 
sometimes it's incredibly tough
especially<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> days<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.680> both<00:02:04.920> squat

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
especially on the days that I both squat

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:22.230 
especially on the days that I both squat
and<00:02:05.490> deadlift<00:02:07.520> anyway<00:02:08.520> so

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.420 

now<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.270> keep<00:02:23.540> getting<00:02:23.690> stronger<00:02:24.430> my

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
now I keep getting stronger my

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.570 
now I keep getting stronger my
measurements<00:02:25.910> are<00:02:26.000> staying<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.330> same<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.250> I'm

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.830 

not<00:02:31.580> really<00:02:31.730> sure<00:02:32.000> where<00:02:32.210> that<00:02:32.330> extra<00:02:32.630> weight

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
not really sure where that extra weight

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.680 
not really sure where that extra weight
has<00:02:33.440> been<00:02:33.560> going<00:02:34.100> according<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> skill<00:02:35.120> my

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
has been going according to the skill my

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.020 
has been going according to the skill my
body<00:02:36.200> fights<00:02:36.470> about<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.830> same<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.370> wore<00:02:37.850> those

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
body fights about the same I wore those

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.660 
body fights about the same I wore those
it<00:02:38.300> down<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.960> you<00:02:38.990> would<00:02:39.290> not<00:02:39.800> expect<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.550> be

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
it down so you would not expect it to be

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.340 
it down so you would not expect it to be
weight<00:02:41.450> from<00:02:41.720> water<00:02:44.980> yeah

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.340 

so<00:02:48.860> that's<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:50.470> net<00:02:51.470> update<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:51.980> two<00:02:52.130> weeks
