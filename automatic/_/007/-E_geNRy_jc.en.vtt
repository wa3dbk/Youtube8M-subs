00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.420

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.360
 blender 3d in today's video class more 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.560
 learn how to make the game lighter in 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.500
 good lighting area some people 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.930
 think only gives to leave the game 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.750
 light on the polygons that never 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.990
 reduce to zero says it's the most talked about 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.070
 but certain polygons then using a 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.370
 low resolution text that also 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.190
 work, but when it comes to 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.340
 It's a bit of realism from here. 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.840
 widely used 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.100

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.789
 this on the internet 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.109
 Of course they do not look for much, but I think 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:01.199
 only on paid same site resources as 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.710

 in a building today the headlight of the car it 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.500
 simulates a real shadow of what is 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.900
 happening to him right through 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.500
