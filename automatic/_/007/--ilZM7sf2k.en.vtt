00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.650 
entire revolution I think
Bush<00:02:02.740> has<00:02:02.950> really<00:02:03.490> sort<00:02:03.910> of<00:02:03.970> shattered<00:02:04.510> the

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
good financial stewards and it's going

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.400 
good financial stewards and it's going
to<00:02:09.250> be<00:02:09.369> really<00:02:09.640> really<00:02:10.000> hard<00:02:10.360> for<00:02:11.050> this<00:02:11.170> ticket

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
to be really really hard for this ticket

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.110

to<00:02:11.680> build<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:11.980> back<00:02:12.190> up<00:02:12.370> again<00:02:12.610> but<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.000> think

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
to build that back up again but I think

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.700 
to build that back up again but I think
that<00:02:13.210> makes<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.720> really<00:02:13.900> interesting<00:02:14.200> point

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
that makes a really interesting point

personally say thank God nor the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.020 
personally say thank God nor the
libertarian<00:03:45.100> generally<00:03:45.579> but<00:03:45.670> they<00:03:45.790> wouldn't

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
libertarian generally but they wouldn't

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.490 
libertarian generally but they wouldn't
they<00:03:46.180> would<00:03:46.329> eliminate<00:03:46.480> all<00:03:46.840> borders<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.410> all

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
they would eliminate all borders and all

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.199 
they would eliminate all borders and all
treaties<00:03:47.890> just<00:03:48.549> haven't<00:03:48.850> wanted<00:03:48.940> them<00:03:49.180> so

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
treaties just haven't wanted them so

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.479 
treaties just haven't wanted them so
Chris<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.810> what<00:03:50.260> do<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.440> say<00:03:50.620> what<00:03:51.310> are<00:03:51.400> they

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
Chris you what do you say what are they

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.910 
Chris you what do you say what are they
different<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:52.180> think<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:52.989> Tax<00:03:53.320> Policy<00:03:53.410> you

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
different I think on Tax Policy you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.800 
different I think on Tax Policy you
would<00:03:54.100> be<00:03:54.250> significant<00:03:54.910> differences<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.540> think

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
would be significant differences I think

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.930 
would be significant differences I think
you<00:03:55.900> would<00:03:56.079> be<00:03:56.260> some<00:03:56.500> tax<00:03:56.739> increases<00:03:57.130> under

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
you would be some tax increases under

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.789 
you would be some tax increases under
Barack<00:03:58.209> Obama<00:03:58.570> I<00:03:58.840> think<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.320> would<00:03:59.410> also<00:03:59.620> see

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
Barack Obama I think you would also see

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.220 
Barack Obama I think you would also see
with<00:04:00.190> Barack<00:04:00.940> Obama<00:04:01.239> administration<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:02.250> more

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
with Barack Obama administration a more

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.120 
with Barack Obama administration a more
interventionist<00:04:05.230> government<00:04:05.799> in<00:04:05.920> the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
interventionist government in the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.340 
interventionist government in the
capital<00:04:06.640> markets<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.239> think<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:07.840> they<00:04:08.110> would

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
capital markets I think that they would

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.760 
capital markets I think that they would
be<00:04:08.730> thinking<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.760> lot<00:04:10.150> more<00:04:10.450> about<00:04:10.870> what<00:04:11.470> do<00:04:11.650> we

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.979 
be thinking a lot more about what do we
have<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:12.160> do<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.550> know<00:04:12.640> pretty<00:04:13.629> sort<00:04:13.930> of

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
but you know what do we have to do to

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.009
