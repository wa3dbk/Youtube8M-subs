00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.460
 pleasant I show you today as one 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.859
 grid over your graphic can put around 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.300
 For example, to knit these or 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.280
 to disgust 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.660
 and of course there are on the internet 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.630
 a lot of software 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.730
 I'll show you this time a woman with pro 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.960
 2.0 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.430
 the website is michael with pro and im 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.800
 next year I write you the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.359
 link in any case again in the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.230
 descriptions so under the video 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.630
 watch youtube 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.329
 ok if you now on this website 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:40.410
 be then there is a field where you 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:46.559
 So you can enter your file for 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.930
 for example a gif jpg which is up to 1 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.100
 megabyte big is my development 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.600
 simply by minutes 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.539
 I have already prepared one exactly 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.870
 Here is a mission prepared and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.019
 here could for example select how 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.799
 the be divided much as strong 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.479
 müller is the smallest days you have 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.479
 her as few people as possible and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.979
 for the size of the festival it will be so much 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.210
 subdivided as practically as possible 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.070
 we are now going to be small in the moonlight 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.700
 look that looks very different 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.970
 better church later and then created 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.950
 the program a pdf drop one 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:37.920
 pdf file that you can get a bit bigger 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.360
 the same is true of the letters 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.860
 I just have pds 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.369
 Letters taken that one file that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.810
 Now in kissing here will also be down 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.990
 and counted on the side again so 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.280
 you have practically pure euro mesh 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.720
 and you do not have to pull it off anymore 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.500
 then you only need to pay 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.750
 look at 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 for example , or the program goes 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.070
 Of course, this one creates this one 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.159
 hand of the graphic that is depending on 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.810
 where your graphic starts from the edge there 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.439
 of course it starts here on the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.520
 done 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.520
 so with me 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.890
 if you are watching me now 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:30.470
 Anguish it starts now here is the edge 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:34.220
 that's where that starts from that works 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.470
 the program so synonymous software and 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.080
 sets the graphics how did it go again 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.940
 back if we are now reddig instead 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.820
 to take 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.480
 then you see a lot already 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.770
 divided finer and you recognize the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.450
 Writing, of course, also clearly what he 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.190
 before you have recognized it but you 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:58.190
 it recognizes this course much 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.320
 better and it is fourth part that is 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.040
 for how much more 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.050
 as with the previous one that is depending on 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.780
 the good one now needs big or 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.700
 small mesh had in mind, umpire 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.410
 one gets thin or fat here 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.530
 is of course subdivided into one for 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.680
 the software and i would go for now 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.610
 It is really perfect 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:27.140
 sufficient otherwise would have to 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.130
 participation will be watching us 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.770
 down here 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.670
 There you have three divisions once 1 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:38.270
 to 1 5 7 and 75 and this is easy 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.240
 never the porsche ag so a club 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.430
 means that the height of the box and 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.410
 the width of the class is the same 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.420
 the bed comes out of course that 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.530
 bed out what we already know so how 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:58.100
 Boxes are easy here 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.569
 square if we are now with portrait 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.110
 take on the 15th 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.110
 and you can see that 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.970
 you can see that the height of the box 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.470
 is much bigger that is now coming to 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.570
 For example , if you are Tunisian 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.190
 disgusted so see the mesh for example 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.639
 Indonesian crochet out there I would 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.860
 recommend this kind to you 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.650
 and then we have another mühlke again 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.419
 the elves wants this is that yes 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.240
 I just so that we trains in five here 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.890
 here we have 7 to 5 you can do it 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.400
 surely think what comes out exactly 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:43.000
 below is the width of the box 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.000
 bigger it is sea ​​level 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.189
 at the gray areas can through 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.289
 Practical decide if we are there now 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:56.259
 another driver with the bright color 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:59.389
 I always like to work that out 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.020
 and then just look something better 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.300
 fit 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.129
 but i would light for ships now 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.289
 now the subdivision is not necessarily 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:09.349
 because they are too grainy for me 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.089
 Let's just say it like this 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.550
 donate to the website whoever 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:18.020
 that gets no idea there are 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.529
 nor any menu that's it 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.529
 beautiful 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.740
 Oh yes, if you are, of course 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:26.479
 can create the have this pdf file 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.589
 who will go out with pdf formats 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.939
 certainly be familiar i have you 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:30.080
 and if you are with a house now 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:32.719
 a little bit over it had the 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.099
 possibility to save the picture so 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.999
 can you go somewhere now ? 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:40.039
 then it could be dry so often 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.830
 otherwise you have such here 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:47.080
 give opportunities 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:50.350
 as program knows what we live 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.890
 ok i hope we helped you and 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.890
 Until next time
