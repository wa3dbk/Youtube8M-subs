00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
to port this over to xcode so click on

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.720 
to port this over to xcode so click on
file<00:01:21.250> scripts<00:01:22.270> PSC<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.300> xcode<00:01:24.400> now<00:01:25.400> it's<00:01:25.580> going

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
file scripts PSC to xcode now it's going

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.210 
file scripts PSC to xcode now it's going
to<00:01:25.790> ask<00:01:25.910> us<00:01:26.120> to<00:01:26.390> choose<00:01:26.690> storyboard<00:01:27.470> file<00:01:27.650> to

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
to ask us to choose storyboard file to

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.490 
to ask us to choose storyboard file to
implement<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:28.730> design<00:01:29.120> onto<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.260> i've

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
implement this design onto so i've

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.640 
implement this design onto so i've
already<00:01:30.650> got<00:01:30.920> one<00:01:31.250> loaded<00:01:31.910> up<00:01:32.060> here<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.650> here

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
already got one loaded up here and here

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.060 
already got one loaded up here and here
we<00:01:33.860> are<00:01:34.120> so<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.900> script<00:01:36.170> is<00:01:36.290> now<00:01:36.440> functioning

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
we are so the script is now functioning

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.860 
we are so the script is now functioning
and<00:01:37.190> it's<00:01:37.310> taking<00:01:37.670> every<00:01:38.000> single<00:01:38.360> layer<00:01:38.570> and

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
and it's taking every single layer and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.450 
and it's taking every single layer and
it's<00:01:39.020> slicing<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.680> out<00:01:39.770> into<00:01:40.010> two<00:01:40.280> different

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
it's slicing it out into two different

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.090 
it's slicing it out into two different
images<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.570> we<00:01:41.720> can<00:01:41.870> see<00:01:42.080> that<00:01:42.260> happening<00:01:42.470> here

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
images so we can see that happening here

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.400 
images so we can see that happening here
one's<00:01:43.760> a<00:01:44.000> retina<00:01:44.540> resolution<00:01:45.020> image<00:01:45.230> and

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
one's a retina resolution image and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.220 
one's a retina resolution image and
wants<00:01:45.770> an<00:01:45.890> on<00:01:46.010> retina<00:01:46.270> resolution<00:01:47.270> image<00:01:47.480> so

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
wants an on retina resolution image so

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.570 
wants an on retina resolution image so
just<00:01:48.380> go<00:01:48.440> ahead<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.770> let<00:01:48.860> this<00:01:48.950> process<00:01:49.160> go

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
just go ahead and let this process go

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.580 
just go ahead and let this process go
for<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.850> few<00:01:49.970> more<00:01:50.150> seconds<00:01:50.600> it's<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.230> really

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
for a few more seconds it's a really

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.320 
for a few more seconds it's a really
quick<00:01:51.740> process<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.400> shouldn't<00:01:52.760> take<00:01:52.820> any<00:01:53.060> more

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
quick process it shouldn't take any more

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.690 
quick process it shouldn't take any more
than<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.810> minute<00:01:54.170> or<00:01:54.200> two<00:01:54.470> this<00:01:54.920> one<00:01:55.160> is<00:01:55.310> nearly

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
than a minute or two this one is nearly

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.220 
than a minute or two this one is nearly
done<00:01:55.940> so<00:01:56.540> there<00:01:56.810> we<00:01:56.900> go

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
done so there we go

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.320 
done so there we go
the<00:01:57.350> process<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.890> finished<00:01:58.040> so<00:01:58.880> now<00:01:59.000> let's<00:01:59.210> go

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
the process is finished so now let's go

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.450 
the process is finished so now let's go
ahead<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.570> pop<00:02:00.140> over<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.500> Xcode<00:02:00.980> and<00:02:01.250> see

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
ahead and pop over to Xcode and see

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.890 
ahead and pop over to Xcode and see
what's<00:02:01.670> happened<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:02.540> as<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.720> can<00:02:02.840> see

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
what's happened so as you can see

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.990 
what's happened so as you can see
something<00:02:03.500> very<00:02:03.830> similar<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.460> what<00:02:04.610> we<00:02:04.730> mocked

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
something very similar to what we mocked

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.450 
something very similar to what we mocked
up<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:05.480> Photoshop<00:02:05.660> has<00:02:06.440> been<00:02:06.710> laid<00:02:06.890> out<00:02:06.920> here

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
up in Photoshop has been laid out here

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.149 
up in Photoshop has been laid out here
but<00:02:08.030> it's<00:02:08.330> not<00:02:08.569> exact<00:02:08.959> yet<00:02:09.259> just<00:02:09.679> because<00:02:09.979> it's

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
but it's not exact yet just because it's

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.069 
but it's not exact yet just because it's
missing<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.579> images<00:02:10.969> one<00:02:11.599> thing<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.959> would

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
missing the images one thing that would

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.750 
missing the images one thing that would
like<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.349> take<00:02:12.620> note<00:02:12.859> of<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.489> the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
like you to take note of is that the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.440 
like you to take note of is that the
images

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
images

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.900 
images
are<00:02:14.510> here<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.470> buttons<00:02:15.860> are<00:02:16.040> here<00:02:16.280> everything

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
are here the buttons are here everything

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.960 
are here the buttons are here everything
is<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.599> terms<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:18.200> Xcode<00:02:18.739> controls<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.849> let's

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
is in terms of Xcode controls so let's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.550 
is in terms of Xcode controls so let's
just<00:02:20.120> go<00:02:20.209> ahead<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.660> finish<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.050> process

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
just go ahead and finish up the process

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.670 
just go ahead and finish up the process
and<00:02:21.770> add<00:02:21.890> these<00:02:22.099> images<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:23.200> I'm<00:02:24.200> going<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.620> go

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
and add these images in I'm going to go

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.050 
and add these images in I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:24.920> choose<00:02:25.010> all<00:02:25.280> these<00:02:25.459> images<00:02:25.910> and

ahead and choose all these images and

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.540 
ahead and choose all these images and
drag<00:02:26.420> them<00:02:26.630> into<00:02:26.810> supporting<00:02:27.410> files<00:02:27.709> you're

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
drag them into supporting files you're

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.390 
drag them into supporting files you're

glad to click finish and bam there we go
the<00:02:31.670> exact<00:02:32.120> design<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:32.870> we<00:02:32.959> implemented<00:02:33.590> in

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
the exact design that we implemented in

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.240 
the exact design that we implemented in
Photoshop<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:34.940> available<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.660> Xcode<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:37.010> I

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
Photoshop is now available in Xcode so I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.190 
Photoshop is now available in Xcode so I
