00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.359
 no no 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:07.129
 hello how are you bringing something 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.930
 I just discovered 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.750
 I'm looking for a lot on the internet how 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.580
 do it but apparently it does not 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.850
 found nothing I did not find anything like 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.960
 doing it is nothing more and nothing less than the 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:28.939
 home receiver for xbox controls 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:31.160
 360 but with a slim xbox plate already 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.410
 that the other one that I had then was already 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.829
 burned decomposed and the chip was born 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.910
 it burned because the voltage street in a 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.370
 pin of connector connectors la 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.340
 street turns the topic of travel and step 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.890
 apparently he was like the goat nou good 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.469
 in this one that I have I just 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.570
 discover that then the two chips that 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.250
 has the plate these blacks of the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.240
 great milestones 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.840
 these two are equal then first 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.840
 I started to find out 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:10.820
 the connector here where they ended up 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:13.910
 the data pins more and dates less in 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.820
 this chip so how are they equal 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.490
 then after finding out here I 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.119
 I went to this one to find out the same but 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.300
 the other way around, then here is 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.150
 where will the new pins go 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.890
 to be able to connect it to the computer 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.800
 as you see here I am from this port 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.770
 usb something mother something slapped but not 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.520
 works 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.780
 good 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.670
 and here the only program that I found is 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.189
 that in this on this plate does not 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.590
 it warmed up the black chip that I have 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.899
 here this chip that you have here is not 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.530
 it warmed up a lot because the voltage of 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.170
 input then it went on the voltage pin of 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.329
 5 volt input not like here here 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.179
 we see that the input voltage pin 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.219
 it's a small square that is here but 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.099
 if we connect there the input voltage 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.750
 of usb the 5 volts does not go will not 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.750
 work will not turn on the plate 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.600
 so you have to connect it any of 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.730
 the other three that are here this would be 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.520
 the plate from behind and this is why 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.470
 forward not here are the leds 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.090
 is the plate for attack I had to 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.870
 remove the connector from here that I had 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.600
 to be able to see how the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.920
 quarrel here so good 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.520
 and they have the usb connected to the 5 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.350
 volts are connected 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.540
 any of these three pins that are 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.100
 here they can connect them nothing more than 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.490
 this is going to heat up and I suggest that 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.200
 as in previous videos that I saw that they 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.910
 they connected a diode to regulate the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.910
 voltage I recommend you see that 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.590
 because I will not burn something 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.960
 I have this plate here because then to me 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.300
 xbox l 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.040
 her mother has put it down she went out to 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.680
 the red light here in the center no longer 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.140
 he wanted to turn on the error he had 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.140
 Well, nobody wanted to buy it for me 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.700
 I said good to be able to investigate that and 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.730
 he connected them to the computer 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.319
 and well now I'll show you how 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.550
 use the computer that the product 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.340
 it would be the same as 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:28.090
 previous good first of all a 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.920
 apology was recording with a 3ds was 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.010
 the only camera the only camera that 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.310
 I had my hand 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.170
 but good to something else I did not explain 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.810
 ok how to connect the pins so in 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.090
 the description of the video I will leave you 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.519
 an image 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.040
 with a simple diagram on how and 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:51.079
 on how to connect forgiveness 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.079
 good, we will proceed to connect it 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.670
 and good and we see that already tells us 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:03.670
 unknown device what are we going to 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.670
 do is open the we give properties 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.740
 the hardware or properties here again 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:15.300
 in the country if here in details gives us 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:20.489
 this this location this this text of 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.959
 here here that says 0 2 to 9 then 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.880
 they will have connected it with 5 and 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.880
 we will proceed to install it 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.620
 we open the device manager 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.440
 and here we have it here 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.110
 update your driver software 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.850
 let's look for him on the computer here 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.220
 let's give choose a list of 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.910
 device drivers 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.050
 here we are going to appear this way 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.530
 several devices that we can install 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.480
 how not to select this that says 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.560
 xbox 360 peripherals 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:07.690
 we give in next and we put the one 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.310
 says this xbox 360 for windows we give 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.020
 the next 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.610
 here he tells us it is not recommended but 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.460
 well we do not pay attention to him we say that 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.360
 yes and ready 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:24.270
 if you notice since installed 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.270
 the receiver is already installed 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.720
 here is already 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.720
 I'm going to connect a control to 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.589
 Y 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.289
 here as you can see that I appear in 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:58.270
 control presents if disconnected 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:06:02.580
 is the door again ready and appeared 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:06.240
 it's already here how to connect it 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.740
 I think that would be all here is the 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.069
 image that I will leave in the 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.069
 instruction 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.850
 and well I think it will be all for this 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.979
 video that is my first video premiere my 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.210
 channel this year I have never used so 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:26.560
 well I hope to upload more things like this 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.560
 and good would be the whole
