mountain<00:00:34.780> bridge<00:00:35.140> is<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:36.280> just<00:00:37.120> use<00:00:37.330> Adams

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
mountain bridge is to just use Adams

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.789 
mountain bridge is to just use Adams
suspension<00:00:39.010> that<00:00:39.100> he<00:00:39.190> already<00:00:39.400> has<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:40.799> grab

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:41.799 
suspension that he already has and grab

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:45.210 
suspension that he already has and grab
a<00:00:41.830> small<00:00:42.190> aluminum<00:00:43.500> beaner<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:44.769> just<00:00:44.979> clip<00:00:45.190> it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
a small aluminum beaner and just clip it

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.420 
a small aluminum beaner and just clip it
to<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.580> ring<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:46.210> outer<00:00:46.390> rings<00:00:46.720> on<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
to the ring the outer rings on the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.890 
to the ring the outer rings on the
hammock<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:51.150> find<00:00:52.150> that<00:00:52.269> that's<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.659> best

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
hammock and I find that that's the best

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.350 
hammock and I find that that's the best
way<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:54.460> connect<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:54.909> you're<00:00:55.059> going<00:00:55.150> to<00:00:55.239> get

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
way to connect it you're going to get

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.539 
way to connect it you're going to get
some<00:00:55.659> you<00:00:56.350> can<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:56.979> can<00:00:57.129> kind<00:00:57.309> of<00:00:57.339> move<00:00:57.489> the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
some you can you can kind of move the

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.250 
some you can you can kind of move the
articles<00:00:58.420> of<00:00:58.540> this<00:00:58.720> on<00:00:58.839> a<00:00:58.869> little<00:00:59.110> piece<00:00:59.229> of

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
articles of this on a little piece of

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.329 
articles of this on a little piece of
material<00:00:59.470> here<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:01.030> outer<00:01:01.390> ring<00:01:01.780> here

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
material here to the outer ring here

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.840 
material here to the outer ring here
you've<00:01:03.339> got<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:05.080> static<00:01:05.590> objects<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.549> what's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
you've got to static objects and what's

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.950 
you've got to static objects and what's
going<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.090> happen<00:01:07.330> is<00:01:07.420> going<00:01:07.570> to<00:01:07.630> tear<00:01:07.840> the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
going to happen is going to tear the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
going to happen is going to tear the
loop<00:01:08.140> off<00:01:09.570> Jack's<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.720> better<00:01:10.900> suspension<00:01:11.650> is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
loop off Jack's a better suspension is

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.780 
loop off Jack's a better suspension is
actually<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.400> bungee<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.630> runs<00:01:13.930> from<00:01:14.050> here

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
actually a bungee that runs from here

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.250 
actually a bungee that runs from here
down<00:01:15.790> here<00:01:15.850> through<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.510> ring<00:01:16.720> and<00:01:16.900> connects

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
down here through the ring and connects

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.940 
down here through the ring and connects
to<00:01:17.980> the<00:01:18.130> loop<00:01:18.340> on<00:01:19.020> their<00:01:20.020> own<00:01:21.060> under<00:01:22.060> quilt<00:01:22.950> but

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
to the loop on their own under quilt but

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.040 
to the loop on their own under quilt but
I<00:01:24.310> like<00:01:24.730> this<00:01:24.850> design<00:01:25.150> actually<00:01:25.390> better<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:25.990> I

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050

quilt right here you can just cinch them

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.830 
quilt right here you can just cinch them
up<00:01:43.960> on<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.170> sides<00:01:44.409> here<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:46.090> have<00:01:46.540> actually

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
up on the sides here and I have actually

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.370 
up on the sides here and I have actually
added<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:48.520> piece<00:01:48.790> of<00:01:50.040> bungee<00:01:51.040> here<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.390> I

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
added one piece of bungee here and I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.320 
added one piece of bungee here and I
just<00:01:53.440> use<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.920> S<00:01:54.070> beam<00:01:54.310> or<00:01:54.460> that<00:01:54.640> Adam<00:01:55.030> sins

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.080 
just use the S beam or that Adam sins
and<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:55.990> connect<00:01:56.290> it<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.590> top<00:01:56.770> of<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
and I connect it to the top of the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.020 
and I connect it to the top of the
bungee<00:01:58.450> cord<00:01:58.659> running<00:01:58.990> across<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.320> top<00:02:00.030> just

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
bungee cord running across the top just

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.780 
bungee cord running across the top just
to<00:02:01.090> make<00:02:01.299> sure<00:02:01.330> that<00:02:01.659> there's<00:02:02.310> no<00:02:03.310> air<00:02:03.520> flow

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
to make sure that there's no air flow

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.300 
to make sure that there's no air flow
through<00:02:03.820> that<00:02:04.120> baffle<00:02:04.510> there<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:06.040> fits

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
through that baffle there it fits

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.749 
through that baffle there it fits
terrific<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.540> works<00:02:07.780> great<00:02:07.900> so<00:02:08.440> if<00:02:08.709> you<00:02:09.340> um

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
terrific and it works great so if you um

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.449
