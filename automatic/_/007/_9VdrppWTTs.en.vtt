have been determined by random events so
the<00:01:54.689> players<00:01:55.140> moved<00:01:55.649> out<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the players moved out of there as the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.330 
the players moved out of there as the
pylon<00:01:57.149> was<00:01:57.390> shooting<00:01:58.320> lasers<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:58.860> them<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
pylon was shooting lasers at them and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.160 
pylon was shooting lasers at them and
they<00:01:59.729> started<00:02:00.030> hiding<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.630> these<00:02:00.810> corners

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
they started hiding in these corners

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.959 
they started hiding in these corners
here<00:02:01.799> then<00:02:02.280> timing<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.960> timing<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:05.640> moments

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
here then timing the timing the moments

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.490 
here then timing the timing the moments
in<00:02:06.030> which<00:02:06.090> they<00:02:06.390> run<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.079> room<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
in which they run out of that room to

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.080 
in which they run out of that room to
minimize<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.280> time<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.640> which<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:08.910> would<00:02:09.030> be

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
minimize the time in which they would be

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.940 
minimize the time in which they would be
exposed<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.780> laser<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.709> start

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
exposed to the laser they start

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.800 
exposed to the laser they start
exploring<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.459> area<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.450> doesn't

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
exploring this area but that doesn't

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.290 
exploring this area but that doesn't
look<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
look like the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.800 
look like the
much<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:14.080> be<00:02:14.200> found<00:02:14.500> they<00:02:15.460> found<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.810> cryogenic

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
much to be found they found a cryogenic

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.810 
much to be found they found a cryogenic
room<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.800> they<00:02:17.920> have<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.190> move<00:02:18.340> fast<00:02:18.640> to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
room here and they have to move fast to

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.670 
room here and they have to move fast to
escape<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.270> lasers<00:02:19.750> then<00:02:20.140> they<00:02:20.290> moved<00:02:20.500> in

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
escape the lasers then they moved in

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.740 
escape the lasers then they moved in
this<00:02:20.860> area<00:02:21.370> where<00:02:21.580> they<00:02:21.760> found<00:02:22.060> two<00:02:22.270> huge

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
this area where they found two huge

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.900 
this area where they found two huge
monsters<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.890> night<00:02:24.070> terrors

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910

they<00:02:25.330> fought<00:02:25.630> them<00:02:25.870> there<00:02:26.560> was<00:02:26.680> another<00:02:26.920> gate

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
they fought them there was another gate

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.980 
they fought them there was another gate
which<00:02:27.880> allowed<00:02:28.180> them<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.360> move<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.720> another

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
which allowed them to move to another
