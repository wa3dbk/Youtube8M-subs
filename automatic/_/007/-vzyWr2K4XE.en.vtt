00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.459
 canotherapy is a series of ideas consisting of four observed theories 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.630
 used for the purpose of explaining how the modern plan supports the body 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.900
 human in combating their own health problems 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.980
 he won to see more 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.769
 It is a fungus like any other natural food but abundant in nutrients 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.580
 The modern age 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 is a dietary supplement that supported the body in an integral way 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.540
 in the maintenance of general well-being 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.210
 through prevention 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.380
 On the contrary, conventional medicines work partially 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.530
 using drugs to treat you correct diseases 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.839
 to obtain an optimal health status 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.400
 the four columns must be observed 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.840
 the lack of any of the four components can leave the body with 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.120
 excess of toxins as well as the imbalance of the corporate system 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.780
 our body is constantly exposed to excessive toxins the radicals 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.520
 free 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.790
 chemical pressure as well as the modern lifestyle 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.760
 and bad eating habits 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.160
 overeating eating too often eating too much 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.009
 hurried on 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.030
 consume too many acid and cooked foods 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.310
 and a diet without green vegetables 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.959
 can accumulate toxins in the body and cause health problems 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.660
 when toxins accumulate in your body 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.540
 the body has a defense system to combat them in three phase phase of 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.050
 phase of crystallization and phase of tumor development 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.630
 during the first level of defense or elimination phase 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.070
 the toxin will be removed from the body by means of its corin phlegm pain and from 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.670
 position 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.729
 If the body is not able to eliminate the toxins they were crystallized in 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.670
 uric acid and stones or combined with other inert materials forming 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.240
 cholesterol and fat 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.009
 For this same reason many people develop obesity overweight high 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:01.940
 cholesterol 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.660
 and joint problems 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.430
 if these toxins can not be released outside the body for a long time 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.859
 the body will develop serious health problems such as tumors 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.889
 knowing that the two main causes of health problems are caused by 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.199
 the toxins and the imbalance of the body 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.710
 of xm has developed two main products the heretic 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.250
 that supported the body with detoxification and gl 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.280
 which supports the body with balance 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.489
 both the heretic and the glp 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.529
 are organic and natural products made from the fruit of the root of both 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.129
 of weapon respectively 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.409
 Usually all the health problems of our body result from two 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.849
 main causes 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.539
 the toxin and the imbalance of the body 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.150
 this is the first theory of observation 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.869
 relating therapy 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:55.869
 the second observation theory indicates that the decline supported the body and 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:59.049
 the body takes care of its own health problems 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.299
 was modern never reacted about health problems is the body that 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.459
 he does it with the support of the modern plan 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.479
 the third theory of observation helps explain about the reflection of the 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.379
 disease after consumption of modern dha reflection of the disease 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.170
 it is not caused by ganoderma 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.020
 if not the body itself that tries to eliminate the toxin during the process of 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.629
 Balance 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.900
 The short theory of observation indicates the recommended dose for optimal 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.299
 health condition 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.750
 for the first week of consumption a couple of rgx per day is recommended 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.299
 and then six pairs in the fourth week 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.519
 If the detection of the disease is excessive, the dose should be decreased 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.999
 half until the condition is manageable by the body itself 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:46.299
 the human body needs an appropriate combination of foods that 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.420
 there had not been 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.029
 in a ratio of 4 to 1 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.339
 one for an optimal health condition 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.659
 based on the foods that we consume daily 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.639
 the consumption ration turns out to be the opposite 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.089
 we tend to consume more meat and sodas than green vegetables 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.969
 fruits and cereals 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.629
 therefore we should take alkaline food supplements to neutralize 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.249
 the acid that is found in our body 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:16.109
 of xm has a variety of alkaline health products such as the rg axle ltd 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.539
 explains spirulina 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.519
 after congratulating is in one 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.620
 and you die for this purpose 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.600
 Many people who suffer from diabetes never realize that the main cause of 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.330
 his disease is the food consumed 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.229
 Diabetes is caused by pancreas problems 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.699
 which in turn results from poor digestion caused by the consumption of 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.050
 food with few tenths 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.770
 most of the food we eat are cooked foods 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.120
 which most oaks have been destroyed during cooking 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.749
 increasing 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.150
 load of the pancreas 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.190
 if the pancreas struggles to withstand more loads for a long time 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.069
 this will face the imbalance sooner or later 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.909
 resulting diabetes 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.150
 as it is not possible to consume raw food at every meal 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.150
 that's why I wanted to ine provide you products with oaks such as frg 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.309
 pl spirulina 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.599
 monsanto and the record and bread 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.939
 you see that our red blood cells only last 120 days 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.660
 our body has to produce red blood cells every day to 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.789
 produce red blood cells the body needs two raw materials called 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.509
 pierrot and chlorophyll 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.509
 chlorophyll is found exclusively in green vegetables 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.150
 you consume enough vegetables daily 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.439
 probably not 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.059
 what will happen then 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:37.809
 your red blood cells will have to be recycled 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:42.319
 the recycling process is very complicated in which it involves the glass 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.509
 liver and kidneys 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.020
 if this is allowed to happen for a long time 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.460
 the organs will fail 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.029
 resulting in serious health problems 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.550
 to avoid this d xm 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.589

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.589

 do you know what is good for your shots or is it good for your career 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.259

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:10.340

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.870
 it's more our skin is exposed to excessive toxins free radicals 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.680
 radiation and pressure chemistry
