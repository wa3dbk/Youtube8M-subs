when you take it out of the box for the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.149 
when you take it out of the box for the
class<00:01:07.909> time<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:09.079> will<00:01:09.200> present<00:01:09.530> applications

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
class time it will present applications

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.740 
class time it will present applications
to<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.430> which<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:10.850> believes<00:01:11.149> you<00:01:11.420> would<00:01:11.539> use

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
to you which it believes you would use

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.380 
to you which it believes you would use
in<00:01:11.930> those<00:01:12.079> different<00:01:12.530> locations<00:01:13.179> so<00:01:14.179> for

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
in those different locations so for

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.569 
in those different locations so for
instance<00:01:14.450> if<00:01:14.869> you're<00:01:15.110> out<00:01:15.679> and<00:01:15.740> about<00:01:15.979> if<00:01:16.460> it

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
instance if you're out and about if it

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.120 
instance if you're out and about if it
is<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:17.179> would<00:01:17.329> sort<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:17.630> water<00:01:18.130> basically

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
is it would sort of water basically

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.950 
is it would sort of water basically
assume<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:19.969> you'd<00:01:20.149> want<00:01:20.179> to<00:01:20.539> use<00:01:20.689> things

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
assume that you'd want to use things

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.190 
assume that you'd want to use things
like<00:01:21.079> maybe<00:01:21.439> car<00:01:22.159> mode<00:01:22.399> perhaps<00:01:22.960> things<00:01:23.960> like

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
like maybe car mode perhaps things like

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.760 
like maybe car mode perhaps things like
maps<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.069> forth<00:01:25.600> when<00:01:26.600> you're<00:01:26.750> at<00:01:26.869> work<00:01:26.899> it

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
maps and so forth when you're at work it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.740 
maps and so forth when you're at work it
presumably<00:01:28.310> understand<00:01:29.179> that<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.509> want<00:01:29.630> to

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
presumably understand that you want to

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.450

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
presenting those two years well but you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.190 
presenting those two years well but you
then<00:01:33.350> were<00:01:33.619> able<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.009> modify<00:01:34.310> those<00:01:34.960> on<00:01:35.960> your

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
then were able to modify those on your

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.100 
then were able to modify those on your
you<00:01:36.469> know<00:01:36.590> depending<00:01:37.069> on<00:01:37.220> your<00:01:37.340> own<00:01:37.490> usage<00:01:38.110> and

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
you know depending on your own usage and

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.639 
you know depending on your own usage and
you<00:01:39.349> can<00:01:39.500> actually<00:01:39.770> set<00:01:40.039> your<00:01:40.340> locations

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
you can actually set your locations

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.529 
you can actually set your locations
using<00:01:42.649> this<00:01:42.860> menu<00:01:43.099> so<00:01:43.429> for<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.000> first<00:01:44.179> time

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
using this menu so for the first time

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.469 
using this menu so for the first time
this<00:01:45.170> morning<00:01:45.649> I<00:01:45.860> was<00:01:46.520> able<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:47.179> select

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
this morning I was able to select

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.190 
this morning I was able to select
different<00:01:48.849> locations<00:01:49.849> here<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:50.869> then<00:01:51.079> it

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
different locations here and then it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.289 
different locations here and then it
presented<00:01:51.709> map<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.489> I<00:01:52.520> could<00:01:52.759> set<00:01:52.970> my<00:01:53.119> location

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
presented map so I could set my location

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.949 
presented map so I could set my location
so<00:01:53.989> it's<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.409> quite<00:01:55.099> selected<00:01:55.489> home<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.780> map

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
so it's a quite selected home on the map

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.169 
so it's a quite selected home on the map
I<00:01:57.170> could<00:01:57.349> actually<00:01:57.470> pinpoint<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:58.429> say<00:01:58.610> that

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
I could actually pinpoint and say that

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.330 
I could actually pinpoint and say that
is<00:01:59.299> my<00:01:59.479> home<00:01:59.720> and<00:01:59.959> select<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:00.590> location<00:02:01.130> so

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
is my home and select that location so

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.850 
is my home and select that location so
when<00:02:01.520> I'm<00:02:02.000> in<00:02:02.179> close<00:02:02.390> proximity<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:03.500> my<00:02:03.649> home

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
when I'm in close proximity to my home

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.339 
when I'm in close proximity to my home
and<00:02:04.099> change<00:02:04.610> applications<00:02:05.239> that<00:02:06.079> have<00:02:06.170> made

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
and change applications that have made

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:14.050 
and change applications that have made
available<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.890> me<00:02:07.420> there<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.479> go
