bit of scrambling a mule again the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.740 
bit of scrambling a mule again the
system<00:02:23.250> as<00:02:23.370> well<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.849> could<00:02:24.000> see<00:02:24.209> kind<00:02:24.660> of

system as well as you could see kind of

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.970 
system as well as you could see kind of
goes<00:02:24.930> through<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.319> middle<00:02:25.560> now<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.830> isn't

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
goes through the middle now this isn't

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.010 
goes through the middle now this isn't
some<00:02:26.280> sort<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.580> trendy<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:27.599> way<00:02:27.870> of

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
some sort of trendy like way of

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.690 
some sort of trendy like way of
designing<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.590> basically<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.160> enables<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
designing it basically it enables the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.280 
designing it basically it enables the
boots<00:02:29.880> actually<00:02:30.300> flex<00:02:30.599> with<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.959> obviously

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
boots actually flex with you obviously

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.170 
boots actually flex with you obviously
everyone<00:02:31.920> walks<00:02:32.220> differently

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
everyone walks differently

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.180 
everyone walks differently
and<00:02:33.269> obviously<00:02:34.110> everyone<00:02:34.440> has<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.650> natural<00:02:35.099> way

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
and obviously everyone has a natural way

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.650 
and obviously everyone has a natural way
of<00:02:35.220> walking<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.849> now<00:02:35.940> basically<00:02:36.390> well<00:02:36.540> that's

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
of walking and now basically well that's

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.280 
of walking and now basically well that's
meant<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.959> do

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
meant to do

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.990 
meant to do
it's<00:02:37.769> basically<00:02:38.220> meant<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.519> make<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.670> song

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
it's basically meant to make the song

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.750 
it's basically meant to make the song
itself<00:02:39.569> move<00:02:40.019> along<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.040> basically

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
itself move along with you basically

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.680 
itself move along with you basically
means<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:42.180> going<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> lot<00:02:42.660> more

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
means it's going to be a lot more
