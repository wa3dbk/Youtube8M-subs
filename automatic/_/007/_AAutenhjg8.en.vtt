00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.530 
to make sure you don't do the lines too
far<00:02:35.470> apart<00:02:35.890> because<00:02:36.520> if<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.880> do<00:02:37.000> them<00:02:37.120> too<00:02:37.300> far

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
far apart because if you do them too far

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.270 
far apart because if you do them too far
apart<00:02:37.900> then<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.200> will<00:02:38.410> have<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> gap<00:02:38.980> in

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
apart then you will have a gap in

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.720 
apart then you will have a gap in
between<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.480> once<00:02:40.690> again<00:02:40.840> just<00:02:41.200> do<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.730> thin

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
between so once again just do a thin

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
between so once again just do a thin
bead<00:02:43.030> from<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.420> front<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.840> back<00:02:48.630> now<00:02:49.630> if

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
bead from the front to the back now if

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.690 
bead from the front to the back now if
you<00:02:49.870> kind<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.080> push<00:02:50.320> down<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.800> smoosh<00:02:51.459> the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
you kind of push down and smoosh the

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.490 
you kind of push down and smoosh the
hair<00:02:51.910> down<00:02:52.120> it's<00:02:52.390> gonna<00:02:52.600> it's<00:02:53.170> going<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.380> help

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
hair down it's gonna it's going to help

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.740 
hair down it's gonna it's going to help
it<00:02:53.709> get<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.130> little<00:02:54.820> spots<00:02:55.120> in<00:02:55.360> between

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
it get to the little spots in between

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.260 
it get to the little spots in between
that<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:57.130> gets<00:02:57.280> color<00:02:57.580> as<00:02:57.730> well<00:02:57.970> and

practice makes perfect

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.040
