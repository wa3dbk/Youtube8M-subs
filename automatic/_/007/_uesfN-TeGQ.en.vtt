simple you won't eat them unless you're
really<00:02:09.539> stuck<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:11.220> this

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
really stuck so this

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800 
really stuck so this
is<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.930> case<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.790> order<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.090> take<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.450> out<00:02:15.570> you

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
is the case in order to take it out you

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.400 
is the case in order to take it out you
do<00:02:15.960> have<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.320> pull<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.770> sides<00:02:17.040> out<00:02:17.490> first

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
do have to pull the sides out first

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.900 
do have to pull the sides out first
before<00:02:20.060> whoops<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.400> pull<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.610> sides

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
before whoops you have to pull the sides

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.180 
before whoops you have to pull the sides
out<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.900> slide<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.710> off<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.070> that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
out and you just slide it off like that

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.690 
out and you just slide it off like that
so<00:02:29.190> here's<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.640> case<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.270> is<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.110> full

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
so here's the case it is a full

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.550 
so here's the case it is a full
