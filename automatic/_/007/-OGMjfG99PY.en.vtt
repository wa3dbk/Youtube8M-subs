the<00:00:02.820> macbook<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.740> our<00:00:04.740> most<00:00:04.890> popular<00:00:05.250> man<00:00:06.290> but

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
the macbook is our most popular man but

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.160 
the macbook is our most popular man but
what<00:00:07.470> we've<00:00:07.680> what<00:00:08.220> we've<00:00:08.280> done<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.170> we've

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
what we've what we've done and we've

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.070 
what we've what we've done and we've
made<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> habit<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.920> doing<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.429> happen<00:00:11.759> is

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
made a habit of doing this it happen is

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.540 
made a habit of doing this it happen is
is<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.469> decided<00:00:14.070> just<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.700> start<00:00:15.059> over

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.480 

the<00:00:19.119> new<00:00:19.269> macbook<00:00:19.539> is<00:00:19.929> a<00:00:19.990> quite<00:00:20.380> remarkable

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.179 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable
engineering<00:00:21.509> achievement<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.859> really

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
engineering achievement it really

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.900 
engineering achievement it really
represents<00:00:25.179> just<00:00:26.109> a<00:00:26.259> complete<00:00:26.739> revolution<00:00:27.730> in

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
represents just a complete revolution in

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:40.500 
represents just a complete revolution in
the<00:00:28.509> way<00:00:28.539> that<00:00:28.779> notebooks<00:00:29.169> are<00:00:29.320> made

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.000 

when<00:00:41.510> traditionally<00:00:42.110> notebooks<00:00:42.590> are<00:00:42.800> made

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
when traditionally notebooks are made

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.110 
when traditionally notebooks are made
from<00:00:43.750> multiple<00:00:44.750> parts<00:00:45.579> but<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:46.670> problem<00:00:47.030> is

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
from multiple parts but the problem is

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.660 
from multiple parts but the problem is
when<00:00:47.449> you<00:00:47.780> have<00:00:48.050> multiple<00:00:48.500> parts<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:49.520> add

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
when you have multiple parts you you add

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.079 
when you have multiple parts you you add
size<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:50.510> weight<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.340> you<00:00:52.340> increase<00:00:52.790> the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
size and weight and you increase the

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.450 
size and weight and you increase the
opportunity<00:00:53.660> for<00:00:53.690> failure<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:54.440> that<00:00:54.470> the

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
opportunity for failure and that the

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.030 
opportunity for failure and that the
huge<00:00:56.180> breakthrough<00:00:56.449> that<00:00:57.290> we<00:00:57.500> heard<00:00:57.800> with

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
huge breakthrough that we heard with

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.030 
huge breakthrough that we heard with
with<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.400> macbook<00:00:58.900> was<00:00:59.900> to<00:01:00.110> replace<00:01:00.440> all<00:01:00.680> of

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
with the macbook was to replace all of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.329 
with the macbook was to replace all of
those<00:01:01.190> parts<00:01:01.699> with<00:01:02.239> just<00:01:02.510> one<00:01:02.839> part<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:03.500> at

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
those parts with just one part and at

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.600 
those parts with just one part and at
one<00:01:04.519> part<00:01:04.790> we<00:01:04.970> called<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.300> unibody<00:01:06.610> we

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
one part we called the unibody we

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.510 
one part we called the unibody we
figured<00:01:08.090> out<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.240> way<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:08.950> being<00:01:09.950> able<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.250> make

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
figured out a way of being able to make

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.029 
figured out a way of being able to make
make<00:01:11.000> make<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.450> notebook<00:01:12.039> fundamentally

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.690 

aluminium<00:01:33.410> was<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:33.800> ideal<00:01:34.100> choice<00:01:34.340> for<00:01:34.490> this

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
aluminium was the ideal choice for this
