more full and normal life we need to do
even<00:01:53.250> better<00:01:53.399> however<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:55.140> are<00:01:55.259> two

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
even better however and there are two

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.389 
even better however and there are two
great<00:01:55.770> challenges<00:01:56.509> challenge<00:01:57.509> one<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
great challenges challenge one is

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.899 
great challenges challenge one is
deciding

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
deciding

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.929 
deciding
especially<00:02:01.909> early<00:02:01.939> on<00:02:02.710> how<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.939> initiate

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
especially early on how to initiate

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.020 
especially early on how to initiate
treatment<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:06.289> somebody<00:02:07.009> with<00:02:07.340> new<00:02:07.520> symptoms

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
treatment in somebody with new symptoms

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.570 
treatment in somebody with new symptoms
of<00:02:08.300> multiple<00:02:08.479> sclerosis<00:02:09.319> we<00:02:09.920> currently<00:02:10.280> have

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
of multiple sclerosis we currently have

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.259 
of multiple sclerosis we currently have
nine<00:02:11.300> different<00:02:11.660> therapies<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.890> range<00:02:13.790> in

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
nine different therapies that range in

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.970 
nine different therapies that range in
effectiveness<00:02:15.019> from<00:02:15.950> very<00:02:16.220> modest<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.980> almost

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
effectiveness from very modest to almost

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.240 
effectiveness from very modest to almost
complete<00:02:19.660> effectiveness<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:22.069> also

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
complete effectiveness and that also

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.289 
complete effectiveness and that also
range<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:23.060> potential<00:02:23.750> risk<00:02:24.080> from<00:02:24.950> minimal<00:02:25.610> to

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
range in potential risk from minimal to

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.610 
range in potential risk from minimal to
quite<00:02:26.599> significant<00:02:27.440> risk<00:02:29.290> unfortunately<00:02:30.290> we

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
quite significant risk unfortunately we

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.210 
quite significant risk unfortunately we
still<00:02:30.680> don't<00:02:31.370> have<00:02:32.380> highly<00:02:33.380> effective<00:02:34.010> and

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
still don't have highly effective and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.110 
still don't have highly effective and
highly<00:02:34.640> safe<00:02:35.180> therapies<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.849> one<00:02:37.849> of<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
highly safe therapies and one of the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.039 
highly safe therapies and one of the
challenges<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.750> we<00:02:39.049> have<00:02:39.319> is<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:40.630> decide<00:02:41.630> in

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
challenges that we have is to decide in

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.770 
challenges that we have is to decide in
a<00:02:42.290> given<00:02:42.829> patient<00:02:43.130> at<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.849> very<00:02:44.120> beginning<00:02:44.360> of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.270 
a given patient at the very beginning of
disease<00:02:45.700> what<00:02:46.700> treatment<00:02:47.739> should<00:02:48.739> be

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
disease what treatment should be

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.289 
disease what treatment should be
initiated<00:02:50.060> how<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.019> follow<00:02:51.709> people<00:02:52.640> once<00:02:52.970> the

therapy and when to declare victory as

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.860 
therapy and when to declare victory as
well<00:02:59.720> when<00:03:00.049> to<00:03:00.260> say<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.920> MS<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.870> now
