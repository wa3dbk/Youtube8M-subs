00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 Y 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.610
 all right 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.450
 after 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.850
 on the first date of the championship that 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.620
 It's still long, it did not go well 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.260
 we have actually worked in the summer 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.450
 for just this date as you 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.370
 He said before the other colleagues who do not 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.600
 many people do not know the issue of the laying 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.520
 ready for summer is completely 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.230
 different from the rest of the year 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.520
 we have worked all summer for 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.110
 to be able to get to this wind well 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.820
 prepared the first date of the super by 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.890
 Peru and we have achieved a second place 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.350
 pretty good accumulation of points are 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.930
 seven dates so this just 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.490
 start we are preparing the motorcycle 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.420
 we are with a totally new bike 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.250
 we have run a motorcycle completely 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.170
 standard with two bikes prepared like this 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.730
 that nothing very happy with the result 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.840
 happy for having been able to reach this 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.090
 date 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.900
 I knew I had seen that the level is 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:06.140
 quite strong very difficult 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.950
 and be fighting the posts there and good 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.540
 thank all the people who have come 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.319
 and congratulate the three guys who have 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.319
 stayed ahead 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.680
 Ricardo has been very hard in the sense 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.690
 that you know that as 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.209
 pilots we deprive ourselves of many things 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.790
 but it's worth the effort when one 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.790
 is focused is very good and 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.590
 satisfactory the result so we have 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.330
 I have been watching the food well 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.590
 we have neglected a bit of gymnastics 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.530
 the truth because of the question of 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.239
 vacations but always focused and 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.349
 training complicated for me I had a 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.690
 problem with a signaling in the 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.799
 first sleeve I entered a stop and go of 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.870
 pits that I did not touch was for another 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.819
 pilot but they made signs to me 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.560
 with the flag the number already seemed 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.319
 it complicated me which made me stay 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.810
 penultimate that we retake the second sleeve 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.280
 we won the same, we did not score more 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.349
 here for the 3rd place or I come 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.989
 preparing me in the two categories not 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.750
 they know I run in 600 and 150 are motorcycles 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.489
 totally different behave 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.489
 different in the circuit not in the 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.080
 preparation also this influences 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.600
 quite not 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.580
 in the kind of handling everything and we're 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.930
 talking about developing the bike so that 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.930
 be on the track
