00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
at that point like I'd only really

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.780 
at that point like I'd only really
dabbled<00:01:20.950> in<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.159> few<00:01:21.340> different<00:01:21.460> techniques

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
month and he pretty much has spelled out

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.109 
month and he pretty much has spelled out
like<00:01:25.869> it<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.950> like<00:01:27.009> all<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.610> old-school

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
like it is like all the old-school

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.230 
like it is like all the old-school
techniques<00:01:28.600> ratted<00:01:29.049> cello<00:01:29.290> cotton<00:01:29.920> flip<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
techniques ratted cello cotton flip and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.460 
techniques ratted cello cotton flip and
I<00:01:31.360> just<00:01:31.570> really<00:01:31.720> stuck<00:01:32.110> with<00:01:32.320> those

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
I just really stuck with those

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.620 
I just really stuck with those
techniques<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.189> now<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.670> like<00:01:34.360> when<00:01:34.509> our

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
techniques and now that like when our

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.929 
techniques and now that like when our
palette<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.079> color<00:01:35.320> really<00:01:36.009> got<00:01:36.310> bigger<00:01:36.759> you

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
palette of color really got bigger you

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.520 
palette of color really got bigger you
know<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.240> everybody<00:01:37.570> like<00:01:37.810> took<00:01:38.049> off<00:01:38.229> on<00:01:38.439> the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
know and everybody like took off on the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.289 
know and everybody like took off on the
whole<00:01:38.680> wig<00:01:38.860> wag<00:01:39.070> scene<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:39.640> feel<00:01:39.820> like<00:01:40.119> I've

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
whole wig wag scene I feel like I've

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.969 
whole wig wag scene I feel like I've
been<00:01:40.329> archiving<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.350> lot<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.649> these<00:01:41.740> like

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
been archiving a lot of these like

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.859 
been archiving a lot of these like
traditional<00:01:42.790> older<00:01:43.119> techniques<00:01:43.540> so<00:01:43.720> we're

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
traditional older techniques so we're

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.780 
traditional older techniques so we're
kind<00:01:44.049> of<00:01:44.110> from<00:01:44.290> like<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.500> past<00:01:44.829> era<00:01:45.100> or<00:01:45.310> whatever

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
kind of from like a past era or whatever

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.670 
kind of from like a past era or whatever
so<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.750> can<00:01:46.870> get<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.020> hold<00:01:47.200> me<00:01:47.290> through<00:01:47.470> dose
