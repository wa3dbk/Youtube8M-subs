to remove because the factory exhaust

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.830 
to remove because the factory exhaust
system<00:00:37.470> splits<00:00:38.430> only<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.090> side<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.720> at

this<00:00:40.020> Junction<00:00:40.500> we're<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.400> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
this Junction we're going to have to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880 
this Junction we're going to have to
actually<00:00:41.670> cut<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.180> pipe<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.770> take<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
actually cut this pipe and take the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:01:01.300 
actually cut this pipe and take the
muffler's<00:00:44.250> out<00:00:44.400> separately

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.310 

our<00:01:02.240> next<00:01:02.420> step<00:01:02.630> is<00:01:02.690> going<00:01:02.840> to<00:01:02.900> be<00:01:02.990> to<00:01:03.140> pull

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
our next step is going to be to pull

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.320 
our next step is going to be to pull
this<00:01:03.440> whole<00:01:03.590> center<00:01:03.950> section<00:01:04.340> out<00:01:04.430> we'll<00:01:05.150> put

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
this whole center section out we'll put

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.320 
this whole center section out we'll put
a<00:01:05.360> pull<00:01:05.600> Jack<00:01:05.870> under<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.230> center<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.970> hold<00:01:08.180> up

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
a pull Jack under the center to hold up

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.480 
a pull Jack under the center to hold up
the<00:01:08.540> exhaust<00:01:09.380> system<00:01:09.800> you<00:01:09.890> get<00:01:10.010> it<00:01:10.160> is<00:01:10.310> pretty

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
the exhaust system you get it is pretty

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.920 
the exhaust system you get it is pretty
heavy<00:01:10.760> for<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.420> newer<00:01:11.750> vehicle<00:01:12.320> like<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:12.500> one

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
heavy for a newer vehicle like this one

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.530 
heavy for a newer vehicle like this one
not<00:01:14.930> everything's<00:01:15.200> all<00:01:15.350> rusted<00:01:15.740> on<00:01:15.830> real<00:01:16.100> bad

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
not everything's all rusted on real bad

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.210 
not everything's all rusted on real bad
if<00:01:17.540> your<00:01:17.690> vehicle's<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.140> little<00:01:18.350> older<00:01:18.650> you<00:01:19.070> may

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
if your vehicle's a little older you may

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.560 
if your vehicle's a little older you may
need<00:01:19.370> to<00:01:19.430> soak<00:01:19.730> it<00:01:19.880> with<00:01:19.910> some<00:01:20.180> penetrating

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
need to soak it with some penetrating

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.000 
need to soak it with some penetrating
oil<00:01:20.720> for<00:01:21.050> a<00:01:21.080> while<00:01:21.260> to<00:01:21.470> get<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:21.740> stuff<00:01:21.950> to

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
oil for a while to get this stuff to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.740 
oil for a while to get this stuff to
come<00:01:22.220> off<00:01:22.400> easier<00:01:25.300> we'll<00:01:26.300> kind<00:01:26.480> of<00:01:26.540> want<00:01:26.690> to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
come off easier we'll kind of want to

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.300 
come off easier we'll kind of want to
orient<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.230> clamps<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.710> way<00:01:27.830> they<00:01:27.980> were<00:01:28.130> from

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
orient the clamps the way they were from

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.400 
orient the clamps the way they were from
the<00:01:28.430> factory<00:01:28.880> they<00:01:29.540> were<00:01:29.600> both<00:01:29.840> pointing<00:01:30.290> out

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
the factory they were both pointing out

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.150 
the factory they were both pointing out
so<00:01:31.250> we'll<00:01:31.400> put<00:01:31.640> them<00:01:31.700> on<00:01:31.850> here<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.420> same<00:01:32.630> way

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
so we'll put them on here the same way

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.500 
so we'll put them on here the same way
cleanse<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.250> lot<00:01:34.400> lighter<00:01:34.640> than<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.970> other<00:01:35.090> one

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.330 

hanger<00:01:38.510> pieces<00:01:38.869> go<00:01:39.020> up<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:40.070> like<00:01:40.190> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
hanger pieces go up just like the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.820 
hanger pieces go up just like the
factory<00:01:40.700> ones<00:01:40.910> did<00:01:41.119> pipe<00:01:41.869> has<00:01:42.080> been<00:01:42.320> stretched

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
factory ones did pipe has been stretched

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.620 
factory ones did pipe has been stretched
at<00:01:43.100> this<00:01:43.250> end<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.790> obviously<00:01:44.150> this<00:01:44.300> is<00:01:44.450> where

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
at this end so obviously this is where

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.480 
at this end so obviously this is where
the<00:01:44.720> clamp<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.170> going<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.380> go<00:01:45.560> not<00:01:46.280> going<00:01:46.400> to

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
the clamp is going to go not going to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.430 
the clamp is going to go not going to
want<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.640> put<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:46.880> on<00:01:46.970> here<00:01:47.180> first<00:01:47.479> I<00:01:47.750> usually

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
want to put it on here first I usually

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.859 
want to put it on here first I usually
like<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.680> orient<00:01:48.950> clamps<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:50.090> where<00:01:50.300> I<00:01:50.630> can

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
like to orient clamps to where I can

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.109 
like to orient clamps to where I can
reach<00:01:51.170> them<00:01:51.380> easily<00:01:51.590> when<00:01:52.460> I'm<00:01:52.580> ready<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:52.970> put

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
reach them easily when I'm ready to put

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:07.350 
reach them easily when I'm ready to put
it<00:01:53.210> all<00:01:53.300> tighten<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.080> all<00:01:54.140> down

to<00:02:13.910> want<00:02:14.060> these<00:02:14.239> pretty<00:02:14.540> much<00:02:14.750> vertical<00:02:15.080> we

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
to want these pretty much vertical we

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.470 
to want these pretty much vertical we
can<00:02:15.950> get<00:02:16.069> our<00:02:16.160> clamps<00:02:16.580> somewhat<00:02:16.940> snug<00:02:17.270> right

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
can get our clamps somewhat snug right

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.120 
can get our clamps somewhat snug right
now<00:02:17.660> leave<00:02:18.140> them<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.319> loose<00:02:18.770> enough<00:02:19.010> to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
now leave them just loose enough to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.100 
now leave them just loose enough to
where<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:19.280> can<00:02:19.430> wiggle<00:02:20.270> something<00:02:20.720> later<00:02:20.900> on
