that ok like I said the beauty in it is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.109

the<00:01:33.630> way<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:34.020> did<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> dark<00:01:34.619> roots<00:01:35.009> ok<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.000> I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the way they did the dark roots ok if I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.880 
the way they did the dark roots ok if I
wanted<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> bring<00:01:36.570> bangs<00:01:36.869> I'd<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> I'd

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
wanted to bring bangs I'd have to I'd

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.399 
wanted to bring bangs I'd have to I'd
have<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.520> flat<00:01:38.880> iron<00:01:38.909> or<00:01:39.299> down<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
have to flat iron or down like this and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.289 
have to flat iron or down like this and
I<00:01:41.369> thought<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.670> we're<00:01:41.820> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.150> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
I thought if we're going to do that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.149 
I thought if we're going to do that
because<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
because if I do to that then the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.340 
because if I do to that then the
darkness<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.790> what<00:01:45.030> they<00:01:45.180> did<00:01:45.420> doesn't<00:01:46.110> show

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
darkness of what they did doesn't show

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.899 
darkness of what they did doesn't show
so<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:48.299> should<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.840> fine<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.909> ok

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so I think should be fine like this ok

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.630 
so I think should be fine like this ok
it's<00:01:51.420> not<00:01:51.540> much<00:01:51.840> volume<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.770> from<00:01:53.100> here
