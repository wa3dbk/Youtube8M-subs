to implement tissue regeneration

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.829 
to implement tissue regeneration
procedures<00:00:02.669> we<00:00:03.419> have<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.689> take<00:00:03.899> several<00:00:04.470> steps

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
procedures we have to take several steps

procedures we have to take several steps
my<00:00:06.839> research<00:00:07.170> starts<00:00:07.620> from<00:00:08.069> getting

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
my research starts from getting

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.430 
my research starts from getting
extracted<00:00:08.940> third<00:00:09.120> molars<00:00:09.450> from<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.110> dental

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
extracted third molars from the dental

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.970 
extracted third molars from the dental
surgery<00:00:10.769> clinic<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.490> take<00:00:12.240> these<00:00:12.420> teeth

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
surgery clinic I take these teeth

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.160 
surgery clinic I take these teeth
disinfect<00:00:13.980> them<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.490> then<00:00:14.759> start<00:00:15.480> isolating

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
disinfect them and then start isolating

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.080 
disinfect them and then start isolating
dental<00:00:16.770> tissue<00:00:16.980> after<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.730> start

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
dental tissue after that I start

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.580 
dental tissue after that I start
culturing<00:00:18.539> these<00:00:18.750> cells<00:00:19.020> put<00:00:19.230> them<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
culturing these cells put them in the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.310 
culturing these cells put them in the
incubator<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.520> usually<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:21.029> takes<00:00:21.180> about<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
incubator it's usually it takes about a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.320 
incubator it's usually it takes about a
week<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:23.310> after<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.760> get<00:00:24.060> really

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
week and then after that I get really

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.820 
week and then after that I get really
tremendous<00:00:24.900> amount<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.230> stem<00:00:25.439> cells<00:00:25.680> they

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
tremendous amount of stem cells they

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.290 
tremendous amount of stem cells they
start<00:00:26.070> growing<00:00:26.400> growing<00:00:26.550> proliferating

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
start growing growing proliferating

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
start growing growing proliferating
whatever<00:00:27.840> media<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.529> grow<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.859> cells

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
whatever media that you grow the cells

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.769 
whatever media that you grow the cells
and<00:00:29.279> they<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.640> differentiate<00:00:29.970> into<00:00:30.570> whatever

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and they can differentiate into whatever

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.830 
and they can differentiate into whatever
cells<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.320> want<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:32.239> take<00:00:33.239> these<00:00:33.450> cells<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
cells you want I take these cells and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.600 
cells you want I take these cells and
isolate<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.649> scaffold<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.280> couple

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
isolate them in a scaffold this couple

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.610 
isolate them in a scaffold this couple
is<00:00:35.730> basically<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> sponge<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> take

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
is basically like a sponge then I take

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.900 
is basically like a sponge then I take

scaffolds in the mine for three months

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.340 
scaffolds in the mine for three months
we<00:01:05.970> take<00:01:06.119> them<00:01:06.299> out<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.080> start

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
we take them out and we start

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.530 
we take them out and we start
decalcifying<00:01:08.040> them<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.939> decals<00:01:09.299> frank

decalcifying them the decals frank

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.940 
decalcifying them the decals frank
solution<00:01:10.020> until<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.590> feel<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.890> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
solution until they feel like a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.160 
solution until they feel like a
cucumbers<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.000> easier<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.600> cut<00:01:12.780> them<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
cucumbers so it's easier to cut them and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.920 
cucumbers so it's easier to cut them and
have<00:01:13.380> slides<00:01:13.909> we<00:01:14.909> start<00:01:15.240> sectioning<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
have slides we start sectioning the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
have slides we start sectioning the
tooth<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.380> view<00:01:16.710> them<00:01:16.890> under<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> microscope

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700

they're supposed to see newly
regenerated<00:01:19.470> tissue<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.780> find<00:01:22.020> out

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
regenerated tissue and if we find out

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.560 
regenerated tissue and if we find out
them<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.830> means<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.430> process<00:01:24.420> was

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
them that means that the process was

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.280 
small part of the two strands that are
lost<00:01:45.009> we<00:01:45.490> can<00:01:45.670> avoid<00:01:46.030> all<00:01:46.299> these<00:01:46.450> traumatic

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
lost we can avoid all these traumatic

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.020 
lost we can avoid all these traumatic
indignation<00:01:47.770> procedures<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:48.640> that's<00:01:48.850> just

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
indignation procedures so that's just

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.719 
indignation procedures so that's just
for<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.390> dental<00:01:49.780> part<00:01:50.439> of<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.770> benefit<00:01:51.520> we

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
for the dental part of the benefit we

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.700 
for the dental part of the benefit we
can<00:01:51.909> actually<00:01:52.060> turn<00:01:52.420> dental<00:01:52.869> stem<00:01:53.049> cells<00:01:53.320> into

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
can actually turn dental stem cells into

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.920 
can actually turn dental stem cells into
mural<00:01:54.070> cells<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.549> bone<00:01:54.970> tissue<00:01:55.270> there's<00:01:55.840> a
