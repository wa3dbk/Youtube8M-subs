tile that is the center time so
everything<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.559> gonna<00:01:04.769> base<00:01:05.040> off<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
everything is gonna base off of this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.420 
everything is gonna base off of this
Center<00:01:05.970> tile<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.990> need<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.290> match<00:01:07.500> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
Center tile so you need to match that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
to that frog there and it's gonna be the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.330 
to that frog there and it's gonna be the
bottom<00:01:18.600> half<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.320> frog<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.220> gonna
