00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.200
 the chosen one 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.189
 hello I propose today to see you disappear 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.089
 so it's a stunt that takes the base of the fomc should hardly be to 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.329
 know that we can very well use it for English or sliding what we 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.599
 interests today but also for the bonhomie azoumana fishing 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.800
 predatory or vivid in e with a sliding float 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.260
 so for no one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.930
 we will just take a point of Lyon in vain 22 hundredths 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.360
 then a strand of 20 centimeters is largely sufficient 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.700
 we will come to parallel 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.540
 so our mid-term arm to 22 hundredths with our body of lyne 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.309
 and we will realized with the little dragon for a hundredth 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.620
 a loop that sleeps in prison and the body of lyne 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.150
 on the agenda and tell it my little buckle yield taken on behalf of 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.610
 insurers the body of lyne like these 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.230
 so we found with afp 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.590
 a loop in prison in the line body and a piece of nyon that exceeds 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.880
 then it will be enough now to do with this little bit of nylon 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.650
 towers that imprisons and another loop 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.750
 and percent the line record so we'll do that six or seven times 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.560
 so I take my arm 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.480
 I do not want that around the line body and I go inside the loop 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.320
 like these 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.460
 so I do that we have six or seven times I shiver t 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.840
 the line body and the little brown level actually makes 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.970
 so here I did six or seven rounds 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.830
 so once we've done these six or seven laps we're actually going to 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.880
 find 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.550
 with a share of one million 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.660
 that's fine i would say the torso ardeurs around the loop and it's going 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.730
 then simply grab the two nylon arms in twenty 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.950
 hundredths 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.509
 after mystifying the dominance and pulling to squeeze so our backs 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.519
 stop 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.719
 then we identify others from stop 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:18.109
 and so our finalize them so for the rest still a very small 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.759
 on-board operation of course we will not leave 200 th the two books 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.609
 over with such a length 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.169
 so we'll take a chisel and we'll cut his rights so I'll call you back 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.159
 that it is important not to cut one's arms 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.649
 valdano stop to arm to leave to the works 2 see 3 centimeters 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.290
 in excess so that the password more easily in the 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.669
 rings 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.979
 this is how 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:50.109
 and so we had to finalize when it's a really pity tool between 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.079
 very well 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.029
 however, if you wish to advise, do you always provide yourself with 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.009
 refer to fishing an indelible marker 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:01.699
 knowing how long a little indelible marker on a darling f 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:06.469
 nokia reader is like a collage of big charges of the loan 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.779
 of the marker in the spirit of union 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.439
 so that will not stop you from moving your baby 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.669
 will get a harder sliding and therefore accidental displacements 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.289
 which are much less common 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.179
 here I wish you good fishing English to the sliding and I 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:21.629
 tell you see you soon
