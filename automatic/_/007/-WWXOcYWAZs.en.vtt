00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.960
 so it is very cold to have a skill 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.429
 and that skill is 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.859
 how the king in the old coordinate system 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.249
 almost all so far caste system steinraht over.and corina tunnel system 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.890
 that doorman nicely 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 but of course you first have to know how to draw a system 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.460
 at both buses we can all have these wise leaves I am you 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.240
 or not 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.630
 10 13 know more 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.420
 it is not for nothing that list is on it 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.050
 so you also have to see it draw across the line 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.860
 I think as a system as the first 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.770
 the vertical if that is 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.770
 from above 9 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.000
 over a line 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.480
 and after that 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.130
 the king the horizontal axis 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.130
 that is, from left to right 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.380
 regards China at that time 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.800
 you get that as a system you have to finish as a city of good 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200
 snack bars 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.210
 vanderpoorten pay and the vertical as Noordwijk the origin 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.700
 could comment on that 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 we are all small speakers 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.910
 every centimeter 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.880
 on the lines 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.580
 from rosenthal as 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.010
 the do so too 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.010
 at the vertical axis 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.740
 At that time we are going to get the numbers and moves 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.540
 o 2 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.030
 and I have them up to 8 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.520
 and so do it 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.520
 and Kalas is fighting that last potter 7 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.410
 safety continues by signing the postelse 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.860
 that reports are negative pay 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.900
 especially system with a positive tone on by hijacking his father I agree 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.159
 watch some dozens 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.159
 the vertical as 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.969
 this way 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.969
 rosenthal as 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.309
 well we set points 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.599
 small speakers 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.559
 all guests 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.409
 neat on the square 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.509
 also sit out for years 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.389
 the pink points plan 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.299
 our feeling is still the intersection of the new ox and does not have 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.919
 can if 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.919
 still the most 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.999
 5 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.999
 upwards is also positive 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.879
 out of 4 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.379
 and now we have to take it to the left 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.029
 and to the left you can benefit yourself 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.469
 after a negative dozens 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.849
 0 immediately people know interim 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.019
 take 4 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.829
 down from the origin 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.609
 is also negative 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.029
 3 2 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.229
 3 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.869
 this way 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.969
 you must therefore draw the appropriate system 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.089
 this the end of the skill as the if they sting
