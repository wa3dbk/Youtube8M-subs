it's going to take that same 217 brush I

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.970 
it's going to take that same 217 brush I
was<00:02:55.790> using<00:02:56.150> for<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.540> crease<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.109> without<00:02:57.769> any

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
was using for the crease and without any

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.559 
was using for the crease and without any
extra<00:02:58.310> product<00:02:58.730> I'm<00:02:58.909> just<00:02:59.090> going<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.329> start

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
extra product I'm just going to start

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.869 
extra product I'm just going to start
slowly<00:02:59.840> blending<00:03:00.349> it<00:03:00.469> up<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.829> with<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.670> black

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
slowly blending it up and with it black

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.819 
slowly blending it up and with it black
like<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.299> because<00:03:02.810> it's<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:03.260> creamy<00:03:03.590> you

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
like this because it's so creamy you

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.170 
like this because it's so creamy you
want<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.040> be<00:03:04.129> careful<00:03:04.400> with<00:03:04.609> your<00:03:04.730> blending

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
want to be careful with your blending

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.380 
want to be careful with your blending
because<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:06.409> will<00:03:06.920> start<00:03:07.219> to<00:03:07.310> creep<00:03:07.670> up<00:03:07.849> really

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
because it will start to creep up really

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.509 
because it will start to creep up really
really<00:03:08.569> high<00:03:08.689> into<00:03:09.140> your<00:03:09.290> crease<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.920> that's

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
really high into your crease and that's

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:23.170 
really high into your crease and that's
when<00:03:10.849> things<00:03:11.090> get<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.780> little<00:03:12.079> crazy<00:03:22.030> I'm<00:03:23.030> just

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
when things get a little crazy I'm just

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.780 
when things get a little crazy I'm just
going<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.359> dip<00:03:23.629> that<00:03:23.810> brush<00:03:24.079> back<00:03:24.829> into<00:03:25.459> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
going to dip that brush back into the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.879 
going to dip that brush back into the
reddish<00:03:26.150> color<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.780> do<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.439> exact<00:03:27.859> same

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
reddish color and do the exact same

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:38.679 
reddish color and do the exact same
thing<00:03:36.669> one<00:03:37.669> thing<00:03:37.879> to<00:03:38.090> like<00:03:38.359> when<00:03:38.540> I'm

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:38.689 
thing one thing to like when I'm

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.909 
thing one thing to like when I'm
blending<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.530> when<00:03:39.829> I<00:03:40.280> have<00:03:40.609> my<00:03:41.180> eye<00:03:41.709> my<00:03:42.709> head

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
blending and when I have my eye my head

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.920 
blending and when I have my eye my head
kind<00:03:43.159> of<00:03:43.250> tilted<00:03:43.639> back<00:03:43.819> I<00:03:44.090> could<00:03:44.239> see<00:03:44.480> like<00:03:44.720> how

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
kind of tilted back I could see like how

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.399 
kind of tilted back I could see like how
high<00:03:45.139> I'm<00:03:45.319> actually<00:03:45.500> taking<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.700> black<00:03:47.409> but

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
high I'm actually taking the black but

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.860 
high I'm actually taking the black but
when<00:03:48.919> I<00:03:48.950> have<00:03:49.220> my<00:03:49.370> eye<00:03:49.400> open<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.389> you

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
when I have my eye open like this you

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.110 
when I have my eye open like this you
can't<00:03:51.169> really<00:03:51.409> see<00:03:51.799> it<00:03:51.889> so<00:03:52.099> what<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.819> want<00:03:53.060> to

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
can't really see it so what you want to

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.360 
can't really see it so what you want to
do<00:03:53.329> is<00:03:53.599> just<00:03:53.810> kind<00:03:54.049> of<00:03:54.139> make<00:03:54.319> sure<00:03:54.349> you<00:03:55.129> have

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
do is just kind of make sure you have

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.219 
do is just kind of make sure you have
the<00:03:55.639> black<00:03:55.849> high<00:03:56.090> enough<00:03:56.359> because<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:56.900> is<00:03:57.049> a

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:57.229 
the black high enough because it is a

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:58.659 
the black high enough because it is a
little<00:03:57.590> bit<00:03:57.680> hard<00:03:57.889> once<00:03:58.159> you<00:03:58.310> have<00:03:58.489> everything

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
little bit hard once you have everything

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.520 
little bit hard once you have everything
nice<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.150> blended<00:03:59.449> the<00:03:59.750> way<00:03:59.870> you<00:03:59.930> want<00:04:00.229> to

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
nice and blended the way you want to

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.069 
nice and blended the way you want to
move<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.699> black<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:01.970> little<00:04:02.269> higher<00:04:02.540> up<00:04:02.810> so

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
move the black a little higher up so

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.250 
move the black a little higher up so
just<00:04:03.650> go<00:04:03.769> like<00:04:03.919> this<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:04.579> just<00:04:05.299> kind<00:04:05.599> of<00:04:05.900> start

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
just go like this and just kind of start

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.920 
just go like this and just kind of start
blending<00:04:06.829> a<00:04:07.430> little<00:04:08.000> bit<00:04:08.120> more<00:04:08.329> of<00:04:08.449> that<00:04:08.659> black

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
blending a little bit more of that black

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:23.220 
blending a little bit more of that black
a<00:04:09.229> little<00:04:09.650> higher<00:04:09.829> up

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.450 

okay<00:04:23.980> so<00:04:24.040> I<00:04:24.220> went<00:04:24.520> ahead<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.820> just<00:04:26.340> cleaned<00:04:27.340> up

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
okay so I went ahead and just cleaned up

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.040 
okay so I went ahead and just cleaned up
some<00:04:27.670> of<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:27.910> fallout<00:04:28.150> because<00:04:28.420> there<00:04:28.810> is

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
some of the fallout because there is

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.340 
some of the fallout because there is
extreme<00:04:29.920> fallout<00:04:30.910> using<00:04:31.630> black<00:04:31.960> what<00:04:32.260> I'm

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
extreme fallout using black what I'm

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.500 
extreme fallout using black what I'm
going<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.620> do<00:04:32.800> is<00:04:33.010> try<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.370> highlight<00:04:34.210> the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
going to do is try to highlight the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.330 
going to do is try to highlight the
inner<00:04:34.690> corner<00:04:35.110> as<00:04:35.260> best<00:04:35.530> as<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:35.770> can

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
inner corner as best as I can

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.660 
inner corner as best as I can
with<00:04:36.790> such<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.030> dark<00:04:37.330> look<00:04:37.570> like<00:04:37.780> this

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
with such a dark look like this

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.710 
with such a dark look like this
highlighting<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.790> inner<00:04:39.940> corner<00:04:40.420> really

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
highlighting the inner corner really

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.650 
highlighting the inner corner really
really<00:04:41.260> I<00:04:42.100> think<00:04:42.460> pulls<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.060> together<00:04:43.210> because

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
really I think pulls it together because

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.810 
really I think pulls it together because
there's<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.290> much<00:04:44.440> black<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.070> darkness<00:04:45.520> going

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
there's so much black and darkness going

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.520 
there's so much black and darkness going
on<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.180> don't<00:04:46.390> want<00:04:46.660> your<00:04:46.810> eyes<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.230> kind<00:04:47.440> of

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
on you don't want your eyes to kind of

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.370 
on you don't want your eyes to kind of
get<00:04:47.650> lost<00:04:47.860> with<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.400> black<00:04:48.700> eye<00:04:48.730> shadow<00:04:49.180> now<00:04:49.450> I'm
