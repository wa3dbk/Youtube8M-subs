issues<00:00:12.650> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.830> pretty<00:00:14.009> close<00:00:14.280> they've<00:00:14.820> got

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
issues this is pretty close they've got

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.179 
issues this is pretty close they've got
a<00:00:15.000> gap<00:00:15.240> down<00:00:15.509> here<00:00:18.439> as<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.560> can<00:00:19.740> see<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.039> uh

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
a gap down here as you can see it uh

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.090 
a gap down here as you can see it uh
it's<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.119> little<00:00:21.359> loose<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:22.439> uh

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
it's a little loose but uh

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.980 
it's a little loose but uh
pressing<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.180> really<00:00:24.480> isn't<00:00:24.720> going<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
pressing it in really isn't going to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:34.490 
pressing it in really isn't going to
solve<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:28.130> now<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.580> other<00:00:29.760> side<00:00:33.500> pretty

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
solve it now on the other side pretty

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.310 
solve it now on the other side pretty
much<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> same<00:00:35.010> deal<00:00:35.690> with<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> exception<00:00:37.230> at

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
much the same deal with the exception at

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.030 
much the same deal with the exception at
the<00:00:37.440> top<00:00:38.899> it<00:00:39.899> might<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.200> hard<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> see<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:40.980> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the top it might be hard to see but I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.319 
the top it might be hard to see but I
got<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> gap<00:00:41.579> right<00:00:41.610> here

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
got a gap right here

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
right about here which time I'm sure

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.970 
right about here which time I'm sure
it's<00:00:48.989> not<00:00:49.079> gonna<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.350> covered<00:00:49.649> under<00:00:49.829> warranty

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
it's not gonna be covered under warranty

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.639 
it's not gonna be covered under warranty
or<00:00:50.460> replacement<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.870> did<00:00:52.079> crack<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.530> by

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
or replacement but I did crack it by

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.540 
or replacement but I did crack it by
pushing<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.930> this<00:00:54.930> side<00:00:55.219> fits<00:00:56.219> pretty<00:00:56.399> good

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
pushing it in this side fits pretty good

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729 
pushing it in this side fits pretty good
with<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> exception<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> top<00:00:57.780> I'm<00:00:58.680> not
