now<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> hip<00:01:17.369> resurfacing<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> show

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
now have a hip resurfacing can you show

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.480 
now have a hip resurfacing can you show
us<00:01:18.570> how<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> works<00:01:19.140> well<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.310> hip

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
us how that works well in a hip

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.370 
us how that works well in a hip
resurfacing<00:01:20.790> what<00:01:21.420> happens<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.170> don't

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
resurfacing what happens is you don't

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.859 
resurfacing what happens is you don't
actually<00:01:22.590> cut<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.189> neck<00:01:23.880> anymore<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.570> you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
actually cut the neck anymore and you

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.539 
actually cut the neck anymore and you
actually<00:01:25.049> preserve<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.920> much<00:01:26.130> amount<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
actually preserve this much amount of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.780 
actually preserve this much amount of
bone<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.000> all<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.630> do<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.430> resurface<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.579> just

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
bone and all you do is resurface or just

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.260 
bone and all you do is resurface or just
reshape<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.259> head<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.460> put<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
reshape the head and then you put you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.660 
reshape the head and then you put you
put<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.509> cap<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> metal<00:01:34.350> cap<00:01:34.619> into<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.640> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
put a cap a metal cap into it with a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.530 
put a cap a metal cap into it with a
much<00:01:35.909> much<00:01:36.180> smaller<00:01:36.900> pin<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.590> compared<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
much much smaller pin as compared to the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.330 
much much smaller pin as compared to the
big<00:01:40.259> pin<00:01:40.530> which<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.009> your<00:01:41.189> traditional

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
big pin which you have your traditional

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.050 
big pin which you have your traditional
hip<00:01:41.729> replacement<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.950> capping<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.759> just

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
hip replacement and that capping is just

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.789 
hip replacement and that capping is just
like<00:01:45.210> putting<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.659> metal<00:01:46.020> crown<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.439> your<00:01:46.560> teeth

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.679 
like putting a metal crown on your teeth
and<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.610> forms<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.320> resurfacing<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
and that forms the resurfacing on the

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.170 
and that forms the resurfacing on the
deep<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.869> bone<00:01:52.170> side<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.520> shell<00:01:53.939> side

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
deep I bone side and on the shell side

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.600 
deep I bone side and on the shell side
you<00:01:54.420> have<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> solid<00:01:54.990> metal<00:01:55.439> shell<00:01:55.680> which<00:01:55.950> goes

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you have a solid metal shell which goes

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.399 
you have a solid metal shell which goes
in<00:01:56.790> together<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.960> forms<00:01:58.290> your

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
in together and that forms your

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.120 
in together and that forms your
resurfacing<00:01:59.070> so<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.930> biggest<00:02:01.170> advantages<00:02:01.890> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
resurfacing so the biggest advantages is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
resurfacing so the biggest advantages is
the<00:02:02.460> bone<00:02:02.850> preservation<00:02:03.420> why<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:03.990> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the bone preservation why is it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.630 
the bone preservation why is it
important<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> preserve<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.979> natural<00:02:05.460> bone

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
important to preserve a natural bone

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.760 
important to preserve a natural bone
well<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> natural<00:02:07.170> hip<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> as<00:02:07.680> an

with time it has to be redone and it has

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.900 
with time it has to be redone and it has
been<00:02:17.930> shown<00:02:17.990> in<00:02:18.260> studies<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:19.100> if<00:02:19.370> somebody

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
been shown in studies that if somebody

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.730 
been shown in studies that if somebody
who's<00:02:20.180> fifty<00:02:20.480> five<00:02:20.720> fifty<00:02:21.020> years<00:02:21.320> of<00:02:21.440> age<00:02:21.590> and

who's fifty five fifty years of age and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.830 
who's fifty five fifty years of age and
they<00:02:22.460> have<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> traditional<00:02:23.090> hip<00:02:23.240> replacement

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
they have a traditional hip replacement

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.660 
they have a traditional hip replacement
actually<00:02:24.260> there<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:24.800> chance<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.460> ten

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
actually there is a chance that in ten

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.970 
actually there is a chance that in ten
years<00:02:25.700> time<00:02:25.970> ten<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.110> fifteen<00:02:27.470> percent<00:02:27.770> of

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
years time ten to fifteen percent of

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.650 
years time ten to fifteen percent of
them<00:02:28.160> would<00:02:28.520> have<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.910> be<00:02:29.000> redone<00:02:29.030> because

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
them would have to be redone because

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.340 
them would have to be redone because
they<00:02:29.990> failed<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.350> too<00:02:30.470> many<00:02:30.800> reasons<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:32.350> in

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
they failed you too many reasons and in

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.860 
they failed you too many reasons and in
a<00:02:33.610> traditional<00:02:34.610> hip<00:02:34.730> replacement<00:02:35.270> you

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
a traditional hip replacement you

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.360 
a traditional hip replacement you
already<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.320> lost<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.830> head<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.190> neck

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
already have lost the head of the neck

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.280 
already have lost the head of the neck
so<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.000> lost<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.480> bone<00:02:38.690> hence<00:02:38.960> as<00:02:39.110> much

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
so you lost the bone hence as much

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.170 
so you lost the bone hence as much
there's<00:02:39.740> very<00:02:39.980> less<00:02:40.190> much<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.820> very<00:02:41.000> less

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
there's very less much the very less

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.600 
there's very less much the very less
bone<00:02:41.540> left<00:02:42.230> in<00:02:42.440> order<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.740> play<00:02:42.890> around<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.460> put

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
bone left in order to play around to put

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.160 
bone left in order to play around to put
the<00:02:43.700> bigger<00:02:43.880> prosthesis<00:02:44.270> in<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:44.990> hip

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
the bigger prosthesis in a hip

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.110 
the bigger prosthesis in a hip
resurfacing<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:46.250> still<00:02:46.520> have<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.790> head<00:02:46.940> and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
resurfacing you still have the head and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.150 
resurfacing you still have the head and
neck<00:02:47.240> preserved<00:02:47.720> hence<00:02:48.380> if<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.800> was<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.070> be

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
neck preserved hence if it was to be

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.250 
neck preserved hence if it was to be
revised<00:02:49.490> 10<00:02:49.820> 15<00:02:50.180> 20<00:02:50.420> years<00:02:50.540> down<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.930> line<00:02:50.960> you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
revised 10 15 20 years down the line you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.940 
revised 10 15 20 years down the line you
still<00:02:51.500> have<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.800> natural<00:02:52.430> bone<00:02:52.910> there<00:02:53.330> and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
still have the natural bone there and

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.230 
still have the natural bone there and
theoretically<00:02:54.950> can<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:55.520> take<00:02:55.730> away<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
theoretically can just take away the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.000 
theoretically can just take away the
head<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.570> neck<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.960> convert<00:02:57.350> that<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.980> a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
head in the neck and convert that to a

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.040 
head in the neck and convert that to a
total<00:02:58.340> hip<00:02:58.460> replacement<00:02:59.000> interesting<00:02:59.780> so

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
total hip replacement interesting so

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.780 
total hip replacement interesting so
actually<00:03:00.530> longer<00:03:00.770> lasting<00:03:01.310> results

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
actually longer lasting results

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.150 
actually longer lasting results
especially<00:03:01.940> yeah<00:03:02.690> what<00:03:03.140> patients<00:03:03.770> that<00:03:03.950> might

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
especially yeah what patients that might

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.950 
especially yeah what patients that might
want<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.400> have<00:03:04.490> this<00:03:04.700> done<00:03:05.000> anyone<00:03:05.600> who<00:03:05.750> needs

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
want to have this done anyone who needs

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.360 
want to have this done anyone who needs
a<00:03:06.020> hip<00:03:06.140> replacement<00:03:06.260> but<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.100> could<00:03:07.220> be<00:03:07.340> a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
a hip replacement but it could be a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.550 
a hip replacement but it could be a
fairly<00:03:07.610> Universal<00:03:08.060> procedure<00:03:08.420> but<00:03:08.960> there<00:03:09.530> are

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
fairly Universal procedure but there are

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.560 
fairly Universal procedure but there are
certain<00:03:09.920> limitations<00:03:10.280> in<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:10.940> sense<00:03:11.210> person

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
certain limitations in the sense person

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.500 
certain limitations in the sense person
who<00:03:11.660> have<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.730> weaker<00:03:13.730> bone<00:03:13.970> quality<00:03:14.209> or

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
doesn't sustain as a metal implants so

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.120 
doesn't sustain as a metal implants so
certainly<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.450> word<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.720> caution<00:03:20.750> there<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.470> we

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
certainly a word of caution there and we

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.540 
certainly a word of caution there and we
try<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.400> put<00:03:23.060> in<00:03:23.180> people<00:03:23.480> who<00:03:23.570> are<00:03:23.600> 65<00:03:23.930> and

good bone quality very active lifestyle
and<00:03:32.930> athletic<00:03:33.410> then<00:03:33.770> suddenly<00:03:34.070> this<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.370> an

and athletic then suddenly this is an

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.370 
and athletic then suddenly this is an
option<00:03:34.820> for<00:03:35.030> them<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.480> we<00:03:35.959> tend<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.200> also

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
option for them and we tend to also

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.790 
option for them and we tend to also
avoid<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:36.980> people<00:03:37.340> who<00:03:37.520> have<00:03:37.550> a<00:03:38.150> kidney

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
avoid in people who have a kidney

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.920 
avoid in people who have a kidney
function<00:03:39.800> failure<00:03:40.640> or<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:40.880> potential<00:03:41.330> for

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
function failure or a potential for

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.390 
function failure or a potential for
kidney<00:03:42.230> problems<00:03:42.620> like<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:42.920> diabetics

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
kidney problems like in diabetics

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.970 
kidney problems like in diabetics
because<00:03:43.790> this<00:03:44.780> actually<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.500> metal<00:03:45.890> and

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
because this actually is a metal and

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.890 
because this actually is a metal and
metal<00:03:46.310> bearing<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.850> generates<00:03:47.239> metal<00:03:47.570> ions

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
metal bearing it generates metal ions

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.570 
metal bearing it generates metal ions
which<00:03:48.260> has<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.590> be<00:03:48.620> filtered<00:03:49.010> by<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.160> kidney

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
which has to be filtered by the kidney

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.190 
which has to be filtered by the kidney
so<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.060> kidneys<00:03:50.360> are<00:03:50.510> not<00:03:50.540> working<00:03:50.630> probably

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
so the kidneys are not working probably

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.500 
so the kidneys are not working probably
properly<00:03:52.190> then<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.459> metal<00:03:52.730> ions<00:03:52.970> can<00:03:53.180> build

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
properly then the metal ions can build

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
eight weeks not really there's not much

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.949 
eight weeks not really there's not much
of<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.640> difference<00:04:01.970> in<00:04:02.090> terms<00:04:02.269> of<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.480> recovery

of a difference in terms of the recovery

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.500

but<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.010> real<00:04:04.310> difference<00:04:04.670> is<00:04:05.060> after<00:04:05.330> three

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
but the real difference is after three

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.330

the<00:05:54.000> United<00:05:54.330> States<00:05:54.390> who<00:05:54.780> are<00:05:54.810> doing<00:05:55.050> it<00:05:55.200> but

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
the United States who are doing it but

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.750 
the United States who are doing it but
suddenly<00:05:55.860> that<00:05:56.130> number<00:05:56.400> has<00:05:56.520> been<00:05:56.550> increasing

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
suddenly that number has been increasing

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.400 
suddenly that number has been increasing
over<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.390> last<00:05:57.450> few<00:05:57.720> months<00:05:57.870> why<00:05:58.200> do<00:05:58.260> you

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
over the last few months why do you

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.660 
over the last few months why do you
think<00:05:58.470> that<00:05:58.590> is<00:05:58.830> is<00:05:58.980> it<00:05:59.010> takes<00:05:59.310> special

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
think that is is it takes special

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.920 
think that is is it takes special
training<00:06:00.090> for<00:06:00.300> someone<00:06:00.540> to<00:06:00.630> like<00:06:00.780> yourself

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
training for someone to like yourself

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.740 
training for someone to like yourself
yes<00:06:01.350> it<00:06:01.500> is<00:06:01.590> a<00:06:01.650> technically<00:06:02.130> a<00:06:02.450> very<00:06:03.450> demanding

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
yes it is a technically a very demanding

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.470 
yes it is a technically a very demanding
operation<00:06:04.470> and<00:06:04.650> it's<00:06:05.190> completely<00:06:05.940> different

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
operation and it's completely different

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.050 
operation and it's completely different
traditional<00:06:06.870> hip<00:06:07.020> replacement<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:08.490> because

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
traditional hip replacement and because

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.910

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
it's technically demanding one has to

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.040 
it's technically demanding one has to
have<00:06:11.070> special<00:06:11.580> training<00:06:11.760> and<00:06:12.180> expertise<00:06:12.900> in
