ready to go with my remote so we have an

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.710 
ready to go with my remote so we have an
easy<00:00:22.529> example<00:00:22.920> here<00:00:23.730> maybe<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.570> an

separately there's other connections a
ways<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.210> we're<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.600> show

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
ways to do this but we're going to show

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.540 
ways to do this but we're going to show
you<00:00:36.809> how<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.079> set<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> simple

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
you how to set it up so we have a simple

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.100 
you how to set it up so we have a simple
connection<00:00:39.030> we're<00:00:39.450> good<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.780> go

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
connection we're good to go

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.740 
connection we're good to go
if<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> iOS<00:00:41.370> 7<00:00:42.059> device<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.570> could

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
if I have a iOS 7 device I could

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.299 
if I have a iOS 7 device I could
actually<00:00:42.930> pair<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.590> bluetooth<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
actually pair it up with bluetooth and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.029 
actually pair it up with bluetooth and
do<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> whole<00:00:44.940> setup<00:00:45.180> right<00:00:45.420> from<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.690> device

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
do the whole setup right from my device

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.900 
do the whole setup right from my device
try<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.340> want<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.520> give<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> shot

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
try it if you want to give it a shot

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
try it if you want to give it a shot
it's<00:00:48.120> easier<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> type<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.050> those<00:00:49.200> devices

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
it's easier to type on those devices

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.619 
it's easier to type on those devices
then<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.460> are<00:00:50.489> about<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.180> using<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
then what we are about to see using the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.479 
then what we are about to see using the
remote<00:00:51.840> control<00:00:52.010> also<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> got<00:00:53.460> a

Bluetooth<00:00:53.820> keyboard<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.300> tells<00:00:54.480> us<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
Bluetooth keyboard it tells us on the

Bluetooth keyboard it tells us on the
home<00:00:54.899> screen<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:56.340> pair<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.610> your

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
home screen right here to pair up your

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.979 
home screen right here to pair up your
Bluetooth<00:00:56.879> keyboards<00:00:57.480> turn<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.870> that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
Bluetooth keyboards turn on that

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.450 
Bluetooth keyboards turn on that
Bluetooth<00:00:58.320> keyboard<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.890> then<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.370> going

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
Bluetooth keyboard and then it's going

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.130 
Bluetooth keyboard and then it's going

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
you're going to be able to type on that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.340 
you're going to be able to type on that
instead<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.300> what<00:01:03.570> you're<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:04.140> so

I'm going to choose English and by the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.990 
I'm going to choose English and by the
way<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.170> infrared<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.040> needs<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
way this is infrared it needs to see the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
way this is infrared it needs to see the
front<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.330> my<00:01:09.450> Apple<00:01:09.750> TV<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.799> Apple<00:01:11.010> TV

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
