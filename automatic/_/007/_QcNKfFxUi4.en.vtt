rebound being too slow

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.479

yeah<00:00:54.149> because<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.570> tear<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.020> small<00:00:55.489> gets

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
yeah because the tear is small gets

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.319 
yeah because the tear is small gets
wider<00:00:56.820> gets<00:00:57.600> wider<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.199> deeper<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> rebounds

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
wider gets wider and deeper so rebounds

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:10.039
