you're<00:00:23.249> not<00:00:23.339> familiar<00:00:23.399> with<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.089> just

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
you're not familiar with it you just

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.989 
you're not familiar with it you just
plug<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.839> turntables<00:00:25.439> into<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.979> and<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:26.999 
plug the turntables into this and the

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.299 
plug the turntables into this and the
computer<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.419> read<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.079> you<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:29.130> tell

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:29.309 
computer can read it and you can tell

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:30.859 
computer can read it and you can tell
you<00:00:29.519> could<00:00:29.669> still<00:00:29.880> scratch<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.539> all<00:00:30.689> this

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
you could still scratch and do all this

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.020 
you could still scratch and do all this
gas<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:32.660> scratch<00:00:33.949> because<00:00:34.949> it<00:00:35.100> reads<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
gas and scratch because it reads the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.180 
gas and scratch because it reads the
record<00:00:36.329> reads<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> music<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.859> could<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.070> it
