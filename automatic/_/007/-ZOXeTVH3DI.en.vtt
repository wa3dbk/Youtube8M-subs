00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.710
 developer company monolith invest 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.610
 used in the apple tree system 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.770
 monolith-brick house buildings in 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.899
 such houses are not warmly heard neighbors and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.730
 they look beautiful the first four 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.710
 skyscrapers are dressed in brick as 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.629
 facades for the remaining houses selected 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.039
 porcelain tiles here are the designers and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.120
 designers come up so that 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.670
 show that we really and apple 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.100
 multicolor garden 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.409
 can danced pay attention so 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.119
 an abstraction I would have interior decoration 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.490
 builders also paid much attention 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.290
 saying did so to newcomers not 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.540
 I wanted to redo anything 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.200
 as usual builders hurt when 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.149
 people stop by then watch around 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.979
 the entrance 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.549
 shot heaters shot site 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.049
 sanitary ware wallpaper 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.970
 so we decided to do everything so that 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.310
 man clean everything is comfortable and no longer 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.500
 I was thinking about repairing the monolith seats 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.720
 uses vinyl laminated wallpaper 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.220

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.580
 monolith professionalism difficult 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.100
 doubt I think the company is 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.659
 she has worked her reputation for years and 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.049
 accordingly what bones say and I 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.720
 the planet is probably such a new accent 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.709

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.500

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.989
 from an engineering point of view I was 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.940
 it is interesting that the column is installed 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.670
 immediately on several floors 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.890

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.600
 stages we from them kolomak it is interesting with 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.459
