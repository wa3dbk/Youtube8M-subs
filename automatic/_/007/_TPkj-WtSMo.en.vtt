00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
a sauce I saw this one I thought it's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.120 
a sauce I saw this one I thought it's
going<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.570> see-through<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:58.800> won't<00:02:58.980> be<00:02:59.100> that

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
going to be see-through it won't be that

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.110 
going to be see-through it won't be that
great<00:02:59.400> but<00:03:00.239> it's<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.019> nice<00:03:01.200> it's<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.560> soft

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
great but it's so nice it's so soft

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.610 
great but it's so nice it's so soft
especially<00:03:03.120> for<00:03:03.209> Primark<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.959> it's<00:03:04.410> only

especially for Primark and it's only
three<00:03:04.980> pounds<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.790> i<00:03:05.820> think<00:03:05.910> i<00:03:06.120> might<00:03:06.269> have<00:03:06.330> to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
three pounds so i think i might have to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.000 
three pounds so i think i might have to
go<00:03:06.600> back<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.930> get<00:03:07.050> some<00:03:07.110> other<00:03:07.560> colors<00:03:07.920> at

up<00:03:34.960> quite<00:03:35.500> small<00:03:36.040> I've<00:03:36.370> got<00:03:37.150> them<00:03:37.330> in<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.510> size

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
up quite small I've got them in a size

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.830 
up quite small I've got them in a size
12<00:03:38.140> I'm<00:03:38.500> sort<00:03:39.100> of<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.250> size<00:03:39.430> 10<00:03:39.760> on<00:03:39.910> top<00:03:40.150> but<00:03:40.720> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
12 I'm sort of a size 10 on top but the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.050 
12 I'm sort of a size 10 on top but the
10th<00:03:41.110> I<00:03:41.230> tried<00:03:41.440> on<00:03:41.590> was<00:03:41.740> really<00:03:41.890> tight<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:42.580> think

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
10th I tried on was really tight I think

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.400 
10th I tried on was really tight I think
it's<00:03:43.180> quite<00:03:43.330> nice<00:03:43.569> for<00:03:43.630> them<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.050> just<00:03:44.080> be<00:03:44.380> a

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
it's quite nice for them to just be a

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.550 
it's quite nice for them to just be a
little<00:03:44.560> bit<00:03:44.890> looser<00:03:45.069> and<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:47.290> white<00:03:47.530> is

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
little bit looser and the white is

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.960 
little bit looser and the white is
slightly<00:03:48.069> bit<00:03:48.280> see-through<00:03:48.459> but<00:03:48.700> I<00:03:48.790> think

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
slightly bit see-through but I think

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.090 
slightly bit see-through but I think
with<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.120> sort<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.390> t-shirt<00:03:49.840> bra<00:03:50.110> that<00:03:50.800> will<00:03:50.920> be

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
with a sort of t-shirt bra that will be

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.880 
with a sort of t-shirt bra that will be
all<00:03:51.670> right<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.150> yeah<00:03:53.050> these<00:03:53.260> are<00:03:53.320> just<00:03:53.680> be

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
all right and yeah these are just be

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.560 
all right and yeah these are just be
