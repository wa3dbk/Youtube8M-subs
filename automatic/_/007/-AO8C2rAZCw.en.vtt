00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
flashcards and definitions I don't know

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.410 
flashcards and definitions I don't know
I<00:03:37.500> put<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.160> pile<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.760> definitions<00:03:39.300> I

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
I put in one pile and definitions I

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.479 
I put in one pile and definitions I
dunno<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.870> put<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:40.380> another<00:03:40.650> pile<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.340> really

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
dunno I put in another pile so it really

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.160 
dunno I put in another pile so it really
helps<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:41.940> study<00:03:42.150> any<00:03:42.690> things<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.050> I

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
helps to study any things that I

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.990 
helps to study any things that I
actually<00:03:43.410> don't<00:03:44.070> know

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.760 

sex<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.120> what<00:03:48.150> we<00:03:48.420> do<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.990> also<00:03:49.440> love

sex is what we do I also love
highlighting<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.520> know<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:50.910> not

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
highlighting I know this is not

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.580 
highlighting I know this is not
everyone's<00:03:51.450> preferences<00:03:51.990> but<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.230> love<00:03:52.470> to

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
everyone's preferences but I love to

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.500 
everyone's preferences but I love to
highlight<00:03:52.980> just<00:03:53.130> important<00:03:53.700> definitions<00:03:54.330> or

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
highlight just important definitions or

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.900 
highlight just important definitions or
important<00:03:55.350> notes<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:56.400> really<00:03:56.610> think<00:03:56.820> this

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
important notes and I really think this

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.790 
important notes and I really think this
helps<00:03:57.210> to<00:03:57.360> kind<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:57.960> have<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.320> important

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
helps to kind of have the important

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.500 
helps to kind of have the important
information<00:03:59.490> stand<00:03:59.910> out<00:04:00.120> when<00:04:00.360> you're

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
information stand out when you're

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.390 
information stand out when you're
studying<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.590> don't<00:04:01.740> have<00:04:01.860> all<00:04:02.040> these

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
studying so you don't have all these

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.970 
studying so you don't have all these
notes<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:03.120> are<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:04.110> in<00:04:04.290> your<00:04:04.440> face<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.830> can

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
notes that are like in your face you can

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.870 
notes that are like in your face you can
kind<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.280> condense<00:04:05.700> them<00:04:05.940> more<00:04:10.550> another<00:04:11.550> trick

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
kind of condense them more another trick

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.400 
kind of condense them more another trick
that<00:04:11.910> always<00:04:12.270> works<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.870> rewrite<00:04:13.200> your

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
that always works is to rewrite your

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.680 
that always works is to rewrite your
notes<00:04:13.770> as<00:04:14.040> well<00:04:14.310> as<00:04:14.550> condensing<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.240> into<00:04:15.510> one

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
notes as well as condensing it into one

little study guide sheet here is one
that<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:17.670> actually<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.180> made<00:04:18.510> for<00:04:18.720> math<00:04:18.870> class

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
that I actually just made for math class
