Center I always get the ones with a slot
and<00:00:51.609> what<00:00:52.609> I<00:00:52.670> do<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:53.179> you<00:00:53.300> can<00:00:53.420> either<00:00:53.600> use<00:00:53.899> a

and what I do is you can either use a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:58.989 
and what I do is you can either use a
little<00:00:54.800> star<00:00:55.100> drill<00:00:55.399> bit<00:00:55.670> like<00:00:55.940> this<00:00:56.949> okay<00:00:57.999> or

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
little star drill bit like this okay or

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.360 
little star drill bit like this okay or
I<00:00:59.420> take<00:01:00.319> a<00:01:00.379> pair<00:01:00.620> of<00:01:00.710> vise<00:01:00.859> grips<00:01:00.889> with<00:01:01.309> the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
I take a pair of vise grips with the

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.270 
I take a pair of vise grips with the
hunk<00:01:01.549> of<00:01:01.639> rebar<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:03.260> I<00:01:03.409> tap<00:01:03.710> this<00:01:03.979> through

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
hunk of rebar and I tap this through

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.200 
hunk of rebar and I tap this through
there<00:01:04.960> all<00:01:05.960> right<00:01:06.520> tap<00:01:07.520> that<00:01:07.730> through<00:01:08.000> there

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
there all right tap that through there

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:16.780 
there all right tap that through there
and<00:01:10.480> then<00:01:12.130> like<00:01:13.130> on<00:01:13.340> this<00:01:13.520> one<00:01:14.980> I've<00:01:15.980> got<00:01:16.280> a

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
and then like on this one I've got a

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:27.160 
and then like on this one I've got a
plate<00:01:17.650> plate<00:01:23.290> with<00:01:24.290> two<00:01:24.650> nuts<00:01:25.550> and<00:01:26.300> I<00:01:26.900> take

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
plate plate with two nuts and I take

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.840 
plate plate with two nuts and I take
this<00:01:28.450> same<00:01:29.450> eyeball<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.550> put<00:01:31.730> it<00:01:31.820> through

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
this same eyeball and I put it through

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.010 
this same eyeball and I put it through
this<00:01:32.090> hole<00:01:32.300> now<00:01:33.490> this<00:01:34.490> anchor<00:01:34.910> here<00:01:35.240> sinks<00:01:35.930> a

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
this hole now this anchor here sinks a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.230 
this hole now this anchor here sinks a
lot<00:01:36.170> faster<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.800> course<00:01:36.940> because<00:01:37.940> it<00:01:38.090> goes

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
lot faster of course because it goes

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.330 
lot faster of course because it goes
down<00:01:38.810> through<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.050> water<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:40.190> water

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
down through the water and the water

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.490 
down through the water and the water
passes<00:01:40.850> through<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.060> holes<00:01:42.730> but<00:01:44.290> this<00:01:45.290> is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
passes through the holes but this is

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.120 
passes through the holes but this is
twice<00:01:45.860> what<00:01:46.390> this<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.660> and<00:01:47.930> thickness<00:01:48.710> as<00:01:48.950> you

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
twice what this is and thickness as you

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.340 
twice what this is and thickness as you
can<00:01:49.310> see<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:50.690> what<00:01:50.810> I've<00:01:50.900> been<00:01:51.020> doing<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:51.260> was

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
can see so what I've been doing it was

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.130 
can see so what I've been doing it was
experimenting<00:01:51.950> around<00:01:52.040> with<00:01:52.370> these<00:01:53.140> bad

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
experimenting around with these bad

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
experimenting around with these bad
thing<00:01:54.470> about<00:01:54.590> this<00:01:54.980> is<00:01:56.590> when<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:57.770> goes<00:01:57.950> to

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
thing about this is when this goes to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.140 
thing about this is when this goes to
fall<00:01:59.380> it<00:02:00.380> wants<00:02:00.650> to<00:02:00.710> do<00:02:00.860> this<00:02:01.070> go<00:02:01.790> into<00:02:02.060> the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
fall it wants to do this go into the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.580 
fall it wants to do this go into the
bottom

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
bottom

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.669 
bottom
all<00:02:03.710> right<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:05.210> when<00:02:05.899> I<00:02:05.929> drop<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.439> over<00:02:06.560> the

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
all right so when I drop it over the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.919 
all right so when I drop it over the
side<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:08.330> boat

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
side of the boat

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.000 
side of the boat
I<00:02:09.399> don't<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:10.670> let<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.540> go<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.379> forget<00:02:12.950> about

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
I don't just let it go and forget about

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.660 
I don't just let it go and forget about
it<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.610> take<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.870> hold<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.230> sideways<00:02:15.670> with

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
it I take it and I hold it sideways with

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.119 
it I take it and I hold it sideways with
my<00:02:16.849> chain<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.330> my<00:02:17.450> hand<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.319> I<00:02:18.620> drop<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:19.010> over

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
my chain in my hand and I drop it over

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.699 
my chain in my hand and I drop it over
the<00:02:19.250> side<00:02:19.489> like<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:20.230> over<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.319> side<00:02:21.500> like

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
the side like this over the side like

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.150 
the side like this over the side like
that

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.150 
that
and<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.879> goes<00:02:23.000> down<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.599> then<00:02:23.810> as<00:02:24.739> soon<00:02:24.920> as<00:02:25.040> it

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
and it goes down and then as soon as it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.009 
and it goes down and then as soon as it
hits<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.489> bottom<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:26.030> want<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.390> stay<00:02:26.569> tight<00:02:26.870> on

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
hits the bottom I want to stay tight on

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.330 
hits the bottom I want to stay tight on
the<00:02:27.110> chain<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:28.430> want<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.970> tumble<00:02:29.420> down

the<00:02:39.860> boat<00:02:40.040> holds<00:02:40.610> my<00:02:40.730> 26<00:02:41.299> foot<00:02:41.450> boat<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.880> then

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
the boat holds my 26 foot boat and then

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.369 
the boat holds my 26 foot boat and then
here<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.810> one<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:45.829> just<00:02:45.980> used<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:47.379> it

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
here is one that I just used and it

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:49.660 
here is one that I just used and it
didn't<00:02:48.680> want<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.860> come<00:02:48.980> out<00:02:49.129> of<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.250> rock<00:02:49.400> so

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
didn't want to come out of the rock so

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.670 
didn't want to come out of the rock so
easy<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.590> piece<00:02:51.890> broke<00:02:52.190> off<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.510> what<00:02:53.720> this

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
easy the piece broke off so what this

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:07.979 
easy the piece broke off so what this
year<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:54.980> think<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.579> dollar<00:02:55.819> 29<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:57.099> think<00:03:06.519> I

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
year I think is a dollar 29 I think I

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.870 
year I think is a dollar 29 I think I
prefer<00:03:08.989> this<00:03:09.139> one<00:03:09.400> now<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.639> I've<00:03:10.730> been<00:03:10.819> using

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
prefer this one now that I've been using

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.319 
prefer this one now that I've been using
this<00:03:12.040> but<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.340> just<00:03:13.579> takes<00:03:13.760> up<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.970> little<00:03:14.120> more

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
this but it just takes up a little more

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.400 
this but it just takes up a little more
space<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.400> can<00:03:16.519> see<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:17.180> just<00:03:17.989> got<00:03:18.260> some

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
space so you can see I just got some

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.160 
space so you can see I just got some
square<00:03:18.709> washers<00:03:19.190> on<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.579> one<00:03:21.910> whole<00:03:22.910> idea<00:03:23.329> is

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
square washers on that one whole idea is

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.920 
square washers on that one whole idea is
you're<00:03:24.319> pulling<00:03:24.829> from<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:25.160> center<00:03:28.930> you're

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
you're pulling from the center you're

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.559 
you're pulling from the center you're
pulling<00:03:30.319> from<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.650> center<00:03:31.130> that's<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.180> idea

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
pulling from the center that's the idea

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.470 
pulling from the center that's the idea
my<00:03:33.019> first<00:03:33.319> time<00:03:33.620> I<00:03:33.950> ever<00:03:34.370> did<00:03:34.639> this<00:03:34.819> is<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.239> wrap

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
my first time I ever did this is I wrap

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.309 
my first time I ever did this is I wrap
chain<00:03:35.900> around<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:37.280> center<00:03:37.609> part<00:03:37.880> here<00:03:38.319> but

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
chain around the center part here but

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.960 
chain around the center part here but
the<00:03:39.380> problem<00:03:39.500> is<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.889> block<00:03:40.040> got<00:03:40.489> real<00:03:40.700> floppy

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
the problem is the block got real floppy

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.480 
the problem is the block got real floppy
so<00:03:43.970> this<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.269> what<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.480> do
