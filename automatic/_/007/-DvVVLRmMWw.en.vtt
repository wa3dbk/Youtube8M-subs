00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
there so the only way to do it there

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.270 
there so the only way to do it there
have<00:01:40.960> been<00:01:41.200> some<00:01:41.410> kind<00:01:41.650> of<00:01:41.710> hacks<00:01:41.950> about

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
have been some kind of hacks about

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.890 
have been some kind of hacks about
putting<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.550> cotton<00:01:42.970> ball<00:01:43.150> and<00:01:43.210> taping<00:01:43.750> over

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
putting a cotton ball and taping over

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.080 
putting a cotton ball and taping over
there<00:01:44.290> I<00:01:44.350> thought<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:45.520> looked<00:01:45.610> kind<00:01:45.820> of<00:01:45.880> hokey

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
there I thought it looked kind of hokey

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.050 
there I thought it looked kind of hokey
but<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.100> thought<00:01:48.310> I'd<00:01:48.460> go<00:01:48.580> ahead<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:48.820> try

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
but so I thought I'd go ahead and try

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.220 
but so I thought I'd go ahead and try
this<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:49.480> we're<00:01:49.600> gonna<00:01:49.690> go<00:01:49.810> ahead<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:49.960> unbox
