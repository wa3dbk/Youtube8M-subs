okay you first ship to click on cod cod
to<00:00:15.290> the<00:00:15.410> city<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:15.920> then

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
to the city and then

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.840 
to the city and then
work<00:00:17.260> appears<00:00:17.710> and<00:00:17.980> you<00:00:18.040> can<00:00:18.190> simply<00:00:18.610> click<00:00:18.730> on

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.130 

okay<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.579> see<00:00:35.879> some<00:00:36.059> type<00:00:36.269> of<00:00:36.300> prediction

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
okay here we see some type of prediction

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.849 
okay here we see some type of prediction
of<00:00:37.199> unit<00:00:37.559> 13<00:00:38.039> timing<00:00:38.460> game<00:00:38.899> made<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.079> audio

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
of unit 13 timing game made in audio

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.310 
of unit 13 timing game made in audio
game<00:00:41.269> usually<00:00:42.269> produce<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:42.750> same<00:00:42.899> type<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
game usually produce the same type of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.950 
game usually produce the same type of
unit<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:44.070> night<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.640> Renaissance<00:00:45.149> or<00:00:45.390> tank

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
unit like night in Renaissance or tank

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.740 
unit like night in Renaissance or tank
in<00:00:46.109> modern<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:47.280> instead<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.149> going<00:00:48.210> each

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
in modern then instead of going each

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.359 
in modern then instead of going each
turn<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.260> your<00:00:49.469> city<00:00:49.769> to<00:00:49.979> change<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:50.369 
turn in your city to change the

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:52.009 
turn in your city to change the
prediction<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.239> use<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> infinite

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
prediction you can use the infinite

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.279 
prediction you can use the infinite
prediction

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.049 

to<00:00:58.289> make<00:00:58.440> an<00:00:58.680> infinite<00:00:59.010> prediction<00:00:59.519> is<00:00:59.760> dead

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
to make an infinite prediction is dead

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.369 
to make an infinite prediction is dead
as<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.300> simple<00:01:00.629> click<00:01:01.100> you<00:01:02.100> use<00:01:02.280> an<00:01:02.670> alto<00:01:03.120> click

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
as a simple click you use an alto click

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.980 
as a simple click you use an alto click
which<00:01:04.379> make<00:01:05.280> appear<00:01:05.759> star<00:01:06.270> close<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.720> unit

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
which make appear star close your unit

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.200 
which make appear star close your unit
which<00:01:07.920> means<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.400> produce<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
which means you will produce it to the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.620 
which means you will produce it to the
infinite<00:01:09.630> then<00:01:10.610> if<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.759> produce<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.240> warrior

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
infinite then if I produce a warrior

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.370 
infinite then if I produce a warrior
this<00:01:13.560> turn<00:01:14.210> another<00:01:15.210> warrior<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.930> produced

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
this turn another warrior is produced

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.640 
this turn another warrior is produced
this<00:01:16.710> zone<00:01:17.700> after

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.340 

and<00:01:23.950> if<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:25.000> if<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.690> want<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:26.080> make<00:01:26.230> another

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
and if you if you want to make another

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.740 
and if you if you want to make another
unit<00:01:26.860> instead<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:27.930> example<00:01:28.930> kick<00:01:29.190> which<00:01:30.190> will

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
unit instead of example kick which will

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.770 
unit instead of example kick which will
make<00:01:31.750> disappear<00:01:32.050> you<00:01:32.620> infinite<00:01:33.400> prediction

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
make disappear you infinite prediction

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.810 
make disappear you infinite prediction
you<00:01:34.780> can<00:01:34.960> use<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.320> control<00:01:35.770> click<00:01:35.980> which<00:01:36.460> will

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
you can use a control click which will

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.390 
you can use a control click which will
put<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.690> unit<00:01:37.990> before<00:01:38.350> your<00:01:38.860> infinite

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
put the unit before your infinite

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.520 
put the unit before your infinite
production<00:01:39.820> then<00:01:40.420> well<00:01:40.600> my<00:01:40.810> fast<00:01:41.080> Walker<00:01:41.290> will

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
production then well my fast Walker will

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.980 
production then well my fast Walker will
be<00:01:41.650> produced<00:01:42.040> my<00:01:43.030> infinite<00:01:43.450> production<00:01:43.840> will

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
be produced my infinite production will

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.060 
be produced my infinite production will
result

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.330 

and<00:01:50.390> finale<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.630> want<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.110> make<00:01:52.470> lists<00:01:52.860> in

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
and finale if you want to make lists in

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.940 
and finale if you want to make lists in
production<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.690> use<00:01:54.900> a<00:01:54.930> shift<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> kick<00:01:55.650> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
production you use a shift to kick and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980 
production you use a shift to kick and
for<00:01:56.460> example<00:01:56.580> I<00:01:57.060> want<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.300> produce<00:01:57.450> first<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
for example I want to produce first a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.090 
for example I want to produce first a
warrior<00:01:59.120> then<00:02:00.120> after<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.540> lambo<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:01.860> want<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
warrior then after a lambo do I want to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.940 
warrior then after a lambo do I want to
produce<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.760> spy<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.630> written<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.170> afterfat

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
produce a spy and written and afterfat

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.520 
produce a spy and written and afterfat
Walker<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:06.570> use<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.869> shift<00:02:07.050> okay<00:02:07.229> each

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
Walker I can use the shift okay each

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:17.210 
Walker I can use the shift okay each
time

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.740 

okay<00:02:18.220> here<00:02:18.459> we<00:02:18.489> show<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.150> reading<00:02:19.450> print
