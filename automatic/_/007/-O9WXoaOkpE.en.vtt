00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.300
 150 million years ago a creature 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.880
 called archaeopterix took off the flight 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.290
 this creature part bird and part reptile 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.640
 he had teeth, solid bones and claws 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.620
 reptile 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.140
 but he had something else 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.140
 the archeopteryx had feathers 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.030
 the feathers and the flight improved during 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.040
 the next 75 million years 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.470
 the birds lost their teeth and their 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.480
 bones became hollow which reduced 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.480
 the weight and facilitated the flight 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.399
 the flight of the birds could have 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.800
 evolved to escape the 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.780
 predators to catch their prey or 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.480
 to move from one place to another with greater 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.660
 ease nobody knows for sure 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.059
 but of something if we can be sure 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.450
 all the 8,700 species of birds have 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.450
 feathers 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.160
 made of keratin the same protein 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.440
 of the hair the feathers evolved 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.980
 the scales had their ancestors 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.980
 reptiles 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.080
 a typical bird of prey has more than 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.080
 7000 pens 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.370
 the feathers of small eagles heras 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.480
 and made to fly they help them 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.480
 stay in the air 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.439
 even birds that do not fly have feathers 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.880
 the penguins have more than 70 feathers 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.880
 pieces in one square inch 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.549
 their feathers protect them because they are 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.450
 waterproof and cover your layer of grease 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.450
 that isolates them 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.150
 the feathers owe their colors to 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.150
 different pigments 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.300
 birds with black or brown gray plumage 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.180
 they owe their color to melanin 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.160
 the crimson ibis owe this color to the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.420
 carotene in shrimp and others 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.420
 crustaceans that are their food 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.570
 all birds also lay eggs 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.920
 but the nests range from the very 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.480
 simple 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.480
 to the very elaborate 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.409
 the chicks of some birds the ducks 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.599
 for example they are precocious capable of 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.930
 feed themselves as soon they come out 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.930
 from the shell 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.470
 other chicks like those of the albatross 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.849
 They are at the trios and they have to wait 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.849
 that their parents feed them 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.850
 the search for food leads to 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.220
 birds to the large annual migrations 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.930
 hummingbirds can fly hundreds of 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.970
 kilometers from the places where 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.860
 nest in the state of washington up 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.460
 the Mexican territory where they spend the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.500
 winter coming and going every year 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.480
 this ease of adaptation has 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.490
 allowed the birds to find a 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.880
 dwelling in almost any habitat of the 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.880
 world
