00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.490
 hi everybody knows this quarter to 45 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.920
 years old find themselves for a new 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.450
 video commented on black ops of then 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.160
 it's a video in response to a 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.240
 comment that I was left on my 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.590
 previous video which was so a live 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.150
 on I know more than what game but it was 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.730
 in game in weapon game 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.190
 and then I was offered to do a 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.700
 video in a loaded ball so one in 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.329
 the chamber is low and that's what I 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.530
 you do today 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.220
 so she is not commented on live 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.230
 it's because in fact it's super hard 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.160
 already actually comment on this game mode 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.660
 live because you need a 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.700
 big concentration for accuracy 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.960
 and in addition when you press ball 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.430
 must be stabbed 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.880
 stabbing his rent crap badly 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.290
 Finally leap it's a whole lot of reasons 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880
 which made that I managed not succeed 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.079
 recording would say that I tried but 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.059
 I swear to you but it made me so 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.200
 farted a cable of the blow I put you 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.210
 really the very first part that 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.850
 I did that they were really very 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.680
 well I made a good series 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.900
 from my first life which assured me the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.080
 victory directly 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.720
 I missed a few balls but that 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.920
 that me or what finally makes homes 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.030
 the guys online at not how they 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.470
 make to spend the stabbings seen 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.799
 the difficulties I had there to 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.250
 to put 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.939
 finally good here that's quite captures 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.320
 past this part there a question that 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.600
 I asked myself that's why they 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.500
 we have set the course 40 years pistol that 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.970
 I do not think he's really 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.310
 emblematic as gun was not 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.600
 this is a small double to the passage in 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.729
 a ball away it's fun 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.340
 gun that in this mode access 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.950
 possible so enough should savor these 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.869
 moments there and then yeah so what 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.850
 gun that is not really I want 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.570
 to say it's not like a diggle or a 44 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.810
 magnum or I do not know the m1911 that had 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.159
 here it is not good we leave it has not 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.480
 of historical value already with its 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.690
 standards of the future finally 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.130
 not yet finally these standards brockhaus 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.320
 there are two ways I take an expert 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.060
 in arms and then yeah yeah that's 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.590
 that a semi automatic and more so 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.090
 it's not really representative of the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.760
 category of pistols I find but 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.270
 good it's their choice after all a bit 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.560
 damage then I have not if you have if 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.360
 you know about it but then it goes 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.030
 one more update on youtube for 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.890
 string interfaces it'll still 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.960
 change that finally foam or good 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.800
 it's no longer okay finally me 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.050
 recognize this site 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.180
 this site because bahia any case they 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.440
 change admires you voice it's 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.690
 maybe it's me a question 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.590
 of adaptation but hey I still remember 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.640
 a little trouble to get me to this 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.800
 new interface that I find 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.020
 much less beautiful is much less 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.530
 hungry here it is much less well 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.410
 I find 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.790
 but hey it is if they think that youtube 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.200
 will develop better with this 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.170
 interface there so much better for them one 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.090
 we will see what happens in 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.300
 anyway I finish on a score of 10 2 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.440
 so that was a good shame 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.610
 that I'm dead twice because 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.590
 I really did a very good 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.470
 series from the beginning but hey it's like 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.000
 that I tell you very soon at this 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.220
 weekend for surely a next 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.270
 video and then well here's passing a good 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.270
 afternoon hi everyone 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.600
