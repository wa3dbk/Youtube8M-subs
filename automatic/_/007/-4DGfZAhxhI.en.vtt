00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
giving it kind of that vent kind of

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.410 
giving it kind of that vent kind of
aggressive<00:01:13.740> type<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.070> look<00:01:14.160> to<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.370> now<00:01:15.180> taking

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.880 
foam and so that's going to offer a nice
high-end<00:01:20.870> performance<00:01:21.870> so<00:01:22.230> that<00:01:22.260> EPP<00:01:22.860> foams

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
high-end performance so that EPP foams

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.130 
high-end performance so that EPP foams
going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.730> be<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.940> black<00:01:24.300> material<00:01:24.900> kind<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
going to be that black material kind of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.930 
going to be that black material kind of
going<00:01:25.320> around<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:25.710> exterior<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.520> perimeter
