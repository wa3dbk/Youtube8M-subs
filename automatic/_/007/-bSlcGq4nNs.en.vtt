all the work with the heavy machinery

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.750 
all the work with the heavy machinery
and<00:01:48.660> you<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:49.020> kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.950> keep<00:01:50.100> an<00:01:50.220> eye<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
and you just kind of keep an eye on the

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.150 
and you just kind of keep an eye on the
Avalanche<00:01:51.240> paths<00:01:51.570> above<00:01:51.810> them<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.650> make<00:01:52.980> sure

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
Avalanche paths above them and make sure

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.880 
Avalanche paths above them and make sure
no<00:01:53.760> snow<00:01:54.000> comes<00:01:54.270> down<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.750> top<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.960> them<00:01:55.320> give

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
no snow comes down on top of them give

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.280 
no snow comes down on top of them give
them<00:01:56.040> fair<00:01:56.250> warning<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.690> see<00:01:57.900> some<00:01:58.080> snow

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
them fair warning if we do see some snow

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.980 
them fair warning if we do see some snow
move<00:01:58.530> they<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.980> move<00:01:59.310> out<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.670> way<00:01:59.990> so

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
move they can move out of the way so

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.560 
move they can move out of the way so
we're<00:02:01.230> keeping<00:02:01.800> them<00:02:02.040> safe<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.420> what's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
we're keeping them safe so what's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.910 
we're keeping them safe so what's
happening<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.230> other<00:02:04.260> side

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
happening on the other side

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.560 
happening on the other side
sounds<00:02:05.550> like<00:02:05.670> they<00:02:05.850> made<00:02:06.060> two<00:02:06.300> miles

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
sounds like they made two miles

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.500 
sounds like they made two miles
yesterday<00:02:07.260> up<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.740> back<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:08.820> means

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
yesterday up and back and so that means

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.510 
yesterday up and back and so that means
that<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.230> know<00:02:10.320> they'd<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.710> about<00:02:10.800> milepost

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that you know they'd be about milepost

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.450 
that you know they'd be about milepost
150<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.560> gives<00:02:13.830> us<00:02:14.160> what<00:02:14.970> about<00:02:16.100> 17<00:02:17.100> miles

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
150 so that gives us what about 17 miles

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:27.330 
150 so that gives us what about 17 miles
in<00:02:17.850> between<00:02:17.880> us<00:02:18.480> them<00:02:18.930> now

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.490
