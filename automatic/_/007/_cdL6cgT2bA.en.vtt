we calculate your unlock code off of

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.850 
we calculate your unlock code off of
that<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:18.869> assuming<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.440> you've<00:01:19.680> done

got your unlock code we can move on to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
got your unlock code we can move on to
the<00:01:23.789> next<00:01:24.030> step

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.000 

all<00:01:28.660> right<00:01:28.780> now<00:01:28.960> we<00:01:29.020> do<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.410> unlocking<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:29.860> the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
that will walk you step-by-step through

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.130 
that will walk you step-by-step through
exactly<00:02:24.550> what<00:02:24.700> I'm<00:02:24.790> doing<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.690> first<00:02:25.959> step<00:02:26.080> is

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
exactly what I'm doing so first step is

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.729 
exactly what I'm doing so first step is
to<00:02:26.790> also<00:02:27.790> insert<00:02:28.150> your<00:02:28.630> SIM<00:02:29.020> card<00:02:29.080> into<00:02:29.350> the

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
to also insert your SIM card into the

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.699 
to also insert your SIM card into the
phone<00:02:30.420> I've<00:02:31.420> inserted<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.989> photo<00:02:32.200> SIM<00:02:32.470> card

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
phone I've inserted a photo SIM card

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.080 
phone I've inserted a photo SIM card
which<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.160> SIM<00:02:33.340> card<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.610> doesn't<00:02:33.910> work

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
which is the SIM card that doesn't work

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.390 
which is the SIM card that doesn't work
with<00:02:34.269> this<00:02:34.360> point<00:02:34.600> it's<00:02:34.870> Rogers<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.739> I've

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
with this point it's Rogers and I've

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.680 
with this point it's Rogers and I've
inserted<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:37.000> fido

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
inserted a fido

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.229 
inserted a fido
so<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:39.010> power<00:02:39.250> on<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.459> phone<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.820> turn<00:02:40.090> off

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
so you power on the phone you turn off

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.180 
so you power on the phone you turn off
the<00:02:40.510> radio<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.200> make<00:02:41.320> sure<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.709> wireless

the radio so make sure that the wireless

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.699 
the radio so make sure that the wireless
is<00:02:42.370> actually<00:02:42.730> off<00:02:42.970> um<00:02:43.360> it's<00:02:44.230> very<00:02:44.260> important

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
is actually off um it's very important

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.440 
is actually off um it's very important
to<00:02:44.769> make<00:02:44.920> sure<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.700> when<00:02:46.269> you're

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
to make sure of this when you're

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.440

unlocking the blackberry pearl as you
know<00:02:52.570> this<00:02:52.690> process<00:02:52.900> will<00:02:53.200> work<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.700> 8180

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
know this process will work on the 8180

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.970 
know this process will work on the 8180
110<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.299> 80<00:02:55.450> 120<00:02:55.600> any<00:02:56.140> basically<00:02:56.650> back<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.860> a

pearl d 8307 Malheur process like

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.630 
pearl d 8307 Malheur process like
example<00:03:01.540> here<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.870> can<00:03:01.989> place<00:03:02.140> an<00:03:02.350> MB<00:03:02.769> PPD

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
example here you can place an MB PPD

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.539 
example here you can place an MB PPD
there<00:03:03.970> you'll<00:03:04.120> press<00:03:04.299> an<00:03:04.450> mepd
