00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.810 
well-known TV star into film was there a
big<00:00:49.050> difference<00:00:49.370> there's<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.460> difference<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
big difference there's a difference you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.459 
big difference there's a difference you
know<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:51.239> you're<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> TV<00:00:51.660> show<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.350> was

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
know when you're on a TV show like I was

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.630 
know when you're on a TV show like I was
with<00:00:52.620> big<00:00:52.770> time<00:00:52.920> rush<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> bunch<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.430> years

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
with big time rush for a bunch of years

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.310 
with big time rush for a bunch of years
you<00:00:53.760> play<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> same<00:00:54.239> character<00:00:54.750> every<00:00:55.140> week

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you play the same character every week

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.650 
you play the same character every week
so<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.460> challenging<00:00:56.969> part<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.270> then<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> new

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so the challenging part is then the new

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.360 
so the challenging part is then the new
material<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:58.649> where<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> story<00:00:59.160> goes

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
material and then where the story goes

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.709 
material and then where the story goes
and<00:00:59.609> adapting<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.480> still<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and adapting to that but it's still the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.930 
and adapting to that but it's still the
same<00:01:00.899> character<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:02.160> every<00:01:02.609> actor

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
same character and I think every actor

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.340 
same character and I think every actor
wants<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.270> play<00:01:03.390> multiple<00:01:03.719> characters<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
wants to play multiple characters and I

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.450 
wants to play multiple characters and I
think<00:01:04.559> that's<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> fun<00:01:04.979> part<00:01:05.010> about<00:01:05.220> doing

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
think that's the fun part about doing

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
think that's the fun part about doing
film<00:01:05.790> he's<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> those<00:01:06.420> movies<00:01:06.689> shot<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.080> in
