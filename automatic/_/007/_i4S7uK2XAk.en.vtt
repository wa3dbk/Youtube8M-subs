we use two and a quarter inch do M
tubing<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.530> form<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.890> back<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:26.090> wanted<00:02:26.330> to

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
tubing to form the back we wanted to

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.260 
tubing to form the back we wanted to
utilize<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.560> roll<00:02:27.740> cage<00:02:28.010> as<00:02:28.400> also<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.970> mount

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
utilize the roll cage as also a mount

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.390 
utilize the roll cage as also a mount
for<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.600> spare<00:02:29.900> tire<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.890> yet<00:02:31.070> still<00:02:31.340> allow

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
for the spare tire and yet still allow

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.080 
for the spare tire and yet still allow
us<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.850> put<00:02:32.090> our<00:02:32.540> custom-made<00:02:33.490> hardtop<00:02:34.490> on<00:02:34.820> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
back of the G the entire carrier

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.320 
back of the G the entire carrier
actually<00:02:37.250> protrudes<00:02:37.520> through<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:38.030> hardtop

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
actually protrudes through the hardtop

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.510 
actually protrudes through the hardtop
without<00:02:39.320> actually<00:02:39.650> touching<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.040> hard<00:02:40.310> time
