 Domestic is just about 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.410
 tremendous experience in the background and there are 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.750
 a lot of things to tell and in general not 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.200
 only from weightlifting in which she 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.309
 specializes but also about crossfit 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.230
 for example at the European level because 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.539
 that she is the only one of ours 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.850
 athletes who visited the regional 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.340
 games on the original stage 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.730
 crossfit games here and tasty one 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.710
 actually felt the level 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.159
 competitive yes 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.159
 scale 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.929
 we are here now 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.420
 accounting is different competitive 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.009
 crossfit and paints both fitness and in 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.229
 present moment we have presented 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.939
 on the paint like fitness with the arrival of oksana 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.830
 we have an opportunity 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.050
 and staffing 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.700
 general run 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.820
 competitive crossfit and very soon 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.720
 we will launch groups 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.580
 suggested training for people who 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.620
 want to participate competitions i don't 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.210
 I think that I will have a lot of load 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.250
 on the contrary, I want to avoid it too 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.250
 picture career and cute big loads 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.270
 average smaller I came to the conclusion that 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.330
 it is not necessary to experience 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.880
 terribly tired or is there an overload you need 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.490
 on the contrary more listen to the body and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.500
 and train with quality 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.090
 not on quantity depends on quality 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.090
 good movie 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.879
 combine crossfit with other power 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.330
 sports can not just be needed then 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.159
 have it very helpful i made sure on 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.799
 my first experience was told to me 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.379
 what to combine money hard years taste 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.879
 coffee there will not be a failure in heavy 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.420
 athletics and carried you can not 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.250
 to withstand 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.760
 in fact 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.190
 in the end everything turned out differently like me 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.860
 and as I planned that is crossfit 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.370
 supplemented weightlifting that is about it 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.470
 removed the extra load from my workouts 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.820
 tired of athletic where was too 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.910
 many let's say gravity and dilute them and 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.190
 what did not lose at all and spoke at 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.790
 2 competitions that is with good 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.420
 the result 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.280
 of course we will strive to 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.850
 create a team that will be able to 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.290
 win competitions at the highest 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.750
 level but there is much more 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.100
 significant aspect 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:24.130
 any business is new especially in sports 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.510
 develops powerful then when there is 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.550
 role models 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.590
 with those examples which are 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.830
 contagious successful 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.930
 and personify success 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.160
 It seems to me that today this crossfit 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.620
 not enough and if we seek 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.370
 wins it will motivate to practice 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.370
 very powerful 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.740
 but 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:07.030
 when a new topic 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.040
 fairly new 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.580
 Substantially new to the country 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.620
 starting to engage 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.100
 I'm not afraid of the word great athlete 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.720
 from on an Olympic level athlete this 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.859
 means that this topic firstly 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.409
 serious 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.240
 secondly it means doing 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:30.280
 this question we start on a very 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.259
 high olympic level it means 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.819
 what if experienced athletes such 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.830
 level comes to this work awaits us 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.719
 success 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.060
 serious relationship to this work and 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:46.409
 success therefore I definitely 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.159
 and glad and proud of the fact that Oksana Slivenko 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.159
 becomes a member of our clinic
