00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
what do you think so far Sahara what's

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.839 
what do you think so far Sahara what's
your<00:00:07.919> opinion<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:10.190> don't<00:00:11.190> know<00:00:11.309> if<00:00:11.460> they<00:00:11.610> took<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
your opinion I don't know if they took a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.220 
your opinion I don't know if they took a
break<00:00:12.750> or<00:00:13.610> what<00:00:14.809> they<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:16.020> sort<00:00:16.170> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.670 
break or what they just sort of
disappeared<00:00:18.080> but<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.140> don't<00:00:19.380> think<00:00:19.560> they're

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
disappeared but I don't think they're

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.320 
disappeared but I don't think they're
far<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.400> probably<00:00:20.609> nothing<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.300> worry

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
far so it's probably nothing to worry

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.519 
far so it's probably nothing to worry

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
be like nine inches and now it looks

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.980 
be like nine inches and now it looks
like<00:02:37.010> it's<00:02:37.370> about<00:02:37.459> 18<00:02:38.030> inches
