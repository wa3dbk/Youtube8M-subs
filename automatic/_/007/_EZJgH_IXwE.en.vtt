skiers are struggling because you're

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.150 
skiers are struggling because you're
skidding<00:00:24.119> too<00:00:24.330> much<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> snow<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.800> need<00:00:25.980> to

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
skidding too much in the snow we need to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.330 
skidding too much in the snow we need to
apply<00:00:26.400> much<00:00:26.849> more<00:00:27.150> edge<00:00:27.449> angle<00:00:27.830> to<00:00:28.830> allow<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
apply much more edge angle to allow the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.250 
apply much more edge angle to allow the
skid<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:31.109> more<00:00:31.410> controlled<00:00:32.989> brilliant<00:00:33.989> so

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
skid to be more controlled brilliant so

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.200 
skid to be more controlled brilliant so
as<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.649> see<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.040> Ian's<00:00:35.460> doing<00:00:35.730> side

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
as we can see here Ian's doing side

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.060 
as we can see here Ian's doing side
slipping<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.500> probably<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> most

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
slipping this is probably the most

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.520 
slipping this is probably the most
important<00:00:38.790> skill<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:39.930> learn<00:00:40.079> for

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
important skill that you can learn for

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.280 
important skill that you can learn for
us<00:00:40.590> while<00:00:41.370> you're<00:00:41.489> skiing<00:00:41.820> at<00:00:42.149> any<00:00:42.360> level<00:00:42.660> it's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
us while you're skiing at any level it's

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.590 
us while you're skiing at any level it's
very<00:00:43.829> good<00:00:44.070> skis<00:00:44.370> find<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.910> difficult<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.329> side

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
very good skis find it difficult to side

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.709 
very good skis find it difficult to side
state<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.879> very<00:00:48.180> simple<00:00:48.420> you're

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
state so all it is very simple you're

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
state so all it is very simple you're
sliding<00:00:49.260> sideways<00:00:49.739> down<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> mountain<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
sliding sideways down the mountain and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.670 
sliding sideways down the mountain and
releasing<00:00:51.329> those<00:00:51.480> edges<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.020> soon<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.410> Ian

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
releasing those edges as soon as Ian

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.430 
releasing those edges as soon as Ian
digs<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> edges<00:00:53.879> into<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> mountain<00:00:54.660> he<00:00:55.260> will

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
digs the edges into the mountain he will

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.720 
digs the edges into the mountain he will
stop<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:56.340> soon<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.610> he<00:00:56.940> releases<00:00:57.300> them<00:00:58.730> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
stop as soon as he releases them you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.310 
stop as soon as he releases them you
slide<00:01:00.059> down<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> mountain<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
slide down the mountain and this is a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.160 
slide down the mountain and this is a
great<00:01:01.680> exercise<00:01:02.239> to<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.660> difficult

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
great exercise to get out of difficult

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
great exercise to get out of difficult
situations<00:01:04.790> places<00:01:05.790> where<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.150> want

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
situations places where you don't want

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.800 
situations places where you don't want
to<00:01:06.510> turn<00:01:06.920> very<00:01:07.920> important<00:01:08.490> skills<00:01:14.390> cool<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
to turn very important skills cool so is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.760 
to turn very important skills cool so is
this<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> give<00:01:16.409> us<00:01:16.500> another

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
this going to give us another

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.460 
this going to give us another
demonstration<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.700> side<00:01:18.090> slipping<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.750> how

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
demonstration of side slipping and how

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.340 
demonstration of side slipping and how
sometimes<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.220> go<00:01:20.369> wrong<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.049> it's<00:01:22.049> going

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
sometimes it can go wrong so it's going

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.080 
sometimes it can go wrong so it's going
to<00:01:22.409> start<00:01:22.590> slightly<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.460> he's<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
to start slightly but he's going to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.289 
to start slightly but he's going to
start<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> twist<00:01:24.900> his<00:01:25.049> upper<00:01:25.350> body<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:26.299> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
start to twist his upper body in the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.359 
start to twist his upper body in the
direction<00:01:27.450> where<00:01:27.869> he<00:01:28.020> doesn't<00:01:28.290> want<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> go<00:01:28.829> so

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
direction where he doesn't want to go so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.819 
direction where he doesn't want to go so
as<00:01:29.490> soon<00:01:29.759> as<00:01:29.939> he<00:01:30.000> does<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.439> as<00:01:31.439> soon<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:31.770> he

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
as soon as he does that as soon as he

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.460 
as soon as he does that as soon as he
twists<00:01:32.220> his<00:01:32.280> upper<00:01:32.549> body<00:01:32.810> down<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.079> mountain

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
twists his upper body down the mountain

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560 
twists his upper body down the mountain
the<00:01:34.560> skis<00:01:34.829> will<00:01:35.100> follow<00:01:35.340> bit<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.939> side<00:01:36.210> slip

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the skis will follow bit for side slip

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.270 
the skis will follow bit for side slip
and<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.780> want<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> keep<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> skis<00:01:37.590> across<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and we want to keep the skis across the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.570 
and we want to keep the skis across the
slope

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.370 

Kosar<00:01:45.580> as<00:01:45.760> we<00:01:46.330> can<00:01:46.570> see<00:01:46.720> here<00:01:46.930> goes<00:01:47.110> we've<00:01:47.350> got

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
Kosar as we can see here goes we've got

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.790 
Kosar as we can see here goes we've got
Ian<00:01:47.770> doing<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.190> bit<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.369> sidestepping<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.800> he's

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
Ian doing a bit of sidestepping and he's

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.090 
Ian doing a bit of sidestepping and he's
making<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.250> few<00:01:51.430> mistakes<00:01:51.550> so<00:01:53.100> sidestepping

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
making a few mistakes so sidestepping

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.620 
making a few mistakes so sidestepping
he's<00:01:54.310> going<00:01:54.550> up<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.850> mountain<00:01:55.119> so<00:01:55.210> we<00:01:55.330> need<00:01:55.509> to

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
he's going up the mountain so we need to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.510 
he's going up the mountain so we need to
grip<00:01:55.990> with<00:01:56.170> our<00:01:56.320> edges<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.860> as<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.070> can<00:01:57.190> see

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
grip with our edges and as you can see

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.630 
grip with our edges and as you can see
Ian's<00:01:57.909> bottom<00:01:58.390> ski<00:01:58.800> he's<00:01:59.800> not<00:02:00.070> standing<00:02:00.580> on

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
Ian's bottom ski he's not standing on

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.850 
Ian's bottom ski he's not standing on
the<00:02:00.700> edge<00:02:00.880> enough<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:01.330> if<00:02:01.750> Ian<00:02:02.110> tilts<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.649> ski

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
the edge enough so if Ian tilts the ski

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.690 
the edge enough so if Ian tilts the ski
and<00:02:02.979> stands<00:02:03.399> on<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.729> edge<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:05.080> grips<00:02:05.560> as<00:02:06.490> soon

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
and stands on that edge it grips as soon

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.059 
and stands on that edge it grips as soon
as<00:02:06.820> he<00:02:06.909> pushes<00:02:07.330> on<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.630> edge<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:08.619> goes<00:02:08.860> away

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
as he pushes on that edge it goes away

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.259 
as he pushes on that edge it goes away
and<00:02:09.399> as<00:02:09.940> soon<00:02:10.270> as<00:02:10.450> he<00:02:10.980> tilts<00:02:11.980> his<00:02:12.100> skis<00:02:12.400> up<00:02:12.700> the

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
and as soon as he tilts his skis up the

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.210 
and as soon as he tilts his skis up the
slope<00:02:13.540> or<00:02:13.750> down<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.230> slope<00:02:14.530> he'll<00:02:14.800> start<00:02:15.070> to

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
slope or down the slope he'll start to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.520 
slope or down the slope he'll start to
slide

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
slide

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.440 
slide
so<00:02:17.530> with<00:02:17.709> sidestepping<00:02:18.340> we<00:02:18.940> always<00:02:19.150> have<00:02:19.300> to

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
so with sidestepping we always have to

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.570 
so with sidestepping we always have to
grip<00:02:20.019> with<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.230> edges<00:02:20.620> with<00:02:20.860> both<00:02:21.130> skis<00:02:21.400> and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
grip with the edges with both skis and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.640 
grip with the edges with both skis and
keep<00:02:21.760> both<00:02:22.090> skis<00:02:22.420> pointing<00:02:22.930> across<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.410> slope

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
keep both skis pointing across the slope

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.740 
keep both skis pointing across the slope
at<00:02:23.830> all<00:02:23.950> times<00:02:24.220> as<00:02:24.400> soon<00:02:24.610> as<00:02:24.760> they<00:02:24.940> start

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
at all times as soon as they start

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.810 
at all times as soon as they start
pointing<00:02:26.110> too<00:02:26.380> far<00:02:26.650> or<00:02:26.890> too<00:02:26.920> down<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.580> slope

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
pointing too far or too down the slope

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.370 
pointing too far or too down the slope
we<00:02:28.030> will<00:02:28.180> slide<00:02:28.480> off<00:02:29.370> simple
