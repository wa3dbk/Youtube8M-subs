getting<00:00:41.940> mad<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.290> tangling<00:00:43.890> a

two weeks with my son when I guess it's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.030

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
because my hair is being pool cuz it's

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.730 
because my hair is being pool cuz it's
braided<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.150> not<00:01:39.270> gonna<00:01:39.530> attribute<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
braided so I'm not gonna attribute that

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.710 
braided so I'm not gonna attribute that
to<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.009> hair<00:01:41.400> people<00:01:42.030> said<00:01:42.180> they<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.540> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
to the hair people said they do that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.539 
to the hair people said they do that
this<00:01:42.840> hair<00:01:42.990> makes<00:01:43.200> their<00:01:43.350> itch<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.890> don't<00:01:44.369> think

so I think it's just how your braid you
know<00:01:46.740> your<00:01:46.860> hair<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.070> braided<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.020> it's
