00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.460 

this<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.179> be<00:00:03.300> all<00:00:03.480> about<00:00:03.629> fixing<00:00:04.110> the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
this is going to be all about fixing the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.490 
this is going to be all about fixing the
walls<00:00:05.629> because<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.870> needs<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.170> happen

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
walls because that needs to happen

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.980 
walls because that needs to happen
before<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:08.069> cabinet's<00:00:08.460> we<00:00:08.610> go<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:09.240> had

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
before the cabinet's we go I had

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.650 
before the cabinet's we go I had
basically<00:00:10.260> one<00:00:10.860> big<00:00:11.190> piece<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.059> drywall<00:00:12.269> to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
basically one big piece of drywall to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.110 
basically one big piece of drywall to
put<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.019> one<00:00:13.559> one<00:00:13.889> big<00:00:14.190> patch<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.880> then

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
put in one one big patch and then

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.450 
put in one one big patch and then
several<00:00:15.599> little<00:00:16.049> little<00:00:16.619> patches<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.160> go<00:00:17.279> in

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
several little little patches to go in

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.640 
several little little patches to go in
and<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:18.480> big<00:00:18.660> piece<00:00:18.869> had<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.109> be<00:00:19.230> cut<00:00:19.560> around

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
and the big piece had to be cut around

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.029 
and the big piece had to be cut around
three<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> outlets<00:00:21.140> but<00:00:22.140> besides<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.710> it

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
three of the outlets but besides that it

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.040 
three of the outlets but besides that it
was<00:00:23.189> fairly<00:00:23.730> simple<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.449> fairly

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
was fairly simple and fairly

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.590 
was fairly simple and fairly
straightforward

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.780 

now<00:00:33.600> when<00:00:33.780> cutting<00:00:34.230> drywall<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.340> actually

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
now when cutting drywall it's actually

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.590 
now when cutting drywall it's actually
really<00:00:35.940> easy<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:37.110> score<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.800> side<00:00:38.160> then<00:00:38.969> break

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
really easy to score one side then break

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.470 
really easy to score one side then break
the<00:00:39.809> interior<00:00:40.350> plaster<00:00:41.190> along<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.090> score

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the interior plaster along that score

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.450 
the interior plaster along that score
line<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.989> then<00:00:43.200> cut<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> other<00:00:43.710> side<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
line and then cut the other side and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.000 
line and then cut the other side and
you've<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> nice<00:00:45.660> fairly<00:00:46.379> clean<00:00:46.649> break

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you've got a nice fairly clean break

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
you've got a nice fairly clean break
with<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> walls<00:00:48.120> themselves<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
with the walls themselves really the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
with the walls themselves really the
first<00:00:49.649> thing<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> clean<00:00:50.579> them<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
first thing to do is to clean them up to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.020 
first thing to do is to clean them up to
get<00:00:51.270> ready<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> plaster<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.030> behind

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
get ready for the plaster and behind

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.029 
get ready for the plaster and behind
where<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.600> upper<00:00:54.930> cabinets<00:00:55.590> used<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.890> be

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
where the upper cabinets used to be

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.639 
where the upper cabinets used to be
there<00:00:56.250> were<00:00:56.340> sort<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.899> all<00:00:57.899> these<00:00:58.140> old<00:00:58.350> bug

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
there were sort of all these old bug

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.420 
there were sort of all these old bug
parts<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.340> spiderwebs<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.660> bits<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.770> gunk

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
parts and spiderwebs and bits of gunk

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
parts and spiderwebs and bits of gunk
that<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.719> wouldn't<00:01:03.989> come<00:01:04.199> off<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
that that wouldn't come off with the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.770 
that that wouldn't come off with the
vacuum<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.580> had<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.820> actually<00:01:05.909> brush<00:01:06.510> that

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
vacuum so I had to actually brush that

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.109 
vacuum so I had to actually brush that
stuff<00:01:07.049> off<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.470> wall<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.430> part<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> wall

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
stuff off the wall that part of the wall

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.539 
stuff off the wall that part of the wall
was<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.659> raw<00:01:09.990> plaster<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:10.950> well<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.340> wasn't

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
was the raw plaster as well there wasn't

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.670 
was the raw plaster as well there wasn't
any<00:01:11.670> paint<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.450> those<00:01:12.720> cabinets<00:01:13.380> were

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
any paint on it like those cabinets were

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.050 
any paint on it like those cabinets were
the<00:01:14.070> original<00:01:15.030> kitchen<00:01:15.710> now<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.740> use<00:01:17.070> plaster

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the original kitchen now I use plaster

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.270 
the original kitchen now I use plaster
that<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.479> actually<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:18.990> mix<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.920> water

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that you actually have to mix with water

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.969 
that you actually have to mix with water
so<00:01:20.939> it'll<00:01:21.210> actually<00:01:21.420> cure<00:01:22.049> instead<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.799> just

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so it'll actually cure instead of just

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.390 
so it'll actually cure instead of just
drawing<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.330> drywall<00:01:25.049> mud<00:01:25.290> does<00:01:25.619> so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
drawing like the drywall mud does so

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
drawing like the drywall mud does so
it's<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.119> bit<00:01:27.360> harder<00:01:27.780> than<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:27.990> than

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it's a little bit harder than that than

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.340 
it's a little bit harder than that than
the<00:01:28.560> mud<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.520> main<00:01:29.729> reason<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:31.049> had

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the mud the main reason was that I had

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
the mud the main reason was that I had
some<00:01:31.560> big<00:01:31.770> spaces<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.460> fill<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.240> plaster

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
some big spaces to fill and the plaster

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.679 
some big spaces to fill and the plaster
that<00:01:33.960> actually<00:01:34.409> cures<00:01:34.770> fills<00:01:35.400> big<00:01:36.119> voids<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
that actually cures fills big voids a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.090 
that actually cures fills big voids a
lot<00:01:36.869> better<00:01:37.049> because<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.380> doesn't<00:01:37.619> shrink<00:01:37.829> as

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
lot better because it doesn't shrink as

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.940 
lot better because it doesn't shrink as
much<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> mud<00:01:39.390> does<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.680> first

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
much as the as the mud does so the first

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.490 
much as the as the mud does so the first
thing<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.400> was<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.850> fill<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.079> seams

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
thing to do was to fill all of the seams

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.069 
thing to do was to fill all of the seams
between<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.670> patches<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.240> I'd<00:01:45.479> put<00:01:45.659> up<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
between the patches that I'd put up I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.770 
between the patches that I'd put up I
first<00:01:46.649> filled<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.250> seam<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.090> covered

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
first filled the seam and then I covered

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.410 
first filled the seam and then I covered
that<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> layer<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.950> drywall<00:01:50.670> tape<00:01:51.119> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that with a layer of drywall tape and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.690 
that with a layer of drywall tape and
then<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> tape<00:01:52.710> got<00:01:52.890> covered<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.399> another

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
then the tape got covered with another

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.550 
then the tape got covered with another
layer<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:53.970> plaster<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.290> sort<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
layer of plaster so it's it's sort of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.730 
layer of plaster so it's it's sort of
sandwiched<00:01:56.070> within<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> plaster<00:01:57.740> there's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
sandwiched within the plaster there's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.679 
sandwiched within the plaster there's
this<00:01:58.950> clock<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> wall<00:02:00.390> in

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
this clock that we have on the wall in

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.139 
this clock that we have on the wall in
the<00:02:00.810> kitchen<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.890> built<00:02:02.219> into<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.820> wall

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the kitchen and it's built into the wall

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.469 
the kitchen and it's built into the wall
and<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.689> wired<00:02:04.020> into<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> house<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> can't

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and it's wired into the house so I can't

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.869 
and it's wired into the house so I can't
really<00:02:06.780> move<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.649> take<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> down<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
really move it or take it down to do the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.150 
really move it or take it down to do the
plastering<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.259> thought<00:02:10.619> about<00:02:10.860> different

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
plastering and I thought about different

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.550 
plastering and I thought about different
things<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:11.760> with<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.840> plaster

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
things to do with it with the plaster

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.830 
things to do with it with the plaster
and<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.160> decided<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.090> sort<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.420> kick<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.690> can

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and I decided to sort of kick the can

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.020 
and I decided to sort of kick the can
down<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.500> road<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.980> just<00:02:17.069> kind<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.400> frame<00:02:17.790> it

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
down the road and just kind of frame it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.570 
down the road and just kind of frame it
in<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.330> square<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.110> then<00:02:19.319> plaster<00:02:19.709> around<00:02:20.160> it

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
in a square and then plaster around it

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.809 
in a square and then plaster around it
and<00:02:20.730> then<00:02:21.060> at<00:02:21.330> some<00:02:21.540> future<00:02:21.720> date<00:02:22.170> if<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.819> think

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
and then at some future date if I think

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.430 
and then at some future date if I think
of<00:02:24.030> something<00:02:24.360> or<00:02:24.629> if<00:02:24.810> someone's<00:02:25.080> got<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> good

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
of something or if someone's got a good

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.559 
of something or if someone's got a good
suggestion<00:02:25.860> for<00:02:26.250> what<00:02:26.400> what<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.849> do<00:02:27.030> with<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.390> I

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
suggestion for what what to do with it I

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.619 
suggestion for what what to do with it I
can<00:02:28.050> do<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.379> in<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> future<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.209> first

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
can do that in the future now the first

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.110 
can do that in the future now the first
skin<00:02:30.930> coat<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.440> wall<00:02:31.670> now<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.849> house

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
skin coat on the wall now this house

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.290 
skin coat on the wall now this house
like<00:02:33.660> most<00:02:33.930> house<00:02:34.200> has<00:02:34.530> textured<00:02:35.220> walls<00:02:35.879> which

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
like most house has textured walls which

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.800 
like most house has textured walls which
I<00:02:36.540> really<00:02:36.989> don't<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.540> would<00:02:39.540> much<00:02:39.780> rather

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
I really don't like I would much rather

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.800 
I really don't like I would much rather
have<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.319> smooth<00:02:40.709> wall<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.480> plastered<00:02:42.480> over

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
have a smooth wall so I plastered over

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.480 
have a smooth wall so I plastered over
the<00:02:43.230> texture

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
the texture

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.550 
the texture
the<00:02:44.580> whole<00:02:44.820> wall<00:02:45.120> one<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.990> reasons<00:02:46.380> is

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the whole wall one of the reasons is

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.070 
the whole wall one of the reasons is
that<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.130> patch<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.210> smooth<00:02:48.540> wall<00:02:48.780> it's

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
that you can patch a smooth wall it's

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.410 
that you can patch a smooth wall it's
really<00:02:49.320> hard<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.710> match<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.250> texture<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.060> not

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
really hard to match a texture and not

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.870 
really hard to match a texture and not
make<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.810> look<00:02:51.960> like<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> patch<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.550> when<00:02:53.760> I've

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
make it look like a patch so when I've

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.960 
make it look like a patch so when I've
made<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.480> patch<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.170> wall<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.860> usually<00:02:56.640> smooth

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
made a patch in a wall I usually smooth

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.430 
made a patch in a wall I usually smooth
out<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.330> whole<00:02:57.540> wall<00:02:59.870> I'm<00:03:00.870> not<00:03:01.080> really<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
out the whole wall I'm not really the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.290 
out the whole wall I'm not really the
best<00:03:01.590> plaster<00:03:02.190> in<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> world<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.030> still

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
best plaster in the world so I still

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.830 
best plaster in the world so I still
need<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.570> sand<00:03:03.900> between<00:03:04.290> my<00:03:05.130> coats<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.610> plaster

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
need to sand between my coats of plaster

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.720 
need to sand between my coats of plaster
so<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:06.870> can<00:03:07.140> do<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.620> well<00:03:08.010> enough<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.580> where

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
so I can do it well enough to where

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.450 
so I can do it well enough to where
sanding<00:03:09.390> will<00:03:09.570> get<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.900> smooth<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:11.040> not<00:03:11.220> well

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
sanding will get it smooth but not well

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.320 
sanding will get it smooth but not well
enough<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.820> where<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.720> don't<00:03:12.870> have<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.470> sand<00:03:14.330> the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
enough to where I don't have to sand the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.200 
enough to where I don't have to sand the
plastering<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:16.020> relaxing<00:03:16.740> now<00:03:17.460> for<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.820> final

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
plastering is relaxing now for the final

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.120 
plastering is relaxing now for the final
coat<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.780> mix<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.230> plaster<00:03:19.350> up<00:03:19.710> a<00:03:19.830> little

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
coat I mix the plaster up a little

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.370 
coat I mix the plaster up a little
thinner<00:03:20.550> which<00:03:21.300> will<00:03:21.480> help<00:03:21.660> get<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:21.990> that

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
thinner which will help get that that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.190 
thinner which will help get that that
nice<00:03:22.620> smooth<00:03:23.070> final<00:03:23.580> finish<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.990> wall

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
nice smooth final finish on on the wall

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.010 
nice smooth final finish on on the wall
so<00:03:26.100> really<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.940> sanding<00:03:27.510> takes<00:03:27.780> down<00:03:27.960> the

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
so really the the sanding takes down the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.740 
so really the the sanding takes down the
bumps<00:03:28.830> or<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.070> or<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.790> positives<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.630> the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
bumps or the or the positives and the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.290 
bumps or the or the positives and the
plastering<00:03:31.620> fills<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.400> voids<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.090> you

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
plastering fills in the voids and you

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.780 
plastering fills in the voids and you
sort<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.630> keep<00:03:34.110> doing<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.560> process<00:03:35.400> over<00:03:35.700> and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
sort of keep doing that process over and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.790 
sort of keep doing that process over and
over<00:03:35.880> again<00:03:36.090> until<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.780> wall<00:03:36.990> looks<00:03:37.560> good

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
over again until the wall looks good

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.740 
over again until the wall looks good
enough<00:03:38.630> now<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:40.250> far<00:03:41.250> wall<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:42.360> wall<00:03:42.540> that's

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
enough now the far wall the wall that's

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.990 
enough now the far wall the wall that's
sort<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.380> parallel<00:03:43.770> with<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.980> camera<00:03:44.490> we've

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
sort of parallel with the camera we've

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.550 
sort of parallel with the camera we've
been<00:03:45.210> thinking<00:03:45.450> about<00:03:45.480> doing<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.990> color<00:03:46.320> on

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
been thinking about doing a color on

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.710 
been thinking about doing a color on
instead<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.160> just<00:03:47.370> white<00:03:47.670> but<00:03:48.030> we<00:03:48.540> thought

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
instead of just white but we thought

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.750 
instead of just white but we thought
we'd<00:03:48.930> put<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.530> kitchen<00:03:49.830> in<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:50.580> kind

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
we'd put the kitchen in so you can kind

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.640 
we'd put the kitchen in so you can kind
of<00:03:50.820> see<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.300> colors<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.170> how<00:03:52.440> they're

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
of see the colors and how they're

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.650 
of see the colors and how they're
working<00:03:52.770> together<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.370> kind<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.760> pick<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.270> color

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
working together to kind of pick a color

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.840 
working together to kind of pick a color
for<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.050> wall<00:03:55.320> where<00:03:55.620> our<00:03:55.800> fear<00:03:56.190> was<00:03:56.220> we<00:03:56.580> we

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
for that wall where our fear was we we

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.370 
for that wall where our fear was we we
would<00:03:57.090> pick<00:03:57.270> something<00:03:57.480> we<00:03:57.750> think<00:03:57.930> would<00:03:58.140> work

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
would pick something we think would work

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.930 
would pick something we think would work
and<00:03:58.710> we'd<00:03:58.830> liked<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.400> then<00:03:59.490> we<00:03:59.730> put

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
and we'd liked and then we put

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.030 
and we'd liked and then we put
everything<00:04:00.120> in<00:04:00.420> as<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:00.720> go<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:01.500> doesn't

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
everything in as I go that doesn't

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.970 
everything in as I go that doesn't
really<00:04:02.160> work<00:04:02.660> so<00:04:03.660> white<00:04:04.410> sort<00:04:04.800> of<00:04:04.890> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
really work so white sort of the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.670 
really work so white sort of the
fallback<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.490> and<00:04:06.090> will<00:04:06.360> work<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:07.260> we<00:04:07.470> may<00:04:07.620> do

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
fallback and and will work but we may do

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.650 
fallback and and will work but we may do
a<00:04:08.310> color<00:04:08.790> on<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.030> wall<00:04:09.390> as<00:04:09.570> well<00:04:14.450> then<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.510> was

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
a color on that wall as well then it was

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.479 
a color on that wall as well then it was
time<00:04:15.840> for<00:04:15.870> painting<00:04:16.290> it<00:04:16.950> really<00:04:17.130> seems<00:04:17.400> like

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
time for painting it really seems like

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.090 
time for painting it really seems like
they<00:04:17.880> change<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:19.049> make<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.440> thing<00:04:19.470> smaller

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
they change you make the thing smaller

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.360 
they change you make the thing smaller
now<00:04:20.460> the<00:04:20.880> roller<00:04:21.299> size<00:04:21.840> with<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.770> roller

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
now the roller size with the roller

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.480 
now the roller size with the roller
handle<00:04:23.850> because<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.900> roller<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.530> got<00:04:25.860> just<00:04:26.130> was

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
handle because the roller I got just was

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.910 
handle because the roller I got just was
really<00:04:26.910> tight<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.420> getting<00:04:27.720> into<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.260> into

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
really tight and getting into the into

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.280 
really tight and getting into the into
the<00:04:29.010> handle<00:04:29.430> but<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.760> worked<00:04:30.060> with<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.930> hammer

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
the handle but it worked with a hammer

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.520 
the handle but it worked with a hammer
so<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.190> did<00:04:32.400> two<00:04:32.640> coats<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.360> same<00:04:34.230> white

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
so I did two coats of the same white

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:42.110 
so I did two coats of the same white
