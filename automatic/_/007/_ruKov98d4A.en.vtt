00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
with coarse snakes being one of the most

with coarse snakes being one of the most
popular<00:00:22.300> snakes<00:00:22.630> in<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:22.840> pet<00:00:23.050> trade<00:00:23.199> we<00:00:23.650> have

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
popular snakes in the pet trade we have

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.830 
popular snakes in the pet trade we have
a<00:00:23.830> really<00:00:24.220> large<00:00:24.400> group<00:00:24.520> of<00:00:24.880> them<00:00:24.970> here<00:00:25.180> at<00:00:25.300> bhp

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
a really large group of them here at bhp

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.900 
a really large group of them here at bhp
and<00:00:26.050> it's<00:00:26.199> one<00:00:26.349> of<00:00:26.380> our<00:00:26.529> largest<00:00:26.910> productions

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
and it's one of our largest productions

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.519 
and it's one of our largest productions
the<00:00:28.240> first<00:00:28.509> thing<00:00:28.689> you<00:00:28.810> do<00:00:29.020> when<00:00:29.200> you<00:00:29.230> come<00:00:29.470> out

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
the first thing you do when you come out

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.529 
the first thing you do when you come out
of<00:00:29.770> hibernation<00:00:29.919> with<00:00:30.520> them<00:00:30.640> is<00:00:30.880> decide<00:00:31.300> which

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
of hibernation with them is decide which

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.780 
of hibernation with them is decide which
males<00:00:31.869> go<00:00:32.200> to<00:00:32.259> which<00:00:32.559> females<00:00:33.100> keeping<00:00:33.700> in

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
males go to which females keeping in

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.759 
males go to which females keeping in
mind<00:00:34.000> that<00:00:34.210> one<00:00:34.420> male<00:00:34.629> can<00:00:34.840> breed<00:00:35.050> up<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.410> five

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
mind that one male can breed up to five

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:36.600 
mind that one male can breed up to five
females

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
females

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.759 
females
so<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.940> first<00:00:37.210> step<00:00:37.449> rearrange<00:00:38.170> those<00:00:38.440> groups

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
so the first step rearrange those groups

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.130 
so the first step rearrange those groups
once<00:00:39.730> your<00:00:39.879> animals<00:00:40.239> are<00:00:40.330> rearranged<00:00:40.870> it's

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
once your animals are rearranged it's

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.720 
once your animals are rearranged it's
very<00:00:41.410> important<00:00:41.830> to<00:00:41.920> feed<00:00:42.160> your<00:00:42.309> females

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
very important to feed your females

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.700 
very important to feed your females
extremely<00:00:43.480> heavily<00:00:43.750> you<00:00:44.290> want<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.500> go<00:00:44.589> at

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
extremely heavily you want to go at

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.530 
extremely heavily you want to go at
least<00:00:44.860> two<00:00:45.190> maybe<00:00:45.580> even<00:00:45.699> three<00:00:45.879> times<00:00:46.360> a<00:00:46.510> week

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
least two maybe even three times a week

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.630 
least two maybe even three times a week
the<00:00:46.989> more<00:00:47.199> fat<00:00:47.500> they<00:00:47.680> have<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.100> better<00:00:48.309> egg

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
the more fat they have the better egg

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.869 
the more fat they have the better egg
production<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:50.769> next<00:00:51.070> step<00:00:51.250> in<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.430> process

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
production the next step in the process

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.130 
production the next step in the process
the<00:00:52.059> females<00:00:52.450> will<00:00:52.570> go<00:00:52.719> through<00:00:52.899> what<00:00:53.020> they

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
the females will go through what they

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.709 
the females will go through what they
call<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.379> post<00:00:53.739> hibernation<00:00:54.430> sedge<00:00:54.820> cycle<00:00:55.329> this

call a post hibernation sedge cycle this

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.330 
call a post hibernation sedge cycle this
is<00:00:55.930> important<00:00:56.440> because<00:00:56.590> that's<00:00:56.980> when<00:00:57.250> they're

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
is important because that's when they're

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.100 
is important because that's when they're
producing<00:00:57.820> follicles<00:00:58.449> and<00:00:58.660> you<00:00:58.750> need<00:00:58.899> to<00:00:58.989> get

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
producing follicles and you need to get

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.110 
producing follicles and you need to get
a<00:00:59.140> male<00:00:59.469> in<00:00:59.680> and<00:00:59.860> start<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.399> breed<00:01:00.640> them<00:01:00.789> now

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
a male in and start to breed them now

a male in and start to breed them now
the<00:01:01.180> male's<00:01:01.480> shed<00:01:01.719> cycle<00:01:02.110> isn't<00:01:02.260> nearly<00:01:02.680> as

the male's shed cycle isn't nearly as

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.770 
the male's shed cycle isn't nearly as

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
they're in shed a lot of times they will

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.430 
they're in shed a lot of times they will
not<00:01:06.610> breathe<00:01:07.149> then<00:01:07.899> comes<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.259> work

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
not breathe then comes the work

not breathe then comes the work
intensive<00:01:08.920> part<00:01:09.160> we<00:01:09.280> have<00:01:09.369> to<00:01:09.430> switch

we<00:01:14.140> use<00:01:14.320> these<00:01:14.530> male<00:01:14.830> tags<00:01:15.190> so<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:15.460> we<00:01:15.789> know

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
we use these male tags so that we know

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.330 
we use these male tags so that we know
where<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.570> location<00:01:17.110> of<00:01:17.200> that<00:01:17.350> male<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:17.860> and
