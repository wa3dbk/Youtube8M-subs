00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.999 

there's<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> backs<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.150> them

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
there's the backs of them

there they're good says there's all the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.179 
there they're good says there's all the
packaging<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.890> Christmas

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
packaging it was like Christmas

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.780 
packaging it was like Christmas
opening<00:01:29.759> these<00:01:29.909> things<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
opening these things up so it is the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.990 
opening these things up so it is the
other<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:34.400> we'll<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.520> stopping<00:01:35.759> those

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
other one and we'll be stopping those

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030 
other one and we'll be stopping those
amps<00:01:36.210> together<00:01:36.509> at<00:01:36.720> 2<00:01:36.869> ohm<00:01:37.079> these<00:01:37.619> are<00:01:37.770> dual

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
amps together at 2 ohm these are dual

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.760 
amps together at 2 ohm these are dual
dual<00:01:38.790> 2-ohm<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.600> I'll<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.960> taking<00:01:40.110> them<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.500> up

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
dual 2-ohm so I'll be taking them up up

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.719 
dual 2-ohm so I'll be taking them up up
to<00:01:41.130> 4<00:01:41.369> ohm<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.020> strapping<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.890> wiring

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
to 4 ohm and strapping and and wiring

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.870 
to 4 ohm and strapping and and wiring
goes<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.720> together<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:47.009> back<00:01:47.189> down<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.520> two

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
goes to together to go back down to two

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.490 
goes to together to go back down to two
of<00:01:48.060> them<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.420> these<00:01:48.570> amps<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.110> only

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
of them because these amps are only

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.109 
of them because these amps are only
stable<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.189> 2<00:01:50.369> ohm<00:01:50.520> when<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.790> strap<00:01:50.970> them

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
stable at 2 ohm when you strap them

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.830 
stable at 2 ohm when you strap them
together<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.829> say<00:01:53.460> they<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.670> 50<00:01:54.149> 500<00:01:54.360> watt

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
together so they say they do 50 500 watt

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.870 
together so they say they do 50 500 watt
SATA<00:01:55.200> at<00:01:55.770> 2<00:01:55.979> ohms<00:01:56.189> strapped<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:58.170> we'll<00:01:58.350> see

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
SATA at 2 ohms strapped so so we'll see

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.090 
SATA at 2 ohms strapped so so we'll see
we'll<00:01:59.880> see<00:01:59.909> these<00:02:00.240> mofos<00:02:00.689> freaking<00:02:01.500> dump<00:02:01.829> hard

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
we'll see these mofos freaking dump hard

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.759 
we'll see these mofos freaking dump hard
so<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:04.170> will<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:05.009> back<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.340> another<00:02:05.369> video
