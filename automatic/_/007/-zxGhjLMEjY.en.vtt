00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
seems like something could have been

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.179 
seems like something could have been
experimenting<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.479> both<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> curb<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:13.560> green

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
experimenting with both of curb as green

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.310 
experimenting with both of curb as green
as<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.240> picture<00:01:15.509> where

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
as can see here on this picture where

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
as can see here on this picture where
it's<00:01:16.439> curved<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> side<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.850> very

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it's curved on the side so it's very

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.630 
it's curved on the side so it's very
very<00:01:18.330> cool<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:19.500> also<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> flexible

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
very cool but also like a flexible

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.910 
very cool but also like a flexible
display<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.990> probably<00:01:22.259> would<00:01:22.470> make<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
display which probably would make it a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
display which probably would make it a
little<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.280> more<00:01:23.430> durable<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.360> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
little bit more durable with you you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.749 
little bit more durable with you you
would<00:01:25.049> drop<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.320> device<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.549> would<00:01:26.729> be

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
would drop the device but this would be

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.880 
would drop the device but this would be
pretty<00:01:27.150> same<00:01:27.420> filter<00:01:27.750> systems<00:01:28.259> 1440

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
already have a qHD display i think on

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.950 
already have a qHD display i think on
their<00:01:44.460> new<00:01:44.759> Galaxy<00:01:45.240> s5<00:01:45.509> LTE<00:01:46.140> variant<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
their new Galaxy s5 LTE variant in the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.889 
their new Galaxy s5 LTE variant in the
in<00:01:48.960> Korea<00:01:49.460> it's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.909> rumor<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> ghost

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
in Korea it's a rumor to have a ghost

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.260 
in Korea it's a rumor to have a ghost
handwriting<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.130> basically<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:54.090> be

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
handwriting so basically this would be

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.770 
handwriting so basically this would be
like<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.509> feature<00:01:55.520> where<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.579> would<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.509> able

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
like a feature where you would be able

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.420 
like a feature where you would be able
to<00:01:58.290> type<00:01:58.740> let's<00:01:59.729> see<00:01:59.820> how<00:02:00.000> picture<00:02:00.869> should<00:02:01.770> be

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
to type let's see how picture should be

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.370 
to type let's see how picture should be
right<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.030> yeah<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.020> would<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.350> able

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
right here yeah that you would be able

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.399 
right here yeah that you would be able
to<00:02:04.619> type<00:02:05.340> something<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:07.049> type

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
to type something and type

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.930 
to type something and type
something<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> screen<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.550> equilibria

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
something on the screen and equilibria

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.509 
something on the screen and equilibria
nuys<00:02:09.709> what<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:11.099> are<00:02:11.459> trying<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:14.280> that

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
nuys what you are trying to do and that

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.640 
nuys what you are trying to do and that
could<00:02:14.670> definitely<00:02:14.790> be<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.330> cool<00:02:15.959> thing<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.470> see

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
could definitely be a cool thing to see

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.619 
could definitely be a cool thing to see
here<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.069> we<00:02:17.190> take<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.459> look<00:02:17.580> at<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.269> maybe

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
here if we take a look at this so maybe

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.680 
here if we take a look at this so maybe
if<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.260> type<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.980> name<00:02:20.370> maybe<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.269> can<00:02:21.390> call

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
if you type a name maybe you can call

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.539 
if you type a name maybe you can call
that<00:02:21.900> person<00:02:22.200> immediately<00:02:22.440> with<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.160> S<00:02:23.250> Pen

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
that person immediately with the S Pen

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.020 
that person immediately with the S Pen
feature<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:25.620> you'll<00:02:25.890> be<00:02:26.069> able<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.370> write

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
feature that you'll be able to write

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.410 
feature that you'll be able to write
stuff<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.750> call<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.769> person<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.209> it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
stuff like call that person and that it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.280 
stuff like call that person and that it
then<00:02:30.599> we'll<00:02:30.959> do<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.700> maybe<00:02:33.239> better<00:02:33.989> like

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
then we'll do that and maybe better like

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.550 
then we'll do that and maybe better like
signature<00:02:34.739> signature<00:02:35.250> right<00:02:36.239> thing<00:02:36.510> when<00:02:37.470> you

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
signature signature right thing when you

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.350 
signature signature right thing when you
need<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.739> sign<00:02:38.310> stuff<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.879> things<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.299> that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
need to sign stuff and things like that

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.229 
need to sign stuff and things like that
also<00:02:40.200> possibly<00:02:41.129> some<00:02:41.370> kind<00:02:41.579> of<00:02:41.640> NOC<00:02:41.970> code

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
also possibly some kind of NOC code

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.229 
also possibly some kind of NOC code
feature<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.980> you'll<00:02:44.160> be<00:02:44.430> able<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.640> unlock<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
feature so you'll be able to unlock the

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.600 
feature so you'll be able to unlock the
display<00:02:45.980> when<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.459> not<00:02:48.000> awake<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:49.459> same<00:02:50.459> as

since the kind of smart and fingerprint

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.940 
since the kind of smart and fingerprint
feature<00:02:57.569> she<00:02:57.930> probably<00:02:58.170> used<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.530> fingerprint

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
feature she probably used a fingerprint

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.460 
feature she probably used a fingerprint
scanner<00:02:59.000> that<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.180> see<00:03:00.390> in<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.599> s5<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.200> also

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
scanner that you see in the s5 and also

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.170 
scanner that you see in the s5 and also
something<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.799> multi<00:03:02.069> network<00:03:02.190> booster<00:03:02.849> which

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
something a multi network booster which

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.949 
something a multi network booster which
could<00:03:03.750> possibly<00:03:03.900> be<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.640> network<00:03:06.599> boosterism

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
could possibly be the network boosterism

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.479 
could possibly be the network boosterism
well<00:03:07.290> minus<00:03:07.560> five<00:03:07.829> where<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.129> can<00:03:08.280> both<00:03:08.459> use

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
well minus five where you can both use

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.160 
well minus five where you can both use
the<00:03:09.030> M<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.780> carriers<00:03:10.319> that<00:03:10.739> speed<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:12.170> your

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
the M the carriers that speed and your

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.559 
the M the carriers that speed and your
Wi-Fi<00:03:13.560> speed<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.920> download<00:03:14.040> things<00:03:14.790> even

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
Wi-Fi speed to download things even

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.069 
Wi-Fi speed to download things even
faster<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:17.370> have<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.639> possibly<00:03:18.540> swipe<00:03:18.900> to

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
faster you have a possibly swipe to

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.660 
faster you have a possibly swipe to
launch<00:03:19.260> feature<00:03:19.530> which<00:03:19.920> i<00:03:20.010> think<00:03:20.069> is<00:03:20.310> an<00:03:20.489> HTC

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
launch feature which i think is an HTC

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.319 
launch feature which i think is an HTC
One<00:03:21.060> m8<00:03:21.329> where<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.750> can<00:03:21.989> used<00:03:22.170> swype<00:03:22.919> and<00:03:23.329> it

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
One m8 where you can used swype and it

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.699 
One m8 where you can used swype and it
will<00:03:24.780> launch<00:03:25.500> launch<00:03:26.459> different<00:03:27.000> things<00:03:27.239> and

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
will launch launch different things and

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.789 
will launch launch different things and
like<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.060> like<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.090> camera<00:03:30.590> some<00:03:31.590> other

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
like the like the camera some other

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.059 
like the like the camera some other
features<00:03:32.040> here<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:33.180> like<00:03:33.690> an<00:03:33.810> aqua<00:03:34.230> capture<00:03:34.709> so

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
features here is like an aqua capture so

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.610 
features here is like an aqua capture so
when<00:03:35.310> obviously<00:03:35.730> one<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.269> big<00:03:36.480> things

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
when obviously one of the big things

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.740 
when obviously one of the big things
with<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.799> device<00:03:37.950> could<00:03:38.459> be<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:39.299> we<00:03:39.510> could

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
with this device could be that we could

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.039 
with this device could be that we could
see<00:03:39.989> some<00:03:40.019> kind<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.919> them<00:03:41.599> that<00:03:42.599> is<00:03:42.750> waterproof

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
see some kind of them that is waterproof

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.050 
see some kind of them that is waterproof
famous<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.739> s5<00:03:44.069> but<00:03:44.340> some<00:03:44.489> kind<00:03:44.639> of<00:03:44.669> aqua

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
famous with the s5 but some kind of aqua

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.360 
famous with the s5 but some kind of aqua
aqua<00:03:45.480> feature<00:03:45.840> that's<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.859> improvement<00:03:47.310> of

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
aqua feature that's the improvement of

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.849 
aqua feature that's the improvement of
the<00:03:47.519> s4<00:03:47.849> actives<00:03:48.290> taking<00:03:49.290> pictures<00:03:49.590> on<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
the s4 actives taking pictures on the

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.720 
the s4 actives taking pictures on the
water<00:03:50.069> so<00:03:50.669> we<00:03:50.940> improve<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.780> fat<00:03:52.260> feature<00:03:52.730> in
