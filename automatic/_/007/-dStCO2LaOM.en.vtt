00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
longer of a tutorial video than normal

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.029 
longer of a tutorial video than normal
mostly<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.620> think<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.949> know

this<00:01:02.190> new<00:01:02.309> area<00:01:02.520> these<00:01:03.000> areas<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.420> little

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
this new area these areas are little

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.450 
this new area these areas are little
confusing<00:01:04.530> especially<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.159> new<00:01:05.250> players

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
confusing especially the new players

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.370 
confusing especially the new players
like<00:01:05.549> I'm<00:01:05.700> still<00:01:05.880> confused<00:01:06.270> by<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.540> there's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
like I'm still confused by them there's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.780 
like I'm still confused by them there's
a<00:01:07.409> lot<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.560> nooks<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.830> crannies<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.220> stuff<00:01:08.549> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
a lot of nooks and crannies and stuff so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.070 
a lot of nooks and crannies and stuff so
you<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.180> figured<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
you know I just figured I would be a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.690 
you know I just figured I would be a
little<00:01:10.290> more<00:01:10.320> detailed<00:01:10.740> than<00:01:10.830> normal<00:01:11.189> ok<00:01:11.640> so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
little more detailed than normal ok so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.219 
little more detailed than normal ok so
when<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> first<00:01:12.150> come<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:12.930> you're<00:01:13.140> going

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to need to use the dragon stone you'll

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.030

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
now I actually already picked it up but

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.740 
now I actually already picked it up but
you<00:01:44.880> know<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.180> won't<00:01:45.329> see<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.659> but

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you know so you won't see it here but

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.889 
you know so you won't see it here but
normally<00:01:45.899> it'll<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.350> right<00:01:46.500> around<00:01:46.619> here<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
normally it'll be right around here and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.819 
normally it'll be right around here and
this<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> sword<00:01:49.350> actually<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.799> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
this is the sword actually I have it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.370 
this is the sword actually I have it
equipped<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.759> pretty<00:01:50.909> cool<00:01:51.060> ok<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.140> once<00:01:52.290> you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
equipped it's pretty cool ok so once you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.210 
equipped it's pretty cool ok so once you
have<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:52.560> sword<00:01:52.799> you're<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> come

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
have your sword you're going to come

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.609 
have your sword you're going to come
back<00:01:53.310> over<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.540> elevator<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.110> we're

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
back over here to the elevator and we're

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:09.830 
back over here to the elevator and we're
going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> head<00:01:56.009> up<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.399> get<00:01:56.729> our<00:01:56.850> armor<00:01:57.119> set

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.470 

okay<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.370> now<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> part<00:02:12.390> I

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
okay so now that this is the part I

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.460 
okay so now that this is the part I
think<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.750> gets<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> little<00:02:13.110> confusing

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
think that gets a little confusing

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.660 
think that gets a little confusing
because<00:02:13.620> there's<00:02:14.069> old<00:02:14.250> there's<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.489> lot<00:02:14.580> of

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
because there's old there's a lot of

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.949 
because there's old there's a lot of
different<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.180> know<00:02:15.209> pathways<00:02:15.780> and

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
different like you know pathways and

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.750 
different like you know pathways and
nooks<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.260> crannies<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.800> stuff<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.430> this

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
nooks and crannies and stuff in this

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.160 
nooks and crannies and stuff in this
area<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.360> know<00:02:18.450> you're<00:02:18.810> jumping
