what's<00:00:00.299> up<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:00.719> it's<00:00:00.750> King<00:00:01.380> intensity<00:00:01.920> here

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
what's up guys it's King intensity here

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.289 
what's up guys it's King intensity here
and<00:00:02.639> I<00:00:03.000> have<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.780> sar-21<00:00:04.259> be<00:00:04.950> set<00:00:05.310> up<00:00:05.490> tons<00:00:06.060> of

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
and I have the sar-21 be set up tons of

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.360 
and I have the sar-21 be set up tons of
you<00:00:06.390> guys<00:00:06.569> have<00:00:06.810> been<00:00:06.930> requesting<00:00:07.080> this<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:08.340> I

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
you guys have been requesting this so I

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.220 
you guys have been requesting this so I
decided<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.880> make<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> beast<00:00:09.480> set<00:00:09.750> up<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.080> this

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
decided to make a beast set up for this

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.810 
decided to make a beast set up for this
and<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.530> think<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.040> probably<00:00:11.219> one<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
and I think this is probably one of the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.379 
and I think this is probably one of the
most<00:00:12.030> requested<00:00:12.420> weapons<00:00:13.290> by<00:00:14.009> far<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.759> this

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
most requested weapons by far and this

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.910 
most requested weapons by far and this
is<00:00:15.509> probably<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:15.960> my<00:00:16.109> most<00:00:16.289> accurate

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
is probably one of my most accurate

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.429 
is probably one of my most accurate
setups<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.480> far<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.050> I'm<00:00:19.260> just

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
setups that I have so far so I'm just

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.170 
setups that I have so far so I'm just
gonna<00:00:19.529> read<00:00:20.220> off<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.550> stats<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.090> weapon

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
gonna read off the stats of the weapon

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.179 
gonna read off the stats of the weapon
here<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.800> screen<00:00:22.920> here

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
here you can see on the screen here

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.790 
here you can see on the screen here

damage 30 accuracy 36 hipfire 73 range
28<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.869> stability<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.439> 104<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> right

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
28 and stability is 104 with the right

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
of fire of 600 and a magazine size of 30

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.819 
of fire of 600 and a magazine size of 30
and<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.620> attachments

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and that is with all the attachments

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.330 
and that is with all the attachments
I'll<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:39.180> showing<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.570> guys<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> second<00:00:40.620> so

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
I'll be showing you guys in a second so

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.030 
I'll be showing you guys in a second so
to<00:00:41.550> kick<00:00:41.700> off<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.270> build<00:00:42.629> we're<00:00:43.620> gonna<00:00:43.739> start

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to kick off this build we're gonna start

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.160 
to kick off this build we're gonna start
off<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.489> optic<00:00:44.940> which<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> coyote<00:00:45.719> RDS

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
off with the optic which is a coyote RDS

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.350 
off with the optic which is a coyote RDS
and<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> probably<00:00:47.550> my<00:00:47.700> favorite<00:00:47.730> sight

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and this is probably my favorite sight

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.529 
and this is probably my favorite sight
to<00:00:48.480> use<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.079> not<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.879> intense<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to use it's not as intense as the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.060 
to use it's not as intense as the
holographic<00:00:51.989> might<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.710> kind<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> like

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
holographic might be it's kind of like

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
holographic might be it's kind of like
that<00:00:53.190> bridge<00:00:53.460> between<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.809> first

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
that bridge between like that first

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.500 
that bridge between like that first
sight<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.469> get<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.309> holographic<00:00:57.090> sight

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
sight you get and the holographic sight

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.180 
sight you get and the holographic sight
so<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:58.980> good

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so I think this is just a really good

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.310 
so I think this is just a really good
sight<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> use<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.780> playing<00:01:01.050> really

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
sight to use it's really playing really

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
sight to use it's really playing really
simple<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.210> using<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
simple and I just like using this and a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.289 
simple and I just like using this and a
lot<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.350> setup<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.519> try<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.119> out

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
lot of my setup so you can try that out

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.960 
lot of my setup so you can try that out
if<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.080> next<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> accessory<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
if you like it next for the accessory I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.539 
if you like it next for the accessory I
have<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> laser<00:01:09.659> sight<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.070> laser<00:01:11.250> sight

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
have a laser sight and the laser sight

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.550 
have a laser sight and the laser sight
is<00:01:11.700> always<00:01:12.090> good<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.380> just

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
is always good to have because it just

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.620 
is always good to have because it just
gives<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> added<00:01:14.460> hipfire<00:01:15.150> accuracy

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
gives you that added hipfire accuracy

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.289 
gives you that added hipfire accuracy
and<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.619> you're<00:01:16.770> worried<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and if you're worried about this the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.999 
and if you're worried about this the
laser<00:01:18.479> sight<00:01:18.960> giving<00:01:19.470> away<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.680> position

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
laser sight giving away your position

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.730 
laser sight giving away your position
you<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.549> always<00:01:20.820> toggle<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.540> off<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.020> believe

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
you can always toggle it off I believe

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.950 
you can always toggle it off I believe
it's<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> d-pad<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.750> you're

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
it's up on the d-pad so if you're

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.090 
it's up on the d-pad so if you're
worried<00:01:25.200> about<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.619> giving<00:01:25.860> away<00:01:26.070> your

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
worried about it giving away your

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.130 
worried about it giving away your
position<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.790> any<00:01:27.000> situation<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.930> go

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
position in any situation you can go

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.380 
position in any situation you can go
ahead<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.530> turn<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.860> off<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.880> it's

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
ahead and turn it off so really it's

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.179 
ahead and turn it off so really it's
always<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> benefit<00:01:31.229> having<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.680> laser<00:01:31.860> sight

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
always a benefit having the laser sight

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
always a benefit having the laser sight
on<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.460> weapon<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> barrel<00:01:33.930> I

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
on your weapon now for the barrel I

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.770 
on your weapon now for the barrel I
chose<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> muzzle<00:01:35.040> break<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> muzzle

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
chose a muzzle break and with the muzzle

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
chose a muzzle break and with the muzzle
break<00:01:36.930> anytime<00:01:37.229> you're<00:01:37.619> using<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.250> want<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
break anytime you're using it you want a

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.210 
break anytime you're using it you want a
burst<00:01:38.820> fire<00:01:39.119> because<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
burst fire because as you can see in the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.249 
burst fire because as you can see in the
last<00:01:41.460> line<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.909> says<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> adds<00:01:42.360> thirty<00:01:42.840> percent

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
last line it says it adds thirty percent

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.260 
last line it says it adds thirty percent
penalty<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> accuracy<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.729> automatic

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
penalty to the accuracy of automatic

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
penalty to the accuracy of automatic
fire<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> lot<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.710> times<00:01:46.979> when<00:01:47.340> you're

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
fire so a lot of the times when you're

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.249 
fire so a lot of the times when you're
using<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.180> muzzle<00:01:48.420> break<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> want<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.140> make

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
using the muzzle break you want to make

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.620 
using the muzzle break you want to make
sure<00:01:49.290> your<00:01:49.590> burst<00:01:50.100> firing<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.450> good

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
sure your burst firing and a good

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.960 
sure your burst firing and a good
attachment<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.500> use<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.130> combination<00:01:53.790> with

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
attachment to use in combination with

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
attachment to use in combination with
the<00:01:54.090> muzzle<00:01:54.270> break<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.200> underbarrel

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the muzzle break is the underbarrel

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.209 
the muzzle break is the underbarrel
angled<00:01:56.790> grip<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> angled<00:01:59.189> grip

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
angled grip and so what the angled grip

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.670 
angled grip and so what the angled grip
does<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.240> reduces<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.990> first<00:02:01.259> shot<00:02:01.469> recoil

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
does is it reduces the first shot recoil

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.459 
does is it reduces the first shot recoil
about<00:02:02.189> 33<00:02:02.820> percent<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.899> when<00:02:04.079> your<00:02:04.200> burst

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
about 33 percent so when your burst

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.530 
about 33 percent so when your burst
firing<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.100> gun<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.820> constantly

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
firing this gun you're constantly

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.869 
firing this gun you're constantly
shooting<00:02:06.780> pausing<00:02:07.530> shooting<00:02:07.979> again<00:02:08.369> so

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
shooting pausing shooting again so

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.940 
shooting pausing shooting again so
you're<00:02:09.360> all<00:02:09.509> your<00:02:09.780> first<00:02:10.050> shot<00:02:10.229> recoil<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you're all your first shot recoil and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.110 
you're all your first shot recoil and
all<00:02:11.190> those<00:02:11.459> bursts

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
all those bursts

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.539 
all those bursts
is<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.659> reduced<00:02:13.019> by<00:02:13.200> 33%<00:02:13.739> any

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
is going to be reduced by 33% any

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.970 
is going to be reduced by 33% any
combination<00:02:15.480> with<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.200> muzzle<00:02:16.440> break<00:02:16.769> that's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
combination with the muzzle break that's

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.130 
combination with the muzzle break that's
a<00:02:17.129> really<00:02:17.549> really<00:02:17.580> good<00:02:17.940> combo<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.930> just

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
a really really good combo and it just

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.440 
a really really good combo and it just
adds<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.739> much<00:02:19.920> stability<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:20.909> gun<00:02:21.180> it's

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
adds so much stability to this gun it's

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.390 
adds so much stability to this gun it's
ridiculous<00:02:22.140> you'll<00:02:22.349> see<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.220> lot<00:02:23.370> of

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
ridiculous you'll see in a lot of

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.190 
ridiculous you'll see in a lot of
situations<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.269> get<00:02:24.540> into<00:02:24.840> when<00:02:25.080> I'm

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
situations that I get into when I'm

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.589 
situations that I get into when I'm
first<00:02:25.860> firing<00:02:26.129> this<00:02:26.430> weapon<00:02:26.489> from<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.120> distance

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
first firing this weapon from a distance

other than just mowing people down and

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.339 
other than just mowing people down and
it's<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:30.030> ridiculous<00:02:30.480> how<00:02:30.780> accurate<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
it's really ridiculous how accurate the

maybe<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.810> compensator<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.680> probably<00:03:02.159> a<00:03:02.220> go

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
maybe a compensator and probably a go

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.800 
maybe a compensator and probably a go
string<00:03:02.909> because<00:03:03.150> those<00:03:03.299> are<00:03:03.450> probably<00:03:03.629> the

string because those are probably the

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
to unlock those but those are probably

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.170

using combat medic will maximize the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.330 
using combat medic will maximize the
amount<00:03:37.109> of<00:03:37.169> points<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.650> can<00:03:37.769> get<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.250> I'm

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
gonna read off the actual benefits of

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.860 
gonna read off the actual benefits of
having<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.190> combat<00:03:41.549> medic<00:03:41.730> field<00:03:42.120> upgrade<00:03:42.510> so

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
having the combat medic field upgrade so

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.080 
having the combat medic field upgrade so
level<00:03:43.169> one<00:03:43.379> your<00:03:43.709> med<00:03:43.919> kit<00:03:44.160> upgrade<00:03:44.519> increases

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
level one your med kit upgrade increases

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.390 
level one your med kit upgrade increases

the maximum deployed medic bags by one

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400 
the maximum deployed medic bags by one
and<00:03:47.669> so<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.269> can<00:03:48.480> put<00:03:48.690> down<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:49.019> those<00:03:49.230> on<00:03:49.379> the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
and so you can put down to those on the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.110 
and so you can put down to those on the
field<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:49.980> that's<00:03:50.190> gonna<00:03:50.340> get<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.639> tons<00:03:50.940> of

field and that's gonna get you tons of
points<00:03:51.239> if<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.629> have<00:03:51.780> them<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.079> different

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
points if you have them in different

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.979 
points if you have them in different
locations<00:03:53.129> so<00:03:53.639> that<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.060> always<00:03:54.329> good<00:03:54.540> level

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
locations so that is always good level

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.140 
locations so that is always good level

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
this setup off for grenades I'm using

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.399 
this setup off for grenades I'm using
the<00:04:36.620> agro<00:04:37.370> impacts<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:38.449> this<00:04:38.900> is<00:04:39.050> actually

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
the agro impacts and this is actually

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:40.990 
the agro impacts and this is actually
the<00:04:39.740> first<00:04:39.889> setup<00:04:40.159> that<00:04:40.370> I've<00:04:40.490> used<00:04:40.729> them<00:04:40.939> in

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
the first setup that I've used them in

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.179 
the first setup that I've used them in
you<00:04:41.180> won't<00:04:41.360> see<00:04:41.539> these<00:04:41.900> in<00:04:42.110> my<00:04:42.259> gameplay<00:04:42.830> but

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:43.189 
you won't see these in my gameplay but

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.369 
you won't see these in my gameplay but
these<00:04:43.460> are<00:04:43.610> actually<00:04:43.939> very<00:04:44.210> good<00:04:44.330> for<00:04:44.840> when

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
these are actually very good for when

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.200 
these are actually very good for when
people<00:04:45.530> are<00:04:45.710> behind<00:04:46.129> cover<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.550> maybe<00:04:47.030> you've

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
people are behind cover and maybe you've

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.089 
people are behind cover and maybe you've
shot<00:04:47.449> out<00:04:47.599> them<00:04:47.780> a<00:04:47.810> little<00:04:48.139> bit<00:04:48.259> and<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:48.949> just

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
shot out them a little bit and you just

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.860 
shot out them a little bit and you just
need<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.340> take<00:04:49.580> them<00:04:49.729> out<00:04:49.909> quickly<00:04:50.240> the

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
need to take them out quickly the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.270 
need to take them out quickly the
impacts<00:04:51.379> are<00:04:51.590> really<00:04:51.889> good<00:04:52.039> because<00:04:52.159> they

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
impacts are really good because they

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.330 
impacts are really good because they
explode<00:04:52.879> on<00:04:53.210> impact<00:04:53.479> so<00:04:54.020> someone<00:04:54.800> dips<00:04:54.979> behind

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
explode on impact so someone dips behind

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.709 
explode on impact so someone dips behind
cover<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:55.789> can<00:04:55.939> just<00:04:56.120> chuck<00:04:56.300> one<00:04:56.479> of<00:04:56.599> those

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:56.719 
cover you can just chuck one of those

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:58.330 
cover you can just chuck one of those
back<00:04:56.960> there<00:04:57.169> it<00:04:57.289> explodes<00:04:57.740> as<00:04:57.919> soon<00:04:58.129> as<00:04:58.219> it

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
back there it explodes as soon as it

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.640 
back there it explodes as soon as it
hits<00:04:58.550> something<00:04:58.759> and<00:04:59.120> a<00:05:00.050> lot<00:05:00.289> of<00:05:00.319> the<00:05:00.439> times

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
hits something and a lot of the times
