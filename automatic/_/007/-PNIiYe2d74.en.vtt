00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 you surely know the proverbs 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.180
 give a fish to a man he will eat 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.919
 the days after him to fish he will eat 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.330
 every day someone who sees you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.130
 a dj is like giving a 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.280
 fish instead of teaching you to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.280
 to fish 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.750
 for a few weeks I do not know 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.800
 why but I have a lot of requests 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.510
 coaching online 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.250
 I am often asked if I 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.869
 proposed a food program or 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.800
 a diet with the program of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.510
 bodybuilding 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.360
 the answer is no and I will you 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.100
 explain why firstly I 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.870
 I'm not worried about the place but 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.460
 calories and secondly it's not 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.660
 something that I recommend 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.640
 because I think it's not a good 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.690
 idea of super diet even though it is 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 made by a professional 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.440
 there is nothing more stupid than 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.510
 follow-up jet made by a coach 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.079
 sports or even worse find on 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.750
 Internet 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.489
 ah so sorry even more stupid asked 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.649
 to follow the dietetics that had good 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.690
 results that's even more stupid 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.910
 than to buy a diet made by 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.290
 a pro situ coach have trouble understanding 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.850
 why it's stupid 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.450
 here is an example that may be 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.500
 telly I have the last bmw and I'm doing the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.930
 full of gas every three-four 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.060
 days you were going for about 500 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.610
 euros of gasoline per month 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.000
 I have a friend he at the c3 he is full 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.710
 gasoline 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.200
 once a week he has for some 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.390
 almost 200 euros a month and to make 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.890
 savings and think like him you me 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.570
 ask where is he doing his full 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.460
 if you did not understand I'm sorry 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 with my video and Marc Pokemon Valley 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.689
 so already stopped looking for diets 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.290
 for cuttlefish or mass taken on 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.150
 Internet 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.409
 stop asking your friends in the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.189
 bodybuilding groups that is the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.140
 best diet 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.189
 it's stupid it has to be 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.530
 something personalized 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.000
 yes but anthony me I followed the jetta 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.799
 and recognized sports coach I have 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.110
 paid 300 euros and I had great 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.490
 result you had a great result not 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.070
 because you ate what your coach 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.689
 you said you were great result because 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.610
 you have eaten the right number of calories 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.640
 just guarantee you pass you said that 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.689
 you paid 300 euros you changed all the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.399
 less young calais men who te 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.869
 make more or less the number of 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.729
 proteins carbohydrates and lipids that te 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.869
 must and you will have exactly the same 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.640
 result 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.990
 then do you believe me or not I'm lying 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.640
 but most coaches to give 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.400
 exactly the same quest for everyone 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.600
 how do I know it because a coaching the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.410
 line I often have three or four 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.120
 people at the same time 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.590
 and I know how long it takes for me 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.660
 prepare only the programs 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.090
 bodybuilding and especially meet the dishes 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.620
 so I can not imagine a second someone 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.440
 who does his business body online 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.360
 personalizes everything ever from life so 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.370
 to the limit if you absolutely want to 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.590
 follow a diet made to yourself and 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.239
 know that the most important in a jet 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.850
 and I do not care what your coach joe 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.620
 school and hadji the most important is the 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.850
 number of calories 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.310
 then the breakdown of proteins 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.310
 carbohydrates and lipids then the intake 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.170
 micronutrients then the number and the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.900
 distribution of loams low and 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.820
 last it was food supplements 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.800
 it's good in the ornament if you're followed 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.450
 by a coach shows this video 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.280
 and if he does not agree with that 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.230
 I will tell you I have the challenge of 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.239
 send me but I am told that they do 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.709
 do not see that I'm wrong if you go 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.870
 see a sports coach who takes care 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.209
 diet or a dietician and him 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.080
 request a food plan that 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.870
 be profitable 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.430
 impressive professional the coach 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.430
 sports or publishing and proposed a 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.410
 special quest tailor-made for you 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.600
 and go ahead dias you have to eat the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.280
 morning noon at night and snack 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.769
 he has to do something to you 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.450
 for the price you paid if you want 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.780
 go see someone who knows what he 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.239
 spoken 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.370
 we are stubborn to ask for advice or a blank 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.780
 feed a year without you will find 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.709
 the names of the calories that you need by 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.690
 relation to its objective 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.570
 and then spread carbohydrate protein 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.920
 and lipids that's all and it's up to you 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.769
 to choose the foods you like 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.200
 eat but I will pay 40 50 60 euros 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.970
 that for that yes I know it's 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.920
 ridiculous that's why I do not do 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.720
 but that's what you have to do 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.799
 eat I do not care that you have 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.299
 sounded in your choices 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.180
 what you eat is more or less 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.880
 balanced calorie saver and that makes 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.170
 pleasure is perfect if you want to see 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.390

 eat to maintain his weight is 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.180
 common bullshit you eat

 currently and every time the answer 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.340
 is I do not know but after if you want 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.720

 better and do not complain that it's too much 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.960

 gains and killed sacrifices I'm going 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.840
 become huge and those who have therefore 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.820
 had them look where to buy a beer 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.770
 special mass gain or loss of 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.850

 these calories carbohydrate project will be % 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.500
 to proteins and 23% of lipids and 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.540
