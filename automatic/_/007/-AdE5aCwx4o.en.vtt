here's HTC blinkfeed now some stuff may
look<00:01:54.259> off<00:01:54.500> because<00:01:54.890> for<00:01:55.610> example<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:56.210> can't<00:01:57.079> go

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
look off because for example I can't go

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
any further out here and I can't move

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.789 
any further out here and I can't move
any<00:02:00.829> apps<00:02:01.189> for<00:02:02.000> example<00:02:02.439> can't<00:02:03.439> move<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.710> over

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799

it<00:03:34.520> looks<00:03:34.730> like<00:03:34.820> on<00:03:34.880> my<00:03:35.180> tablet<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.780> again<00:03:36.680> you

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
it looks like on my tablet and again you

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.620 
it looks like on my tablet and again you
have<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.190> have<00:03:37.280> room<00:03:37.490> to<00:03:37.520> get<00:03:37.760> this<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.210> have<00:03:38.540> to

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
have to have room to get this I have to

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.420 
have to have room to get this I have to
do<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.810> flash<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.290> zip<00:03:39.320> down<00:03:39.680> below<00:03:39.950> but<00:03:40.190> so

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.210 
do is flash the zip down below but so
far<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:41.000> think<00:03:41.660> this<00:03:42.290> would<00:03:42.530> look<00:03:42.560> nice<00:03:42.890> on<00:03:43.040> my

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
far I think this would look nice on my

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.950 
far I think this would look nice on my
phone<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:43.970> only<00:03:44.150> thing<00:03:44.360> I<00:03:44.450> have<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.660> downside

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
phone the only thing I have a downside

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.990 
phone the only thing I have a downside
to<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.500> app<00:03:45.680> drawer<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.190> can't<00:03:46.460> really<00:03:46.580> do

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
to is the app drawer you can't really do

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.450 
to is the app drawer you can't really do
anything<00:03:47.300> with<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.780> it's<00:03:48.080> just<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:49.220> app

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
anything with it it's just the app

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.880 
anything with it it's just the app
drawer<00:03:49.790> actually<00:03:50.390> this<00:03:50.900> is<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.140> stock<00:03:51.560> grid

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
drawer actually this is the stock grid

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.250 
drawer actually this is the stock grid
size<00:03:52.100> 4<00:03:52.970> by<00:03:53.090> 5<00:03:53.300> this<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.870> what<00:03:54.050> it<00:03:54.140> would<00:03:54.170> look

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
size 4 by 5 this is what it would look

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.610 
size 4 by 5 this is what it would look
like<00:03:54.410> on<00:03:54.800> my<00:03:55.490> tablet<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.180> look<00:03:57.140> even<00:03:57.290> worse

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
like on my tablet and it look even worse

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.480 
like on my tablet and it look even worse
on<00:03:58.010> my<00:03:58.340> tablet<00:03:59.060> without<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.590> LCD<00:04:01.310> density

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
on my tablet without the LCD density

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.300 
on my tablet without the LCD density
changes<00:04:02.210> so<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.720> hope<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.650> looks<00:04:03.770> better<00:04:03.980> on<00:04:04.130> the

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310
