play<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:05.390> just<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.319> little<00:04:06.530> load<00:04:06.680> up<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.970> let's

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
play on just a little load up and let's

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.660 
play on just a little load up and let's
just<00:04:08.780> see<00:04:08.959> now<00:04:08.990> this<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.770> see<00:04:09.950> whether<00:04:10.130> can

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
just see now this is to see whether can

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.570 
just see now this is to see whether can
you<00:04:10.790> go<00:04:10.940> options<00:04:11.680> video<00:04:12.680> settings<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.370> there

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
you go options video settings and there

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.220 
you go options video settings and there
should<00:04:13.850> be<00:04:14.030> all<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.420> normal<00:04:14.690> things<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.140> then

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
should be all the normal things and then

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.840 
should be all the normal things and then
there<00:04:15.440> should<00:04:15.590> be<00:04:15.620> things<00:04:15.860> like<00:04:16.010> fast

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
there should be things like fast

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.150 
there should be things like fast
I<00:04:16.880> mean<00:04:17.209> fog<00:04:17.510> fog<00:04:18.230> start<00:04:18.530> quality<00:04:18.950> details

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
I mean fog fog start quality details

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.420 
I mean fog fog start quality details
animation<00:04:19.910> so<00:04:20.150> now<00:04:20.780> you<00:04:20.840> know<00:04:21.200> that<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:22.220> is

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
animation so now you know that it is

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.640 
animation so now you know that it is
actually<00:04:22.610> working<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.960> best<00:04:24.200> settings

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650

this<00:04:41.450> before<00:04:42.730> I'm<00:04:43.730> going<00:04:43.850> to<00:04:43.910> put<00:04:44.210> that<00:04:45.040> zero

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
this before I'm going to put that zero

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.490

because<00:04:47.360> with<00:04:47.660> Lighting's<00:04:47.990> better<00:04:48.200> if<00:04:48.350> it's

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
because with Lighting's better if it's

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.680 
because with Lighting's better if it's
off<00:04:49.000> brightness<00:04:50.000> I'm<00:04:50.150> gonna<00:04:50.270> put<00:04:50.390> that<00:04:50.510> up

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
off brightness I'm gonna put that up

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.710 
off brightness I'm gonna put that up
because<00:04:50.810> I<00:04:51.229> don't<00:04:51.350> like<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:51.830> when<00:04:51.919> it's<00:04:52.040> crap

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
to go into quality and basically you'll

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.620 
to go into quality and basically you'll
want<00:05:48.289> to<00:05:48.350> turn<00:05:48.620> most<00:05:49.250> of<00:05:49.520> this<00:05:49.700> off<00:05:49.970> so<00:05:50.210> example

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
want to turn most of this off so example

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.390

it keeps lying out in this and

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.180 
it keeps lying out in this and
why<00:06:07.880> are<00:06:08.180> we<00:06:08.270> doing<00:06:08.390> a<00:06:08.540> lot<00:06:08.690> to<00:06:08.870> it<00:06:11.140> and<00:06:12.190> you

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
why are we doing a lot to it and you

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.690 
why are we doing a lot to it and you
want<00:06:13.310> to<00:06:13.460> go<00:06:13.520> animations<00:06:14.360> and<00:06:15.340> you<00:06:16.340> can<00:06:16.520> keep

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
want to go animations and you can keep

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.220 
want to go animations and you can keep
them<00:06:16.850> all<00:06:17.030> on<00:06:17.210> but<00:06:17.300> particles<00:06:18.020> down<00:06:18.170> to

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
them all on but particles down to

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.930 
them all on but particles down to
minimal<00:06:18.770> it<00:06:19.130> doesn't<00:06:19.400> really<00:06:19.490> matter<00:06:19.730> what

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
minimal it doesn't really matter what

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.130 
minimal it doesn't really matter what
you<00:06:20.000> have<00:06:20.180> on<00:06:20.360> but<00:06:20.510> I<00:06:20.570> normally<00:06:20.960> turn

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
you have on but I normally turn

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.230 
you have on but I normally turn
everything<00:06:21.530> off<00:06:21.890> and<00:06:21.950> then<00:06:22.520> turn<00:06:23.590> water<00:06:24.590> fire

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
everything off and then turn water fire

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.030 
everything off and then turn water fire
redstone<00:06:28.270> just<00:06:29.270> lagging<00:06:29.690> out<00:06:29.780> a<00:06:29.840> lot<00:06:30.290> yes<00:06:31.010> a

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
redstone just lagging out a lot yes a

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.090 
redstone just lagging out a lot yes a
water<00:06:31.370> fire<00:06:31.670> redstone<00:06:32.090> lava<00:06:32.810> and<00:06:33.260> portal<00:06:33.950> on

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
water fire redstone lava and portal on

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.730 
water fire redstone lava and portal on
that's<00:06:34.310> normally<00:06:34.640> what<00:06:34.760> I<00:06:34.790> keep<00:06:35.000> on<00:06:38.590> so<00:06:39.590> once

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
that's normally what I keep on so once

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.050 
that's normally what I keep on so once
you've<00:06:39.890> done<00:06:40.010> that<00:06:40.070> you<00:06:40.550> can<00:06:40.670> go<00:06:40.730> into

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
you've done that you can go into

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.810 
you've done that you can go into
performance<00:06:44.740> lazy<00:06:45.740> chunk<00:06:46.160> load<00:06:46.310> now<00:06:46.490> this<00:06:46.670> is

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
performance lazy chunk load now this is

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:54.760 
performance lazy chunk load now this is
new<00:06:47.150> just<00:06:48.250> smoothing<00:06:49.250> it<00:06:53.140> just<00:06:54.140> you<00:06:54.380> can<00:06:54.530> try

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
new just smoothing it just you can try

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.200 
new just smoothing it just you can try
that<00:06:55.010> out<00:06:55.190> you<00:06:55.490> can<00:06:55.720> try<00:06:56.720> that<00:06:57.020> on<00:06:57.200> on<00:06:57.500> or<00:06:57.650> off

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
that out you can try that on on or off

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.940 
that out you can try that on on or off
I'll<00:06:59.210> try<00:06:59.780> that<00:06:59.810> on<00:06:59.990> on<00:07:00.350> because<00:07:00.680> I<00:07:00.770> have<00:07:00.860> a

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
I'll try that on on because I have a

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.840 
I'll try that on on because I have a
crap<00:07:01.460> computer<00:07:02.320> and<00:07:03.320> then<00:07:04.010> texture<00:07:04.580> packs

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
crap computer and then texture packs

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.480 
crap computer and then texture packs
yeah<00:07:05.180> it<00:07:05.330> doesn't<00:07:05.540> really<00:07:05.630> matter<00:07:05.930> than<00:07:06.230> other

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
yeah it doesn't really matter than other

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.310 
yeah it doesn't really matter than other
weather<00:07:07.490> off<00:07:07.870> full-screen<00:07:08.870> mode<00:07:08.990> off

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
weather off full-screen mode off

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.440 
weather off full-screen mode off
autosave<00:07:09.950> 30<00:07:10.370> minutes<00:07:10.880> it's<00:07:11.120> pretty

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450 
autosave 30 minutes it's pretty

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.790 
autosave 30 minutes it's pretty
important<00:07:11.930> and<00:07:12.050> then<00:07:12.980> should<00:07:13.550> be<00:07:13.630> done<00:07:14.650> so<00:07:15.650> now

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
important and then should be done so now

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.670 
important and then should be done so now
I<00:07:15.830> was<00:07:16.100> lagging<00:07:16.370> it<00:07:16.670> now<00:07:17.000> it<00:07:17.930> just<00:07:17.990> has<00:07:18.380> to<00:07:18.500> load

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
I was lagging it now it just has to load

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.300 
I was lagging it now it just has to load
everything<00:07:18.860> up<00:07:19.280> again<00:07:19.580> she's<00:07:19.880> like<00:07:20.180> intensely

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
everything up again she's like intensely

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.520 
everything up again she's like intensely
and<00:07:22.310> I<00:07:22.820> still<00:07:23.150> have<00:07:23.300> crap<00:07:23.600> FPS<00:07:24.080> I<00:07:24.260> don't<00:07:24.440> know

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530 
and I still have crap FPS I don't know

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.230 
and I still have crap FPS I don't know
why<00:07:24.800> normally<00:07:25.460> have<00:07:25.610> a<00:07:25.640> lot<00:07:25.850> better<00:07:25.970> than<00:07:26.090> this

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 
why normally have a lot better than this

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.910 
why normally have a lot better than this
maybe<00:07:26.510> because<00:07:26.750> I'm<00:07:26.960> recording<00:07:27.140> at<00:07:27.620> the<00:07:27.710> same

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:27.920 
maybe because I'm recording at the same

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.710 
maybe because I'm recording at the same
time<00:07:28.190> yeah<00:07:28.490> that's<00:07:28.700> probably<00:07:28.910> why<00:07:29.030> so<00:07:29.600> I'm

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 
time yeah that's probably why so I'm

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.350 
time yeah that's probably why so I'm
just<00:07:29.810> gonna<00:07:29.930> turn<00:07:30.140> music<00:07:30.320> off<00:07:30.740> and<00:07:31.160> sound<00:07:32.060> to

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 
just gonna turn music off and sound to

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.030 
just gonna turn music off and sound to
about<00:07:32.890> 20<00:07:33.920> I<00:07:34.190> like<00:07:34.400> FFA<00:07:34.910> at<00:07:35.000> 90<00:07:35.800> but<00:07:36.800> because

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.040 
about 20 I like FFA at 90 but because

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.780 
about 20 I like FFA at 90 but because
I'm<00:07:37.160> recording<00:07:37.310> it<00:07:38.440> is<00:07:39.440> pretty<00:07:39.830> bad<00:07:40.010> otherwise

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:40.790 
I'm recording it is pretty bad otherwise

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.760 
I'm recording it is pretty bad otherwise
