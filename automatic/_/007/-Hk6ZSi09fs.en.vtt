repaired<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.300> ahead<00:04:49.540> a<00:04:49.570> couple<00:04:49.780> laser<00:04:50.080> rifles

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
repaired it ahead a couple laser rifles

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.740 
repaired it ahead a couple laser rifles
on<00:04:50.770> hand<00:04:50.980> so<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.250> prepared<00:04:51.940> it<00:04:52.060> my<00:04:52.450> energy

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
on hand so I prepared it my energy

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.720 
on hand so I prepared it my energy
weapons<00:04:53.050> goes<00:04:53.260> very<00:04:53.410> low<00:04:53.680> it's<00:04:54.430> right<00:04:54.610> now

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
weapons goes very low it's right now

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.090 
weapons goes very low it's right now
it's<00:04:54.760> doing<00:04:55.270> 21<00:04:55.780> but<00:04:56.050> at<00:04:56.140> full<00:04:56.320> condition<00:04:56.530> and

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
it's doing 21 but at full condition and

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.300 
it's doing 21 but at full condition and
with<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.480> level<00:04:59.110> 100<00:04:59.230> energy<00:04:59.650> weapons<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.190> does

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
with a level 100 energy weapons it does

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.000 
with a level 100 energy weapons it does
35<00:05:00.820> compared<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.660> regular<00:05:02.140> laser<00:05:02.590> rifles

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
35 compared to the regular laser rifles

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.830 
35 compared to the regular laser rifles
22<00:05:04.260> so<00:05:05.260> here<00:05:05.530> I'm<00:05:05.620> gonna<00:05:05.710> quit<00:05:06.540> so<00:05:07.540> as<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:07.720> can

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
22 so here I'm gonna quit so as you can

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.070 
22 so here I'm gonna quit so as you can
see<00:05:08.940> as<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.000> does<00:05:10.330> say<00:05:10.510> it's<00:05:10.660> prototype

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
see as it does say it's prototype

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.730 
see as it does say it's prototype
there's<00:05:11.320> wiring<00:05:11.770> all<00:05:11.920> around<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.880> weapon<00:05:13.740> but

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
there's wiring all around the weapon but

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.260 
there's wiring all around the weapon but
it<00:05:15.040> adds<00:05:15.250> to<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.610> character<00:05:15.940> of<00:05:15.970> the<00:05:16.090> gun<00:05:16.240> I

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
it adds to the character of the gun I

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.290 
it adds to the character of the gun I
think<00:05:16.570> it's<00:05:16.780> pretty<00:05:16.990> cool<00:05:17.730> so<00:05:18.730> excited<00:05:19.240> this

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
think it's pretty cool so excited this

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.810 
think it's pretty cool so excited this
35<00:05:19.750> compared<00:05:20.170> to<00:05:20.230> 22<00:05:20.620> so<00:05:20.890> it's<00:05:21.040> substantially

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
35 compared to 22 so it's substantially

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.640 
35 compared to 22 so it's substantially
more<00:05:21.940> damaging<00:05:22.420> and<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.230> first<00:05:23.410> thing<00:05:23.530> you'll

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
more damaging and the first thing you'll

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.170 
more damaging and the first thing you'll
notice<00:05:23.830> is<00:05:24.070> it<00:05:24.220> doesn't<00:05:24.400> fire<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.730> red<00:05:24.850> beam<00:05:25.030> it

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
notice is it doesn't fire it red beam it

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.010 
notice is it doesn't fire it red beam it
fires<00:05:25.360> a<00:05:25.480> green<00:05:25.690> one

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
fires a green one

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.370 
fires a green one
so<00:05:27.150> it's<00:05:28.150> got<00:05:28.300> a<00:05:28.330> slightly<00:05:28.630> higher<00:05:28.900> fire<00:05:29.260> rate

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
so it's got a slightly higher fire rate

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.730 
so it's got a slightly higher fire rate
to<00:05:30.060> slightly<00:05:31.060> less<00:05:31.300> spread<00:05:31.630> it's<00:05:32.560> got<00:05:32.710> a

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
to slightly less spread it's got a

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.470 
to slightly less spread it's got a
higher<00:05:32.950> critical<00:05:33.160> multi-hit<00:05:33.730> critical<00:05:34.360> hit

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
higher critical multi-hit critical hit

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.560 
higher critical multi-hit critical hit
multiplier<00:05:34.960> higher<00:05:35.590> critical<00:05:36.100> damage<00:05:36.570> also

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
multiplier higher critical damage also

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.450 
multiplier higher critical damage also
it<00:05:37.720> uses<00:05:37.870> too<00:05:38.380> much<00:05:38.590> confusion<00:05:38.770> cells<00:05:39.190> instead

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
it uses too much confusion cells instead

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.360 
it uses too much confusion cells instead
of<00:05:39.550> one<00:05:39.760> the<00:05:40.530> next<00:05:41.530> that's<00:05:41.770> got<00:05:41.920> a<00:05:41.950> green<00:05:42.190> beam

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
of one the next that's got a green beam

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.070 
of one the next that's got a green beam
it<00:05:42.580> does<00:05:42.760> away<00:05:42.940> point<00:05:43.240> five<00:05:43.450> more<00:05:43.780> than<00:05:43.990> the

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
it does away point five more than the

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.930 
it does away point five more than the
regular<00:05:44.440> laser<00:05:44.620> rifle<00:05:45.040> let's<00:05:45.400> say<00:05:45.520> point<00:05:45.760> five

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
regular laser rifle let's say point five

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.620 
regular laser rifle let's say point five
eight<00:05:46.450> and<00:05:47.520> another<00:05:48.520> downside<00:05:48.970> is<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:49.390> does

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
eight and another downside is it does

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.920 
eight and another downside is it does
have<00:05:50.440> 25<00:05:51.040> less<00:05:51.400> item<00:05:51.850> HP<00:05:52.180> than<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.600> regular

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
have 25 less item HP than the regular

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.470 
have 25 less item HP than the regular
laser<00:05:53.200> rifle<00:05:53.650> well<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.670> makes<00:05:54.820> up<00:05:54.970> for<00:05:55.000> that<00:05:55.270> by

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
laser rifle well it makes up for that by

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.170 
laser rifle well it makes up for that by
doing<00:05:55.750> more<00:05:55.930> damage<00:05:56.700> in<00:05:57.700> having<00:05:57.970> a<00:05:58.030> higher

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
doing more damage in having a higher

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.930 
doing more damage in having a higher
critical<00:05:58.630> hit<00:05:58.840> ratio

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.240 

so<00:06:02.940> as<00:06:03.030> you<00:06:03.150> can<00:06:03.210> see<00:06:03.330> my<00:06:03.540> laser<00:06:03.950> rifle<00:06:04.950> and<00:06:05.190> the

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
so as you can see my laser rifle and the

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.070 
so as you can see my laser rifle and the
energy<00:06:05.580> weapons<00:06:05.910> is<00:06:06.000> terrible

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
energy weapons is terrible

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.450 
energy weapons is terrible
because<00:06:07.470> I'm<00:06:07.590> like<00:06:07.800> doing<00:06:07.980> no<00:06:08.100> damage<00:06:08.130> to

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
because I'm like doing no damage to

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.670 
because I'm like doing no damage to
birds<00:06:08.790> but<00:06:09.720> if<00:06:09.810> you're<00:06:09.930> a<00:06:09.960> ninja<00:06:10.140> weapons<00:06:10.530> user

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
birds but if you're a ninja weapons user

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.100 
birds but if you're a ninja weapons user
this<00:06:10.890> is<00:06:10.950> a<00:06:11.130> really<00:06:12.060> good<00:06:12.210> replacement<00:06:12.450> to<00:06:12.870> the

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
this is a really good replacement to the

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.230 
this is a really good replacement to the
regular<00:06:13.440> laser<00:06:13.620> rifle<00:06:14.040> because<00:06:14.670> it<00:06:14.940> can<00:06:15.060> take

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
regular laser rifle because it can take

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.660 
regular laser rifle because it can take
down<00:06:15.390> targets<00:06:15.750> much<00:06:16.170> faster<00:06:16.530> than<00:06:16.650> a<00:06:16.980> standard

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
down targets much faster than a standard

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.320 
down targets much faster than a standard
one<00:06:17.820> can<00:06:18.470> and<00:06:19.470> so<00:06:19.650> yeah<00:06:19.860> there<00:06:20.430> you<00:06:20.490> go<00:06:20.550> let's

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
one can and so yeah there you go let's

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.810 
one can and so yeah there you go let's
say<00:06:21.420> you<00:06:21.510> get<00:06:21.570> the<00:06:21.720> AER<00:06:21.960> 14<00:06:22.470> prototype<00:06:22.920> doing

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
say you get the AER 14 prototype doing

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.280 
say you get the AER 14 prototype doing
it<00:06:23.910> the<00:06:24.030> long<00:06:24.180> method<00:06:24.600> if<00:06:24.780> you<00:06:24.870> don't<00:06:25.140> have

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
it the long method if you don't have

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.070 
it the long method if you don't have
repair<00:06:25.710> to<00:06:25.980> fix<00:06:26.220> the<00:06:26.310> elevator<00:06:26.640> and<00:06:27.120> so<00:06:27.900> I'll
