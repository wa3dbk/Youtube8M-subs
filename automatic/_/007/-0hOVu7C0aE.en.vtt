00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:12.120
 [Music] 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.889
 nice guys are darkest beppe 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.520
 welcome to my channel 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.240
 today we are here on fifa 13 naga excuse me 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.400
 absence for four days but 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.699
 unfortunately I didn't have the playstation 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.199
 in the computer to record and therefore me 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.380
 sorry not to have warned you for 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.840
 this my absence 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.460
 but now I hope for at least some 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.489
 apple day leave the play and the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.770
 computer anyway let's start mine immediately 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.329
 this is the premier league goalkeeper 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.989
 a lara premier league team 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.510
 gut loris really strong i use it 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.120
 holder is the beast I thought not 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.850
 there was a stronger goalkeeper than art though 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.280
 re it just beats it really doesn't have it then 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.699
 we have the three central defenders 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.910
 There have I usually use to kabul 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.879
 the left towards the company use center 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.769
 and towards the right I usually use 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.000
 david luiz 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:11.159
 then or vice versa then the module 3 5 2 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.040
 that of juventus because I was 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.439
 started at the beginning already with this but then 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 I really changed to see what it was 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.530
 best 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.640
 and finally I came back to this 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.979
 because I find myself really well then i 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.380
 midfield are me 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:34.259
 usually towards ie usually towards 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.909
 the left I use branches and ramires and then 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.470
 to the right I use three hours and why 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.960
 really they are midfielders who 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.439
 run like hell then three hours is a 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000
 pinch let's say stronger on one side 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.750
 poorer on the other because ramires 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.470
 he runs a lot and instead he catches up 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.500
 many balloons 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.479
 therefore all contribute eventually 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.820
 two to make the right midfield no to 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.509
 end then as left exterior we have 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.009
 hazard that I usually also use joe 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.149
 copy because they both run like 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.230
 damned and then as a right-handed outsider 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.090
 we have these 3 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.459
 usually due valentia otherwise ce 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.760
 they have the same walcott walnut because 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.030
 they all run very fast my name is is 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.640
 escaped a burp and still guys ve 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.250
 I recommend it because I really was 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.049
 started with this at the beginning of fifa 13 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.599
 and I'm back here at the end with this one 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.519
 therefore then as co coc ie 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.069
 trequartista use nasri raga nasri is 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.260
 really the fast beast that good 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.579
 a nice shot I recommend it costs you not 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.920
 he knows so much in brought on 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.500
 30 thousand seems to me that it is really worth it 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.900
 worth buying so I recommend it 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.670
 strongly because in the premier league 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.640
 players are hardly found with 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.069
 these pd here but then it depends on you the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.310
 your style of play then like the 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:02.379
 according to how I attack then how 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.660
 holders use van persie and aguero in van 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.400
 I didn't think she was that fast 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.040
 because it really will be me faster than 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.690
 aguero then I do not know there are days that 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.049
 days are faster than aguero 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.790
 that faster van persie depended however 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.590
 a mess a shot from the madonna nagar 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.419
 in fact, I took it for this too 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.709
 I also took it as a bank because it is 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:26.440
 quite a nice body and then as a coach 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.079
 we captain don't remember the 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.669
 name but does nothing 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.989
 however the thing here is the team 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.389
 holder now I'll show you a little 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.980
 of substitutions that they too do 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.200
 part of the owners because the end is 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.609
 all strong then iso returned to the 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.519
 premier league because I didn't know that 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.280
 other ex others she didn't know how to do others 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.919
 teams because in the end I turned them 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.310
 almost all the strongest Italian with the 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:53.019
 German then what is it that I shot with the 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.510
 Spanish year with the Spanish I have not 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.160
 however I made it at the beginning 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.739
 at first I do n't feel well at all 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.440
 with were so much and we suck 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.879
 then the Brazilian one my little surprised in 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.019
 attack because it sucked enough 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:10.209
 da da is called from neymar but waited 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.680
 a little more from the price however to the 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.989
 end I returned to the premier league 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.790
 and I must say that I will stay here for a long time 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.760
 of the solar the series begins I will begin 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.359
 with this one he roams for the road to 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.359
 division one 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.090
 and nothing this war is my team 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:30.990
 which I will use for a long while fed up with why 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.550
 I think I don't change them anymore 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.050
 I hope I saw you enjoyed raga 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.590
 this is my perfect team here 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.669
 in fact the roda will begin with this 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.400
 left a nice live with comment 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.050

 sorry for the absence of the race of these 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.740
 four days, unfortunately, it touches me 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.930
 to do so by not having things the school there 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.639
