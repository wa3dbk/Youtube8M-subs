00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:16.139
 just writing the same thing with checking 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.359
 more difficult it means I got the store in 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.359
 will follow immediately after the girl 2 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:36.059
 that's about it means so explain again 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.920
 on which all fall right on 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.920
 couch shutter look carefully you 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.719
 break the sequence of the tree and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.480
 start like this just who forgets 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.710
 it's interesting to start 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:58.020
 look very slowly I circled 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:01:02.340
 movement in one did not even drive 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.780
 work correctly means that any more 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.450
 the questions here are disassembly assembly now 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.010
 disassembly-assembly when the flight is under 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.010
 mine understandably means 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:27.940
 I took off which I immediately put here and 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.550
 try to put the shutter wrong and here on 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.000
 I understand this part 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.700
 spring this cultural will do by 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.690
 C grade that's put Behrens Thorne 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.760
 one more species 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.230
 further now i'm working slowly 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.620
 so as not to wear naturally this 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.950
 part 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.940
 I once screwed I took off because they shutter 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.070
 should this part be like here 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.500
 this to be to me why if you are now 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.240
 I'll take it like this 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.960
 smoke see me cover another cartridge 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.960
 bent
