 the cursors will come in this file as 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.099
 you can arrive like a little folder what 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.749
 what we have to do is copy the luce 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.560
 the theme of the various cursors and good 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:20.870
 we copy 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.390
 right to copy we came here in the 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.840
 cursor program folder we expose 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.250
 equity in systems according to themes and 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.250
 here we paste the cursor 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.610
 we give them continue 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.239
 and I have already done this what we have to 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.510
 to do is to come here in the forerunner 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.450
 there we open it and then as 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.060

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.099
 cursors according 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.260

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.600
 state is coming out comes with the 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.340
 Program 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.280

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.310
 and good here are the courses that 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.170
 we have to do we have chosen the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.500
 cursor that we want to install we are going to 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.840

 We accept and you will have the 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.120
 cursor 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.400
 but I wanted to give you a warning that 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.230
 times when we open the program that 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.140
 we want to install the cursors so 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.630
 unless it happens to me that I give it here and 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.120
 I give to apply for example you must apply and 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.430
 it does not change, I do not change my cursor and 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.590
 to accept and nothing changes me what 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.980
 you have to do is to restart our 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.080
 pc reopen the program and choose 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.570

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.760
 agreement and I am sure that you will 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.440
