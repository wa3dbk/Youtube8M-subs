00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 they interrogate anonymous company inputs and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.250
 livestock services 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.300
 this an introduction program when 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.599
 we say introduction is because 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.860
 it is practically in the phase of 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.420
 experimentation 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.430
 that is worth the redundancy 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.890
 experiments of sense sectors already 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.990
 it would be a commercial planting without 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.090
 However, this experimentation is a 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.740
 experience that is being done in 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.700
 the states of the east of the country 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:42.100
 monagas anzoátegui this experience is 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.489
 has brought from these regions of the state 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.680
 from venezuela from eastern venezuela 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.100
 where the floors are quite acidic 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.000
 infertile in the planta de campoalegre 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.730
 specifically where we are doing 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.040
 this work the floors are of a 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.260
 strong fertility I would say 50 per 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.130
 higher than what we have in the 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.240
 zone of monagas and deán suave with ph of 5 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.310
 or 6 we have certain calcium levels 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.050
 about 200 parts per million of calcium 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.840
 we have a match in six part by 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.560
 million and we have a potassium in 100 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.140
 parts per million means with this in 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.590
 that is not going to fertilize or mushroom 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.940
 fertilizing that we are using with 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.160
 1500 kilos 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.330
 of dolomitic lime when we say 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.660
 dolomitic is calcium and magnesium by 5% 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.420
 We are talking about 750 kilos of 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.580
 calcium carbonate per stage and 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.010
 we have a fertilization program 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.740
 basic because you want soy everything 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.920
 more is very demanding in calcium the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.440
 magnesium in phosphorus and in potassium with a 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.980
 minimum nitrogen fertilization and a 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.720
 foliar fertilization there are micro elements 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.030
 in the tropics region in the state 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.570
 barinas that are very deficient moles 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.430
 how is boron manganese the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.520
 molybdenum remember that in tolls 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.770
 acids there is almost no molybdenum then 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.230
 this fertilization are based on these 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.210
 micro elements in general not but 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.190
 emphasizing boron because the one that 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.370
 causes the fall of the flower and the fall of 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.680
 the pod the molybdenum that is number one 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.170
 for legumes that almost does not exist 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.700
 in the tropics and another series of micro 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.980
 elements that are in this 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.440
 foliar fertilizer complex 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.180
 we are also talking as one said 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.970
 of the co-owners that is the lord 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.640
 with víctor rodríguez padrón is the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.459
 main function is intrusion of 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.040
 varieties resistant or adapted to 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.459
 tropic as it was what he named the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.099
 the boa looks already the peta the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.010
 samba and the Ecuadorian we have in 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:56.569
 this shelf 62 hectares with a 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.690
 population of 400,000 plants per 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.690
 hectare
