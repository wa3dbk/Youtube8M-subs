00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
of ways he's also just as intense as

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.400 
of ways he's also just as intense as
John<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.730> just<00:04:05.760> hey<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.359> hate<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.870> idea<00:04:07.019> though

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
John I just hey I hate that idea though

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.629 
John I just hey I hate that idea though
that<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.620> got<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:07.889> be<00:04:07.980> different<00:04:08.340> from<00:04:08.400> your

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
that you got to be different from your

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.220 
that you got to be different from your
last<00:04:08.790> coach<00:04:09.120> but<00:04:09.419> it<00:04:09.510> seems<00:04:09.780> like<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:09.989> lot<00:04:10.199> of

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
last coach but it seems like a lot of

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.470 
last coach but it seems like a lot of
teams<00:04:10.530> do<00:04:10.769> that<00:04:10.980> but<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.519> think<00:04:11.609> I<00:04:11.849> think<00:04:12.030> our

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
teams do that but I think I think our

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.409 
teams do that but I think I think our
fans<00:04:12.810> know<00:04:13.169> ok<00:04:14.010> with<00:04:14.459> John<00:04:14.669> Tortorella<00:04:15.030> kicked

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
fans know ok with John Tortorella kicked

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.210 
fans know ok with John Tortorella kicked
ass<00:04:15.569> so<00:04:15.780> let's<00:04:15.930> go<00:04:16.049> completely<00:04:16.349> opposite<00:04:17.010> no

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
ass so let's go completely opposite no

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.740 
ass so let's go completely opposite no
but<00:04:17.370> listen<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.729> agree<00:04:17.970> with<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.359> think<00:04:18.479> this

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
but listen I agree with you I think this

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.939 
but listen I agree with you I think this
is<00:04:18.930> brilliant<00:04:19.109> in<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.530> you're<00:04:19.709> kind<00:04:19.889> of

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
is brilliant in that you're kind of

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.800 
is brilliant in that you're kind of
walking<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.370> line<00:04:20.519> on<00:04:20.699> both<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.030> this<00:04:21.180> one<00:04:21.329> he

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
walking the line on both on this one he

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.360 
walking the line on both on this one he
is<00:04:21.840> different<00:04:22.229> but<00:04:22.890> he's<00:04:23.010> still<00:04:23.190> got<00:04:23.340> that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
is different but he's still got that

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.830 
is different but he's still got that
edge<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:24.000> think<00:04:24.210> every<00:04:24.419> coach<00:04:24.599> needs

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
edge and I think every coach needs

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.000 
edge and I think every coach needs
because<00:04:25.140> you<00:04:25.229> just<00:04:25.320> can't<00:04:25.500> let<00:04:25.590> these<00:04:25.710> guys<00:04:25.770> do

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
because you just can't let these guys do

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.750 
because you just can't let these guys do
whatever<00:04:26.159> they<00:04:26.340> want
