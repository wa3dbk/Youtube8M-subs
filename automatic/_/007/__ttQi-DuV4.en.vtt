00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 m 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.400
 yes thank you for allowing me to do it again 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:28.439
 Look at it, I'm amazing 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.820
 athletic and sometimes I still try 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.589
 to be a bit sportier than 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.730
 otherwise 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.379
 when I'm not three weeks apart 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.970
 I got one in the gym 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.489
 automatically generated male in the 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.680
 about the following stand-alone him yes 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.910
 your studio team has just asked 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.809
 why you have not been there for so long 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.159
 Training were lacking the motivation 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.640
 are you currently not so good 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.089
 or are there any other reasons no matter what 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.290
 is 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.760
 please contact me I thought briefly 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.930
 a very long amount back to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.189
 I write about it in detail 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.510
 all dates in the last three weeks 

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:02.449
 Report my private problems 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.110
 spread and excuse me 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.729
 I am the next day instead 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.909
 just gone back to the studio 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.259
 i hate my bad sport 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.790
 is one of the things I milk 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.890
 eat rice and go to funerals 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.510
 dear ones always make sad 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.770
 again in this unfortunate place 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.450
 the fitness studio is located directly 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.040
 next to my office is also the only one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.990
 Reason why I signed in there 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.980
 I then no more talk got it 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.660
 right next door 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.920
 I force my time with something 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.630
 I just hate that because I hate it 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.380
 I think I have to do that because it's healthy 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.300
 should be 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.340
 of it times from what I do there 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.050
 not healthy every two weeks over 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.670
 look on the crosstrainer and jerk 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.950
 then go to the muscle building circle 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.420
 not healthy I start all 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.850
 two weeks of forums in my muscles 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.870
 build 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.860
 in between, I have muscle ache and 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.930
 my connection builds up 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.340
 sparse muscles off as me 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.900
 initially really regular against 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.280
 comprised of one my upper arm and the 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.100
 Tense him so much that my head 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.750
 He almost burst out looking at me questioningly 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.540
 and said yes now exciting 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.000
 since then I had him and my upper arm 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.740
 and whenever I am in this circle 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.060
 sit and my biceps triceps awesome 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.500
 I have to train one's muscles 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.349
 screen staring at the studio 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.459
 For example, team tips are 70 of the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.190
 Training success depends on the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.150
 from aha I think and meditate 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.000
 About the pasta I follow me 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.920
 a whistle will mean with nutrition 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.660
 the studio but the egg white drinks 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.190
 that's what the actual diet is 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.480
 drinks that look like milk shakes 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.040
 but not half as good taste 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.140
 it's so awful that I'm the same 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.670
 get more hunger on good days 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.900
 I still visit after the muscle building 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.510
 one of these courses they have times 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.239
 so crazy names core workouts of fat 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.230
 Burner and bbp 2 are in reality 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.280
 all synonyms for sweat 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.900
 Now you have to say I am one 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.130
 difficult patient after knee-op and 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.630
 various problems of the kneecap 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.030
 Water in the knee and wrong handling is 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.440
 extremely unfavorable if your hops do not care 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.640
 which form I have with it 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.590
 a good excuse for the right one 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.810
 make strenuous courses instead 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.580
 I pilates 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.780
 Pilates is also synonymous with breathing 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.160
 the most important thing is pilates 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.569
 that one thinks about his power 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.980
 then your powerhouse calls the trainer 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.350
 about every five seconds thinks then yours 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.350
 powerhouse will tense up that 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.260
 Powerhouse is the belly my stomach has 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.019
 very little to do with a power house 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.580
 rather with a relaxation center or 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.730
 a specialty store for particularly soft 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.209
 mattresses 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.230
 Of course, I still try anyway 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.670
 Of course I try the powerhouse 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.010
 I can think so too 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.150
 fully utilized all others in the course 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.680
 make a thousand others in parallel 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.390
 things their legs in the height heave a 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.750
 ball in between pinching breathing I think 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.579
 only to bauhaus the breathing technique is at 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.049
 pilates super important at certain 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.060
 you have to inhale and to others 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.560
 again exhale with it the stupidest 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.180
 Heads in the course that makes it happen 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.640
 trainer inhale that very loudly and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.650
 exhale again 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.310
 there are people who do the same 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.240
 after breathing as well as every 30 felt 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.709
 Participants with 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.569
 I do not want that someone for 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.400
 It does not take me alone to breathe 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.450
 at least and if I'm alone 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.230
 You can do sports because I want that too 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.360
 do it alone 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.709
 they are annoying me 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.480
 shortest time and then I can at 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.950
 Do not think anymore except breathe and mouth 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.630
 probably not to hus or tense 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.010
 let alone the fact that where just 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.630
 other which leg of mine are 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.830
 should support that 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.940
 But the worst thing about this course is 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.739
 not the participants either 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.070
 Coach no, the worst of all 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.540
 the glass windows in short distances 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.740
 People come to these glass windows 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.370
 or go past them and look 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.050
 pure as in the zoo on the info for it 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.020
 could stand here you look desperate 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.260
 People breathing while trying fitter 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.310
 please do not feed and if 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.310
 only with protein shakes 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.840
 whenever whenever someone looks 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.919
 I feel pressured 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.139
 I give myself then for five seconds 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.330
 special effortless hardly looks the human 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.409
 do not break anymore together still knows 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.900
 not if that really is the meaning of 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.370
 Pilates is the most beautiful thing about sports 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.050
 After a shower, take a shower 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.280
 Good conscience that you should say 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.560
 but again, if you're in the spring 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.939
 it will do so on the long hike 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.500
 as if it were the most natural of the world for 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.479
 to go to sports regularly 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.610
 of course I do sport regularly 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.539
 Body needs it as you do it 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.409
 not there you have to know yourself 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.580
 So I'm at least twice that 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.889
 week there is really good for 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.419
 my joints and three weeks later 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:34.620
 I will get a mail again 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:36.479
 thank you so much we even hold us 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.110
 not for long but you leave that 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.110
 kill
