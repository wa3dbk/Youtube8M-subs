00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
ridiculous a little bit more noticeable

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.740 
ridiculous a little bit more noticeable
because<00:02:26.700> sometimes<00:02:27.180> people<00:02:27.330> don't<00:02:27.569> want<00:02:27.690> to

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
because sometimes people don't want to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.360 
because sometimes people don't want to
wave<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.440> when<00:02:28.830> they<00:02:28.920> don't<00:02:29.010> want<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> wave

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
you got to grab their attention a little

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.720 
you got to grab their attention a little
bit<00:02:30.750> more<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.680> what<00:02:32.220> we're<00:02:32.310> gonna<00:02:32.400> try<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.610> do

is and hopefully I can find a motorcycle

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.330 
is and hopefully I can find a motorcycle
pretty<00:02:43.410> soon<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:43.799> because<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.100> don't<00:02:44.250> really

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
pretty soon here because I don't really

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.880 
pretty soon here because I don't really
have<00:02:44.819> much<00:02:45.390> more<00:02:45.540> auto<00:02:45.720> ship<00:02:46.080> too<00:02:46.560> bad<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.739> had

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
have much more auto ship too bad I had

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.470 
have much more auto ship too bad I had
to<00:02:46.920> use<00:02:47.040> my<00:02:47.069> clutch<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.670> brake<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.269> one

from<00:06:42.700> Canada<00:06:42.940> I<00:06:43.150> think<00:06:43.240> but<00:06:43.780> fled<00:06:44.080> Canada<00:06:44.500> for

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
from Canada I think but fled Canada for

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.800 
from Canada I think but fled Canada for
legal<00:06:45.730> reasons<00:06:45.880> or<00:06:46.180> something<00:06:46.420> like<00:06:46.510> that<00:06:46.660> so

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
legal reasons or something like that so

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.130 
legal reasons or something like that so
he<00:06:46.870> wouldn't<00:06:47.050> have<00:06:47.200> to<00:06:47.350> pay<00:06:48.540> some<00:06:49.540> fines<00:06:49.780> or

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
he wouldn't have to pay some fines or

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.810 
he wouldn't have to pay some fines or
something<00:06:50.410> like<00:06:50.530> that<00:06:50.740> that<00:06:50.890> I<00:06:50.950> guess<00:06:51.220> he<00:06:51.640> got

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:51.820 
something like that that I guess he got

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.750 
something like that that I guess he got
but<00:06:52.180> luckily<00:06:52.630> for<00:06:52.750> me<00:06:52.810> I<00:06:53.310> haven't<00:06:54.310> got<00:06:54.490> any

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
haven't seen it by the way but I guess

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.100 
haven't seen it by the way but I guess
yeah<00:07:06.730> we<00:07:06.850> got<00:07:07.000> one<00:07:07.150> wave<00:07:07.510> in<00:07:07.720> there<00:07:07.960> I'll

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
yeah we got one wave in there I'll

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.380 
yeah we got one wave in there I'll
probably<00:07:08.230> end<00:07:08.590> it<00:07:08.740> here<00:07:09.160> but<00:07:09.460> I<00:07:09.760> might<00:07:10.240> make

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390 
probably end it here but I might make

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.500 
probably end it here but I might make
another<00:07:10.420> video<00:07:11.760> cut<00:07:12.760> this<00:07:12.850> one<00:07:12.970> off<00:07:13.030> here<00:07:13.360> and

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.510 
another video cut this one off here and

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.240 
another video cut this one off here and
then<00:07:13.660> make<00:07:13.900> another<00:07:14.140> video<00:07:14.350> if<00:07:14.800> I<00:07:14.920> get<00:07:15.070> some

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
then make another video if I get some

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.430 
then make another video if I get some
more<00:07:15.490> bikers<00:07:16.270> coming<00:07:16.630> my<00:07:16.840> way<00:07:16.870> but<00:07:17.260> I<00:07:17.290> guess

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
more bikers coming my way but I guess

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.060
