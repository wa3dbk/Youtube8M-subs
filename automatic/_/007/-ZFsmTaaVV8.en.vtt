00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
to pass word 32 times in that section

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.530 
to pass word 32 times in that section
and<00:01:20.299> here's<00:01:21.299> how<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.659> works

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
and here's how it works

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.899 
and here's how it works
once<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.689> gets<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.140> section<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.979> it

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
once it gets to that section here it

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:44.569 
once it gets to that section here it
will<00:01:27.000> start<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.420> fast-forward<00:01:27.810> process

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.010 

and<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.329> turned<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:47.549> long<00:01:47.789> clip<00:01:48.179> it's<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and I just turned that long clip it's a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.209 
and I just turned that long clip it's a
six-minute<00:01:49.679> clip<00:01:50.000> into<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.359> few<00:01:51.630> seconds

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
six-minute clip into just a few seconds

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.959 
six-minute clip into just a few seconds
and<00:01:53.329> from<00:01:54.329> there<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:55.189> finish<00:01:56.189> editing<00:01:56.369> or

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and from there you can finish editing or

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.899 
and from there you can finish editing or
do<00:01:57.899> whatever<00:01:58.110> you'd<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.219> then

do whatever you'd like to do and then

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.870 
do whatever you'd like to do and then
upload<00:02:00.359> it<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:01.049> YouTube<00:02:03.079> I<00:02:04.280> guess<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
