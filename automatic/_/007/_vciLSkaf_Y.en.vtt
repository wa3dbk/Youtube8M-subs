00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
point okay so you have one line go ahead

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.020 
point okay so you have one line go ahead
and<00:01:16.370> draw<00:01:17.370> another<00:01:17.610> line<00:01:18.050> quite<00:01:19.050> a<00:01:19.110> ways<00:01:19.260> away

to do is select both of them and then

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.030 
to do is select both of them and then
you<00:01:46.080> go<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.230> object

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.850 

go<00:01:50.700> down<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.880> path<00:01:51.260> excuse<00:01:52.260> me<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.710> down<00:01:52.830> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
go down to path excuse me go down to

gradient that's how you'll make your

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.670 
gradient that's how you'll make your
gradient<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.890> it's<00:03:34.670> black<00:03:35.209> here<00:03:35.659> and<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:36.319> ends

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
gradient so it's black here and it ends

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.530 
gradient so it's black here and it ends
in<00:03:36.769> this<00:03:36.980> turquoise<00:03:37.610> color<00:03:38.110> down<00:03:39.110> here<00:03:40.359> okay

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
in this turquoise color down here okay

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.009 
in this turquoise color down here okay
um<00:03:41.950> in<00:03:42.950> order<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.400> manipulate<00:03:43.810> single<00:03:44.810> lines

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
um in order to manipulate single lines

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.780 
um in order to manipulate single lines
this<00:03:45.410> what<00:03:45.859> you'll<00:03:45.980> want<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.220> need<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.459> do<00:03:46.579> is

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
this what you'll want to need to do is

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.349 
this what you'll want to need to do is
go<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.000> object<00:03:48.670> expand<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:52.459> have<00:03:53.030> all<00:03:53.209> these

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
go to object expand and I have all these

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.490 
go to object expand and I have all these
selected<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:53.900> that's<00:03:54.019> fine<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.980> click<00:03:55.250> OK

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.990 
selected and that's fine and click OK
and<00:03:57.500> then<00:03:58.040> simply<00:03:58.670> ungroup<00:03:59.359> your<00:04:00.200> selection

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.670 

so<00:04:05.829> good<00:04:06.829> object<00:04:07.340> ungroup<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.470> then<00:04:09.470> you

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
so good object ungroup and then you

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.319 
so good object ungroup and then you
should<00:04:09.739> be<00:04:09.980> able<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:10.190> manipulate<00:04:11.180> these

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
should be able to manipulate these

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.970 
should be able to manipulate these
eventually<00:04:11.840> so<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:12.290> could<00:04:12.410> delete<00:04:12.709> lines

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
eventually so you could delete lines

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.309 
eventually so you could delete lines
I'll<00:04:13.579> go<00:04:13.790> ahead<00:04:13.849> and<00:04:14.060> delete<00:04:14.150> every<00:04:14.599> other

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
I'll go ahead and delete every other

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:21.339 
I'll go ahead and delete every other
line<00:04:15.769> or<00:04:15.980> so<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:20.120> if<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:20.359> if<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:21.079> wanted<00:04:21.260> to

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
line or so so if you if you wanted to

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.250 
line or so so if you if you wanted to
make<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.500> look<00:04:21.680> like<00:04:21.889> it<00:04:22.220> was<00:04:22.340> going<00:04:22.639> from<00:04:23.260> wide

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
make it look like it was going from wide

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.070 
make it look like it was going from wide
to<00:04:24.770> less<00:04:25.550> wide<00:04:25.820> that's<00:04:26.510> one<00:04:26.720> thing<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:26.930> you

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
to less wide that's one thing that you

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:55.860 
to less wide that's one thing that you
could<00:04:27.289> do<00:04:27.440> here<00:04:27.770> I'll<00:04:27.889> show<00:04:28.099> you

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.840

something like that now you know if
there<00:04:58.030> was<00:04:58.150> more<00:04:58.389> lines<00:04:58.630> it<00:04:58.960> can<00:04:59.050> get<00:04:59.199> really

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
there was more lines it can get really

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.970 
there was more lines it can get really
close<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.490> then<00:05:00.730> really<00:05:01.090> far<00:05:01.360> away<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:02.860> can
