didn't<00:03:11.680> have<00:03:11.800> enough<00:03:11.980> speed<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.580> remember<00:03:13.480> just

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
didn't have enough speed I remember just

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.940 
didn't have enough speed I remember just
looking<00:03:13.780> around<00:03:14.020> like<00:03:14.320> dude<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.620> need<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.800> get

a moped and I just seen some guy like
sitting<00:03:17.680> there<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:17.860> lounging<00:03:18.459> on<00:03:18.519> his<00:03:18.730> moped

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
sitting there like lounging on his moped

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.040 
sitting there like lounging on his moped
watching<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.750> said<00:03:19.930> hey<00:03:22.709> he's<00:03:23.709> like<00:03:25.050> that's

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
watching and I said hey he's like that's

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.570 
watching and I said hey he's like that's
it<00:03:26.290> we've<00:03:26.890> got<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.160> moped

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.390 

and<00:03:30.670> he<00:03:31.420> started<00:03:31.810> doing<00:03:31.990> it<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.380> he<00:03:32.500> he<00:03:33.160> wasn't

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
and he started doing it and he he wasn't

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.160 
and he started doing it and he he wasn't
really<00:03:33.520> matching<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.390> speed<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.870> needed

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
really matching the speed that I needed

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.160 
really matching the speed that I needed
I<00:03:35.440> think<00:03:35.530> maybe<00:03:35.980> he<00:03:36.360> tried<00:03:37.360> tone<00:03:37.600> cookie<00:03:38.050> in<00:03:38.110> a

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
I think maybe he tried tone cookie in a

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.840 
I think maybe he tried tone cookie in a
couple<00:03:38.470> times<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.100> don't<00:03:39.220> think<00:03:39.400> since<00:03:39.730> he

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
couple times and I don't think since he

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.280 
couple times and I don't think since he
didn't<00:03:40.120> skate<00:03:40.330> didn't<00:03:40.540> really<00:03:40.720> understand

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
didn't skate didn't really understand

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.200 
didn't skate didn't really understand
