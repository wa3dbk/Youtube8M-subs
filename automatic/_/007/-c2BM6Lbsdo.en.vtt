don't have to wait two minutes or
anything<00:04:32.330> but<00:04:32.659> it's<00:04:32.810> just<00:04:32.870> how<00:04:33.349> I<00:04:33.379> do<00:04:33.620> my

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
anything but it's just how I do my

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.209 
anything but it's just how I do my
routine<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:35.810> can<00:04:35.990> put<00:04:36.139> on<00:04:36.229> moisturizer<00:04:36.500> you

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.219 
routine you can put on moisturizer you

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.520 
routine you can put on moisturizer you
can<00:04:37.370> put<00:04:37.550> on<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.699> skin<00:04:38.449> primer<00:04:38.719> you<00:04:39.110> can<00:04:39.259> put<00:04:39.409> on

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
can put on a skin primer you can put on

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.999 
can put on a skin primer you can put on
your<00:04:39.680> makeup<00:04:39.919> right<00:04:40.219> away<00:04:40.460> it's<00:04:40.909> not<00:04:41.569> as

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
your makeup right away it's not as

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.959 
your makeup right away it's not as
moisturizing<00:04:43.009> where<00:04:43.219> I<00:04:43.250> think<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.669> could<00:04:43.849> go

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:43.969 
moisturizing where I think you could go

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.510 
moisturizing where I think you could go
without<00:04:44.180> a<00:04:44.389> moisturizer<00:04:45.080> I<00:04:45.500> think<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.400> would

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
without a moisturizer I think you would

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.080 
without a moisturizer I think you would
still<00:04:46.789> need<00:04:47.000> one<00:04:47.270> but<00:04:48.110> if<00:04:48.409> you<00:04:48.740> have<00:04:49.159> you<00:04:50.060> know

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
still need one but if you have you know

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.959 
still need one but if you have you know
super<00:04:50.840> oily<00:04:51.050> skin<00:04:51.560> then<00:04:51.830> maybe<00:04:52.159> you<00:04:52.639> could<00:04:52.849> get

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:52.969 
super oily skin then maybe you could get

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.240 
super oily skin then maybe you could get
away<00:04:53.270> with<00:04:53.479> it<00:04:53.689> I<00:04:53.930> don't<00:04:54.199> know<00:04:54.289> I<00:04:54.500> prefer<00:04:54.949> to

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
away with it I don't know I prefer to

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.540 
away with it I don't know I prefer to
still<00:04:55.460> use<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.639> moisturizer<00:04:56.270> but<00:04:56.919> it<00:04:57.919> just<00:04:58.400> is

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
still use a moisturizer but it just is
