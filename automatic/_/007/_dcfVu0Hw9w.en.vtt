set<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.400> aside<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.600> separate<00:01:33.990> Bowl<00:01:34.110> you're

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
set it aside in a separate Bowl you're

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.929 
set it aside in a separate Bowl you're
going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> start<00:01:34.799> together<00:01:34.979> mustard<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
going to start together mustard and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.850 
going to start together mustard and
water<00:01:36.180> stir<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.990> together<00:01:37.170> until<00:01:37.470> it's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
water stir that together until it's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.620 
water stir that together until it's
combined<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.610> add<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> little<00:01:39.390> bit<00:01:39.600> of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.300 
the flour back to the mustard and water
so<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.229> thick<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> stick<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
so that it can get thick and stick to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.249 
so that it can get thick and stick to
the<00:01:44.430> zucchini<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.509> now<00:01:45.720> we're<00:01:45.960> ready<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.109 
dredge our zucchini you want to coat it
in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.350> mustard<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.979> water<00:01:50.280> mixture<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.909> had<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
in the mustard and water mixture I had a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.660 
in the mustard and water mixture I had a
difficult<00:01:51.450> time<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.399> make

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
difficult time with this so if you make

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.330 
difficult time with this so if you make
more<00:01:54.090> than<00:01:54.149> let's<00:01:55.110> say<00:01:55.229> six<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.860> these<00:01:55.979> plates

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
more than let's say six of these plates

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.020 
more than let's say six of these plates
like<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.820> making<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:58.020> use<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
like I'm making then you can use like a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.450 
like I'm making then you can use like a
shallow<00:02:00.030> bowl<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:01.140> something<00:02:01.740> different<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
shallow bowl or something different to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.030 
shallow bowl or something different to
