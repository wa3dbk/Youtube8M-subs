video<00:00:03.570> on<00:00:03.870> my<00:00:04.770> updated<00:00:05.609> main<00:00:06.240> speak<00:00:06.779> use<00:00:07.020> since

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
video on my updated main speak use since

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.060 
video on my updated main speak use since
last<00:00:08.010> time<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.309> did<00:00:08.370> one<00:00:08.610> was<00:00:09.290> September<00:00:10.290> 2011

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
last time I did one was September 2011

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.580 
last time I did one was September 2011
so<00:00:11.790> some<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.300> them<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.630> changed<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.559> I

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
so some of them have changed so I

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.070 
so some of them have changed so I
figured<00:00:13.650> I'd<00:00:13.950> just<00:00:14.040> make<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.639> new<00:00:14.849> video<00:00:15.080> so

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
figured I'd just make a new video so

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.870 
figured I'd just make a new video so

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
starting off 2 x 2 is a wit to it turns

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029

can<00:02:53.500> see<00:02:53.680> these<00:02:53.860> holes<00:02:54.100> are<00:02:54.400> kind<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.030> bigger

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
can see these holes are kind of bigger

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.970 
can see these holes are kind of bigger
than<00:02:55.360> usual<00:02:55.660> but<00:02:55.959> they're<00:02:56.170> not<00:02:56.290> all<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.770> big

nicely<00:05:08.950> um<00:05:09.880> except<00:05:10.540> this<00:05:10.630> one's<00:05:10.870> really

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
nicely um except this one's really

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.320 
nicely um except this one's really
really<00:05:11.470> old<00:05:11.729> since<00:05:12.729> I've<00:05:12.820> had<00:05:12.910> it<00:05:13.060> for<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.210> while

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
really old since I've had it for a while

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.350 
really old since I've had it for a while
so<00:05:13.720> it<00:05:14.260> pops<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:15.340> whole<00:05:15.550> bunch<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:15.970> like<00:05:16.180> the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
so it pops a whole bunch and like the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.190 
so it pops a whole bunch and like the
logo<00:05:16.570> is<00:05:17.050> very<00:05:17.320> worn<00:05:17.680> down<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.930> it's<00:05:19.930> kind<00:05:20.169> of
