00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
blocks that we currently have and then

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.479 
blocks that we currently have and then
the<00:00:37.930> ones<00:00:38.140> that<00:00:38.320> we<00:00:38.410> have<00:00:38.530> from<00:00:38.680> mass<00:00:38.950> affected

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489

the ones that we have from mass affected
you<00:00:39.610> guys<00:00:39.790> see<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.510> ones<00:00:40.720> on<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:40.989> left<00:00:41.170> are

from mass effecting the ones on the

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.729 
from mass effecting the ones on the
right<00:00:43.120> are<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.660> default<00:00:43.960> building<00:00:44.530> blocks

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
right are the default building blocks

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:45.900 
right are the default building blocks
and<00:00:44.949> for<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.160> most<00:00:45.340> part<00:00:45.460> they<00:00:45.730> look

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
resemble the default blocks which i

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.670 
resemble the default blocks which i
think<00:01:13.270> is<00:01:13.510> really<00:01:13.930> awesome<00:01:14.050> and<00:01:14.350> then<00:01:14.500> if<00:01:14.590> you
