00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hi everyone here super lupine set 77 e 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.880
 pitt welcome in this new guide 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.250
 by pokémon leeds ey 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.559
 after learning how to get pokémon 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.400
 by ivy and nature in perfect last 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.870
 episode 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.100
 Now let's focus on distribution 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.930
 gods and you on our pokémon 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.760
 if you haven't seen the first guide yet 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.650
 the advice to go and watch it 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.930
 because it explains the basic methods for 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.740
 distribute light while in this third 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.620
 part 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.800
 we will analyze the fastest methods 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.290
 the first slower but more precise is the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.360
 super shortened virtual training 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.190
 with the initials saab to which we can 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.680
 access from the lower screen of the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.660
 our console in the screen 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.760
 the pokemon is in the center 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.440
 which is going to be trained we can 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.730
 choose at the bottom of the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.280
 pokemon screen team 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.500
 sometimes the pokémon will fall asleep and not 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.059
 can then be trained for 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.170
 wake him master to touch him on the part 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.110
 right of the screen 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.700
 we will find a graph that shows 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.250
 approximately the distribution 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.530
 of the and of our pokémon while 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.480
 even further to the right we find a bar 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.020
 which shows the quantity of e vito such 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.460
 who owns our pokémon when the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.400
 bar will be full will no longer 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.340
 Earn up top left 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.409
 the figure of a little man will appear 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.570
 at the top right is the drawing of a 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.820
 balloon that depending on the color 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.109
 will change in strength and speed during 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.579
 the training to the latter we can 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:39.420
 access from the bottom left icon 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.130
 of the screen there are three levels of 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.469
 super workout for each 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.770
 statistics that will provide ours 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.429
 pokémon respectively 4 8 and 12 is 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.429
 different 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.360
 during training we should try 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.460
 to defeat the inflatable pokémon 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.860
 marking in the networks that appear on the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.860
 their bodies and avoiding their blows 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.010
 then there are two other super levels 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.990
 training but are not useful for the purpose 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.990
 of the distribution of the base points 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.879
 after defeating the balloons like 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.680
 reward we will get sacks of 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.659
 sand that our pokémon can 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.060
 hit by repeatedly pressing 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.980
 screen on the main screen 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.310
 after selecting it from the icon in 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.310
 lower right 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.810
 exist for each statistic three 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.590
 types of sml bags these will provide us 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.790
 respectively 14 and 12 basis points in the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.790
 respective statistic 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.230
 then there are other types of bags of 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.720
 sand the guard sack which causes that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.310
 our pokémon will lose less points if 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.130
 will be hit in the next workout 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.930
 the lot of power that will make us 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.660
 Earn more points for each shot 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.420
 scored during training 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.310
 next the lot of life he will make 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.700
 the fastest pokémon while training 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.070
 very important restoration lot that 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.100
 reset all and saw the pokémon the 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.650
 doubling bag also important the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.290
 fact of v that will double the number of 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.170
 basic points that we will earn in the next 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.360
 training the gauge bag that increases 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.459
 the precision of the pokémon shoots the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.400
 relaxation bag that will make the pokemon more 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.200
 friendly and finally the flare bag that 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.730
 causes our little does not affect the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.730
 sand bags and quickly 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.090
 the second method much faster for 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.749
 use our pokémon and through the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.670
 orde poker indeed defeating art of 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.840
 pokémon that give us at least two ways 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.030
 head 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.400
 if the pokemon we want to stay owns 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.299
 growth and is affected by rus cooks 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.870
 we will get 10 instead of 40 and so on 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.090
 look i suggest if the can anyway 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.189
 we want to train is low level e 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.260
 he knows no moves that can strike 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.450
 more enemies to activate the shared 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.930
 experience and make someone fight 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.180
 another in its place through a quick 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.829
 internet search will let you know where 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.260
 find every horde pokémon that i 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.759
 interested and how many and which ones there is 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.349
 will provide each pokémon with the footprint 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:20.690
 this guide has also come to an end 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.470
 so if you have been of help or if the 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.780
 did you like it
