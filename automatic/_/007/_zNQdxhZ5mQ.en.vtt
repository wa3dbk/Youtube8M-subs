00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.170
 Yup 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.389
 it was hard because obviously 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.320
 reconcile the fifth year study with 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.990
 the tests were not easy but I did 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.230
 so I put it all if destiny 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.839
 I will enter, however, I know I did 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.279
 my best but greets read one or 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.990
 then took the bus to leave then 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.480
 I woke up at half past five 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.349
 four hours of sleep four and a half hours 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.530
 they are good 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.320
 we started a course that 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.630
 lasted 4 5 months from 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.060
 November we say is therefore to reconcile 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.060
 then the program to be carried out 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.980
 of the fifth year plus prepare for a 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.420
 testing as a medicine was enough 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.460
 difficult though what we did 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.650
 let's go or break it 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.010
 we hope that the professors of 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.739
 what they were tolerant up to a 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.989
 certain point because anyway 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.020
 unprepared and perhaps even a few 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.610
 two, however, there was obviously not 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.180
 we could do otherwise 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.479
 double program cannot be managed in 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.960
 sense that 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.880
 today's physical mathematics to logic also 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.829
 a little 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.009
 I can do homework questions 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:23.520
 so a little to the battery 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.939
 let's hope, however, that a little goes one way 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.399
 do not mind doing these tests 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.890
 let's say before finishing a cycle i 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.350
 tests are not right because they base the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.090
 future of a young person in a test of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.030
 an hour on an hour and a half test 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.350
 let's say it's not a good thing 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.689
 do it again before the cycle ends 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.179
 school doesn't seem like anything to me 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.149
 there is stress but there is a charge from us 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:52.500
 charges okay but let's pass let's pass me 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:56.459
 I feel I feel very excited 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.899
 as they are studied so much among them 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.700
 it would be a shame now with good be it 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:06.950
 in the end not making a score hopefully 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.950
 there is also the pink crown has resumed 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.760
 we have studied in these six months 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.270
 we also did a school fee 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.090
 which was definitely very stressful 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.739
 because we had to reconcile both 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.500
 morning hours with in the afternoon hours 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.260
 which however were two hours on Thursday at 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.170
 4 hours and Saturday so we didn't have it 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.060
 plenty of time to rest and in any case i 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.130
 we have made sacrifices and we hope to 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.019
 enter and then this in the text is 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.580
 very different because compared to the years 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.590
 precedents given more emphasis on those that 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.239
 are the subjects of address 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.970
 therefore the subjects are the subjects 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.290
 chemistry mathematics biology while the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.970
 culture generates from that for years forever 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.680
 been a rock is ninth for the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.269
 students has nevertheless been a subject 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.580
 very controversial because there were questions 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.620
 of all the tv and stage uses a four between 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.970
 four questions while on today has been 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.370
 scope to 23 requirements therefore for 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.380
 going to look for with have changed 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.870
 potentially more intelligent more 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.610
 prepared I think that for a test of the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.340
 genetics chemistry biology 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.019
 anything else but that the logic that a 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.150
 sometimes a harmless thing goes by 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.390
 to prejudice the future is the dream of 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.239
 someone is absolutely 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.700
 unjustifiable for some 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.960
 a little more complex for example 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.710
 logic was a little more 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.080
 I have more abstruse but 9 beautiful tina 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.110
 compared to other years it was feasible 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:36.180
 second but what was the question and you 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:39.030
 left a little depends on whether the companies 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.580
 some for example of chemistry does not have 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.980
 some more complicated or some of 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.860
 logical but that of mathematics then of 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.360
 logic to the palermo because there were figures 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.200
 many calculations so there is to lose 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.910
 also a long time 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.410
 and in fact you do not personally give it 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.330
 all the fires have few but many dates 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.270
 more on science on which I was more 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.620
 ferrato and nothing even if the logic was 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.780
 a thought also the passages themselves were 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.490
 long is then that answers yes 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.260
 they looked very much so if you didn't 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.390
 will pay more attention to luck 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.460
 because exercised so much then offer a 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.050
 method to solve it so they should 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.240
 be done and then see 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.760
 is an add on the logical or President 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.940
 there were those who said there was a farmer 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.130
 who had land to cultivate if not 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.320
 mistake and the measures of chance of measures 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.720
 from which you must calculate the area of ​​squares 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.920
 and rectangles was a bit complicated but not 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.580
 I remember expected because there is a little 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.580
 of emotion though
