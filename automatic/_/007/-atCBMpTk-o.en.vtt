are<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> little<00:01:33.780> bit<00:01:33.990> lower<00:01:34.170> quality<00:01:34.890> um<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.670> also

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
are a little bit lower quality um I also

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
are a little bit lower quality um I also
don't<00:01:36.360> think<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.720> bad<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.380> when<00:01:38.070> you

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
don't think it's that bad but when you

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.399 
don't think it's that bad but when you
used<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.549> HD<00:01:38.909> stuff<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> guess<00:01:39.810> this

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
used to like HD stuff then I guess this

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.950
