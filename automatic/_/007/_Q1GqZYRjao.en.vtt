circle programs on there there might be

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.010 
circle programs on there there might be
but<00:00:36.030> anyway<00:00:36.920> episode<00:00:37.920> 3<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:39.270> talking<00:00:39.780> about

but anyway episode 3 in talking about

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.470 
but anyway episode 3 in talking about
ancient<00:00:40.530> aliens<00:00:40.980> certainly<00:00:41.790> sort<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.090> diverts

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
ancient aliens certainly sort of diverts

off<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.260> tangent<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:44.010> crop<00:00:44.250> circles<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
off on this tangent of crop circles and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.479 
off on this tangent of crop circles and
how<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> messages<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.809> crop<00:00:46.230> circles<00:00:46.710> are

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
how the messages of crop circles are

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.260 
how the messages of crop circles are
more<00:00:48.390> than<00:00:48.539> likely<00:00:48.600> alien<00:00:49.469> messages<00:00:50.270> because

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
more than likely alien messages because

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270 
more than likely alien messages because
they<00:00:51.390> can't<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.750> created<00:00:52.110> by<00:00:52.230> people<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:53.129> know

because I mean it was all put down to
the<00:01:50.520> fact<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.939> must<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.270> aliens<00:01:51.600> now<00:01:52.110> okay

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the fact that it must be aliens now okay

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.910 
the fact that it must be aliens now okay
in<00:01:52.710> fairness<00:01:54.110> this<00:01:55.110> program<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.799> obviously

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
in fairness this program is obviously

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
in fairness this program is obviously
going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.540> bit<00:01:57.780> biased<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
going to be a little bit biased and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.730 
going to be a little bit biased and
hyped<00:01:59.219> up<00:01:59.460> because<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.049> program<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.530> is

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
hyped up because it's a program that is

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.399 
hyped up because it's a program that is
talking<00:02:02.130> about<00:02:02.340> ancient<00:02:02.880> aliens<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:04.110> not

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
talking about ancient aliens is not

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.069 
talking about ancient aliens is not
talking<00:02:04.770> about<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.850> ancient<00:02:06.180> aliens<00:02:06.840> or

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
talking about not ancient aliens or

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.650 
talking about not ancient aliens or
there<00:02:07.649> are<00:02:07.860> no<00:02:08.039> ancient<00:02:08.190> aliens<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.119> talking

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
there are no ancient aliens it's talking

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.890 
there are no ancient aliens it's talking
about<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:10.349> are<00:02:10.560> ancient<00:02:10.890> aliens<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
about there are ancient aliens so the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.880 
about there are ancient aliens so the
hypothesis<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
hypothesis of the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.890 
hypothesis of the
is<00:02:14.250> obviously<00:02:14.700> going<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:14.970> be<00:02:15.060> heavily<00:02:15.330> steered

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
is obviously going to be heavily steered

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.160 
is obviously going to be heavily steered
into<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:17.100> into<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.209> sort<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.480> believer<00:02:18.780> camp

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
into the into the sort of believer camp

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.520 
into the into the sort of believer camp
and<00:02:20.209> but<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.330> know<00:02:21.360> again<00:02:21.780> as<00:02:22.080> I've<00:02:22.200> said<00:02:22.230> in

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and but you know again as I've said in

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.870 
and but you know again as I've said in
the<00:02:22.620> past<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.250> not<00:02:23.580> very<00:02:23.760> good

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
the past this is not very good

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.690 
the past this is not very good
journalism<00:02:24.630> if<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.920> know<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.130> can't<00:02:26.459> put<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
journalism if you know you can't put the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.970 
journalism if you know you can't put the
balance<00:02:27.090> across<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.290> think<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.770> program

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
balance across and I think the program

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.960 
balance across and I think the program
makers<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.990> get<00:02:31.440> around<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.550> balance

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
makers to get around it the balance

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.199 
makers to get around it the balance
comes<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.570> form<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:34.020> very<00:02:34.620> quick<00:02:35.209> comments

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
comes in the form of very quick comments

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.930 
comes in the form of very quick comments
which<00:02:36.600> aren't<00:02:36.840> really<00:02:37.350> brought<00:02:37.680> out<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:38.160> you

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
which aren't really brought out or you

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.010 
which aren't really brought out or you
know<00:02:39.890> made<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.920> stand<00:02:41.310> out<00:02:41.640> basically<00:02:42.420> which

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
know made to stand out basically which

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.020 
know made to stand out basically which
say<00:02:43.230> sort<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.069> know<00:02:44.190> obviously

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
say sort of like you know obviously

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.420 
say sort of like you know obviously
there<00:02:45.300> are<00:02:45.450> some<00:02:45.660> manmade<00:02:46.260> circles<00:02:46.709> but<00:02:46.890> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
there are some manmade circles but you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.670 
there are some manmade circles but you
know<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.000> added<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.270> up<00:02:48.510> from<00:02:48.780> quickly

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
know that it added it up from quickly

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.229 
know that it added it up from quickly
get<00:02:49.890> back<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:50.640> aliens<00:02:51.060> it's

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
get back on so that it's aliens it's

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.060 
get back on so that it's aliens it's
aliens<00:02:51.600> Italians<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.350> of<00:02:52.470> course<00:02:52.739> they<00:02:52.890> can

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
aliens Italians and of course they can

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.920 
aliens Italians and of course they can
say<00:02:53.310> justifiably<00:02:54.239> well<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.480> didn't<00:02:54.690> say<00:02:54.900> you

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
say justifiably well we didn't say you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.020 
say justifiably well we didn't say you
know<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.350> could<00:02:55.890> be<00:02:55.920> man-made<00:02:56.310> circles<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:56.880> we

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
know it could be man-made circles but we

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.840 
know it could be man-made circles but we
made<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.110> big<00:02:58.350> we<00:02:58.709> didn't<00:02:58.950> make<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.100> this

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
made it this big we didn't make it this

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.970 
made it this big we didn't make it this
 big<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:01.410> with<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> alien

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
 big like with the alien

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.810 
 big like with the alien
hypothesis<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.390> anyway<00:03:04.370> what<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.550> big

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
hypothesis so anyway what the big

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.360 
hypothesis so anyway what the big
problem<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.570> with<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.350> program<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:08.040> that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
problem I have with this program is that

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.390 
problem I have with this program is that
they<00:03:08.550> have<00:03:08.820> brought<00:03:09.330> up<00:03:09.570> yet<00:03:10.470> again<00:03:10.830> they<00:03:11.160> have

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
they have brought up yet again they have

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.780 
they have brought up yet again they have
brought<00:03:11.760> up<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.390> regurgitated<00:03:13.519> eleven<00:03:14.519> goods

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
brought up and regurgitated eleven goods

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.810 
brought up and regurgitated eleven goods
research<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:15.800> they<00:03:16.800> have<00:03:16.980> said<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.250> Elevens

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
research and they have said that Elevens

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.229 
research and they have said that Elevens
Goods<00:03:18.150> research<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.900> from<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.610> dr.<00:03:20.610> Levin

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
Goods research is from the dr. Levin

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.370 
Goods research is from the dr. Levin
good<00:03:21.799> dr.<00:03:22.799> Levin<00:03:23.220> good<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:25.430> one<00:03:26.430> has<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.700> wonder

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
good dr. Levin good so one has to wonder

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.509 
good dr. Levin good so one has to wonder
why<00:03:28.610> when<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:31.200> know<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.560> Linda<00:03:32.130> Moulton<00:03:32.250> Howe

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
why when you know it Linda Moulton Howe

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.199 
why when you know it Linda Moulton Howe
fair<00:03:32.820> play

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
fair play

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.250 
fair play
how<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:35.010> believed<00:03:35.970> Suzanne<00:03:36.390> Taylor<00:03:36.600> who

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
how and I believed Suzanne Taylor who

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.110 
how and I believed Suzanne Taylor who
actually<00:03:37.440> refer<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.010> eleven<00:03:38.610> good<00:03:38.820> but<00:03:38.940> just

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
actually refer to eleven good but just

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.270 
actually refer to eleven good but just
by<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.299> title<00:03:39.900> eleven<00:03:40.530> good<00:03:40.769> they<00:03:40.950> don't<00:03:41.130> say

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
by the title eleven good they don't say

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.400 
by the title eleven good they don't say
dr.<00:03:41.820> Levin<00:03:42.060> good<00:03:42.180> did<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.390> say<00:03:42.540> Levin<00:03:43.170> good

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
dr. Levin good did you say Levin good

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.630 
dr. Levin good did you say Levin good
but<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.750> would<00:03:45.750> like<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.959> know<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:47.040> am<00:03:47.220> making

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
title was used in this program so I am

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.410 
title was used in this program so I am
making<00:03:55.709> inquiries<00:03:56.130> into<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.760> at<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.060> moment

making inquiries into that at the moment

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.890 
making inquiries into that at the moment
and<00:03:57.540> we<00:03:57.600> shall<00:03:57.810> see<00:03:58.049> what<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.410> said<00:03:58.680> but<00:03:59.900> yet

out so therefore dr. Levengood is
actually<00:04:36.720> mr.<00:04:37.020> levin<00:04:37.290> good<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.620> he<00:04:37.680> faked<00:04:37.950> his

actually mr. levin good and he faked his

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.600 
actually mr. levin good and he faked his

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.420 
title so yet again we've had another TV
program<00:04:42.210> another<00:04:43.730> instance<00:04:44.730> where

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
program another instance where

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
research and we don't think or certainly

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
don't think that it's fair that research

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.970 
don't think that it's fair that research
should<00:05:00.090> be<00:05:00.150> promoted<00:05:00.720> like<00:05:00.930> this<00:05:01.230> on<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.770> back

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
should be promoted like this on the back

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.220 
should be promoted like this on the back
of<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.490> title<00:05:02.670> doctor<00:05:03.120> because<00:05:03.840> if<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.050> man

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
of the title doctor because if the man

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.230 
of the title doctor because if the man
