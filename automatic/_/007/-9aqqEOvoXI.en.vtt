it<00:00:01.020> was<00:00:01.199> another<00:00:01.469> terrific<00:00:02.449> picture<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.659> a

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
it was another terrific picture of a

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.210 
it was another terrific picture of a
liver<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.850> you<00:00:05.850> can<00:00:06.060> see<00:00:06.390> once<00:00:06.720> again<00:00:07.040> that<00:00:08.040> it

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
liver and you can see once again that it

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.730 
liver and you can see once again that it
is<00:00:08.250> congested<00:00:09.179> because<00:00:09.719> when<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.290> look<00:00:10.530> very

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
is congested because when you look very

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.480 
is congested because when you look very
carefully<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.759> these<00:00:12.150> little<00:00:12.480> red<00:00:13.200> pin<00:00:14.009> point

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
carefully at these little red pin point

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.439 
carefully at these little red pin point
or<00:00:14.849> streaked<00:00:15.269> areas<00:00:15.809> these<00:00:16.529> all<00:00:16.830> represent

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
or streaked areas these all represent

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.390 
or streaked areas these all represent
central<00:00:18.449> veins<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.080> isn't<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.039> kind<00:00:20.279> of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
central veins and isn't it's kind of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.890 
central veins and isn't it's kind of
interesting<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.270> even<00:00:21.330> though<00:00:21.689> we're

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
interesting that even though we're

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.980 
interesting that even though we're
looking<00:00:22.080> at<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> liver<00:00:23.000> grossly<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.869> are

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
looking at the liver grossly we are

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.740 
looking at the liver grossly we are
actually<00:00:25.230> seeing<00:00:26.119> microscopic<00:00:27.119> structures

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
actually seeing microscopic structures

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.189 
actually seeing microscopic structures
there<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.920> central<00:00:29.400> vein<00:00:30.050> representing<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
there is a central vein representing the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.160 
there is a central vein representing the
middle<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.920> lobule<00:00:32.520> there<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.480> adjacent

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
middle of a lobule there are adjacent

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.910 
middle of a lobule there are adjacent
central<00:00:34.980> veins<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.559> kind<00:00:37.860> of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
central veins so it's kind of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.590 
central veins so it's kind of
interesting<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.640> even<00:00:39.030> though<00:00:39.390> we're

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

looking at the liver grossly we are
seeing<00:00:43.290> really<00:00:43.829> microscopic<00:00:44.340> globules<00:00:45.120> here

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
seeing really microscopic globules here

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.549 
seeing really microscopic globules here
aren't<00:00:46.140> we

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
aren't we

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.180 
aren't we
if<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.640> were<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.940> look<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.360> these<00:00:49.190> pinpoints

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
if you were to look at these pinpoints

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.380 
if you were to look at these pinpoints
or<00:00:50.309> perhaps<00:00:50.640> linear<00:00:51.410> congested<00:00:52.410> streaks

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
or perhaps linear congested streaks

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.720 
or perhaps linear congested streaks
microscopically<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:55.289> would<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.489> they

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
microscopically you would see that they

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.689 
microscopically you would see that they
would<00:00:56.879> correspond<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.899> areas<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> liver

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
would correspond to areas in the liver

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.600 
would correspond to areas in the liver
like<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:01.250> like<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.930> like<00:01:03.930> here<00:01:04.619> which

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
like here like here like here which

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.929 
like here like here like here which
represents<00:01:06.299> central<00:01:06.900> vein<00:01:07.170> areas<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.189> which

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
represents central vein areas in which

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.570 
represents central vein areas in which
you<00:01:09.000> are<00:01:09.390> seeing<00:01:09.750> increases<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:11.840> stasis<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
you are seeing increases in stasis of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.600 
you are seeing increases in stasis of
blood<00:01:14.580> cells<00:01:15.560> this<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.430> would

blood cells this would be this would

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.600 
blood cells this would be this would
probably<00:01:17.850> correspond<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.110> an<00:01:19.680> area<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.369> your

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
probably correspond to an area with your

degree of congestion or stasis is the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.120 
degree of congestion or stasis is the
more<00:01:36.060> likely<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.960> pick<00:01:37.920> up

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
more likely you are to pick up

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.319 
more likely you are to pick up
hemosiderin<00:01:39.119> cells<00:01:39.799> within<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.130> area<00:01:41.640> so

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
hemosiderin cells within this area so

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.050 
hemosiderin cells within this area so
when<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:42.840> looking<00:01:43.070> in<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.369> area<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
when you are looking in this area and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.859 
when you are looking in this area and
you<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.500> hemosiderin<00:01:46.500> cells<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.970> assume

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you see hemosiderin cells you can assume

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.230 
you see hemosiderin cells you can assume
it<00:01:49.079> was<00:01:49.229> chronically<00:01:49.680> congested<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.970> don't

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
it was chronically congested but don't

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.710 
it was chronically congested but don't
be<00:01:51.450> fooled<00:01:51.649> this<00:01:52.649> little<00:01:53.180> brownish<00:01:54.180> pigment

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
be fooled this little brownish pigment

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.679 
be fooled this little brownish pigment
here<00:01:54.899> represents<00:01:55.649> probably<00:01:56.189> bile<00:01:56.790> within

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
here represents probably bile within

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.149 
here represents probably bile within
hepatocyte<00:01:58.409> s'<00:01:58.469> and<00:02:00.560> we're<00:02:01.560> actually<00:02:01.740> seeing

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
hepatocyte s' and we're actually seeing

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.760 
hepatocyte s' and we're actually seeing
out<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.299> sinusoids<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.350> central

vein<00:02:04.979> area<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:06.329> not<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.540> much

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
vein area is really not very much

vein area is really not very much
pigmented<00:02:07.710> at<00:02:07.950> all<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> these<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.270> just

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
pigmented at all is it these are just

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.229 
pigmented at all is it these are just
fresh<00:02:09.989> red<00:02:10.289> cells<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.459> amount<00:02:12.060> of

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
fresh red cells so this amount of

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.650 
fresh red cells so this amount of
congestion<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:13.110> not<00:02:13.349> real

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
congestion is not real

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.220 
congestion is not real
chronic<00:02:14.700> let's<00:02:15.700> look<00:02:15.880> at<00:02:16.060> congestion<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.840> the

like<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.290> see<00:03:20.530> here<00:03:20.770> in<00:03:20.830> here<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:22.120> is

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
like you see here in here this is

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.380 
like you see here in here this is
generally<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:22.930> very<00:03:23.440> acute<00:03:24.390> passively

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390

generally a very acute passively
congested<00:03:26.230> lung<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:27.190> are<00:03:27.310> not<00:03:27.580> seeing<00:03:27.880> too

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
congested lung you are not seeing too

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.449 
congested lung you are not seeing too
many<00:03:28.420> of<00:03:28.690> these<00:03:28.900> hemosiderin<00:03:29.500> macrophages

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
many of these hemosiderin macrophages

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.000 
many of these hemosiderin macrophages
here<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.600> addition<00:03:32.140> you're<00:03:32.680> seeing

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
here and in addition you're seeing

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.060 
here and in addition you're seeing
mostly<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.550> significant<00:03:34.480> amount<00:03:34.959> of<00:03:35.230> congested

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
mostly a significant amount of congested

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.960 
mostly a significant amount of congested
blood<00:03:36.820> vessels<00:03:37.360> within<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> septae<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.970> not

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
blood vessels within the septae and not

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.250 
blood vessels within the septae and not
so<00:03:40.330> much<00:03:40.540> in<00:03:40.810> terms<00:03:41.080> of<00:03:41.440> actual<00:03:42.209> edema<00:03:43.260> within

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
so much in terms of actual edema within

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.850 
so much in terms of actual edema within
the<00:03:44.410> alveoli<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.540> case<00:03:46.780> shows<00:03:47.110> very<00:03:47.530> very

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
the alveoli so this case shows very very

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.500 
the alveoli so this case shows very very
good<00:03:48.160> examples<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:49.000> acutely<00:03:51.060> congested<00:03:52.060> lungs

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
good examples of acutely congested lungs

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.090 
good examples of acutely congested lungs
and<00:03:52.810> livers<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.800> thank<00:03:54.489> you<00:03:54.640> very<00:03:54.670> much
