00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.250 

in<00:00:17.800> my<00:00:18.580> past<00:00:18.880> switch<00:00:19.240> layer<00:00:19.510> tutorial<00:00:20.080> I

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
in my past switch layer tutorial I

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.470 
in my past switch layer tutorial I
showed<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:20.920> basics<00:00:21.340> of<00:00:21.460> it<00:00:21.580> how<00:00:21.789> you<00:00:22.240> can

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
showed the basics of it how you can

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.779 
showed the basics of it how you can
switch<00:00:22.900> between<00:00:23.050> sub<00:00:23.529> layers<00:00:23.769> but<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.580> one

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
switch between sub layers but the one

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.939 
switch between sub layers but the one
thing<00:00:25.000> I<00:00:25.090> forgot<00:00:25.240> to<00:00:25.449> show<00:00:25.840> was<00:00:26.619> how<00:00:26.920> to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
thing I forgot to show was how to

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.300 
thing I forgot to show was how to
interpolate<00:00:27.820> between<00:00:28.830> different<00:00:29.830> sub<00:00:30.070> layers

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
interpolate between different sub layers

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.040 
interpolate between different sub layers
and<00:00:30.730> it's<00:00:30.880> actually<00:00:31.210> a<00:00:31.240> pretty<00:00:31.630> neat<00:00:32.020> little

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
and it's actually a pretty neat little

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.010 
and it's actually a pretty neat little
trick<00:00:32.680> you<00:00:32.920> can<00:00:33.070> use<00:00:33.210> especially<00:00:34.210> if<00:00:34.630> you<00:00:34.750> plan

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
trick you can use especially if you plan

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.280 
trick you can use especially if you plan
to<00:00:35.290> maintain<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.820> same<00:00:37.090> points<00:00:37.630> throughout

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
to maintain the same points throughout

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.250 
to maintain the same points throughout
your<00:00:38.500> sub<00:00:38.710> layers<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.270> get<00:00:40.630> started<00:00:41.080> I<00:00:41.230> have

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
your sub layers so to get started I have

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.480 
your sub layers so to get started I have
anime<00:00:41.980> studio<00:00:42.160> open<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:42.880> I<00:00:43.600> have<00:00:43.840> a<00:00:43.870> simple

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
anime studio open and I have a simple

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.810 
anime studio open and I have a simple
oval<00:00:45.490> drawn<00:00:45.910> and<00:00:46.240> I've<00:00:47.080> applied<00:00:47.650> some<00:00:47.820> points

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
oval drawn and I've applied some points

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.260 
oval drawn and I've applied some points
to<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:49.150> though<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:50.790> give<00:00:51.790> it<00:00:51.910> some<00:00:52.090> more

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
to it though to give it some more

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.410 
to it though to give it some more
control<00:00:52.840> basically<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.880> right<00:00:54.880> now<00:00:55.000> just

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
control basically and right now just

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.680 
control basically and right now just
with<00:00:55.750> the<00:00:56.670> translate<00:00:57.670> points<00:00:58.090> tool<00:00:58.300> I'm<00:00:58.630> just

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
with the translate points tool I'm just

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.710 
with the translate points tool I'm just
gonna<00:00:58.930> come<00:00:59.200> in<00:00:59.230> and<00:00:59.590> move<00:01:00.430> these<00:01:00.670> points<00:01:01.330> down

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
gonna come in and move these points down

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.960 
gonna come in and move these points down
like<00:01:02.110> so<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.210> they<00:01:04.479> meet<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.580> bottom

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
like so just so they meet the bottom

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.140 
like so just so they meet the bottom
portion<00:01:07.180> here<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:09.520> might<00:01:09.670> actually<00:01:10.030> add

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
portion here and I might actually add

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.220 
portion here and I might actually add
one<00:01:10.330> more<00:01:10.510> point<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:12.460> like<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:14.140> make

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
one more point just like that to make

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.190 
one more point just like that to make
sure<00:01:14.290> everything<00:01:14.950> works<00:01:15.670> pretty<00:01:16.270> good<00:01:16.510> okay

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
sure everything works pretty good okay

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.020 
sure everything works pretty good okay
so<00:01:17.680> we<00:01:17.890> basically<00:01:18.010> have<00:01:18.370> a<00:01:18.400> really<00:01:18.640> thin

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
so we basically have a really thin

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.290 
so we basically have a really thin
looking<00:01:20.220> shape<00:01:21.220> here<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.610> I<00:01:21.640> can<00:01:21.790> even<00:01:21.880> close

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
looking shape here and I can even close

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
looking shape here and I can even close
it<00:01:22.480> in<00:01:22.570> further<00:01:22.840> just<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:24.540> make<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:25.570> so<00:01:26.110> that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
it in further just to make it so that

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.800 
it in further just to make it so that
the<00:01:26.620> red<00:01:26.890> portion<00:01:27.160> doesn't<00:01:27.850> come<00:01:28.480> in<00:01:28.600> so

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
the red portion doesn't come in so

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.780 
the red portion doesn't come in so
basically<00:01:29.080> what<00:01:29.320> we<00:01:29.440> have<00:01:29.650> here<00:01:29.680> is<00:01:30.159> what

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
basically what we have here is what

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.340 
basically what we have here is what
could<00:01:31.000> appear<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.750> be<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:32.110> smiling<00:01:33.100> mouth<00:01:33.330> now

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
could appear to be a smiling mouth now

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.380 
could appear to be a smiling mouth now
when<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.409> make<00:01:35.530> your<00:01:35.680> switch<00:01:35.950> layer<00:01:36.390> which

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
when you make your switch layer which

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.320 
when you make your switch layer which
you<00:01:37.510> can<00:01:37.630> go<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.810> new<00:01:38.050> layer<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.590> switch<00:01:39.370> we

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
you can go to new layer and switch we

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.110 
you can go to new layer and switch we
can<00:01:40.540> name<00:01:40.690> it<00:01:40.720> mouth<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:41.830> then<00:01:42.670> we<00:01:42.730> can<00:01:42.880> bring

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
can name it mouth and then we can bring

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.800 
can name it mouth and then we can bring
the<00:01:44.010> vector<00:01:45.010> layer<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.729> we<00:01:45.850> just<00:01:46.060> made<00:01:46.240> into

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
the vector layer that we just made into

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.890 
the vector layer that we just made into
mouth<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.800> then<00:01:48.729> we<00:01:48.820> can<00:01:49.000> name<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.479> let's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
mouth and then we can name this let's

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.420 
mouth and then we can name this let's
just<00:01:49.960> say<00:01:50.290> closed<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:53.170> click<00:01:53.770> OK

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
just say closed and then click OK

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.700 
just say closed and then click OK
so<00:01:54.580> once<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.540> have<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.930> switch<00:01:56.110> layer<00:01:56.409> in

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
so once you have the switch layer in

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.399 
so once you have the switch layer in
your<00:01:56.740> vector<00:01:57.310> layer<00:01:57.940> is<00:01:58.120> inside<00:01:58.479> of<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.720> what

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
your vector layer is inside of it what

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.870 
your vector layer is inside of it what
we<00:01:59.500> can<00:01:59.650> do<00:01:59.890> is<00:02:01.110> duplicate<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.440> layer<00:02:02.880> by

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
we can do is duplicate this layer by

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.300 
we can do is duplicate this layer by
going<00:02:03.909> up<00:02:04.299> here<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.750> clicking<00:02:05.310> duplicate

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
going up here and clicking duplicate

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.839 
going up here and clicking duplicate
layer<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:06.970> then<00:02:07.780> we<00:02:07.810> can<00:02:08.019> name<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.470> open

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
layer and then we can name this open

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.739 
layer and then we can name this open
now<00:02:11.450> zooming<00:02:11.989> in<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.549> can<00:02:13.549> just<00:02:13.790> come<00:02:14.390> in<00:02:14.510> here

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:14.749 
now zooming in I can just come in here

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.550 
now zooming in I can just come in here
with<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:16.430> translate<00:02:16.909> points<00:02:17.209> tool<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.719> move

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
with the translate points tool and move

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.119 
with the translate points tool and move
them<00:02:18.799> points<00:02:19.639> up<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.620> make<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.739> look<00:02:21.889> like<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
them points up to make it look like the

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.330 
them points up to make it look like the
mouth<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.639> open<00:02:23.329> and<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:26.510> can<00:02:27.099> lower<00:02:28.099> the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
mouth is open and you can lower the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.069 
mouth is open and you can lower the
bottom<00:02:28.519> points<00:02:29.030> as<00:02:29.150> well<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.359> little<00:02:29.719> bit<00:02:32.079> go

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
bottom points as well a little bit go

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.640 
bottom points as well a little bit go
like<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.959> can<00:02:36.109> shape<00:02:36.349> it<00:02:36.500> however

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
like that and you can shape it however

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.520 
like that and you can shape it however
you<00:02:37.040> wish<00:02:37.389> and<00:02:38.389> again<00:02:38.689> this<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.930> very<00:02:39.200> basic

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
you wish and again this is a very basic

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.929 
you wish and again this is a very basic
example<00:02:39.799> of<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.549> so<00:02:41.349> same<00:02:42.349> points<00:02:42.769> making<00:02:43.700> up

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
example of this so same points making up

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.349 
example of this so same points making up
both<00:02:44.329> layers<00:02:45.079> you<00:02:45.560> have<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:46.040> closed<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.790> open

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
both layers you have a closed and open

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.369 
both layers you have a closed and open
instance<00:02:48.699> so<00:02:49.699> now<00:02:49.879> what<00:02:50.629> you<00:02:50.750> could<00:02:50.870> do<00:02:51.109> as

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
instance so now what you could do as

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.009 
instance so now what you could do as
I've<00:02:51.859> shown<00:02:52.129> before<00:02:52.519> is<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:53.659> the<00:02:53.780> switch

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
I've shown before is with the switch

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.319 
I've shown before is with the switch
layer<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:54.739> could<00:02:54.980> go<00:02:55.129> to<00:02:55.189> frame<00:02:55.430> 1<00:02:55.699> and<00:02:55.939> you

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
layer you could go to frame 1 and you

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.939 
layer you could go to frame 1 and you
could<00:02:56.480> right-click<00:02:56.959> on<00:02:57.169> that<00:02:57.230> switch<00:02:57.709> layer

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:57.949 
could right-click on that switch layer

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.459 
could right-click on that switch layer
and<00:02:58.219> choose<00:02:58.549> closed<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.480> then<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.349> could

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.469 
and choose closed and then you could

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.409 
and choose closed and then you could
advanced<00:03:00.769> let's<00:03:01.099> say<00:03:01.219> to<00:03:01.280> frame<00:03:01.639> 6<00:03:02.090> and

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:02.419 
advanced let's say to frame 6 and

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.470 
advanced let's say to frame 6 and
right-click<00:03:03.139> and<00:03:03.650> choose<00:03:03.680> open<00:03:04.189> so<00:03:04.939> it<00:03:05.329> goes

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
right-click and choose open so it goes

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.559 
right-click and choose open so it goes
from<00:03:05.599> close<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.900> open<00:03:06.109> on<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:07.849> timeline<00:03:08.299> at

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
from close to open on the timeline at

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.490 
from close to open on the timeline at
frame<00:03:09.349> 6<00:03:09.739> now<00:03:10.730> if<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.150> want<00:03:11.419> to<00:03:11.719> create<00:03:12.169> in

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
frame 6 now if you want to create in

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.470 
frame 6 now if you want to create in
animations<00:03:13.159> so<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.699> it<00:03:13.819> looks<00:03:14.030> like<00:03:14.120> it's

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
animations so that it looks like it's

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.839 
animations so that it looks like it's
actually<00:03:15.109> physically<00:03:15.680> animating<00:03:16.280> from<00:03:16.519> close

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
actually physically animating from close

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.539 
actually physically animating from close
to<00:03:16.879> open<00:03:17.379> what<00:03:18.379> you<00:03:18.470> can<00:03:18.620> do<00:03:18.829> is<00:03:19.099> double<00:03:19.519> click

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
to open what you can do is double click

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.249 
to open what you can do is double click
on<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:21.079> switch<00:03:21.379> layer<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.299> go<00:03:23.299> to<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:23.900> switch

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:24.259 
on the switch layer and go to the switch

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.869 
on the switch layer and go to the switch
tab<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:26.259> choose<00:03:27.259> interpolate<00:03:27.979> sub<00:03:28.489> layers

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
tab and choose interpolate sub layers

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.339 
tab and choose interpolate sub layers
just<00:03:29.509> check<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.290> box<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.120> then<00:03:32.120> click<00:03:32.479> apply

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
just check that box and then click apply

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.020 
just check that box and then click apply
or<00:03:33.889> ok<00:03:35.439> so<00:03:36.439> now<00:03:36.590> between<00:03:36.949> these<00:03:37.159> two<00:03:37.609> keyframes

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
or ok so now between these two keyframes

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.629 
or ok so now between these two keyframes
you<00:03:38.739> can<00:03:39.739> see<00:03:40.009> that<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.609> creates<00:03:41.090> in<00:03:41.359> animation

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
you can see that it creates in animation

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.640 
you can see that it creates in animation
now<00:03:43.639> again<00:03:44.269> this<00:03:44.479> is<00:03:44.540> useful<00:03:44.870> for<00:03:45.109> many

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
now again this is useful for many

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.080 
now again this is useful for many
different<00:03:45.829> things<00:03:46.040> let's<00:03:46.489> say<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:46.699> want<00:03:46.970> to

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
different things let's say you want to

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.679 
different things let's say you want to
add<00:03:47.239> more<00:03:47.769> detail<00:03:48.769> to<00:03:48.799> your<00:03:49.729> mouth<00:03:50.090> movements

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
add more detail to your mouth movements

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.929 
add more detail to your mouth movements
you<00:03:51.079> could<00:03:51.259> definitely<00:03:51.799> now<00:03:52.280> do<00:03:52.340> that

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
you could definitely now do that

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.629 
you could definitely now do that
it<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.239> wouldn't<00:03:53.449> be<00:03:53.509> a<00:03:53.889> single<00:03:54.889> switch<00:03:55.310> it

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
it just wouldn't be a single switch it

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.069 
it just wouldn't be a single switch it
would<00:03:55.729> actually<00:03:56.060> look<00:03:56.209> like<00:03:56.269> it's<00:03:56.509> animating

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
would actually look like it's animating

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.099 
would actually look like it's animating
between<00:03:57.469> the<00:03:57.620> switches<00:03:58.069> and<00:03:58.099> it<00:03:58.430> would

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
between the switches and it would

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.990 
between the switches and it would
basically<00:04:00.109> scale<00:04:00.469> the<00:04:00.979> animation<00:04:01.639> depending

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
basically scale the animation depending

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.539 
basically scale the animation depending
on<00:04:02.120> how<00:04:02.329> far<00:04:02.959> your<00:04:03.139> keyframes<00:04:03.620> are<00:04:03.859> you<00:04:04.400> could

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
on how far your keyframes are you could

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.819 
on how far your keyframes are you could
do<00:04:04.639> anything<00:04:05.060> from<00:04:05.299> let's<00:04:05.659> say<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:06.019> closed<00:04:06.379> hand

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
do anything from let's say a closed hand

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.119 
do anything from let's say a closed hand
going<00:04:07.189> to<00:04:07.459> an<00:04:07.669> open<00:04:08.030> hand<00:04:08.359> and<00:04:08.979> there<00:04:09.979> are

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
going to an open hand and there are

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.069 
going to an open hand and there are
several<00:04:10.400> other<00:04:10.699> different<00:04:11.689> little<00:04:12.049> things

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
several other different little things

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.229 
several other different little things
you<00:04:12.379> could<00:04:12.500> do<00:04:12.650> with<00:04:12.859> this<00:04:13.099> the<00:04:13.699> bottom<00:04:14.030> line

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
you could do with this the bottom line

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.420 
you could do with this the bottom line
is<00:04:14.449> you<00:04:14.659> have<00:04:14.689> to<00:04:15.169> have<00:04:15.199> the<00:04:15.590> same<00:04:15.829> points

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
is you have to have the same points

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.029 
is you have to have the same points
between<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.389> two<00:04:17.599> sub<00:04:18.049> layers<00:04:18.289> or<00:04:18.560> else<00:04:18.769> it

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
between the two sub layers or else it

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.580 
between the two sub layers or else it
just<00:04:19.099> won't<00:04:19.579> work<00:04:19.760> so<00:04:20.120> if<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.049> plan<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.440> use

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
just won't work so if you plan to use

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.260 
just won't work so if you plan to use
the<00:04:21.739> same<00:04:21.919> points<00:04:22.430> between<00:04:22.610> different<00:04:23.120> sub

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
the same points between different sub

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.400 
the same points between different sub
layers<00:04:23.510> check<00:04:24.139> it<00:04:24.229> out

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
layers check it out

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.790 
layers check it out
it<00:04:24.650> might<00:04:24.920> uh<00:04:24.950> it<00:04:25.670> might<00:04:25.850> work<00:04:26.060> out<00:04:26.210> for<00:04:26.510> you<00:04:26.800> so

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
it might uh it might work out for you so

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.130 
it might uh it might work out for you so
