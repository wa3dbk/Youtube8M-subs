 welcome new to my channel so 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.809
 today I find myself for a 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.890
 video with 2/10 highway so a dialogue 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.960
 to create your own protective spray 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.090
 low heat end by heat demand 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.910
 but mostly sun for your hair 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.910
 and another that will be a nutritious mask 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.380
 and really moisturizing to the extreme for 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.820
 repair your hair if you ever have 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.830
 forgot to protect them from the sun 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.350
 we'll say it's a tough match and 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.059
 solar after sun for the hair and 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.309
 forward said to me I also gave you 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.820
 small pieces of information to protect 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.559
 your hair in the sun have down before 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820
 this old to give you really 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.590
 the maximum of information if you do not 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.239
 can not do right now said to himself 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.820
 do not worry about it 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.079
 directly to the diwan but hey I think 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.579
 that it can still bring you 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.750
 a few things information 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.840
 that I will tell you where a little thing 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.230
 he's going to big turgot bottoms that you're going back 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.690
 cloud 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.420
 according to my moods finally brest and my 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.920
 cat and sometimes she does not calculate and 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.539
 local time and right now is the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.500
 case so I thought I was going 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.459
 you introduce her because she does 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.910
 often go back and forth in my 

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.530
 bedroom 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.490
 finally, do not be surprised 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.009
 have it here and so let's go for the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.950
 infos and for all that is to know 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.720
 and for the 10th just after so we know 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.780
 that it's really super important to 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.369
 protect your skin in the sun during the summer 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.039
 because just the sun 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.020
 burn the UV is good in small doses 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.880
 subway it can have effects really 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.770
 catastrophic but we do not speak 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.840
 enough of the fact that on the hair it's 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.489
 exactly the same thing since when 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.289
 we go outside when there is a big 

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:47.020
 sun and stay too long 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.840
 exposed to the sun finally our hair 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.069
 exposed to the sun it has the same effect as 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.530
 if we had the colored Nauche 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.050
 for at least 30 minutes which makes 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.640
 that the cuticles rise up the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.800
 hair become porous dry brittle 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.290
 and sometimes they clear up so 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.630
 the same effect finally here it is not top 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.250
 at all for the hair so that's 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.350
 really very very important to protect 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.520
 your sun hair for that you have 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.530
 many solutions 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.080
 the first one which is the simplest is 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.420
 time to put on a hat or scarf 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.190
 if you do not know how to put a 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.750
 scarf in an original way how does the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.010
 tie or whatever I do you 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.690
 advise again to go see 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.460
 the chain of my girlfriend biotype has that 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.710
 I 'll leave it as an info bar and 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.840
 which shows lots of tutorial to put 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.520
 scarves differently and I 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.990
 find it cool that's original and 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.510
 then it's a good way to 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.820
 protect her hair from the sun then 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.620
 low or not but not neither hats nor 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.240
 the scarves you can use 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.490
 vegetable oils that have an index of 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.030
 quite high sun protection then 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.070
 Warning 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.380
 as I just said all the 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.630
 vegetable oils not big clues 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.220
 sunscreen and this city 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.540
 can be used to protect falls 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.950
 of the sun but they are not enough 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.310
 effective in protecting your skin from 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.930
 Sun 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.820
 so it's really important that you 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.400
 still have protection 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.260
 solar on your skin so it's gone 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.200
 I will tell you what are the oils 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.520
 to protect your hair from the sun by 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.190
 does it simply suffice you in 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.989
 job a small dose on the left ca 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.180
 will also protect your hair from 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.489
 pool chlorine and salt from the sea 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.810
 if you go swimming at sea or 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.730
 the pool is important too 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.290
 so I think it's a bit of a 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.600
 protection for all and that's really 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.820
 not bad so among the best oils 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.930
 at the best sun protection factor 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.709
 for hair on jojoba oil 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.810
 macadamia oil sesame oil 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.630
 arbutus oil seed oil 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.400
 raspberry pardon hindered a little 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.069
 noisy or and the shea butter that has 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.749
 also in good 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.099
 sun protection so as I you 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:48.849
 do you say apply a little bit 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.829
 on your hair 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.260
 if you go swimming do not forget 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.609
 to postpone and renew 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.109
 the application every one or two 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.499
 hours to properly protect your hair from 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.209
 sun will be a good thing and as 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:03.099
 I wanted to say that it protects against chlorine 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.599
 and sea salt so it's really 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.219
 something is pretty good 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.870
 others now that it's done on 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:13.030
 goes off we sometimes need 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.950
 So begins the first j ai ai is 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.289
 the solar protective spray for 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.650
 hair so for those here you will 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.900
 need a little cup of cream water 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.830
 solar of a measuring cup or 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.210
 anything and having a spout 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.740
 a vaporizer that you can 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.410
 find in hairdresser's shops 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.630
 around 3 euros or on the internet 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.889
 for example on as roma area where on 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.560
 any site if you find any 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.340
 cheaper besides do not hesitate 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.120
 to say it in comment 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.340
 and finally a teaspoon so we 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.199
 simply start not pay back 3 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.470
 at 4 teaspoons of sunscreen 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:54.400
 in the measuring cup or in what you 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.349
 have and then we come to this is the 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.630
 little cup of water in it all 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:00.789
 so just try to do it from 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.139
 way more right than me because I am 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.630
 very clumsy and every time I 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.509
 pours liquids from cups 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.419
 I put it everywhere 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:13.180
 it's the story of a good lobby I'm 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.169
 calm and the brief so here's one more time 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.479
 that you did that you have everything 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.250
 simply to pour it into the 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.229
 spray 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.970
 and that's just you have your 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.259
 little solar protector strip so 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.729
 it's really simple but it 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.849
 super walk then we go to 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.169
 second they go so for these 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.969
 you will simply need them 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.349
 start with a mayonnaise so 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.689
 for those you will need everything 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.550
 simply an egg yolk from a 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.259
 teaspoon of mustard and oils 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.909
 plants of your choice for my part I 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.979
 take the olive one because she 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.439
 suits my hair well and finally 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.169
 of course a drummer or the 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:49.520
 strength of your arms if you are enough 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.879
 gifted to make a knowing mayonnaise 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.860
 that it is rather hard but good so we 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:57.919
 just start by putting the 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.270
 egg yolk in the bowl yes because 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.840
 you need a bowl I forgot to 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.699
 to say it elsewhere 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.740
 then we put the teaspoon of 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.629
 mustard and then we start beating 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.300
 while adding oil as you go 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:10.430
 measure and now is that they are engaged 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.169
 in the end you have your mayonnaise a 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.779
 time your mayonnaise is ready while 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:18.349
 simply you will add 1.9 of 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:20.449
 in a whole egg and plain yoghurt 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.310
 and here you are going to have your mask 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.650
 so just simply afterwards 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.900
 to really mix well and once 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.969
 that you mix well you can 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.099
 apply your mask on dry hair 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.779
 or wet or 8 it's like you 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.279
 prefer 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.899
 finally it's according to your preferences for 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.639
 apply your masks and once you 

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:40.009
 apply it you let it act 30 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.930
 minutes to an hour then you rinse 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:44.539
 well and you do your shampoo 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.520
 usual 700 m2 if you ever see that 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.520
 it's a little bit too hard from 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.460
 this is everyone this video is
