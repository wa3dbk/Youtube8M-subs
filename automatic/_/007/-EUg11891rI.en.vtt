00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello people here is your minecraft allowed 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 Today with a little beginner guide 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.189
 for skyrim beginners in which I give you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.110
 show we want best regards 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.910
 weapons and armor 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.860
 I know that most of you know 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.910
 my subscribers and sky of professionals 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.680
 already know how that works 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.570
 however, it is still the am 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.279
 Frequently asked question under all 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.230
 I now watch my videos for all time 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.939
 That's why I want to answer 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 Have fun with this video and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.029
 I hope one or the other 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.029
 something new will be there 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.760
 a danish weapon and armor counts 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.710
 pretty much one of the highest goals 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.600
 every skyrim player as they really are 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.760
 the strongest in the whole game are 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.320
 unless of course you have the dlc there 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.030
 installed then there are still some 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.800
 slightly stronger weapons 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.300
 nevertheless one can say of course that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.489
 the intervening weapons possible to the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.020
 strongest brain and, of course, too 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.449
 look super cool and really very 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.370
 are very desirable and there are 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.960
 three way to get close to these 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.210
 two of which are very well known 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.220
 third maybe not quite so and that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.630
 first is simply the whole character 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.460
 to level up then you will find 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.229
 this happens in the game I will 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.510
 I'll go in first as well 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.820
 Still telling how to get fresh weapons and 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.530
 Armours with blacksmithing yourself 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 can produce and the third you can 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.770
 she also with magic 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.240
 I will do all this 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.900
 right now in the following steps 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.330
 to explain 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.430
 Let's get started with the simplest 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.320
 but unfortunately also and most effective way 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.240
 namely the general one 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.270
 level up the whole character because 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.650
 once you reach level 46, it is 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.600
 you possible at the most diverse 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.009
 make the whole game fresh 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.930
 to find weapons and armor 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.060
 for example, in any boxes 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.310
 or else it could be too 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.380
 various dead bodies find the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.970
 killed mostly with strong opponents 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.009
 nevertheless one must say that they very much 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.990
 very rare so you will almost find 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.549
 never which and if you find one 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.170
 then of course it is rarely the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.149
 wish you weapon on time 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.770
 And finally you can get it then 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.450
 not improve anymore 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 most likely your blacksmithing 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.110
 level not on the stand is hers 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.869
 Needed for the fresh weapons 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.729
 to reinforce somewhat if 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.500
 you also have an enchanted one 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.420
 you still have to hope that the date is thrown 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.480
 another level waiting in the there is 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.030
 only from the stage 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.069
 That's why I can only recommend you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.659
 make your trivial things 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.610
 simply that is a lot 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.400
 work is definitely worth it 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.349
 you need blacksmithing level 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.090
 90 and how the whole thing goes fastest 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.610
 I have already in a video once 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.049
 shown and I have the same 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.299
 again below in the video description 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.799
 linked if you follow this method 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.110
 you should also and within one 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.640
 reach the level 90 hour and then 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.379
 do you still have to be in the talent tree of 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.220
 blacksmithing aesthetic forging 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.440
 unlock 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.000
 For that you need several parks until you 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.769
 then at the top of this talent point 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.450
 when it arrives it is important that he 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.769
 if the right side approaches 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.870
 you go over the left you do not come 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.730
 until the electric forging then 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.410
 so that he is an invisible border and 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.540
 you do not go around then 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.040
 you can just speak the blogs of the 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.400
 distribute it on the right side and you 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.440
 Sport any amount of talent points if you 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.329
 So level 90 reached and the talent 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.099
 activated the deadly forge art 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.170
 then you can go to any one 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.870
 Forge and then go there yourself 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.519
 your own weapons and armor as 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.109
 third product make for it 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.700
 However, he always needs three 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.470
 different things and the first one is 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.900
 of course, just a doctor 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.489
 then you need a date risches 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.739
 I'll tell you how he gets it 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.780
 the same and then a bit 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.340
 leather are the idea of a heart 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.079
 really hardest to get her 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.669
 are among the rarest items in the 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.470
 There are still a few games left 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.569
 put where they are always to be found and 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.639
 the simplest is probably certainly 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.010
 in white at the same time in her wasg 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.049
 teammates and that is the top 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.209
 marketplace this house with the funny 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.739
 roof and when he goes in there and the 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.959
 stairs down to the sleeping quarters 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.669
 then you will go dead on the 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.230
 small table a details find that 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.819
 you can steal and look for one 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.169
 game week it will then turn back 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.599
 so you get the next item 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.340
 If you can then produce as already 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.169
 briefly addressed or deadly 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.910
 you want to improve arsenal 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.349
 just go to this hone the 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.209
 you can find it in just about everyone 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.340
 Forge and then you need to turn 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.349
 one next to doctors and if you then 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.269
 she still works in the weapon 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.400
 make good some damage and on 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.889
 this way it is really possible one 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.639
 weapon am up to 1000 damage points 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.199
 to improve 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.789
 how exactly is I have already 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.349
 I'll show you a video 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.400
 you also again below in the video 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.199
 link description 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.080
 So we come to the third variant 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.910
 how to get the equipment 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.039
 and that is especially for magicians 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.419
 well suited, being somewhat questionable 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.160
 find something magician with one 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.900
 between armor wants because actually 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.120
 There is probably much better for the brand 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.830
 suitable marco ruben but no matter that 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.750
 If you are really well-developed 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.520
 may have your skills and less on the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.229
 blacksmithing or less level 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.300
 your character has then still exist 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.270
 the possibility if you the level 90 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.440
 in the conspiracy have reached over 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.860
 Diatonic forge you technical 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.449
 equipment where diatonic 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.860
 Forge is you really have to 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.930
 already know how to find here 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.580
 under the academy of winterproof wo 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.039
 you also do most of your magic 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.479
 gravel and around this tonnage 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.250
 to be able to start schmiede 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.199
 you need a so-called seal 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.800
 ask which one as I said until 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.479
 a summon level of 90 gets that way 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.310
 if you came down here then 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.840
 of course you have to be your first 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.580
 Brick in the box here in front 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.960
 put in the whole in order to 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.180
 bring and then you have the 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.770
 opportunity to interject the following objects 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.729
 in the end, an electric weapon 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.860
 get 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.570
 Of course we have one at first 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.669
 tetra herz we always need that 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.610
 we want to make something tetris 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.740
 then next from any weapon 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.750
 need only just for her to know the 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.520
 kind of weapon he will put into it 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.930
 In the end, you will also be in this form again 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.940
 say rausholen if he there to 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.949
 For example, it just makes it difficult 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.690
 you will end up with a danish sword 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.690
 get then you need next 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.130
 another centurion dynamo stone 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.169
 you can usually find that in the 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.330
 southwestern areas of streams in 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.430
 mostly deep in caves 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.070
 dwarf dwarves and then of course 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.720
 Finally, a black soul stone 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.940
 whether the teacher is filled today 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.310
 It does not matter if you can get it 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.840
 I only recommend you to flee after 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.909
 there is always a way to go moral 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.270
 an offer that is the magician of 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.440
 there has his cottage right on the river 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.909
 by merging all this 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.250
 things you have so synonymous 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:24.289
 possibility with some magic to the 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.550
 desired fresh objects 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:28.099
 come that is a little less 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.960
 well-known method because they do not even 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.280
 is used as often as I wanted 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.240
 no way the way 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.159
 withhold 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.020
 that was all, as I said 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.270
 possibilities to get fresh weapons 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.860
 and armor as a beginner to get 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.510
 for the professionals among you will not 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.040
 have been there much new 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.690
 Of course I hope that I do 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.370
 all the other of you again and again 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.500
 Asked about these questions 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.760
