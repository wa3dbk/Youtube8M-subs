00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
games you know so most guys fortunately

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.150

it<00:05:06.460> had<00:05:06.699> stepped<00:05:07.210> up<00:05:07.419> okay<00:05:07.990> through<00:05:08.350> my<00:05:08.979> what

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
it had stepped up okay through my what

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.010 
it had stepped up okay through my what
pretty<00:05:09.490> all<00:05:09.639> time<00:05:09.940> but<00:05:10.150> they<00:05:10.270> they<00:05:10.510> found<00:05:10.780> ways

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
pretty all time but they they found ways

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.690 
pretty all time but they they found ways
to<00:05:11.050> limit<00:05:11.789> found<00:05:12.789> ways<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.060> prepare

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
to limit found ways to prepare

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.870 
to limit found ways to prepare
oh<00:05:17.810> I<00:05:18.810> think<00:05:18.960> we're<00:05:19.320> in<00:05:20.100> a<00:05:20.160> good<00:05:20.190> spot<00:05:20.400> right

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
oh I think we're in a good spot right

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.110 
oh I think we're in a good spot right
now<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.540> we<00:05:21.840> would<00:05:21.990> that<00:05:22.640> experience<00:05:23.640> coming

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
now and we would that experience coming

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.580 
now and we would that experience coming
back<00:05:24.390> so<00:05:24.600> we're<00:05:24.780> different<00:05:25.140> than<00:05:25.320> where<00:05:25.500> we

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
back so we're different than where we

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.160 
back so we're different than where we
were<00:05:25.650> last<00:05:25.920> year
