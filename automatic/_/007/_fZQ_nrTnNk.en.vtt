much<00:01:47.060> wider<00:01:47.359> than<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.810> top<00:01:48.020> rail<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
much wider than the top rail so the

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.739 
much wider than the top rail so the
stopped<00:01:49.490> groove<00:01:49.759> must<00:01:50.060> reflect<00:01:50.329> that

difference that's why the marks on top

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.550 
difference that's why the marks on top
