00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:11.389
 in this video I will show you the principle 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.770
 works 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:19.500
 greenhouse without heating yes you are right 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:25.470
 understood without any special 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.369
 drowning and despite this in the end 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.369
 plates can be grown either tropical 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.369
 plants 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:50.280
 this recess 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:54.500
 greenhouses primer two times more than 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.500
 your territory freezing ground 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.049
 dig a trench 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.930
 Need north to south Orenburg 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:12.830
 as you see here this land is necessary 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.830
 throw away the trench to the west 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.630
 the overlap is made of 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.820
 begin the distance between them must pass 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:35.330
 56 centimeters 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:38.180
 the film we give above and below it 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.720
 necessarily like as between the films 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:51.160
 there will be an airbag and 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:02:01.510
 greenhouse will be protected from above secure 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:02:06.470
 the film should be planks just planochki on 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:10.690
 half a centimeter here we nail the film 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.910
 from above and we beat them with such strips from below 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.050
 when it is very cold there 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.080
 more than 30 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:25.880
 need to give the film another ball here 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:29.800
 inside the greenhouse here it is attached with 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:34.360
 using straps 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:38.770
 Spock the trench we fix it 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:43.070
 straight into the wall 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:47.590
 but it is necessary to fix at such a height so that 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:52.930
 there was no need for ground freezing 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.930
 necessarily lower than soil freezing 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.670
 the side walls do a little bit on he 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:08.870
 in order not to crumble the earth and 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:10.750
 for more resilient and more bigger 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.270
 light hits 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.270
 side walls must be 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:26.090
 margin 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.090
 how to say lime 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.190
 chasing two options first it will be 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:41.840
 more light inside the greenhouse because 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:49.080
 here comes a color slew and simultaneously 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:57.650
 disinfect all the insides of the slab on 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:04:01.230
 this wall shows that its depth is 2 meters 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:07.980
 width got two and a half meters 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:10.530
 and here are the sides it goes by three 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.000
 meter is a very normal option 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:18.959
 don't think there will be little room for you and 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.489
 so on if done on the greenhouse 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.489
 wider or 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:33.240
 there are other sizes 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:35.550
 you will already lose heat and 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.699
 in such a greenhouse will have to be 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:43.490
 install some kind of heating it 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.669
 order i think is the most economical and 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.800
 practically 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.210
 you need a little first 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:55.770
 work or order a tractor or 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:58.289
 the shovel is not important the length of the greenhouse can 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.300
 be any you can cook for yourself first 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:09.060
 there is 10 meters in the process you can imagine 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:12.780
 you can continue them to 100 so 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:16.250
 success if anything please contact 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.250
 I will answer all questions
