00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.040
 johann people get to a minute 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.690
 Thank you we will decide today 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.870
 I promised myself as promised 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.849
 Helicopter and Chechen Battlefield 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.109
 4 entertain that becker and calls 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.080
 I see here is in the background 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.000
 by the way, directly from the e3 of level cap 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 and charm were recorded that is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.240
 if you do not know the fans yet me 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.760
 have the links in the description 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.590
 unfortunately, there are only a few of them 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.109
 a helicopter fomc that will give it now 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.610
 it stands with great security 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.739
 already firmly because you can in the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.290
 customization menus we already have 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.680
 The e3 have seen the lettering of 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.750
 jets and ground combat network recognize the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.149
 ethik helicopter we here in velvet 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.120
 we can see are on the one hand has 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.989
 while continuing to pull the Chinese wz 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.390
 and last but not least the russian mb 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.820
 L2 cache all of these vehicles are 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.010
 of course, that's equally customizable 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.129
 means we have four custom slots for 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.670
 the pilots and three more for the gerner 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.970
 that means we have seven in total 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.479
 customization options for the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.040
 helicopter 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.409
 Of course, on top of that comes the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.990
 Eighth and that would be the beautiful 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.420
 vehicle kemmer so the pilot can 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.009
 his primary and secondary weapon 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.680
 Of course you also choose one 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.180
 defense measure and upgrade the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.939
 we already have premiere weapons 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.710
 are've seen eg the hydra rocket 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.020
 potts and the sony rock it bots the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.689
 sulies fly a bit slower than those 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.850
 but hydra do more harm for that 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.310
 infantry the hats skirts tops are in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.869
 very comparable on the whole 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.430
 with the standard rocket potts we 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.579
 also seen in battlefield 3 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.780
 As a secondary weapon, the pilot can 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.340
 Choosing a heated one means that knows 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.960
 you also from battlefield 3 who 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.149
 rockets are looking for more 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.280
 aircraft can be used 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.780
 the only defense we do 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.450
 have already seen are the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.369
 flyers whether the already known ecm lambs 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.119
 from battlefield 3 comes back 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.130
 still in question 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.590
 Of course we still have to last 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.380
 an upgrade for the pilot there we have 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.299
 unfortunately so far only self to see 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.950
 if there is more, because of course 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.560
 not yet but somehow reckon 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.959
 I already use it as a co-pilot or he 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.430
 8 as a gag helicopter you can 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.590
 Of course, three more beautiful ones 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.930
 look for the first weapon of the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.060
 Ghana is called a secondary weapon in the case 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.370
 For example, it could be a guided rocket 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.310
 So be a guided trade fair which one 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.260
 on ground targets but also on air targets 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.489
 You should be able to use these with one 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.290
 be laser marked 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.019
 by the way, the marking tool which 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.230
 one can use as Enlightenment means 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.269
 plo an extra thing which the pilot 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.700
 but not for the ghanaer is the 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.610
 optics there you can already zoom 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.420
 and of course infrared optics 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.430
 install 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.870
 here at Bern we have again 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.120
 an upgrade that is in the big and 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.489
 all we can up to 2 upgrades for 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.010
 use this vehicle and in the case 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.540
 was by default autoloader in it 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.640
 if you do not get it out yet 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.099
 got the first weapon from ghana 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.269
 is of course his normal can without 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.000
 which one already in battlefield 3 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.980
 has seen as a second helicopter type 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.459
 in battlefield 4 we have the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.880
 transport helicopter once the u16 i 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.540
 lon race and have z 9 for the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.250
 chinese 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.519
 in principle , the transport helicopters 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.709
 as in battlefield 3 1 pilot two ghana 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.390
 and two extra places for normal 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.130
 Passengers which then probably 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.260
 even while flying 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.690
 The only way to fix it is to repair it 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.940
 thing which one before going off as 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.440
 can change pilot are the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.260
 defense measures and there we have 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.150
 again only the flyers so far to the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.889
 unfortunately you can still use multiplayer jets 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.690
 Do not say as much as I hoped 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.519
 but i really have some 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.280
 information culled we 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.079
 already know about jazz so far 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.500
 singleplayer we have seen that it 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.910
 there is a bell v 22 osprey this gave it 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.980
 but already in 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.269
 Battlefield 3 in singleplayer and man 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.459
 Of course, she could not do that 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.340
 multiplayer fly as first correct 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.100
 job we have here to chen yang j 8 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.160
 which one interceptor is the quantities 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.560
 thunder douglas f 1800 which anyway 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.630
 multi room kombat airplane is is 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.280
 Of course, this again 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.500
 Chinese team would be the one then 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.599
 schenker j-20 got a grip 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.700
 which also like the f 18 one 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.739
 multivan kombat fighter jet is that 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.650
 means he does 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.569
 and he does ground combat is possible the 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.340
 the first thing that really stood out 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:31.250
 Of course it would be really cool in 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.770
 battlefield 4 is the xian h6 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.289
 that 's a really big one 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.840
 strategic bomber and the whole can 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.470
 man on the channel racing dlc poster 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.880
 marvel at the ac-130 spector too 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.419
 Again, you had them in too 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.449
 Battlefield 3 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.849
 but here in battlefield 4 she is something 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.099
 otherwise the commander can be here 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.159
 this airplane was still spawning 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:57.199
 this option is available as well 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.940
 it looks like up to three ghana 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.180
 and a passenger in the machine place 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.909
 taking the anti he means 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.789
 or by and large, not anymore 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.409
 Unfortunately, there are now 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.030
 not so much gameplay yet 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.130
 You really do not have that much yet 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.770
 say how they will behave 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.900
 they are similar to battlefield 2 or 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.909
 as in Battlefield 3, that will be 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.169
 means with these speculations I wait 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.819
 but once I find it 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.550
 of course, this cool super cool 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:27.680
 strategic bomber like left jan h 6 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.270
 because that would be a really 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.370
 bring in a cool new element and 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.440
 besides, i would very much welcome it if 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.469
 different types of jets in one 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.199
 play match like the a10 and the f 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:41.449
 18 in a team in a game so too 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.099
 say well that was it again 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.409
 to my little information video 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.060
 about the dogfight in battlefield 4 me 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.960
 Hope you like it if that 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.460
 that was the case 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.020
 I want just got a thumbs 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.819
 By the way, friend up with everyone that 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.800
 latest of the latest about battlefield 4 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.610
 want to have an abo harms there 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.139
 certainly not 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.099
 then it comes to see and hopefully 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.099
 Until next time
