00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.500
 Good today Hello 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:12.900
 This symbol 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:19.619
 I think I'm going to do a knitting method called ring top knitting 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.850
 In this way, it develops into the letter u of the child alphabet of Lou 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.430
 of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.220
 Symbol 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:32.029
 It is very interesting to say what kind of knitted fabric it will be. 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.029
 It becomes like this 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.480
 It's funny, is not it 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:44.780
 It's such an interesting way to add a little process to the top knitting 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.960
 I think Naa amazing person Masukore first thought becomes a knitted fabric 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.410
 I love knitting 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:59.570
 I think it would be nice to weave with eco-friendly stuff 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.570
 Nemu pop It seems to be good Cao ind is good and it seems to be foam standing good 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.310
 various 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:16.570
 I think that it can likely application softening flower motif and crab also to likely 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:18.960
 It seems to be a skirt of Amigurumi and various applications seem to be useful 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.960
 Gold Sesame 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 I'm doing a little work because it is one of the knitting patterns that I want to use in various ways 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.140

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.920

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.220

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.159

 You have to like this Fu 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.679
 I'm trying to make your Mami here 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.230
 After supporting the thread 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.250

 Pull out two at the same time 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.190
 I made one 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.470
 It will be a form that appears on the back side 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.460
 The same is also true 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.600
 With the middle finger 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:24.590
 Hook the thread like this 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.590
 The thumb and the forehead of this work 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:33.400
 To where you want to put knitting something like sandwich the place 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.400
 I will do this network 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.530
 It is an ordinary fine knitting from here, but now two 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.910
 It looks like this when you look at the place where the ring crochet was done 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.910
 Two rings were made 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.670
 Give 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.440
 Top knitting 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.440
 Pull out your finger and support me 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.549
 Top knitting 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.549
 I will do to feel like 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.160
 This is due to finger insertion 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.940
 Because the length of the bald changes 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.870
 Well here and here the length is a little different 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.000
 As much as possible 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.000
 I think it will be beautiful if you align 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.380
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:48.990
 It was an introduction of the ring top knitting a little work now A work using this is also in trial production 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.990
 By the way 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:58.190
 This is a failure of the measure, but do you know what you tried to make? 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.200
 It is great if you understand this 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.410
 This is right 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.310
 At home 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.510
 I 'm going to weave more and more in white 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.770
 I was trying to make a sheep 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.910
 What is the direction of the ring crochet but the enemy is opposite 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.910
 I'm stopping 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:29.150
 It is said that I have a measure in such a feeling, and it is also a guy in February after a mini day of twine strings now 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:33.680
 Slightly knit or unravel the guy you received for your request 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.040

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.420
 I came down below 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.760
 I think I'll try knitting this time 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.990
 More than ring crochet 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.990
