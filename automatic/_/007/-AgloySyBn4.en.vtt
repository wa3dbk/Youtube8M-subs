 youtube it on the lists welcome 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.880
 back a book on the front video 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.560
 today will be a bit different from the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.840
 videos you are accustomed to see here in 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.699
 Channel is in this video I will not show 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.170
 doing nothing to make you see or go 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.119
 show nothing of the kind actually i will 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.340
 raise a discussion here because I am 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.350
 bringing this discussion here I did 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.719
 That same question I said the same one 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.360
 thing on facebook and facebook software 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.460
 it's a very picky place a lot 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.590
 because depending on the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.780
 configuration that the guy has if he 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.110
 comments on fanpage only his friends 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.059
 came the conversation and most people 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 they can not read 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.320
 talk there and if it does not help 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.170
 really nothing my question was 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.660
 It's very simple, I want to change 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.210
 I want to upgrade to the river and take 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.950
 he from where he is and take the fifth 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.210
 nicer place, yes a city 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.390
 Different and I asked a question 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.520
 Which city is the best city is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.890
 What is the best municipality to live in? 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 The biologist is in Brazil. 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.100
 Survival lists I believe the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.259
 majority of people accompanying the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.259
 channel are survival lists 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.490
 I'll explain more or less mine. 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.829
 point of view is i can not stand it any more 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.140
 big city traffic and everything not 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.359
 It's going to happen, I 'm not going to leave anymore. 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.490
 I'm in a small town for a 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.069
 big city which I think is a lot 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.929
 survival advantage is in a 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.450
 who lives in a country town 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:52.020
 he has this nature next he is 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.390
 several times here and I got out 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.189
 on a journey like this to raehk from one to two 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.310
 voices come back with the cart full of 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.409
 firewood for example is among other things 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.079
 among other practical issues as well 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.629
 that the question of literally and practically 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.340
 to leave the house and go camping with a 

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:10.170
 little easier instead of getting 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.569
 making great trips to be able to do 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.920
 a simple camp and train things 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.959
 simple 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.549
 So I think it 's a city for me. 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.769
 ideal would be a city ​​that has 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.629
 resources of a city like internet by 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.900
 example it is logical that it will not work 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.329
 If you do not have internet in the city, it 's me 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.739
 I kill you to have the legal zone for you. 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.480
 to be able to work a little more 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.859
 preserved even if it is a more 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.720
 rural and everything else 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.359
 I asked the same question on the page 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.220
 from facebook and we had a lot of 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.290
 The answer is that you can not read 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.540
 Everyone and I got curious . 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.650
 Talking there, I talked to a lot of people. 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.079
 also from there 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.239
 Good, I really want to go out. 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.180
 search for more space and I'm really 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.489
 need to move house is to change to 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.260
 a little bigger place because all the 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.480
 programs that we do here for the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.970
 channel you see on the page in the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.400
 facebook are already taking the whole lot 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.810
 It's time to start is to get a 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.730
 A little bigger place 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.310
 I'm really willing to do this. 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.139
 is the idea is to literally ask for help 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.880
 of you with your comments 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.010

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.930
 is that the best place to live 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.329
 so in terms of survival 'list 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.829
 wp chang free survival is me 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.349

 possible to try to respond or try 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.739

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.660

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.470
