00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.030
 hello welcome to this video and we are going to 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.380
 See below how to download the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.779
 device drivers 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.960
 unknown to both windows 7 and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.939
 for windows 8 onwards this we are going to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 do it in case we have 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.810
 problems when you want to download 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.980
 and install the necessary drivers 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.420
 automatically if at the time of 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 that you have downloaded the drivers 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.440
 find them they simply have to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.260
 go to the manufacturer's website and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.460
 download them manually 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.440
 I had previously done a tutorial 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.510
 about how to update the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.640
 controllers automatically in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.829
 this case I am using a program 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.780
 it's called rain driver duscher is 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.699
 a program that automatically scans 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.460
 our computer looking for 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.980
 missing drivers and updates them 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.960
 in a single click but in this case we're going 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.449
 to manually do it manually 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.230
 for windows 8 the first thing we're going to 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.440
 do then is 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.690
 the windows x key or a right click 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.670
 on the start button and let's go 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.670
 where that device manager 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.000
 the positive managers section 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.670
 let's find those devices 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.980
 that are not updated 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.200
 drivers or that are not installed 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.460
 to then identify this 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.530
 controller in this case that is 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.950
 unknown let's give it right click and 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.659
 let's select properties 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.539
 in the properties of this driver 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.659
 let's go to the details tab and in 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.960
 the property section we are going to look for 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.420
 the label that says and hardware and 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.179
 here in the value section let's see 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.250
 that we have a unique identifier in 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.259
 this case is the name or is it the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.539
 unique identifier of this driver 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.100
 missing in our computer I do not know no 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.960
 it matters if we do not understand it simply 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.350
 what we are going to do is that the right and 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.380
 let's copy it 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.820
 Now what we are going to do is go to the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.500
 google page goes to any one 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.900
 seeker 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.760
 let's paste this public identifier 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.530
 and here in the results we will 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.930
 appear the page where possibly 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.790
 we can download the drivers in this 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.159
 case any of these pages are going 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.140
 to serve and began to search 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.870
 to later download this 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.470
 controller 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.120
 here is telling me that it is a 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.159
 driver for a radio adapter 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.340
 of fm that I was missing in the computer 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.810
 so what I do is just 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.750
 search on what page I can download 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.269
 and like any other program I start 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.799
 install it is basically this tutorial 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.140
 I wanted to show you how they can 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.480
 you find and install so 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.760
 manual those drivers that are 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.280
 unknown for windows up here 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.290
