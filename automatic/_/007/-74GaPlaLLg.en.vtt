00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:58.270 
the shell I've been on there forever I'm
pretty<00:03:56.810> sure<00:03:57.079> bleach<00:03:57.470> isn't<00:03:57.799> a<00:03:57.859> filler<00:03:58.129> I

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
pretty sure bleach isn't a filler I

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.099 
pretty sure bleach isn't a filler I
don't<00:03:58.549> know<00:03:58.639> I<00:03:58.699> just<00:03:58.729> I<00:03:59.090> washing<00:03:59.540> on<00:03:59.689> it<00:03:59.780> also
