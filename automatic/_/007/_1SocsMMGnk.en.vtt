00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
play one of these all the way through

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.820 
play one of these all the way through
you<00:02:43.819> could<00:02:44.000> play<00:02:44.209> one<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:44.780> then<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.680> next

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
you could play one and then in the next

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.550 
you could play one and then in the next
section<00:02:46.489> or<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.940> know<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.110> good<00:02:48.110> time<00:02:48.380> to

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
section or you know a good time to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.500 
section or you know a good time to
switch<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:49.010> know<00:02:49.130> four<00:02:49.819> measures<00:02:50.269> later

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
switch you know four measures later

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.380 
switch you know four measures later
eight<00:02:50.780> measures<00:02:51.050> they<00:02:51.380> later<00:02:52.090> only<00:02:53.090> over<00:02:53.300> the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
eight measures they later only over the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.600 
eight measures they later only over the
B<00:02:53.569> section<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.230> know<00:02:54.319> use<00:02:54.560> your<00:02:54.590> ears<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.430> can

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
B section you know use your ears you can

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.210 
B section you know use your ears you can
switch<00:02:55.880> into<00:02:56.239> one<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:56.989> these<00:02:57.080> other<00:02:57.349> patterns

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
switch into one of these other patterns

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.890 
switch into one of these other patterns
so<00:02:58.849> check<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.300> out

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.370 

so<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.530> see<00:03:06.680> what<00:03:06.739> I'm<00:03:06.860> doing<00:03:07.010> here

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.870 

I<00:03:11.910> took<00:03:12.910> pattern<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.810> pattern<00:03:14.170> B<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.880> did

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
I took pattern a and pattern B and did

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.910 
I took pattern a and pattern B and did
two<00:03:16.060> measures<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.630> two<00:03:16.930> measures<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.260> be<00:03:17.530> put

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
two measures of a two measures of be put

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.300 
two measures of a two measures of be put
it<00:03:18.010> right<00:03:18.130> next<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.550> each<00:03:18.610> other<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.090> going<00:03:19.360> up

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
it right next to each other so going up

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.940 
it right next to each other so going up
actually<00:03:22.150> I'm<00:03:22.300> sorry<00:03:22.540> one<00:03:23.260> measure<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.650> the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
actually I'm sorry one measure of the

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.760 
actually I'm sorry one measure of the
a11<00:03:24.940> measure<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.420> b1<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.959> make<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.560> measure

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
a11 measure the b1 to make a to measure

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:34.290 
a11 measure the b1 to make a to measure
pattern<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:27.510> up<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.959> then
