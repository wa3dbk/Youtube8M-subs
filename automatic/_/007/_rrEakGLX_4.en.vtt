00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.700
 good 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.700
 two 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.070
 hello amateur radio control and in 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.360
 this mini case 72 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.680
 mini zetas 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.960
 I do not know if you will remember that one of the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.070
 previous videos two or three videos 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.580
 previous we talked about 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.920
 a new chassis model wdl media 0 20 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.560
 that had left and some information 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.570
 and we also point to some news 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.270
 in the deserves 3 we already have more 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.160
 information we have these images that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.800
 we are going to teach you now this is a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.350
 kind of presentation not very formal 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.300
 that he made use of the models that were going to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.230
 present at the Tokyo show that has 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.000
 celebrated this past weekend 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.210
 in this presentation that I put on 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.610
 on a table all the models of 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.770
 static model radio control everything 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.879
 that make boats and so on 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.620
 models that were going to present at the fair 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.250
 so that the press could photograph 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.720
 and on one of the tables these 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.420
 specific photos as you can see in 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.850
 this several mini zer0 three bodies 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.100
 quite current and in the middle a station 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.040
 tasting 19 first alarm that we take 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 all after in this other image yes that 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.160
 we can already see that the station catches 19 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.490
 had a kind of a fringe the color 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.220
 blue 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.970
 that is also new 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.950
 in another image we saw a chassis m of 0-3 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.400
 up close apparently the same as those 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.260
 we have now but with the blue antenna already 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.480
 what's up with the blue color and everyone a 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.210
 little flies we are mini mushroom geeks and 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.030
 that already caught our attention and in this 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.370
 last image that they posted was 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.520
 some understand that curious engineers 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.100
 or technicians manipulating like adjusting the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.700
 katy 19 station in front of a mini zmr 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.640
 03 that's a novelty because if those who 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.920
 you do not know the station cate 19 works 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.800
 only for mini bikes for Zs 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.050
 motor make mini 7 of them or a 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.920
 4-channel station with some settings 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.590
 exclusive for motorcycles and not valid for 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.110
 the cars the mini cars that are in 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.410
 03 02 work with the broadcaster cate 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.320
 18 the previous model so much of mere 03 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.540
 acted as the station katy 18 are 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.090
 manufactured by bought for the manufacturer 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.220
 of giant world broadcasters that all 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.440
 you know 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.640
 the transmitter cat 19 is not manufactured 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.410
 because they either 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.959
 what information do we have information 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.930
 cool this weekend was disputed 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.150
 As I told you, the hall of 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.610
 tokyo of the hobby and in the curious has 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.540
 presented all this novelty the holder 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.670
 the news is called mini mushroom sports the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.510
 mini set a esports is composed of a 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.390
 chassis at 0-3 equal to the one we have 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.610
 a body exactly like the 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.370
 that run from mini z and the Qatari station 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.530
 19 what differences does it have is going to sell 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.920
 in ready format the three pieces 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.140
 together the station catches 19 extra station 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.760
 of 4 channels that will work with the 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.579
 new electronics and that's the novelty 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.890
 that carries the chassis in my recipe 3 is 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.709
 one is a pack for beginners it 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.780
 should depend on the 180 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.200
 euros have not specified less than 200 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.830
 euros body chassis plus issuer me 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.230
 I sign now 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.360
 Y 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.400
 in terms of benefits obviously 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.200
 is a new electronics that does not 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.940
 Factory out the factory with own 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.700
 same as the small station and moves 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.370
 and having a benefit least not 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.440
 you can connect gyroscope is a 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.720
 electronics that does not have a connector either 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.510
 to connect the electronics to 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.239
 computer using the system i cs no 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.190
 there's tiki-tiki version okay so 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.500
 to carry a station 4 for channels 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.110
 we already know that that's going to launch a kit 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.340
 lights for these cars that of some 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.310
 have to connect to the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.870
 station and that through the third channel 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.540
 we can activate or deactivate the lights 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.010
 from the station itself and for what we 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.170
 have said the fourth channel is going to be a 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.120
 kind of dual rate to be able to remove 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.180
 roll more turn to the whole direction of the 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.980
 car 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.350
 these are the news you want 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.850
 present we know that this is going to come out to 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.519
 end of October and early 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.530
 November and we know that the first 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.750
 bodies are going to be mans so much the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.990
 mazda like the sauber of 9 but that 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:32.720
 they also point to that if the ferrari 458 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.610
 italy what if the audi r8 the new toyota 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.710
 good street version there are several 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.080
 speculations but surely they are going to 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.020
 get out the first the Mazda and the 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.820
 sauber de le mans remember the chassis is 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.900
 exactly the same as we had 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.660
 until now and it only changes then that is 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.340
 a version for beginners we think 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.830
 which is something very positive finally 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.180
 We will have an item to be able to sell 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.470
 to all the people who want 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.520
 start and do not want to make a 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.610
 disbursement around 250 or 280 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.740
 euros may have a mini zmr 0-3 more 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.539
 economic that there will be two 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.370
 electronic llosa has told us that they are going 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.889
 to continue making the normal as 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.229
 electronic cane for sugarcane cars and 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.880
 this cheaper version just like in 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:23.730
 his day came out the dmre 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.830
 It does not deserve 2x because it will manufacture this 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.230
 cheaper version that will be sold in 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.390
 network and it stops for those who start as 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.770
 want to enter the world of 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.350
 mini date and do not want to make a big 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.540
 disbursement 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.040
