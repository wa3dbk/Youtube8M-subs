00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.000 
the Canadian cold to talk to you today
about<00:00:05.279> your<00:00:05.910> nervous<00:00:06.299> system<00:00:06.589> why<00:00:07.589> should<00:00:07.890> you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
about your nervous system why should you

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.970 
about your nervous system why should you
care<00:00:08.300> because<00:00:09.300> your<00:00:09.450> nervous<00:00:09.809> system<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.380> in

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
care because your nervous system is in

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.759 
care because your nervous system is in
large<00:00:11.219> part<00:00:11.639> responsible<00:00:11.849> for<00:00:12.719> how<00:00:13.349> fast<00:00:13.590> you

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
large part responsible for how fast you

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.650 
large part responsible for how fast you
build<00:00:13.980> muscle<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.490> how<00:00:14.940> fast<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.389> increase

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
build muscle and how fast you increase

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.900 
build muscle and how fast you increase

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
I want to move my hand I have to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.940 
I want to move my hand I have to
activate<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> nerve<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.559> done<00:00:40.739> through

my brain my brain sends the signal down
this<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.890> important<00:00:44.399> because<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.239> have

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
this is important because you have

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.760 
this is important because you have
different<00:00:45.629> types<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.930> nerves<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.649> have

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
different types of nerves and you have

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.650 
different types of nerves and you have
different<00:00:46.950> types<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.340> muscles<00:00:47.640> right<00:00:48.270> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
different types of muscles right you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
different types of muscles right you
have<00:00:48.780> fast<00:00:49.260> nerves<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.430> slow

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
have fast nerves and you have slow

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.850 
have fast nerves and you have slow
nerves<00:00:50.940> yeah<00:00:51.239> fast<00:00:51.629> muscles<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.260> slow

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
nerves yeah fast muscles and slow

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.250 
nerves yeah fast muscles and slow
muscles<00:00:53.370> research<00:00:54.149> shows<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.899> fast

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
muscles research shows that the fast

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
muscles research shows that the fast
muscles<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.010> muscle<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.430> responsible<00:00:56.579> for

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
muscles the muscle is responsible for

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.000 
muscles the muscle is responsible for
explosive<00:00:57.600> actions<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.170> powerful<00:00:58.680> you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
explosive actions think powerful you

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.549 
explosive actions think powerful you
know<00:00:59.129> runningback<00:00:59.640> sprinters<00:01:00.559> Olympic

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
know runningback sprinters Olympic

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.219 
know runningback sprinters Olympic
lifters<00:01:02.010> are<00:01:02.219> better<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.690> building<00:01:03.899> muscle

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
lifters are better for building muscle

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.070 
lifters are better for building muscle
so<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:05.460> would<00:01:05.610> prefer<00:01:05.810> generally<00:01:06.810> speaking

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
so we would prefer generally speaking

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.429 
so we would prefer generally speaking
more<00:01:07.500> fast<00:01:08.010> muscle<00:01:08.430> fibers<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.049> fast<00:01:10.049> nerve

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
more fast muscle fibers a fast nerve

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.859 
more fast muscle fibers a fast nerve
will<00:01:10.979> always<00:01:11.310> activate<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.909> fast<00:01:12.210> muscle<00:01:12.540> fiber

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
will always activate a fast muscle fiber

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.920 
will always activate a fast muscle fiber
a<00:01:13.170> slow<00:01:13.950> nerve<00:01:14.250> will<00:01:14.640> activate<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> slow<00:01:15.540> muscle

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
a slow nerve will activate a slow muscle

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.800 
a slow nerve will activate a slow muscle
fiber<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.710> can't<00:01:17.040> determine<00:01:17.430> our<00:01:17.790> makeup<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
fiber we can't determine our makeup of

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.510 
fiber we can't determine our makeup of
our<00:01:18.960> genetics<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:19.770> how<00:01:20.009> many<00:01:20.070> muscle<00:01:20.490> fibers

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
our genetics now how many muscle fibers

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.140 
our genetics now how many muscle fibers
we<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.060> fast<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.720> slow<00:01:21.930> however<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.820> can

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
we have fast or slow however what we can

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.910 
we have fast or slow however what we can
do<00:01:24.450> now<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> nerve

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
do now that we know that a nerve

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.520 
do now that we know that a nerve
controls<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> muscle<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:27.570> studies<00:01:28.140> show<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
controls a muscle what studies show is

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.560 
controls a muscle what studies show is
that<00:01:28.670> innervation<00:01:29.670> could<00:01:29.880> take<00:01:30.060> place<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that innervation could take place and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.929 
that innervation could take place and
what<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.740> means<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.549> take<00:01:32.759> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
what this means is that if you take a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.319 
what this means is that if you take a
fast<00:01:33.450> nerve<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.920> would<00:01:35.189> actually<00:01:35.610> turn<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.880> slow

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
fast nerve it would actually turn a slow

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.289 
fast nerve it would actually turn a slow
muscle<00:01:36.810> into<00:01:37.470> properties<00:01:38.009> resembling<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.790> fast

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
muscle into properties resembling a fast

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.660 
muscle into properties resembling a fast
muscle<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.990> other<00:01:40.710> words<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.310> nerve

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
muscle in other words the nerve

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.210 
muscle in other words the nerve
determines<00:01:42.509> what<00:01:42.930> type<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.229> muscle<00:01:43.590> fiber<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
determines what type of muscle fiber you

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.580 
determines what type of muscle fiber you
have<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:45.240> if<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.750> fast<00:01:46.170> nerve

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
have so if you have a fast nerve

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649 
have so if you have a fast nerve
attached<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.369> slow<00:01:47.579> muscle<00:01:47.939> theoretically<00:01:48.450> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
attached to slow muscle theoretically of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.660 
attached to slow muscle theoretically of
course<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.680> properties<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.369> slow

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
course the properties of that slow

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.789 
course the properties of that slow
muscle<00:01:51.060> will<00:01:51.299> start<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.840> resemble<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
muscle will start to resemble that of a

yourself making the shot you know
scoring<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.270> touchdown<00:03:39.690> all<00:03:40.320> those<00:03:40.650> examples

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
scoring the touchdown all those examples

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.949 
scoring the touchdown all those examples
actually<00:03:41.730> helps<00:03:42.030> them<00:03:42.120> achieve<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.600> end

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
actually helps them achieve that end

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.979 
actually helps them achieve that end
outcome<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.160> big<00:03:44.400> tip<00:03:44.700> if<00:03:44.910> we<00:03:45.630> know<00:03:45.810> that

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
outcome so the big tip if we know that

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.750 
outcome so the big tip if we know that
our<00:03:46.110> brain<00:03:46.350> makes<00:03:46.560> our<00:03:46.770> muscles<00:03:46.920> stronger<00:03:47.580> and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
our brain makes our muscles stronger and

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.220 
our brain makes our muscles stronger and
can<00:03:47.880> help<00:03:48.060> increase<00:03:48.209> our<00:03:48.540> strength<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:49.080> by

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
can help increase our strength just by

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.080 
can help increase our strength just by
thinking<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.800> increasing<00:03:50.430> our<00:03:50.790> strength

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
thinking about increasing our strength

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.540 
thinking about increasing our strength
you<00:03:51.660> should<00:03:51.870> think<00:03:52.080> about<00:03:52.230> always<00:03:52.800> training

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
you should think about always training

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.449 
you should think about always training

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
success and this is a big tip I practice

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.310 
success and this is a big tip I practice
this<00:03:56.580> on<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.850> frequent<00:03:57.480> basis<00:03:57.870> when<00:03:58.050> I'm<00:03:58.140> not

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
this on a frequent basis when I'm not

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.960 
this on a frequent basis when I'm not
training<00:03:58.620> sometimes<00:03:59.160> I'll<00:03:59.459> just<00:03:59.610> think<00:03:59.790> about

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
training sometimes I'll just think about

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.729 
training sometimes I'll just think about
training<00:04:00.360> think<00:04:00.840> about<00:04:01.050> smashing<00:04:01.620> my

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
training think about smashing my

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.530 
training think about smashing my
personal<00:04:02.220> records<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.700> by<00:04:03.030> thinking<00:04:03.480> about

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
personal records and by thinking about

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.720 
personal records and by thinking about
it<00:04:03.840> constantly<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.440> becomes<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.130> reality<00:04:05.370> I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
it constantly it becomes a reality I

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.360 
it constantly it becomes a reality I
help<00:04:06.090> bring<00:04:06.570> it<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:07.080> reality<00:04:07.230> because<00:04:08.040> I've

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
help bring it to reality because I've

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.340 
help bring it to reality because I've
already<00:04:08.520> done<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.120> in<00:04:09.239> my<00:04:09.390> brain<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.900> couple

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
already done it in my brain a couple

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.350 
already done it in my brain a couple
dozen<00:04:10.650> times<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:11.190> mean<00:04:11.580> that<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.150> would<00:04:12.270> have

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
dozen times I mean that I would have

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.270 
dozen times I mean that I would have
tribute<00:04:12.660> part<00:04:13.020> of<00:04:13.200> my<00:04:13.470> increase<00:04:14.010> in<00:04:14.190> my

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
tribute part of my increase in my

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.300 
tribute part of my increase in my
strength<00:04:14.640> over<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.239> last<00:04:15.390> year<00:04:15.660> to

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
strength over the last year to

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.620 
strength over the last year to
visualizing<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.489> success<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.120> visualizing

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
visualizing that success and visualizing

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.210 
visualizing that success and visualizing
training<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.470> think<00:04:19.500> if<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:19.919> look<00:04:20.070> at<00:04:20.160> a

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
training and I think if you look at a

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.860 
training and I think if you look at a
lot<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.520> individuals<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.150> will<00:04:21.359> fail<00:04:21.660> and

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
lot of individuals that will fail and

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.630 
lot of individuals that will fail and
miss<00:04:22.200> lifts<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.770> not<00:04:23.160> increase<00:04:23.490> your

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
miss lifts and not increase your

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.100 
miss lifts and not increase your
strength<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:24.030> because<00:04:24.330> they're<00:04:24.510> scared<00:04:24.720> of

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
strength is because they're scared of

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.520 
strength is because they're scared of
lifting<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:25.919> weight

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
lifting that weight

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.470 
lifting that weight
what<00:04:27.130> they<00:04:27.250> think<00:04:27.310> about<00:04:27.580> in<00:04:27.910> their<00:04:28.060> head<00:04:28.240> is

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
what they think about in their head is

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.960 
what they think about in their head is
failure<00:04:28.840> instead<00:04:29.200> of<00:04:29.500> success<00:04:29.889> your<00:04:30.580> brain

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
failure instead of success your brain

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.820 
failure instead of success your brain
will<00:04:31.389> help<00:04:31.630> make<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.080> muscles<00:04:32.470> stronger

about success and thinking about
