things<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.630> aware<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.380> go<00:01:22.500> through

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
things to be aware of as you go through

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.730 
things to be aware of as you go through
is<00:01:22.950> when<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> those<00:01:24.720> last<00:01:25.049> two<00:01:25.350> flam's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
is when you get to those last two flam's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.480 
is when you get to those last two flam's
making<00:01:26.700> sure<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.420> rebounded<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
making sure that they are rebounded and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.039 
making sure that they are rebounded and
rather<00:01:29.490> than<00:01:29.700> being<00:01:29.850> very<00:01:30.180> staccato<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.930> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
rather than being very staccato so that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.690 
rather than being very staccato so that
you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.470> them<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.710> connect<00:01:32.159> nice<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you can get them to connect nice and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.149 
you can get them to connect nice and
even<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:34.229> space<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> grace<00:01:34.920> note

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
even and the space of the grace note

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.580 
even and the space of the grace note
where<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.970> doesn't<00:01:36.150> become<00:01:36.600> flat<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.229> pop

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
where it doesn't become flat and pop

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.429 
where it doesn't become flat and pop
with<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> accent<00:01:45.290> once<00:01:46.290> you're

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
with the with the accent once you're

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.920 
with the with the accent once you're
comfortable<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.700> playing<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.360> add

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
comfortable with just playing one add

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:59.060 
comfortable with just playing one add
two

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:18.150 

and<00:02:00.070> so<00:02:00.970> on<00:02:01.120> add<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.480> couple<00:02:01.840> more<00:02:16.740> as<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:17.980> play

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
and so on add a couple more as you play

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.470 
and so on add a couple more as you play
this<00:02:18.280> faster<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.850> might<00:02:19.030> want<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.270> take<00:02:19.420> a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
this faster you might want to take a

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.480 
this faster you might want to take a
legato<00:02:19.930> approach<00:02:20.350> as<00:02:20.590> opposed<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.130> staccato

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
legato approach as opposed to a staccato

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:30.410 
legato approach as opposed to a staccato
approach<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:28.450> becomes<00:02:28.870> more<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.830> fingers

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
approach it becomes more of the fingers

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.980 
approach it becomes more of the fingers
kind<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:32.970> doing<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.480> stick<00:02:34.750> just

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
kind of doing this on the stick just

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.020 
kind of doing this on the stick just
gripping<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.650> little<00:02:35.890> bit<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.430> allowing<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
gripping a little bit and allowing the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.850 
gripping a little bit and allowing the
stick<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.390> bounce<00:02:37.420> back<00:02:37.870> up<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.290> controlling

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
stick to bounce back up and controlling

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:48.810 
stick to bounce back up and controlling
that<00:02:38.890> balance<00:02:39.340> with<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.610> fingers<00:02:47.580> it's<00:02:48.580> good

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
that balance with the fingers it's good

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.370 
that balance with the fingers it's good
to<00:02:48.940> work<00:02:49.120> on<00:02:49.300> this<00:02:49.420> rudiment<00:02:49.870> because<00:02:50.170> you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
to work on this rudiment because you

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.470 
to work on this rudiment because you
won't<00:02:50.590> always<00:02:50.710> find<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.580> as<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.270> patty

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
won't always find it just as the patty

exercise that will demonstrate the same
feel<00:03:11.410> as<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.910> alternative<00:03:13.480> patty<00:03:13.720> flaw<00:03:13.989> flaw

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
feel as the alternative patty flaw flaw

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.620 
feel as the alternative patty flaw flaw
but<00:03:14.680> incorporate<00:03:15.280> more<00:03:15.520> flam's<00:03:15.880> on<00:03:16.150> one<00:03:16.360> hand

I'll<00:03:17.260> start<00:03:17.560> with<00:03:17.650> one<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:17.950> add<00:03:18.430> one<00:03:18.730> as<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:19.000> go

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
I'll start with one and add one as I go

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:52.699 
I'll start with one and add one as I go
through

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.720 

it's<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.860> last<00:03:54.070> note<00:03:54.489> tick<00:03:56.550> once<00:03:57.550> you've

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
it's the last note tick once you've
