It's time for tabbouleh, an Arab dish, fresh
and super crunchy that is also very versatile,

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.570
because you can have it warm or cold
and as a base I’ve used bulgur, or

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.050
a cracked wheat. But alternatively
you can use the couscous or quinoa or any

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.249
other cereal.
Let’s start from the bulgur. Follow the instructions

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.349
of the bulgur you bought. I have
put it together in cold water in a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.070
pot, let it simmer until
is ready. Meanwhile prepare

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.150
the rest of the ingredients. For the cherry tomatoes,
I'm going to cut them in half and deseed them with

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.640
a teaspoon to remove all seeds
and all the water from the inside.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:53.690
Then cut them into cubes and put them aside.
Cut the two extremes of a pepper, remove the seeds

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.890
and cut into cubes too.
Peel a carrot and grate it with

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.440
a coarse grater. When the bulgur
is ready it will be very bulky and very grainy.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.830
Move it to a bowl where it will be easier
for seasoning and it will cool down too

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.760
in the meantime. Time to chop
parsley and basil, in abundance.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.200
Do not worry about the amount of parsley
because it will be worth. Plus, if you take

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.380
away the tabbouleh not forget the wire
floss. Take the parsley

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:35.120
and the basil and chop them finely together.
I just have to assemble the tabbouleh. Take

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.420
the bowl and add all the diced vegetables
and grated carrots.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.979
Add the zest of a whole lemon and
its juice.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.710
Then parsley, a good pinch of salt,
a drop of oil then stir everything with

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.760
your hands.
To maintain the volume and the bulgur beautiful

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.090
areated.
Last put it on your plate, a sprig of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.500
parsley and it's ready. You can safely prepare
the tabbouleh in advance. Since

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.659
there is also the lemon juice it will stay fresh
for at least a couple of days in the refrigerator.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.289
Photography!
I decided to experiment with these wooden layers

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.430
I had been given by
joinery under home.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.409
I lay them down, add the dish with the
tabbouleh, a sprig of cherry tomatoes that I wrapped

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.659
with parchment paper. Then simply add
a glass of fresh water with a floating slice

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:28.120
lemon. And this photograph
will be absolutely taken from above. This

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.120
photograph along with all the others that I shot
in video recipes are on my Instagram.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.400
Check them out and give it a like
and leave comments.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.169
This week I’ll show you a picture of
Dino del Corso, who has recreated the hummus but

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:45.519
with a very creative touch, because he
added some mustard. All done Dino!

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.889
I am very glad that you also shared
the picture with me. The ingredients

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.790
