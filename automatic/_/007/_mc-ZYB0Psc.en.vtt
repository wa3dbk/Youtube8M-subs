00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.319 
you know I've never asked you this
before<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.579> maybe<00:03:22.730> putting<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.090> on<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.180> spot

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
before so maybe putting you on the spot

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.830 
before so maybe putting you on the spot
here<00:03:23.480> but<00:03:24.280> what<00:03:25.280> you're<00:03:25.400> saying<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:26.150> very<00:03:26.480> good

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
here but what you're saying is very good

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.569 
here but what you're saying is very good
in<00:03:26.959> theory<00:03:27.200> right<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.129> that's<00:03:28.310> what<00:03:28.430> most

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
in theory right and that's what most

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.339 
in theory right and that's what most
people<00:03:29.030> are<00:03:29.090> gonna<00:03:29.209> say<00:03:29.450> yeah<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:29.930> sounds

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
people are gonna say yeah that sounds

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.979 
people are gonna say yeah that sounds
really<00:03:30.470> good<00:03:30.739> theologically<00:03:31.700> sound<00:03:31.989> makes

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
really good theologically sound makes

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.379 
really good theologically sound makes
sense<00:03:33.349> except<00:03:33.980> when<00:03:34.940> I'm<00:03:35.030> going<00:03:35.359> through

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
sense except when I'm going through

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.870 
sense except when I'm going through
something<00:03:35.599> really<00:03:36.079> difficult<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.730> the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
something really difficult and the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.860 
something really difficult and the
theory<00:03:38.120> has<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.299> be<00:03:38.419> put<00:03:38.690> into<00:03:38.870> practice<00:03:39.489> then

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
theory has to be put into practice then

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.839 
theory has to be put into practice then
it<00:03:41.870> doesn't<00:03:42.560> work<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:42.950> smoothly<00:03:43.250> have<00:03:43.519> you<00:03:43.669> had

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
it doesn't work so smoothly have you had

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.819 
it doesn't work so smoothly have you had
to<00:03:44.000> put<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.239> into<00:03:44.389> practice<00:03:44.870> in<00:03:45.590> your<00:03:45.769> own

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
to put this into practice in your own

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.150 
to put this into practice in your own
life<00:03:46.220> during<00:03:47.209> a<00:03:47.630> season<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.290> turmoil<00:03:48.769> or<00:03:48.980> where

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
life during a season of turmoil or where

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.069 
life during a season of turmoil or where
the<00:03:49.639> pressures<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.120> life<00:03:50.150> really<00:03:50.569> were<00:03:50.780> trying

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
the pressures of life really were trying

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.839 
the pressures of life really were trying
to<00:03:51.169> overwhelm<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.739> yeah<00:03:52.430> as<00:03:52.549> a<00:03:52.609> matter<00:03:52.790> of

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
to overwhelm you yeah as a matter of

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.759 
to overwhelm you yeah as a matter of
fact<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.180> find<00:03:53.419> that<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.810> most<00:03:53.989> difficulties

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
fact I find that the most difficulties

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:55.990 
fact I find that the most difficulties
in<00:03:54.919> this<00:03:55.040> life<00:03:55.250> have<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.609> do<00:03:55.760> with<00:03:55.790> how

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
in this life have to do with how

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.759 
in this life have to do with how
self-centered<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.630> am<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.680> how

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
self-centered I am and how

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.729 
self-centered I am and how
self-conscious<00:03:58.310> I<00:03:58.639> am<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.599> gets<00:03:59.750> harder

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
self-conscious I am so it gets harder

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.890 
self-conscious I am so it gets harder
and<00:04:00.829> harder<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:01.400> more<00:04:01.760> pressures<00:04:02.750> of<00:04:02.870> life

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
and harder the more pressures of life

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.539 
and harder the more pressures of life
try<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.290> make<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.560> look<00:04:03.739> at<00:04:03.919> yourself<00:04:04.099> and

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
try to make you look at yourself and

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.490 
try to make you look at yourself and
look<00:04:05.180> at<00:04:05.269> this<00:04:05.450> life<00:04:05.690> but<00:04:06.680> when<00:04:07.269> you<00:04:08.269> can<00:04:08.629> pull

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
look at this life but when you can pull

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.550 
look at this life but when you can pull
yourself<00:04:09.680> away<00:04:10.160> from<00:04:10.220> those<00:04:10.489> things<00:04:10.760> in<00:04:11.560> exact

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
yourself away from those things in exact

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.559 
yourself away from those things in exact
proportion<00:04:13.129> to<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.370> difficulty<00:04:13.970> he<00:04:14.450> will

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
proportion to the difficulty he will

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.960 
proportion to the difficulty he will
give<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.780> comfort<00:04:15.049> and<00:04:15.680> that's<00:04:16.280> that's<00:04:16.789> where

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
give you comfort and that's that's where

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.819 
give you comfort and that's that's where
he<00:04:17.060> shines<00:04:17.359> brightest<00:04:17.959> is<00:04:18.109> when<00:04:18.260> it's<00:04:18.380> darkest

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
he shines brightest is when it's darkest

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.039 
he shines brightest is when it's darkest
so<00:04:19.250> what<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:19.880> hear<00:04:20.000> you<00:04:20.060> saying<00:04:20.269> is<00:04:20.419> when<00:04:20.690> we're

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
so what I hear you saying is when we're

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.620 
so what I hear you saying is when we're
in<00:04:21.169> those<00:04:21.320> seasons<00:04:21.829> of<00:04:22.300> difficulty<00:04:23.300> and

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
in those seasons of difficulty and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.500 
in those seasons of difficulty and
darkness<00:04:24.410> of<00:04:24.560> pressure<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:25.669> temptation<00:04:26.360> is

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
darkness of pressure the temptation is

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.020 
darkness of pressure the temptation is
to<00:04:26.690> put<00:04:26.900> our<00:04:27.050> focus<00:04:27.349> on<00:04:27.470> those<00:04:27.620> things<00:04:28.030> but

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
to put our focus on those things but

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.460 
to put our focus on those things but
actually<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.510> more<00:04:29.660> we<00:04:29.750> put<00:04:29.900> our<00:04:29.990> focus<00:04:30.169> on

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
actually the more we put our focus on

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.260 
actually the more we put our focus on
them<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.830> more<00:04:30.860> difficult<00:04:31.220> they<00:04:31.520> become<00:04:31.849> yes

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
them the more difficult they become yes

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.330 
them the more difficult they become yes
definitely<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.500> what<00:04:33.740> you're<00:04:33.890> saying<00:04:34.130> is<00:04:34.219> the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
definitely but what you're saying is the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.589 
definitely but what you're saying is the
thing<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.520> seems<00:04:34.789> counterintuitive<00:04:35.090> which

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
thing that seems counterintuitive which

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:36.790 
thing that seems counterintuitive which
is<00:04:35.719> taking<00:04:35.960> your<00:04:36.050> attention<00:04:36.409> off<00:04:36.530> of<00:04:36.560> them

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
is taking your attention off of them

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.260 
is taking your attention off of them
putting<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.550> on<00:04:37.640> Jesus

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
putting it on Jesus

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.360 
putting it on Jesus
takes<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.570> burden<00:04:38.660> lighter<00:04:39.050> right<00:04:39.920> and<00:04:40.130> makes

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
takes the burden lighter right and makes

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.370 
takes the burden lighter right and makes
even<00:04:40.670> going<00:04:41.060> through<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.270> trial<00:04:41.570> easier<00:04:42.170> as

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
even going through the trial easier as

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.180 
even going through the trial easier as
we<00:04:43.100> focus<00:04:43.250> on<00:04:43.610> him<00:04:43.850> yeah<00:04:44.660> most<00:04:45.410> definitely<00:04:45.830> yes

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
we focus on him yeah most definitely yes

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.800 
we focus on him yeah most definitely yes
and<00:04:46.430> that's<00:04:46.490> what<00:04:46.760> Jesus<00:04:46.910> is<00:04:47.180> showing<00:04:47.510> us<00:04:47.630> when

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
and that's what Jesus is showing us when

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.990 
and that's what Jesus is showing us when
he<00:04:47.870> says<00:04:48.080> salvation<00:04:48.770> David<00:04:49.430> calls<00:04:49.670> God

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
he says salvation David calls God

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.120 
he says salvation David calls God
actually<00:04:50.390> salvation<00:04:50.900> several<00:04:51.710> times<00:04:51.890> he<00:04:51.980> says

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
actually salvation several times he says

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.100 
actually salvation several times he says
you<00:04:52.280> are<00:04:52.310> my<00:04:53.000> salvation<00:04:53.210> other<00:04:53.720> times<00:04:53.990> she

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
you are my salvation other times she

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.560 
you are my salvation other times she
says<00:04:54.320> my<00:04:54.710> salvation<00:04:55.100> he<00:04:55.820> actually<00:04:56.090> named<00:04:56.330> some

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
says my salvation he actually named some

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.710 
says my salvation he actually named some
salvation<00:04:57.250> salvation<00:04:58.250> is<00:04:58.400> being<00:04:59.300> delivered

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
salvation salvation is being delivered

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.130 
salvation salvation is being delivered
out<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.920> life<00:05:01.220> that<00:05:01.700> does<00:05:02.510> not<00:05:02.750> have<00:05:02.990> his

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
out of a life that does not have his

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.200 
out of a life that does not have his
presence<00:05:03.650> that's<00:05:04.310> what<00:05:04.490> salvation<00:05:04.640> is<00:05:05.000> he's

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
presence that's what salvation is he's

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.380 
presence that's what salvation is he's
called<00:05:05.420> us<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.810> himself<00:05:06.160> so<00:05:07.160> really<00:05:07.550> what<00:05:08.000> God

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
called us to himself so really what God

called us to himself so really what God
has<00:05:08.660> given<00:05:08.900> to<00:05:09.020> us<00:05:09.140> through<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.500> shedding<00:05:09.710> of
