00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.460
 tell a young man a reason 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.280
 filter device is the most basic 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.940
 the elements are two of these from the reactor 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.600
 which is just happening 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:20.820
 redox processes 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.820
 then voltage plus minus is applied 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.910
 this is seen happening chemical 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.340
 electrolysis of water ie separation here 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.980
 of these heavy metal nitrates there and all 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.870
 the rest, that is, the water as it separates 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.020
 and this part 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.750
 and modifications of emerald years diamond itself something 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.390
 you yourself are the most expensive car here 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.460
 the swirl chamber here is selected semi 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.680
 also what nitrates are cleaning that is 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.930
 also such a tricky system 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.530
 it is not clear what has done a or saturation 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.440
 oxygenated water occurs under and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.050
 the end already comes three passive filters 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.030
 so-called carbon filter and 2 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.829
 apartment 1 ruble changes how many times 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.979
 coal doesn't change at all and yes 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:11.170
 this filter completely regenerates 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.789
 there are devices there are 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.350
 the device I'll show those through the pump 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:21.130
 participant nothing can flow there 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.020
 distiller per million liters up here 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.369
 draws change everything is regenerated once 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.139
 the form but these mean closing it 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.840
 now we are with wires from a little bit here 

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:37.749
 these here look like this here 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.779
 wires means here it turns on 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:44.529
 on the sink we wind the crane and but it 

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:47.799
 input water inlet grabs you leave already 

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:50.009
 2 well and where to pour hutuda up here 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.950
 come and where 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.919
 Here now here is this clean water left 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.800
 there a few baklazhka how much something 

00:01:56.919 --> 00:02:04.000
 spinning at the same drinking water prism 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:08.170
 I do there chyo a flask 35 are at the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.520
 I'm worth not enough electricity 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.520
 tyrosine to 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.050
 here under the mind from just like a spring 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.030
 go get water get 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:27.420
 proposed blood plasma and understand 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:30.220
 where goes with a negative goal paper. 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.560
 Now let's try and more on them 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.390
 but she knows what kind of water it is 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:41.230
 have to stand up 2 yes it's just she 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.560
 not all have been saturated with oxygen if your 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.780
 bank bubbles and even these are obtained 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.660
 oxygen, that is, such porridges 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.070
 tea is transparent there becomes he sat a 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.020
 You did not try to freeze the camera 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.880
 freezer also tried like crystal 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.520
 tried how to get fine 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:04.750
 it turns out sent not what is there and 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:08.200
 such here I saw on the Internet such 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:13.980
 installation can not show here 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.980
 Look here is Alena from this water 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:28.470
 I just had it now just not 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:33.970
 become more well done or do you have 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:36.520
 Look at the light right on the battles 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.670
 here mori looks awesome 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.570
 here it is installation yes indeed 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.240
 such here from such as salute to such pair 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.270
 to pack 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.040
 freeze show online so yes and 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.930
 here is from simple here is cartridge such 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.420
 without getting tried simple 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.960
 the creature tried with him yes he did not 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.410
 It turns out this installation 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.500
 spring boma all good luck buy not 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.500
 will regret
