 also last year that was the final battle and then it was the young klose a bon can 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.390
 put only two goals difference with 18 16 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390
 why evening went the offices of ayolt monk farmer 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.220
 favorite until the last place sold out 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.640
 ten thousand men, I dare to know korfball temple the French Sunday for that one 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.630
 day 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.559
 so zaandijk the team in the cloud kicked last year's champion in one 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.970
 repeat against 46 both teams have in the first half 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.220
 both two points for existence are both made up again and this is pure 12 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.860
 12 from pedrosa marie rozebeke 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.360
 the men bit snowy in the initial stages they had location 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.370
 14 12 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.780
 put the card 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.050
 the women in a leading role 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.370
 half without goals coming from it happened hands where it normally one 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.370
 out of three 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.430
 dos 46 will be slightly closer to the goal for the fifth consecutive 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.800
 to win in the final before and that is a record 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.320
 third 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.110
 the second half 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.360
 dos existed before half time with two goals for az that is still there now 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.590
 one 18 and 17 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.740
 casper tree 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.890
 the man of the long shots 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.240
 and there is 9 10 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.240
 it just goes back and forth in the finals 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440
 chris hijacker 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.440
 his movements 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.860
 do not just lay 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.370
 can come in handy 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.910
 a very important one 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.970
 the rebound 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.320
 the strong weapon normally used by the team from the zaan region went up zaandijk 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.780
 let it fail 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.610
 dos 46 then 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.610
 with more jan de kleijn 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.349
 and then there is only about five minutes left 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.349
 but kz still gives gas in the final phase 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.019
 with tim bakker 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.019
 is one point behind 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.069
 22 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.589
 make the decision 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.829
 the most exciting final 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.179
 the korfball league has been running for years 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.869
 start of that extension 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:38.379
 Kuipers offers himself, but whoever Jan de Kleijn gets the ball and scores 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:42.899
 dos 46 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:46.299
 party bursts substitute on the side of kz 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.299
 gets a lot of opportunities 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.999
 a man who was able to make so few minutes in the korfball league 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.519
 understandable though, because he is small and therefore less of this is in this 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.299
 country 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.949
 but you have to score as well 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.949
 and so does Kasparov 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.219
 forest 6 6 4 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.219
 he risks four to five years 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.889
 the most exciting china 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.129
 year just like victor dos 46 runs the start to get the cup dethroned 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.729
 again to wrist prints 46 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:25.199
 national champion
