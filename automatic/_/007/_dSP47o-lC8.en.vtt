around<00:01:36.149> in<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.570> area<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.679> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:38.460> expect

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
around in this area so you can expect

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.039 
around in this area so you can expect
people<00:01:39.450> actually<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.530> about<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.670 
people actually do know about this one a
bit<00:01:43.100> so

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
bit so

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.340 
bit so
that's<00:01:46.280> pretty<00:01:46.430> much<00:01:46.550> it<00:01:47.050> warriors<00:01:48.050> would<00:01:48.230> be

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
that's pretty much it warriors would be

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.540 
that's pretty much it warriors would be
very<00:01:48.530> good<00:01:48.800> ayo<00:01:49.250> ease<00:01:49.640> would<00:01:49.970> be<00:01:50.600> decent

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
very good ayo ease would be decent

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.460 
very good ayo ease would be decent
you're<00:01:52.550> not<00:01:52.670> really<00:01:52.850> assuring<00:01:53.660> a<00:01:53.870> cluster<00:01:54.260> so

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
you're not really assuring a cluster so

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.640
