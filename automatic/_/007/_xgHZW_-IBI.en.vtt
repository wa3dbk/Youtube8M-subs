00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.220
 yes I think it was very tactical 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.650
 embossed game both teams well 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.779
 At first, standing well is not going to leave much 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.250
 pato had shot more successfully 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.929
 First one counts when I'm on 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.070
 Burmeister thinks of the two big thing 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.810
 especially if you go there then lead 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.119
 the game can perhaps far 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.499
 different design so it is up to the 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.429
 We are pretty tight then we go 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.460
 still in the lead 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.570
 He had very few chances to score the mat 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.730
 have a good use 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.800
 unfortunately, another from opponents 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.420
 enough to make the compensation and 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.039
 Ultimately I could grow once 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.680
 in the end one has seen that it 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.600
 today top players both teams 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.309
 But they did not want the victory 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.199
 risk too much so both at first 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.039
 confessed and sampled 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.840
 what was going on ahead 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.730
 we had the first thought 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.870
 Overall, we have more opportunities 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.550
 may have worked out my 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.500
 Last pass is the better conclusion 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.750
 was missing after the half came 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.670
 s way then much better forward 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.620
 has played more forward and had 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.440
 a small urge phase into the urge phase 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.880
 into it we then do the 1 0 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.350
 and yes, maybe we wanted to 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.570
 wanted to run the 2 0 refill immediately 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.100
 and could instead perhaps only 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.140
 At times, behind a backlash 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.939
 try to put pin pricks and stuff like that 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.290
 if we stop maybe a bit 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.670
 singled out in your own stadium 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.320
 introduce and then stop but 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.000
 really not the point itself 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.220
 do not classify properly 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.140
 I think about 90 minutes a very 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.500
 Fast-paced a good football game 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.350
 seen 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.700
 we're kidnapping and there 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.850
 you just have to be so clever and 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.380
 also ripped off times a dirty 1 0 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.149
 especially at home with our fans in the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.310
 to bring back the stage 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.409
 Unfortunately, that was not successful, yes then 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.460
 the red card was still hoping that then 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.899
 maybe a little bit too 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.719
 but already he has got the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.030
 Wiesbadener were very good defensively 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.350
 have compact through their fast 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.149
 extras I think one or two 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.530
 I had other good odds 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.180
 but still tried everything 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.399
 but he today it is not like that 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.799
 succeeded the game over the outside 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.630
 raise or immediately gate to come around 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.289
 dangerous situations up 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.520
 implore 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.450
 we have to do better because 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.920
 maybe a little quieter 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.130
 player bit more purposeful and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.020
 just the last pass to play more accurately 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.140
 yes, I think everyone knows that's not 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.050
 self-runner is 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.860
 the players start at zero and that 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.770
 was the case today 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.160
 wiesbaden succeeded as a double top 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.550
 Bielefeld and finally had to 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.900
 be happy yes so it went in the 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.870
 situation not otherwise so by that 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.180
 the gentleman who still runs the ball 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.010
 crossed in the penalty area and him the bavaria 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.959
 but no idea how through his legs 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.310
 I'm already at the grazing 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.930
 Stepped too far forward and then had to 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.610
 delay stand on the right leg and then 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.440
 I could only leave the left behind 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.520
 push leg and then do that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.570
 that the gates of course bad 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.160
 it was maybe there 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.690
 thought I bring him right 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.260
 maybe in the short corner and so it works 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.330
 long corner but yes it is a nice goal 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.920
 but by the compensation 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.010
 You can not be so happy today 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.930
 about it super troupe the city is great 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.660
 i feel comfortable here my family 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.410
 Feels comfortable here and fun here 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.060
 to play football 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.220
 I think you saw at the beginning that 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.530
 we re-diced team 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.250
 were and he needs us all for a long time 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.810
 have found 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.150
 yes I think there was sometime 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.070
 crack was then noticed okay 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.019
 it can just go have their home 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.570
 we have not lost for a long time 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.650
 So I see it positively and I think 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.570
 until winter is still a month 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.950
 time was still as many points as 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.280
 possible in a chance was over 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.280
 winter
