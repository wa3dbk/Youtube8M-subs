awesome-looking carb and when it comes

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.120 
awesome-looking carb and when it comes
to<00:00:33.510> carburetors<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.350> very<00:00:34.620> important<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
to carburetors it's very important to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.920 
to carburetors it's very important to
make<00:00:35.370> sure<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.120> size<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.600> correctly

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
make sure that you size it correctly

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.959 
make sure that you size it correctly
we'll<00:00:37.290> talk<00:00:37.440> about<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.860> average<00:00:38.219> say<00:00:38.460> four

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
we'll talk about your average say four

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.310 
we'll talk about your average say four

v8<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.940> most<00:00:42.180> cases<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.809> run<00:00:43.020> between<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
v8 now in most cases you run between a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.130 
v8 now in most cases you run between a
750<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.190> 850<00:00:44.520> CFM<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.809> type<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
750 and 850 CFM on that type of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.560 
750 and 850 CFM on that type of
configuration<00:00:46.610> but<00:00:47.610> different<00:00:48.000> engines<00:00:48.329> come

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
configuration but different engines come

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
configuration but different engines come
in<00:00:48.750> different<00:00:48.960> sizes<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.070> very

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
in different sizes so it's very

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.950 
in different sizes so it's very
important<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> make<00:00:50.940> sure<00:00:50.969> they<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:51.449> sized

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
important to make sure they are sized

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660 
important to make sure they are sized
correctly<00:00:52.260> now<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.340> lots<00:00:53.610> of

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
correctly now there are lots of

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.160 
correctly now there are lots of
calculations<00:00:54.360> about<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.110> on

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
calculations about if you have a look on

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.389 
calculations about if you have a look on
the<00:00:55.289> net<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.620> search<00:00:55.829> around<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.219> sure

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the net and search around I'm sure

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.099 
the net and search around I'm sure
you'll<00:00:56.579> find<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.629> punch<00:00:57.930> in

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you'll find them that you can punch in

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.630 
you'll find them that you can punch in
the<00:00:58.170> specifications<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.949> your<00:00:59.010> engine<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the specifications of your engine the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.670 
the specifications of your engine the
given<00:00:59.879> size<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.449> also<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> RPM<00:01:01.260> range<00:01:01.440> that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
given size and also the RPM range that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.869 
given size and also the RPM range that
you're<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.070> use<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.520> you'll<00:01:02.789> get

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
you're going to use and you'll get

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.549 
you're going to use and you'll get
something<00:01:03.239> that's<00:01:03.510> pretty<00:01:03.750> close<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> is

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
something that's pretty close but it is

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.469 
something that's pretty close but it is
very<00:01:04.619> important<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.489> oversize<00:01:06.210> your

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
very important not to oversize your

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.330 
very important not to oversize your
carburetor<00:01:06.960> many<00:01:07.439> people<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.130> think

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
carburetor many people out there think

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.730 
carburetor many people out there think
that<00:01:08.520> bigger<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.090> better<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.200> all<00:01:10.409> about

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that bigger is better but it's all about

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
that bigger is better but it's all about
air<00:01:11.040> speed<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.850> given<00:01:12.210> engine<00:01:12.689> speed<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.439> if

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
air speed at a given engine speed so if

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.260 
air speed at a given engine speed so if
you<00:01:13.590> go<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> joint<00:01:14.310> carburetter<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.119> this

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you go for a joint carburetter like this

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.899 
you go for a joint carburetter like this

the low to mid range you might only make

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.230 
the low to mid range you might only make
a<00:01:25.799> little<00:01:26.189> bit<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.460> power<00:01:26.700> upstairs

a little bit more power upstairs
compared<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> say<00:01:27.869> 750<00:01:28.500> or<00:01:28.619> something<00:01:28.890> like

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
compared to say 750 or something like

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.789 
compared to say 750 or something like
that<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.430> overall<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.060> 750<00:01:31.020> would<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> far

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that but overall a 750 would be a far

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
better choice for that sort of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.719 
better choice for that sort of
application<00:01:33.390> maybe<00:01:34.290> even<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.680> 650<00:01:35.310> so

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
application maybe even a 650 so

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.789 
application maybe even a 650 so
sometimes<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.020> smaller<00:01:37.320> side<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
sometimes think on the smaller side to

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.140 
sometimes think on the smaller side to
get<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> throttle<00:01:38.340> response<00:01:38.460> you're<00:01:38.880> looking

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
get the throttle response you're looking

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.870 
get the throttle response you're looking

trumpet Sam is formula ones they do the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
same thing now the reason they do that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.990 
same thing now the reason they do that
is<00:02:40.290> because<00:02:40.590> by<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.860> time<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.310> fuel<00:02:41.550> does<00:02:41.790> get

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
is because by the time the fuel does get

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.910 
is because by the time the fuel does get
down<00:02:42.210> through<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.690> intake<00:02:43.080> runner<00:02:43.320> down

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
down through that intake runner down

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.710 
down through that intake runner down
into<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.310> intake<00:02:44.580> port<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.270> fuel<00:02:45.570> has

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
into the intake port the fuel has

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.940 
into the intake port the fuel has
atomized<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.440> absolute<00:02:46.920> perfection

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
atomized to absolute perfection

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.460 
atomized to absolute perfection
therefore<00:02:47.850> providing<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.660> better<00:02:48.900> burn<00:02:49.170> and

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
therefore providing a better burn and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.800 
therefore providing a better burn and
more<00:02:49.980> horsepower<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:51.000> only<00:02:51.150> downside<00:02:51.390> is

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
more horsepower the only downside is

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.120 
more horsepower the only downside is
with<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.050> injector<00:02:52.440> sitting<00:02:52.710> right<00:02:52.890> up<00:02:53.070> there

that there is a danger of fire and
