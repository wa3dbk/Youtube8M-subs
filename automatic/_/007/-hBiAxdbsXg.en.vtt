00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.279
 I would say that the area 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.739
 pedro vieira de almeida 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.089
 if he was drunk report 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.089
 He should get here the delegate. 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.959
 only when the worker is given the start 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.259
 lost mandate 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.150
 This time he leaves the country. 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
 It's the guy who has to have this decision was made 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.829
 in the two days of debates and misery 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.560
 I hope this flag of white and black work 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.130
 xi she does not let her breath out 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.510
 after five months of research 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.030
 currently the primary 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.469
 the following year adriano 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.540
 for us 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.920
 then Basque 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.040
 we want this 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.060
 to 27 the value now how is it there 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.690
 already in the early hours of Saturday 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.519
 the waterfront 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.460
 the so-called south 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.630
 the good 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.950
 abel leomir 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.950
 this approach with historical value for the period 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.190
 in front of almost 90 returned 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.190
 the four people 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 the country has experienced moments of tension 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 I'm sure it will check if the text 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.410
 then looking at a prism can not know whether to crash in course 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.600
 Goalkeeper Eduard 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.640
 It can rain 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 and not now 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 this historic agreement 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.020
 talk about long-term policy due to injuries 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.369
 so when you miss the pass 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.480
 lasted you're not even about to go off on a tangent 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.480
 at least until now 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.670
 voting is required 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.549
 now 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.549
 in May now with the show that alagoas 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.210
 and when it loses 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.030
 Of Quality 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.200
 bending oblin 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.149
 now botafogo 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.599
 the difference 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.559
 I know that you
