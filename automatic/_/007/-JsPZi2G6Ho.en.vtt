00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
just touch it up a little bit I use a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.490 
just touch it up a little bit I use a
smaller<00:01:47.399> tool<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.930> mean<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
smaller tool for this because I mean the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.499 
smaller tool for this because I mean the
pen<00:01:49.680> tip<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.979> too<00:01:50.250> big<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.450> is

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
pen tip is too big for this so this is

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.359 
pen tip is too big for this so this is
the<00:01:51.689> harder<00:01:52.049> part<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.100> don't<00:01:53.280> get

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the harder part because you don't get

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.770 
the harder part because you don't get
the<00:01:53.490> exact<00:01:53.790> shape<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.180> want<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.600> fine

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.999 
the exact shape you want just fine
pressing<00:01:55.290> down<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> now<00:01:57.170> wipe<00:01:58.170> off<00:01:58.380> your<00:01:58.409> end

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
