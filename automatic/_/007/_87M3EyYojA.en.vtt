decision<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.860> adding<00:01:50.280> types<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:51.180> Ultimate

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
decision of adding types like Ultimate

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.109 
decision of adding types like Ultimate
Jutsu<00:01:51.780> type<00:01:52.079> Drive<00:01:52.439> type<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.670> better<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
Jutsu type Drive type it was better the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.580 
Jutsu type Drive type it was better the
way<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.270> was<00:01:54.479> before<00:01:54.659> when<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.229> could<00:01:55.560> have

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
way it was before when you could have

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.010 
way it was before when you could have
all<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.159> them<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> same<00:01:56.610> time<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.360> believe

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
all of them at the same time I believe

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.590 
all of them at the same time I believe
limiting<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.890> character<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.880> only<00:02:00.210> being<00:02:00.450> able

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
limiting a character to only being able

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.230 
limiting a character to only being able
to<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.170> thing<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> huge<00:02:02.070> setback<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to do one thing is a huge setback and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.060 
to do one thing is a huge setback and
they<00:02:03.450> should<00:02:03.630> remove<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.200> feature

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
they should remove this feature

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.890 
they should remove this feature
and<00:02:05.159> they<00:02:05.730> even<00:02:05.880> stay<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.240> themselves<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
and they even stay to themselves that

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.109 
and they even stay to themselves that
people<00:02:07.260> do<00:02:07.560> not<00:02:07.650> like<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:08.070> and<00:02:08.310> they<00:02:08.850> will

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
people do not like this and they will

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.620 
people do not like this and they will
consider<00:02:09.360> removing<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.320> one<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.649> those<00:02:11.630> as

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
consider removing it and one of those as

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.330 
consider removing it and one of those as
well<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:12.990> new<00:02:13.140> things<00:02:13.380> being<00:02:13.650> added<00:02:14.040> game

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
well as new things being added game

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.310 
well as new things being added game
there<00:02:14.670> will<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.360> lot<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.780> things<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.110> will

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
there will be a lot of things that will

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.590 
there will be a lot of things that will
stay<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.680> same<00:02:16.740> for<00:02:17.430> example<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.209> fighting

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
stay the same for example the fighting

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.190 
stay the same for example the fighting
system<00:02:18.810> will<00:02:19.470> be<00:02:19.650> sort<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.640> similar<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.840> not

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
system will be sort of similar the not

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.080 
system will be sort of similar the not
focusing<00:02:22.560> too<00:02:22.770> much<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:23.160> combos<00:02:23.640> by<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.850> looks

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
focusing too much on combos by the looks

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.880 
focusing too much on combos by the looks
of<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.300> for<00:02:24.600> storm<00:02:24.840> revolution<00:02:24.990> was<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> huge

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
of it for storm revolution was a huge

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.330 
of it for storm revolution was a huge
update<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.640> everyone's<00:02:27.150> movesets<00:02:27.750> combos<00:02:28.500> so

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
update to everyone's movesets combos so

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.460 
update to everyone's movesets combos so
the<00:02:29.760> new<00:02:29.850> characters<00:02:30.270> will<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.690> unique<00:02:31.200> move

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
the new characters will have unique move

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.370 
the new characters will have unique move
sets<00:02:31.770> however<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.520> believe<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.480> most<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.290> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
sets however I believe that most of the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.170 
sets however I believe that most of the
characters<00:02:34.620> will<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.459> their<00:02:35.730> move<00:02:35.910> sets

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
characters will have their move sets

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.220 
characters will have their move sets
transferred<00:02:36.959> from<00:02:37.770> now<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.160> storm<00:02:38.580> revolution

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
transferred from now to storm revolution

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.420 
transferred from now to storm revolution
we<00:02:40.230> don't<00:02:40.440> know<00:02:40.590> though<00:02:40.800> they<00:02:41.040> might<00:02:41.190> change

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
we don't know though they might change

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.120 
we don't know though they might change
things<00:02:41.580> up<00:02:41.970> but<00:02:42.480> we<00:02:42.630> know<00:02:42.750> how<00:02:42.870> these<00:02:43.680> two<00:02:43.920> are

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
things up but we know how these two are

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.710 
things up but we know how these two are
when<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.580> comes<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.850> stuff<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.450> for

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
when it comes to stuff like this for

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.990 
when it comes to stuff like this for
example<00:02:46.140> with<00:02:46.590> storm<00:02:46.950> generations<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.730> storm

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
example with storm generations and storm

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.140 
example with storm generations and storm
3<00:02:48.300> they<00:02:48.959> kept<00:02:49.320> some<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.459> move<00:02:50.610> sets<00:02:50.940> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
3 they kept some of the move sets the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.720 
3 they kept some of the move sets the
same<00:02:51.390> maybe<00:02:51.870> not<00:02:52.110> maybe<00:02:52.530> i'm<00:02:52.739> wrong<00:02:52.770> but<00:02:53.130> we'll

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
same maybe not maybe i'm wrong but we'll

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.660 
same maybe not maybe i'm wrong but we'll
see<00:02:54.170> then<00:02:55.170> another<00:02:55.410> interview<00:02:55.920> some<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
see then another interview some of the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.370 
see then another interview some of the
developers<00:02:57.150> mentioned<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.810> there's<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.170> low

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
developers mentioned that there's a low

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.770 
developers mentioned that there's a low
chance<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.920> jutsu<00:02:59.489> clashes<00:03:00.000> being<00:03:00.269> in<00:03:00.450> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
chance of jutsu clashes being in the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.050 
chance of jutsu clashes being in the
game<00:03:00.959> now<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.130> huge<00:03:02.340> disappointment<00:03:03.030> for

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
game now this is huge disappointment for

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.550 
game now this is huge disappointment for
me<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.600> really<00:03:03.870> enjoyed<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.380> two

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
me because I really enjoyed you two

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.130 
me because I really enjoyed you two
crashes<00:03:04.830> in<00:03:05.280> storm<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.690> what<00:03:06.989> we're

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
crashes in storm one but what we're

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.990 
crashes in storm one but what we're
gonna<00:03:07.230> do<00:03:07.410> have<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.860> move<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.400> advance<00:03:08.850> to

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
gonna do have to move on and advance to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.750 
gonna do have to move on and advance to
new<00:03:09.360> features<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.340> new<00:03:11.340> feature<00:03:11.549> that<00:03:11.640> they

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
new features a new feature that they

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.640 
new features a new feature that they
added<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:12.209> storm<00:03:12.480> revolution<00:03:12.600> was<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.230> counter

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
added a storm revolution was the counter

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.830 
added a storm revolution was the counter
system<00:03:14.070> now<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:14.760> looks<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.630> to

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
system now this looks like it's going to

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.199 
system now this looks like it's going to
come<00:03:16.080> back<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.650> stall<00:03:17.280> for<00:03:17.549> as<00:03:17.760> they<00:03:17.910> really

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
come back and stall for as they really

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.880 
come back and stall for as they really
enjoy<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.720> counter<00:03:19.019> system<00:03:19.380> because<00:03:19.709> they

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
enjoy the counter system because they

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.479 
enjoy the counter system because they
think<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.340> has<00:03:20.610> strategic<00:03:21.299> play<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> game

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
think it has strategic play to the game

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.920 
think it has strategic play to the game
of<00:03:23.489> course<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:24.000> game<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.420> going<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.720> try<00:03:24.900> to

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
of course this game is going to try to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.410 
of course this game is going to try to
make<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.380> evo<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.670> car<00:03:26.820> system<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.390> a

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
make it to evo so the car system is a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.229 
make it to evo so the car system is a
good<00:03:27.720> addition<00:03:28.019> for<00:03:28.579> strategic<00:03:29.579> players<00:03:29.850> but

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
good addition for strategic players but

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.420 
good addition for strategic players but
however<00:03:30.420> it's<00:03:30.810> got<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.110> lot<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.350> bad<00:03:32.010> and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
however it's got a lot of bad and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.039 
however it's got a lot of bad and
negative<00:03:32.760> feedback<00:03:33.269> because<00:03:33.630> not<00:03:33.870> many

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
negative feedback because not many
