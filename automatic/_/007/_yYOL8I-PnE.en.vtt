00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
use his bone mass for the power now
easily<00:01:11.340> neither<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.060> he<00:01:12.390> has

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
easily neither do that because he has

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.660 
easily neither do that because he has
the<00:01:12.869> Holly<00:01:13.140> chose<00:01:13.439> power<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.010> he<00:01:14.400> also<00:01:14.520> has

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the Holly chose power and he also has

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.840 
the Holly chose power and he also has
some<00:01:15.030> kids<00:01:15.180> powers<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:17.700> see

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
some kids powers on one so what we see

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.039 
some kids powers on one so what we see
now<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.330> kind<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> demonstrates<00:01:18.960> how

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
now and it's kind of demonstrates how

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.020 
now and it's kind of demonstrates how
powerful<00:01:19.590> he<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> latest<00:01:20.520> chapter<00:01:20.820> I

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the bottom with you know his hollow

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.510 
the bottom with you know his hollow

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that's all fuse together and so

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.020 
that's all fuse together and so
basically<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.310> reason<00:01:56.460> why<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.729> doesn't<00:01:56.939> have

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
basically the reason why it doesn't have

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.179 
basically the reason why it doesn't have
his<00:01:57.119> hollow<00:01:57.299> mask<00:01:57.509> why<00:01:57.810> cant<00:01:58.110> disculpa<00:01:59.040> cause

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
his hollow mask why cant disculpa cause

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.770 
his hollow mask why cant disculpa cause
hollow<00:01:59.430> mask<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> remember<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.360> hollow<00:02:00.540> mask

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
hollow mask to remember the hollow mask

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.569 
hollow mask to remember the hollow mask
did<00:02:01.049> some<00:02:01.259> power<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.040> he<00:02:02.130> only<00:02:02.189> got<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.399> power

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
did some power but he only got the power

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.730 
did some power but he only got the power
from<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.880> one<00:02:03.180> source<00:02:03.630> basically<00:02:04.560> yeah

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
from that one source basically yeah

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.380 
from that one source basically yeah
power<00:02:04.979> from<00:02:05.189> zangetsu<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:05.850> confuse<00:02:06.240> that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
power from zangetsu then confuse that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.630 
power from zangetsu then confuse that
power<00:02:06.780> with<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.560> hollow<00:02:07.770> master<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:08.459> boom

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
power with the hollow master then boom

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.760 
power with the hollow master then boom
to<00:02:08.910> put<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.929> since<00:02:10.170> they're<00:02:10.319> both<00:02:10.349> one

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
to put it on but since they're both one

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.290 
to put it on but since they're both one
being

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
being

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.270 
being
there<00:02:11.570> was<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.720> home<00:02:11.900> at<00:02:12.110> home<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.710> know<00:02:12.830> son

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
there was a home at home you know son

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.420 
there was a home at home you know son
get<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:14.930> version<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.800> know<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.220> say

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
get to have a version you know so I say

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.910 
get to have a version you know so I say
um<00:02:17.210> basically<00:02:17.810> that's<00:02:18.260> why<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.440> have<00:02:18.890> a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
um basically that's why you have a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.380 
um basically that's why you have a
hollow<00:02:19.100> mask<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.640> mean<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.090> just<00:02:20.120> my

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
hollow mask so that mean this is just my

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.390 
hollow mask so that mean this is just my
opinion<00:02:20.420> i'm<00:02:21.050> not<00:02:21.170> exactly<00:02:21.350> sure<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.340> is

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
opinion i'm not exactly sure if this is

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.780 
opinion i'm not exactly sure if this is
the<00:02:22.520> lowdown<00:02:23.270> why<00:02:24.070> he<00:02:25.070> doesn't<00:02:25.340> have<00:02:25.460> a<00:02:25.490> hollow

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
the lowdown why he doesn't have a hollow

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.240 
the lowdown why he doesn't have a hollow
mask<00:02:26.030> but<00:02:26.330> i'm<00:02:26.660> pretty<00:02:26.960> sure<00:02:27.190> that's<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
mask but i'm pretty sure that's the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.850 
mask but i'm pretty sure that's the
reason<00:02:28.490> why<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.570> long<00:02:29.750> as<00:02:29.930> he's<00:02:30.080> one<00:02:30.290> being<00:02:30.590> and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
reason why so long as he's one being and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.170 
reason why so long as he's one being and
but<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.040> also<00:02:31.160> shows<00:02:31.430> how<00:02:31.580> strong<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.970> girl

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
but it also shows how strong this girl

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.510 
but it also shows how strong this girl
really<00:02:32.240> is<00:02:32.360> then<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:33.440> might<00:02:33.650> be<00:02:33.710> he<00:02:34.370> might

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
really is then so you might be he might

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.070 
really is then so you might be he might
be<00:02:34.670> fighting<00:02:34.970> at<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.090> level<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.510> when<00:02:35.840> he<00:02:36.050> was

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.590 
be fighting at the level of when he was
up<00:02:36.470> when<00:02:37.160> he<00:02:37.250> first<00:02:37.490> saw<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.000> fought<00:02:38.180> Aizen

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
up when he first saw and fought Aizen

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.540 
up when he first saw and fought Aizen

may<00:02:59.330> not<00:03:00.020> have<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.260> hollow<00:03:00.500> mask<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:01.130> know<00:03:01.250> what

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
may not have a hollow mask you know what

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.730 
may not have a hollow mask you know what
are<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:01.610> guys<00:03:01.670> stops<00:03:02.030> on<00:03:02.270> this<00:03:02.690> if<00:03:02.960> you<00:03:03.440> think

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
are you guys stops on this if you think

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.650 
are you guys stops on this if you think
if<00:03:04.310> there's<00:03:04.520> any<00:03:04.700> other<00:03:04.730> way<00:03:05.030> they<00:03:05.360> doesn't

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
if there's any other way they doesn't

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.790 
if there's any other way they doesn't
have<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.870> all<00:03:05.990> I'm<00:03:06.110> ask<00:03:06.260> us<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.470> mean<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.710> know

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
have it all I'm ask us I mean you know

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.980 
have it all I'm ask us I mean you know
use<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.190> yet<00:03:07.340> but<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.240> think<00:03:08.330> that's<00:03:08.660> part<00:03:08.930> of

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
use it yet but I think that's part of

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.900 
use it yet but I think that's part of
the<00:03:09.650> part<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:09.890> reason<00:03:09.980> why<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.220> can't<00:03:10.250> use<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.790> is

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
the part of reason why I can't use it is

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.390 
the part of reason why I can't use it is
because<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:11.870> both<00:03:12.110> doesn't<00:03:12.560> get<00:03:12.710> to<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.190> hollow

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
because it both doesn't get to in hollow

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.460 
because it both doesn't get to in hollow
ichigo<00:03:13.760> are<00:03:13.940> fused<00:03:14.300> they're<00:03:14.540> not<00:03:14.690> one<00:03:15.260> cannot

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
ichigo are fused they're not one cannot

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.930 
ichigo are fused they're not one cannot
separate<00:03:15.890> entities<00:03:16.280> but<00:03:16.459> then<00:03:16.610> hit<00:03:16.760> within

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
separate entities but then hit within

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.060 
separate entities but then hit within
him<00:03:17.270> he's<00:03:17.690> just<00:03:17.720> is<00:03:18.020> just<00:03:18.050> one<00:03:18.410> being<00:03:18.650> with<00:03:18.800> one

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
him he's just is just one being with one

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.130 
him he's just is just one being with one
mask<00:03:19.370> power<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:19.910> he<00:03:20.030> gets<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.330> eaves<00:03:20.540> free

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
mask power that he gets the eaves free

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.160 
mask power that he gets the eaves free
so<00:03:21.860> yeah<00:03:22.820> let's<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.209> put<00:03:23.450> my<00:03:23.600> thoughts<00:03:23.840> on

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
so yeah let's just put my thoughts on

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.420 
so yeah let's just put my thoughts on
the<00:03:24.260> whole<00:03:24.440> thing<00:03:24.680> that's<00:03:24.860> wanted<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.130> address

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
the whole thing that's wanted to address

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.070 
the whole thing that's wanted to address
this<00:03:25.760> only<00:03:26.000> because<00:03:26.300> so<00:03:26.750> many<00:03:26.810> people<00:03:27.020> were

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
this only because so many people were

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.590 
this only because so many people were
asking<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:28.160> why<00:03:28.340> isn't<00:03:28.880> he<00:03:28.940> using<00:03:29.390> his

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
asking that why isn't he using his

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.030 
asking that why isn't he using his
hollow<00:03:29.780> man<00:03:30.050> why<00:03:30.290> doesn't<00:03:30.560> go<00:03:30.650> hollow<00:03:30.830> mask

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040
