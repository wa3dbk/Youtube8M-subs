00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello guys with you dzhey review on 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.000
 possesses this game about vampires on 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.680
 the next few minutes I will 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.389
 explain why you should not 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 acquire this game even if you 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.650
 so ardent fan of vampires that suck 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.420
 any liquid from another person 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.699
 it seems to you quite natural occupation 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.740
 Perhaps I'll start with what I like when 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.140
 games have linear development 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.850
 events but know that i don't like i don't 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.920
 love when a developer tries me 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.840
 frankly fuck giving a choice in 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.029
 dialogues that do not affect at all 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.800
 what they say yes you have a choice 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.630
 we really have you there 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.610
 choose we believe in fate and therefore 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.440
 option outcome will be one just like 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.540
 past presidential elections russia 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.309
 one of the main features of this game 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.110
 is that the main character in any 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.850
 moment may involve penis 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.020
 turning his vagina to grow two 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.910
 hefty boobs 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.160
 yes of course the plot is generally two 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.710
 different characters men crusaders luminaries 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.329
 whom feast who are connected by a curse 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.140
 why do you need this nasty sound 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.140
 penis when turning 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.260
 sounds awful 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.059
 in theory, all these transformations are made for 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.189
 order to introduce diversity into 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.780
 gameplay as a man crusader 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.470
 can only chop all with sabers in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.210
 melee 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.950
 finish vampire tune everyone 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.380
 from a distance of two crossbows with speed 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.460
 Do voices but here developers 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.470
 Nakosyachili because all you need 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.670
 do while you play as a vampire so 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.830
 it hold down the left mouse button 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.170
 aiming at enemies to slowly move away 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.939
 back with everything in the direction of your 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.950
 sight will be successfully leveled 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.170
 while you will be completely safe 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.000
 however, when playing for a crusader such 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.710
 The topic does not go away as he peels all 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.720
 melee because of this regularly 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.030
 get without a baton from one then 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.280
 another bloodsucker and all this because 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.200
 that the game has no rolls or blocks 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.270
 nothing inherent audible 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.750
 although the game is half heard half 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.970
 lpg 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.979
 the plot we have to protect it 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.990
 the priest while he charges solar 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.750
 light these diamond pistachios for 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.450
 so as not to 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.580
 even all the vampire tombs however the game 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.620
 makes a very unpleasant surprise 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.650
 annoying but I can not characters 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.770
 after all this bull with two huge 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.930
 comrades 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.720
 this man will you here something every 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.119
 five seconds starting from those bastards again 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.690
 or die a bloodsucker or see one 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.120
 less or not getting up and stay there 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.190
 god what the hell man you kind of like 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.230
 soldier on an important mission to save the world 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.790
 why do you act like a schoolboy 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.160
 who wants to assert itself in 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.500
 any game and beard all print 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.120
 although judging by the size of the axes of this 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.040
 man i could guess about 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.140
 complexes present at it 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.120
 we protect the plot from vampires not anyone 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.070
 excite things like a priest says 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.290
 thanks to this crystal now no 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:45.390
 from vampire solo seal from the tomb not 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:48.340
 Komi vampire escapes escaped solo stamp 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.989
 although of course something happened during these 15 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.970
 minutes for example the main character weighed 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.430
 black girl queen vampire 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.850
 who once spat blood at him 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.549
 turned it bumper yes that way all 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.769
 and there were generally problems with logic here 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.440
 just everywhere plots start where 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.330
 first it is claimed that vampires are not 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.940
 can escape from the tomb and then not 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.060
 avoid continuing the dialogues in which 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.410
 the protagonist for example asks to shut up 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.750
 a new girlfriend vampire and then 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.760
 immediately ask her name and ending 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.900
 further game situations which 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.910
 you are standing on the plot 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.160
 for example, a crowd of your former colleagues 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.430
 who will try you for fucking mind 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.049
 the fact that you are now vampires in general fagot 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.900
 after that, it turns out that 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.850
 they wanted you to help them and 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.400
 their problems with witches or else 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.410
 some kind of lift on that i'm kindly 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.329
 agreed oh well guys not easy 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.990
 I really wanted to kill this occasion 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.780
 in order not to help your neighbor 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.550
 somehow not Christian and letting them 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.290
 retreat solve all problems for them 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.030
 one of them was so glad that 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.700
 rushed into the fire caught fire in my honor 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.410
 nice nothing to say to the developers 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.460
 very strange look at what 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.070
 there must be vampires 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.890
 for example, local vampires are afraid of water 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.690
 because she kills them and not pretty 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.230
 I wonder how they don't drink the blood that 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.480
 90 percent consists of water well or even 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.880
 if so why soldiers all these heavy 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.980
 spears and shields and other ammunition 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.200
 below can just dial rubber 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.060
 water balls and lynn water basins 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.190
 killing vampires in batches just 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.690
 splashing them with water from the basins why 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.520
 they would not think of it 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.900
 much easier and more fun for no one would 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.000
 refreshed while the rest of the soldiers 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.190
 Generally as you progress through the game 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.200
 it becomes a little more interesting due to 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.110
 standard lured from the rpg genre 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.090
 for example enemies get stronger together 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.430
 with you it becomes more but the hero 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.130
 keeps up and pumped increases 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.350
 the power of their attacks combo and others 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.930
 rocket type new skills and the 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.750
 but the game gets better 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.490
 I would compare a little from dog shit 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.220
 which was built just and 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.500
 which has lain for about two months only 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.260
 that you country has a bright not pleasant 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.080
 brown color and stinks at full power 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.480
 and the next couple of months already turned white and 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.250
 and in general it practically does not float if 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.980
 find it dense but it's still 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.530
 dog dogs in general prodigal quote step 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.020
 low intermediate level as far as i know in 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.450
 the game has a cooperative though the very bottom 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.850
 let not soulless cooperative 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.010
 via the Internet and the most real soul 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.320
 RAM Yes two friends are sitting 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.960
 joysticks in front of a company monitor 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.509
 telly and and maybe 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.280
 I really appreciate such topics but even this one 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.380
 fact don't make this game good 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.660

 description of this video but to be honest 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.330
 the only thing I will do there 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.770
