00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:05.370
 all ie so talked about this I say blog I did a test with galaxy one 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.209
 gps galaxy s2 using the application both home tracks 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.559
 this application reads the tv of the brought from the GPS a real latitude 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.519
 longitude a slap on the map in my case decided to take it feedburner 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.749
 feed us or see the accuracy of the phone 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.659
 this train traveled by a city route that dust to the ring road of 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.380
 naples as you can see there is no problem whatsoever of gps signal 

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:30.880
 that's a search for 2 takes with me 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.880
 personally graziano gps and integrated agps 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.880
 and I wanted to focus on this part because 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.280
 i am a series of open celtic galleries 20 meters around shoes 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.260
 the opening of the art gallery in gps I had no problem maintaining 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.120
 the signal 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.960
 but some problems but it is clear that it is so in the galleries of course the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.910
 shooting signal I immediately forgot immediately after a few meters after being 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.360
 the gallery came out 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.490
 and as you can see teaching this awesome thing also passes by 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.440
 lane ie I remember precisely when I used to spend mornings 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.840
 I find precisely in the description made on purpose rex 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.040
 in the city it seems that paciotti ghirigori but it is a normal thing because here it was 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.490
 of traffic hours this application reads the data 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.270
 hope the gps if there is any we say some 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.159
 unevenness some difference some - trace a yes 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.330
 he is as if there were not some 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.500
 some problems. of the approach I will know instead the return of last night 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.900
 is 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.860
 this path is much more precise than the other especially in the field 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.620
 citizen precisely because to see that after this he tries to think of Naples 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.460
 just because 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.930
 but there was no traffic to be a fairy tale via mombarone deposition of 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.090
 I write v2 3bmeteo maps 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.910
 was I am absolute the price fly gps galaxy s the two and you can stay 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.100
 quiet duty modern or want to buy at what age you already have that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950
 they were still found 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.850
 the navigation because 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.490
 it's not just like the galaxy s1 and it doesn't lose the hendel tiziano signal 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.130
 very bellucci times and it is also quite accurate I would say graphic wow 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.359
 at most 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:15.249
 The long-lasting conditions of which I have made these tests I raise slightly 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.680
 from the top of the can of departure and above all the latter 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.639
 stretch of I'm showing now 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.979
 it had rained down from the commons on how it works that wants sweets 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.729
 of leaving to the completion of the beautiful normal trace 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:33.169
 cook aid today is almost over in her city journey 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:34.799
 . to my 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.749
 thanks in the following if you have other doubts
