00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.440 

the<00:00:05.830> first<00:00:06.130> thing<00:00:06.400> up<00:00:06.550> on<00:00:06.760> the<00:00:06.910> screen<00:00:07.210> is<00:00:07.420> a

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
the first thing up on the screen is a

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.830 
the first thing up on the screen is a
cross<00:00:07.780> section<00:00:08.320> of<00:00:08.410> the<00:00:08.530> mesh<00:00:08.740> on<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:10.240> left<00:00:10.540> is

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
cross section of the mesh on the left is

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.580 
cross section of the mesh on the left is
the<00:00:11.050> correct<00:00:11.470> coding<00:00:11.890> and<00:00:12.250> exposure<00:00:13.180> as<00:00:13.599> you

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
the correct coding and exposure as you

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.589 
the correct coding and exposure as you
can<00:00:14.769> see<00:00:15.040> the<00:00:15.250> mesh<00:00:15.430> is<00:00:15.610> totally<00:00:16.180> encapsulated

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
can see the mesh is totally encapsulated

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.909 
can see the mesh is totally encapsulated
and<00:00:17.519> the<00:00:18.519> emulsion<00:00:19.089> is<00:00:19.179> exposed<00:00:19.919> completely

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
and the emulsion is exposed completely

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.470 
and the emulsion is exposed completely
through<00:00:21.400> from<00:00:22.300> print<00:00:22.659> side<00:00:22.929> to<00:00:23.619> squeegee<00:00:23.980> side

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
through from print side to squeegee side

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.540 
through from print side to squeegee side
creating<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.689> solid<00:00:26.019> bond<00:00:26.439> of<00:00:26.679> emulsion<00:00:27.220> on<00:00:27.339> the

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
creating a solid bond of emulsion on the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.899 
creating a solid bond of emulsion on the
screen<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:29.289> lighter<00:00:29.589> blue<00:00:29.919> on<00:00:30.069> the<00:00:30.249> bottom<00:00:30.279> to

screen the lighter blue on the bottom to
the<00:00:30.939> right<00:00:31.269> side<00:00:31.659> of<00:00:31.929> the<00:00:32.050> correct<00:00:32.439> exposure

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
the right side of the correct exposure

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.389 
the right side of the correct exposure
is<00:00:33.460> what's<00:00:34.120> called<00:00:34.359> eom<00:00:35.109> or<00:00:35.379> emulsion<00:00:36.070> over

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
is what's called eom or emulsion over

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.240 
is what's called eom or emulsion over
mesh<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:37.960> what<00:00:38.170> tells<00:00:38.410> ink<00:00:38.800> where<00:00:39.070> to

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
mesh this is what tells ink where to

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.389 
mesh this is what tells ink where to
stop<00:00:39.579> it<00:00:39.940> gets<00:00:40.480> stupid<00:00:40.989> and<00:00:41.019> it<00:00:41.679> needs<00:00:41.949> a<00:00:42.129> place

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
stop it gets stupid and it needs a place

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.400 
stop it gets stupid and it needs a place
to<00:00:42.429> stop<00:00:42.940> when<00:00:43.269> it<00:00:43.390> flows<00:00:43.690> through<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.199> mesh

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
to stop when it flows through the mesh

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.340 
to stop when it flows through the mesh
on<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:46.030> right<00:00:46.239> side<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:46.600> can<00:00:46.989> see<00:00:47.019> an

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
on the right side you can see an

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.919 
on the right side you can see an
underexposed<00:00:48.129> screen<00:00:48.670> where<00:00:49.449> we've<00:00:49.629> not

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
underexposed screen where we've not

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.470 
underexposed screen where we've not
exposed<00:00:50.500> completely<00:00:51.250> through<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.879> we're

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
exposed completely through and we're

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.829 
exposed completely through and we're
washing<00:00:52.719> emulsion<00:00:53.559> off<00:00:53.800> on<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:55.329> squeegee

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
washing emulsion off on the squeegee

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.130 
washing emulsion off on the squeegee
side<00:00:56.140> rendering<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.370> stencil<00:00:58.030> much<00:00:58.570> weaker

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
side rendering the stencil much weaker

side rendering the stencil much weaker
and<00:00:59.320> possibly<00:01:00.219> creating<00:01:00.969> pinholes<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:03.100> still

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
and possibly creating pinholes you still

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.300 
and possibly creating pinholes you still
have<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.730> little<00:01:04.030> bit<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.330> an<00:01:04.540> eom<00:01:05.050> but<00:01:05.980> when<00:01:06.160> you

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
have a little bit of an eom but when you

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.120 
have a little bit of an eom but when you
see<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.790> eom<00:01:07.300> on<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.780> screen<00:01:08.140> it's<00:01:08.380> rounded

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
see the eom on the screen it's rounded

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.360 
see the eom on the screen it's rounded
and<00:01:09.340> thin<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:10.240> what<00:01:11.050> happens<00:01:11.560> is<00:01:11.890> when<00:01:12.220> you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
and thin and what happens is when you

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.670 
and thin and what happens is when you
push<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.850> ink<00:01:13.090> through<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:14.230> ink<00:01:14.470> has<00:01:14.560> a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
push the ink through the ink has a

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.570 
push the ink through the ink has a
tendency<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.820> want<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.420> spread<00:01:16.990> out

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
tendency to want to spread out

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.540 
tendency to want to spread out
underneath<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.820> stencil<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.740> it's<00:01:20.980> critical

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
underneath the stencil so it's critical

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.530 
underneath the stencil so it's critical
to<00:01:21.960> cope<00:01:22.960> properly<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:23.980> expose<00:01:24.760> properly<00:01:25.510> I

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
to cope properly and expose properly I

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.680 
to cope properly and expose properly I
can't<00:01:25.960> impress<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.380> upon<00:01:26.620> you<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:28.180> than<00:01:28.660> I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
can't impress that upon you more than I

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.920 
can't impress that upon you more than I
just<00:01:28.810> did<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:30.550> next<00:01:30.880> thing<00:01:31.060> we<00:01:31.210> do<00:01:31.420> is<00:01:31.450> throw

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
just did the next thing we do is throw

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.830 
just did the next thing we do is throw
an<00:01:32.110> ink<00:01:32.290> some<00:01:32.710> ink<00:01:32.890> in<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.190> screen<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.840> squeegee

an ink some ink in the screen a squeegee

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.590 
an ink some ink in the screen a squeegee
and<00:01:35.230> print<00:01:36.130> it<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.430> you<00:01:36.880> can<00:01:37.090> see<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.390> the

and print it and you can see that the

things that happen all the time these

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.370 
things that happen all the time these
are<00:01:48.220> questions<00:01:48.460> we<00:01:48.970> get<00:01:49.240> all<00:01:49.480> the<00:01:49.780> time<00:01:50.050> and

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
are questions we get all the time and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.240 
are questions we get all the time and
this<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.430> one<00:01:51.640> of<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.910> tipple<00:01:52.330> typical

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
this is one of the tipple typical

this is one of the tipple typical
explanations<00:01:54.250> as<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.550> what<00:01:55.330> happens<00:01:55.810> when<00:01:56.020> the
