like<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:28.100> know<00:01:28.130> kids<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.729> can<00:01:28.820> get<00:01:28.909> shit<00:01:29.180> them

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
like you know kids you can get shit them

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.750 
like you know kids you can get shit them
that's<00:01:29.870> what<00:01:29.990> advanced<00:01:30.290> classes<00:01:30.740> hole<00:01:30.920> but

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
that's what advanced classes hole but

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.090 
that's what advanced classes hole but
the<00:01:32.150> standard<00:01:33.020> class<00:01:33.200> should<00:01:33.380> do<00:01:33.530> more<00:01:33.770> walk

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
the standard class should do more walk

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.240 
the standard class should do more walk
on<00:01:34.370> projects<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.799> advanced<00:01:36.799> shouldn't<00:01:37.130> even

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
on projects and advanced shouldn't even

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.340 
on projects and advanced shouldn't even
do<00:01:37.400> politics<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.510> so<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.750> fact<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.049> and

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
do politics just so the fact that and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.050 
do politics just so the fact that and
since<00:01:39.650> you<00:01:40.130> know<00:01:40.250> they<00:01:40.490> pick<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.850> class

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
since you know they pick the class

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.880 
since you know they pick the class
because<00:01:41.210> they<00:01:41.390> can<00:01:41.540> do<00:01:41.720> more<00:01:41.960> walk<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.500> if

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
because they can do more walk and if

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.250 
because they can do more walk and if
they<00:01:43.010> obviously<00:01:43.330> small<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.600> can<00:01:44.690> handle<00:01:44.930> more

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
they obviously small and can handle more

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.350 
they obviously small and can handle more
stuff<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.740> do<00:01:45.920> then<00:01:46.610> why<00:01:46.790> should<00:01:47.030> they<00:01:47.119> have<00:01:47.150> to

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
stuff to do then why should they have to

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.300 
stuff to do then why should they have to
do<00:01:47.479> projects<00:01:48.080> when<00:01:48.380> they<00:01:48.500> would<00:01:48.650> prove

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
do projects when they would prove

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.700 
do projects when they would prove

should<00:02:04.250> have<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.880> do<00:02:05.060> all<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:06.260> advanced<00:02:06.590> steps

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
should have to do all the advanced steps

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.889 
should have to do all the advanced steps
for<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.250> Science<00:02:07.640> Hill<00:02:07.760> project<00:02:08.269> and<00:02:08.450> the

advanced kids get a you know benefit of
being<00:02:12.890> an<00:02:13.130> advanced<00:02:13.520> class<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.090> do<00:02:14.390> less<00:02:14.569> walk

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
being an advanced class and do less walk

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.110 
being an advanced class and do less walk
standard<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.780> l2<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.470> know<00:02:18.760> they<00:02:19.760> need<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:20.060> be

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
standard is l2 you know they need to be

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.370 
standard is l2 you know they need to be
pushed<00:02:20.390> more<00:02:20.690> cuz<00:02:21.290> they<00:02:21.440> are<00:02:21.590> smart<00:02:21.980> as<00:02:22.190> us<00:02:22.340> so

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
pushed more cuz they are smart as us so

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.910 
pushed more cuz they are smart as us so
that's<00:02:24.380> that's<00:02:24.950> my<00:02:25.190> thought<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.000> after<00:02:26.360> that

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
that's that's my thought and after that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.449 
that's that's my thought and after that
