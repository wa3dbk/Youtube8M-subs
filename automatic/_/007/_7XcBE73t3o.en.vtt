00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 personal hi all good my problem 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:11.130
 car is the following if a ford focus 2002 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.130
 2002 is a problem in the recovery 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.199
 Engine Fails When It Accelerates Abruptly 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.820
 so come on the car picks up normally 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.950
 but I think I want to paint a little low 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.230
 too much 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.720
 the engine is a bit forgetful but 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.500
 when the throttle once the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:36.740
 engine failure taiwan 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:41.210
 Like I already got hoses is tbi 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.210
 I did all the possible tests here 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.010
 but does not solve the car has already been made 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.110
 nozzle cleaning has already been done 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.190
 filter exchange replacement of candles 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:02.260
 candle was made the exchange of this mania goes 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.970
 behind what could be a reason for 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.490
 air entrance 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.170
 The cleaning of the sac has been made 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.960
 it does not appear that cleaning was done 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.960
 less time to accelerate 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.659
 now pulling the government looks in the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.930
 cleaning nozzles 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.479
 The mechanic said he's in trouble. 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.040
 and gives it in the nozzles that it can 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.440
 cause it but I still have my 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.170
 suspicions because for example his language 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.430
 leaves in gaza in gaza there for 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:50.430
 accelerate the car and slow down and let 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:55.590
 it would go back idle and erase now 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.850
 did not do it like this if I 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.850
 have for example have samba 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:12.760
 ready always goes is a problem that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.160
 I'm having this problem. 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.040
 car is very good has 230 thousand 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.069
 Compressed engine running pressure tabo 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:26.470
 the petrol pump is holding three 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:28.450
 agreement between three and four more 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.590
 was changed toothed sail cable 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.629
 candle 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.730
 I think everything that was possible that 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.519
 to be made was done by nozzle weight 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.090
 so I hope you can help me there with 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.090
 the problems
