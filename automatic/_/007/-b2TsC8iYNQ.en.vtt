00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.619 

I<00:00:00.860> think<00:00:01.860> we<00:00:01.920> should<00:00:02.070> go<00:00:02.340> here<00:00:02.669> down<00:00:03.270> there<00:00:03.510> and

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
I think we should go here down there and

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.130 
I think we should go here down there and
then<00:00:03.689> split<00:00:04.020> up<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.410> go<00:00:04.470> there<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.069> there<00:00:05.250> i

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
then split up and go there and there i

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
then split up and go there and there i
think<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.350> battle<00:00:07.560> will<00:00:07.680> be<00:00:07.710> over<00:00:07.770> by<00:00:08.099> the

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
think the battle will be over by the

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.250 
think the battle will be over by the
time<00:00:08.250> we<00:00:08.490> reach<00:00:08.639> there<00:00:08.880> i<00:00:09.090> think<00:00:09.660> i<00:00:09.840> think<00:00:10.019> this

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
time we reach there i think i think this

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.310 
time we reach there i think i think this
is<00:00:10.320> no<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.889> it's<00:00:11.849> our<00:00:12.000> time<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.269> pay<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:12.900> i<00:00:12.929> think

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
is no is it's our time to pay so i think

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.740 
is no is it's our time to pay so i think
i<00:00:13.679> think<00:00:13.799> if<00:00:14.190> they<00:00:14.370> were<00:00:14.849> smart<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.599> day

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
i think if they were smart with this day

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.410 
i think if they were smart with this day
could<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.560> wash<00:00:17.039> cap<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.699> their<00:00:17.850> tanks<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
could just wash cap with their tanks and

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.900 
could just wash cap with their tanks and
they<00:00:18.869> would<00:00:19.109> win<00:00:19.320> by<00:00:19.590> cab<00:00:19.859> before<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.730> hash

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
they would win by cab before we hash
