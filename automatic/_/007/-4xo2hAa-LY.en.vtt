and<00:01:19.619> when<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.890> were<00:01:19.979> composting<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.909> had<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and when we were composting we had to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.730 
and when we were composting we had to
mix<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.810> through<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.350> need<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> with

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
mix all this through do we need to with

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.350 
mix all this through do we need to with
one<00:01:22.920> fun<00:01:23.159> no<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> worms<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
one fun no because the worms do the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.670 
one fun no because the worms do the
mixing<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> rooms<00:01:25.259> are<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.530> because

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
mixing so the rooms are there because

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800 
mixing so the rooms are there because
they're<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> mixers<00:01:26.430> always<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> bag<00:01:27.630> on

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
they're the mixers always have a bag on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.359 
they're the mixers always have a bag on
top<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.619> our<00:01:28.710> compost<00:01:29.040> that's<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
top like we do in our compost that's the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.800 
top like we do in our compost that's the
same<00:01:29.549> as<00:01:29.670> composting<00:01:30.210> because<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.479> keeps<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
same as composting because that keeps it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.350 
same as composting because that keeps it
dark<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> moist<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.759> win<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.180> top

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
dark and moist so when they win this top

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.480 
dark and moist so when they win this top
