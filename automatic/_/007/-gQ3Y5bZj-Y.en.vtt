00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.400
 let's learn how to make a healthy body video in 2007 that windows 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.910
 The river movement will hold a populist presentation 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.310
 in this case bland a simple presentation on how to educate prisons 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.389
 in penis as an example 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.449
 The second step is to export every post kioto image 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.449
 as only he like other formats 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.269
 jpg format was recommended approximations with many images png format for 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.710
 context presentations we will use pnc 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.000
 we ask you to save it from your desktop 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 and in this case if we only have the current positio the muscle milk and if 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.130
 we want you exported to the sports we click on positive face 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.780
 and it is said that I have done today successfully now we are going to less than a month 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.800
 let's go to import the images that we take from the heart 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.420
 import images with protections 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.810
 your selector the folder where they are contained already you care 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.480
 let's click on show run 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.750
 and drag them we press all the images 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.570
 we are there 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.870
 I will not do is a patient that I'm not crazy to have a better image 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.180
 of what we have 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.560
 the duration of each positive 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.620
 is not defined by time is that it does have each 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.240
 they put the course on street margin we can see 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.490
 the duration 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.460
 because in the absence of five seconds 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.560
 let's modify it 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.830
 without a click - control that the end 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.750
 the second mourners 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.110
 it is important the unit of how much is said without a positive face 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.940
 to establish the duration of each of them according to what we have to 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.660
 contribute 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.360
 the next step is added a narration 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.619
 it could be that the janácek microphone and 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950
 to show me in a narrative 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.659
 we verify this volume the microphone quest in the green zone if 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.210
 comes to gold as extension programs let's think click on start a 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.090
 relationship 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.040
 then good positive bar about drawn a happy face to undertake 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.030
 with us our example 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.270
 I think that will start present the first step that is click on cliché the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.379
 Second step is to draw a circle 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.449
 we click on clinic 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.959
 iu like two spotlights 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.010
 for later 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.639
 efe quique curve line 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.639
 and draw the mouth open 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.109
 continuation 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.349
 a no meter asks us to go there the file 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.349
 let's go to almonte performance 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.769
 and the narration appears below the pyre 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.989
 let's review the part of your choice 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.989
 to make sure that this one 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.249
 We are going to export the movie 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.299
 the continuation is addressed the script to your hard drive 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.719

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.719
 describe a man lost 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.779
 specify the place they want and videos 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.809
 and then they presented type of fights in that case to use the best one possible for 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.759
 that day a computer is produced which exceeded the flocks 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.059
 with his next I was going to start enjoying the movie 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:17.619
 once it's over 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.849
 nava reproduces here let's see how it ended up next 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.789
 after 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.879
 now that file we can no longer share youtube send it by mail or 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.699
 put it on its own site
