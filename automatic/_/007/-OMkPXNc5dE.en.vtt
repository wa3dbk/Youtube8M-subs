00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.090 

so<00:01:57.790> basically<00:01:58.330> I<00:01:58.690> was<00:01:59.020> going<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.560> fill<00:01:59.980> these

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
so basically I was going to fill these

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.590 
so basically I was going to fill these
cracks<00:02:00.430> with<00:02:00.670> proxy<00:02:01.090> woo

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
cracks with proxy woo

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.260 
cracks with proxy woo
sand<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.500> down<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:03.040> repaint<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.760> black<00:02:04.000> or

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
sand it down and repaint it black or

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.810 
sand it down and repaint it black or
right<00:02:04.480> align<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.990> or<00:02:05.110> something<00:02:05.350> like<00:02:05.470> that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
right align it or something like that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.609 
right align it or something like that
but<00:02:06.820> it's<00:02:07.120> so<00:02:07.360> dry<00:02:07.660> rodded<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.290> realize

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
but it's so dry rodded and I realize

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.020 
but it's so dry rodded and I realize
that<00:02:08.830> there's<00:02:09.040> a<00:02:09.100> hard<00:02:09.550> plastic<00:02:10.000> shell

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
that there's a hard plastic shell

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.420 
that there's a hard plastic shell
underneath<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.040> just<00:02:12.250> took<00:02:12.370> a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
underneath it so I just took a

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.830 
underneath it so I just took a
screwdriver<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.270> start<00:02:13.450> chipping<00:02:13.630> away

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
screwdriver to and start chipping away

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.390 
screwdriver to and start chipping away
it<00:02:14.440> comes<00:02:14.680> off<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.920> we're<00:02:18.100> going<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.250> go

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
it comes off so we're going to go

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.680 
it comes off so we're going to go
through<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.000> we're<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.180> going<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.420> remove

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
through and we're just going to remove

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.990 
through and we're just going to remove
all<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.380> coating<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.640> thick

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
all that coating all that like thick

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.600 
all that coating all that like thick
insulation<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:23.140> like<00:02:23.440> plastic<00:02:23.980> rubber<00:02:24.370> and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
insulation and like plastic rubber and

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.240 
insulation and like plastic rubber and
whatnot<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:25.960> have<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> solid<00:02:26.590> plastic<00:02:26.920> -

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
and send it down and painting so it's

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.830

padding on it but I can't get to it

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.540 
padding on it but I can't get to it
because<00:03:19.660> dashes<00:03:20.140> in<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.350> way<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:21.310> we're<00:03:21.459> going

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
of the game is just weight reduction and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.330 
of the game is just weight reduction and
so<00:03:43.030> we're<00:03:43.299> going<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.480> see<00:03:43.780> what<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.920> this<00:03:45.160> we

so we're going to see what of this we

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.280 
so we're going to see what of this we
can<00:03:45.519> cut<00:03:45.790> out<00:03:45.970> without<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.510> messing<00:03:47.019> up<00:03:47.170> the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.510 
s13 so I'm going to see what I can do
about<00:04:09.080> doing<00:04:09.440> that<00:04:09.560> as<00:04:09.770> well<00:04:09.890> just<00:04:10.220> cutting

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
about doing that as well just cutting

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.680 
about doing that as well just cutting
out<00:04:10.580> this<00:04:10.790> whole<00:04:10.940> door<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.270> just<00:04:11.390> having<00:04:11.600> it

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
out this whole door and just having it

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.220 
out this whole door and just having it
hollow<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.680> then<00:04:13.030> that<00:04:14.030> will<00:04:14.180> be<00:04:14.360> basically

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
hollow and then that will be basically

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.080 
hollow and then that will be basically
that<00:04:15.620> for<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.010> weight<00:04:16.400> reduction<00:04:16.820> right<00:04:16.910> now

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
that for the weight reduction right now

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.610 
that for the weight reduction right now
and<00:04:17.390> if<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.720> want<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:17.959> see<00:04:18.140> what<00:04:18.290> we<00:04:18.380> did<00:04:18.530> to

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
and if you want to see what we did to

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:27.060 
and if you want to see what we did to
the<00:04:18.709> front<00:04:22.510> so<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:24.290> girl<00:04:24.530> joined<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.400> mess

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
the front so the girl joined the mess

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.770 
the front so the girl joined the mess
but<00:04:28.180> we<00:04:29.180> removed<00:04:29.570> from<00:04:30.470> fenders<00:04:30.950> front<00:04:31.280> bumper

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
but we removed from fenders front bumper

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.780 
but we removed from fenders front bumper
just<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:32.960> it's<00:04:33.110> easier<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.920> get<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.580> motor

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
just so it's easier to get to the motor

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.440 
just so it's easier to get to the motor
and<00:04:35.360> see<00:04:35.720> you<00:04:35.930> what's<00:04:36.260> wrong<00:04:36.560> with<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:37.450> only

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
and see you what's wrong with that only

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.360 
and see you what's wrong with that only
two<00:04:38.720> bad<00:04:38.930> things<00:04:39.170> right<00:04:39.350> now<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.830> has<00:04:40.100> no

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
two bad things right now is it has no

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.340 
two bad things right now is it has no
clutch<00:04:40.640> in<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:41.000> so<00:04:41.390> it's<00:04:41.540> not<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.690> bad<00:04:41.900> clutch<00:04:42.200> it

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
clutch in it so it's not a bad clutch it

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.370 
clutch in it so it's not a bad clutch it
has<00:04:42.470> no<00:04:42.620> clutch<00:04:42.830> at<00:04:42.980> all<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:44.540> gas<00:04:44.750> tanks<00:04:45.170> out

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
has no clutch at all the gas tanks out

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.690 
has no clutch at all the gas tanks out
and<00:04:46.090> there<00:04:47.090> is<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.360> pretty<00:04:48.260> decent<00:04:49.190> oil<00:04:49.430> leak

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
and there is a pretty decent oil leak

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.390 
and there is a pretty decent oil leak
from<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.390> oil<00:04:50.630> pan<00:04:50.930> itself<00:04:51.260> so<00:04:51.620> we're<00:04:52.280> going

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
from the oil pan itself so we're going

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.720 
from the oil pan itself so we're going
to<00:04:52.460> doing<00:04:52.730> that<00:04:52.940> see<00:04:53.270> what<00:04:53.660> those<00:04:53.900> are<00:04:54.730> but
