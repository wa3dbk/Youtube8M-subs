 the premieres and also close to the 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.910
 telenovelas is not a genre that to me 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.339

 international festival that also goes to 

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:25.569

 what to do with Ibero-America Latin America 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.060
 so a genre really very, very, very 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.880
 strong and then has the objective 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.470

 good story that is called manu in 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.390

 genre the telenovela is a genre that 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.490
 it has to do with feelings with

 and that had golden times and that was 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.740
 really very despised by the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.160

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.970

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.840
 the authors in what each chapter looks like 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.580
 of the community telenovela take care 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.680

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.720
 You have to know out on the strip that is 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.730
 put the strip on the shoulders and 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.239
 carry forward 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.370

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.950
 be 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.030

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.359
