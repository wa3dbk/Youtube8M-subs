00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
I'm thinking of something but I can't

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.820 
I'm thinking of something but I can't
actually<00:02:22.420> remember<00:02:23.420> another<00:02:24.260> difference

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
actually remember another difference

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.700 
actually remember another difference
between<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.490> vampires<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.500> forks<00:02:27.500> and

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
between the vampires of the forks and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.790 
between the vampires of the forks and
the<00:02:27.770> vampires<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.520> Germany<00:02:29.030> yah<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:30.350> i

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
the vampires of the Germany yah so i

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.130 
the vampires of the Germany yah so i
have<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.460> say<00:02:31.640> nine<00:02:31.880> for<00:02:32.180> now<00:02:32.330> cuz<00:02:32.810> i<00:02:32.930> don't

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
really know anything I guess that's the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.650 
really know anything I guess that's the
main<00:02:36.530> difference<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.490> if<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.270> have<00:02:38.570> any

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
main difference so if you have any

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.390 
main difference so if you have any
questions<00:02:39.170> or<00:02:39.260> if<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.410> are<00:02:39.530> very<00:02:39.800> calm<00:02:40.190> down

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400
