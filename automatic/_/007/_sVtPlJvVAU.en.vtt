that I come out because it would take

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.050 
that I come out because it would take
too<00:02:52.840> long<00:02:53.019> for<00:02:53.290> me<00:02:53.349> to<00:02:53.379> list<00:02:53.620> them<00:02:53.769> out<00:02:54.060> there's

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.629 
some good ones are some bad ones in
there<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.590> we'll<00:02:56.769> see<00:02:56.920> how<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.069> all<00:02:57.219> works<00:02:57.459> out

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
there so we'll see how it all works out

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.979 
there so we'll see how it all works out
but<00:02:57.939> it<00:02:58.150> should<00:02:58.480> be<00:02:58.599> fun<00:02:58.780> regardless<00:03:00.959> also<00:03:01.959> I

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
but it should be fun regardless also I

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.629 
but it should be fun regardless also I
don't<00:03:02.260> know<00:03:02.439> if<00:03:02.530> you've<00:03:02.620> seen<00:03:02.650> but<00:03:03.430> there<00:03:03.549> have

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
places now I've got a feeling that these

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.479 
places now I've got a feeling that these
ones<00:03:12.250> could<00:03:12.579> be<00:03:12.639> trollin<00:03:13.560> if<00:03:14.560> they<00:03:14.859> remind<00:03:15.310> me

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.220 
ones could be trollin if they remind me
so<00:03:15.700> much<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.939> I<00:03:16.629> don't<00:03:16.810> know<00:03:16.900> if<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.109> guys

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
remember a couple of years ago back in

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.539 
remember a couple of years ago back in
the<00:03:18.970> eastern<00:03:19.239> plaguelands<00:03:19.709> there<00:03:20.709> were<00:03:21.010> some

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
the eastern plaguelands there were some

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.729 
the eastern plaguelands there were some
some<00:03:21.970> towers<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.629> once<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:22.959> captured<00:03:23.590> all

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
some towers that once you captured all

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.440 
some towers that once you captured all
of<00:03:23.769> them<00:03:24.069> if<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.489> enter<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:24.939> west<00:03:25.120> one<00:03:25.329> you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
of them if you enter the west one you

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.869 
of them if you enter the west one you
could<00:03:25.599> get<00:03:25.719> a<00:03:25.750> free<00:03:25.989> flight<00:03:26.230> back<00:03:26.500> on<00:03:26.879> said

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
could get a free flight back on said

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.209 
could get a free flight back on said
celestial<00:03:28.419> mount<00:03:28.739> back<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.889> light<00:03:30.040> oak

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:30.219 
celestial mount back the light oak

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:34.110 
celestial mount back the light oak
chapel<00:03:30.609> so<00:03:30.849> now<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:32.189> think<00:03:33.189> this<00:03:33.609> would<00:03:33.760> be<00:03:33.790> cool

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
chapel so now I think this would be cool

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.819 
chapel so now I think this would be cool
to<00:03:34.209> him<00:03:34.329> will<00:03:34.480> mount<00:03:34.629> in<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.870> game<00:03:35.109> especially

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
to him will mount in the game especially

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.530 
to him will mount in the game especially
because<00:03:36.250> these<00:03:36.370> ones<00:03:36.609> look<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.939> little<00:03:37.239> bit

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
because these ones look a little bit

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.319 
because these ones look a little bit
different<00:03:38.519> they<00:03:39.519> don't<00:03:39.700> look<00:03:39.790> like<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:40.120> paid

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329
