engine<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.720> here's<00:00:30.960> our<00:00:31.080> exhaust<00:00:31.410> manifold

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
engine so here's our exhaust manifold

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.830 
engine so here's our exhaust manifold
where<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> new<00:00:32.399> sensor<00:00:32.790> screws<00:00:33.090> into<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
where the new sensor screws into you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.150 
where the new sensor screws into you
want<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.050> make<00:00:34.140> sure<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> engine<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.890> cool

want to make sure the engine is cool

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.979 
want to make sure the engine is cool
because<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.700> gets<00:00:35.910> very<00:00:36.210> hot<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.750> you'll

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
because this gets very hot and you'll

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.840 
because this gets very hot and you'll
burn<00:00:37.170> yourself<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.070> what<00:00:38.219> you're<00:00:38.340> looking<00:00:38.460> for

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
burn yourself so what you're looking for

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.660 
burn yourself so what you're looking for
is<00:00:39.059> bank<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.660> sensor<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> sensor

the two black wires right there which

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.130 
the two black wires right there which
are<00:01:17.790> gonna<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> top<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.630> pigtail

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
are gonna be the top of this pigtail

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.620 
are gonna be the top of this pigtail
here<00:01:19.439> connect<00:01:20.400> each<00:01:20.610> lead<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> multimeter

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
here connect each lead of the multimeter

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.469 
here connect each lead of the multimeter
to<00:01:21.900> each<00:01:22.530> black<00:01:22.830> prong<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> pigtail<00:01:23.909> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
to each black prong in the pigtail you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.240 
to each black prong in the pigtail you

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
can see there's no continuity so the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.219 
can see there's no continuity so the
heater<00:01:26.490> circuit<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.000> broken<00:01:27.030> let's<00:01:27.930> compare

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
heater circuit is broken let's compare

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.859 
heater circuit is broken let's compare
this<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.680> sensor<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.189> works<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:30.689> here's

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this to the sensor that works so here's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
this to the sensor that works so here's
a<00:01:30.930> brand<00:01:31.259> new<00:01:31.439> sensor<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.220> I'll<00:01:32.490> show<00:01:32.640> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
a brand new sensor and I'll show you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.880 
a brand new sensor and I'll show you
what<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> should<00:01:33.329> look<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.470> two<00:01:34.680> black

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
what it should look like the two black

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
what it should look like the two black
wires<00:01:35.100> are<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> top<00:01:35.820> right<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:37.049> just

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
wires are on the top right here you just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
wires are on the top right here you just
touch<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.409> prong<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.729> touch<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.810> other<00:01:40.220> and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
touch one prong and touch the other and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.600 
touch one prong and touch the other and
you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.729> see<00:01:41.939> there<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.750> resistance<00:01:43.320> and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
you can see there is resistance and

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.920 
you can see there is resistance and
obviously<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.909> good<00:01:45.090> sensor<00:01:45.420> cuz<00:01:45.780> it's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
obviously this is a good sensor cuz it's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.780 
obviously this is a good sensor cuz it's
a<00:01:45.990> brand<00:01:46.229> new<00:01:46.259> now<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.189> verified<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
a brand new now that we verified the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.600 
a brand new now that we verified the
sensors<00:01:48.149> bed<00:01:48.420> let's<00:01:48.899> replace<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:50.310> got

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
sensors bed let's replace it I just got

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.190 
sensors bed let's replace it I just got
back<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.119> parts<00:01:51.390> store<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.990> rented

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
back from the parts store and we rented

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.260 
back from the parts store and we rented
this<00:01:52.470> oxygen<00:01:52.829> sensor<00:01:53.340> socket<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.119> has<00:01:54.240> a

this oxygen sensor socket and it has a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.670 
this oxygen sensor socket and it has a
special<00:01:54.570> slot<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.170> could<00:01:55.290> slide<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680

oxygen sensor socket and snug it up you

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.360 
oxygen sensor socket and snug it up you
don't<00:03:54.320> need<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.470> make<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.709> super<00:03:55.040> tight<00:03:55.250> you

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
don't need to make this super tight you

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.970 
don't need to make this super tight you
just<00:03:55.400> need<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:55.760> get<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:55.970> real<00:03:56.090> snug<00:03:59.110> good

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
just need to get it real snug good

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.830 
just need to get it real snug good
and<00:04:02.099> then<00:04:02.610> after<00:04:02.880> we<00:04:02.970> tighten<00:04:03.330> this<00:04:03.480> we're

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
and then after we tighten this we're

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.240 
and then after we tighten this we're
going<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:03.990> just<00:04:04.140> connect<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.590> clip<00:04:04.800> right<00:04:05.099> in

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
going to just connect the clip right in

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.860 
going to just connect the clip right in
here<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:06.260> snaps<00:04:07.260> in<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:07.910> so<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.690> we<00:04:09.780> have

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
here that snaps in like so so we have

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.320 
here that snaps in like so so we have
our<00:04:09.989> new<00:04:10.140> air<00:04:10.290> fuel<00:04:10.530> sensor<00:04:10.770> going<00:04:11.520> up<00:04:11.670> clipped

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
our new air fuel sensor going up clipped

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.150 
our new air fuel sensor going up clipped
in<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.750> now<00:04:13.260> let's<00:04:13.440> delete<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.800> codes<00:04:14.040> to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
in and now let's delete the codes to

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.740 
in and now let's delete the codes to
check<00:04:14.430> engine<00:04:14.730> light<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:14.970> see<00:04:15.270> if<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.599> gets

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
check engine light and see if it gets

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.800 
check engine light and see if it gets
triggered<00:04:15.959> again<00:04:16.139> so<00:04:17.100> we<00:04:17.220> have<00:04:17.250> our<00:04:17.760> bank<00:04:18.510> two

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
triggered again so we have our bank two

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.280 
triggered again so we have our bank two
sensor<00:04:19.380> one<00:04:19.739> code<00:04:20.310> right<00:04:20.669> here<00:04:21.200> we're<00:04:22.200> going

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
sensor one code right here we're going

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.730 
sensor one code right here we're going
to<00:04:22.350> delete<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.850> good<00:04:24.350> now<00:04:25.350> we'll<00:04:25.410> start<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
to delete it good now we'll start the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.950 
to delete it good now we'll start the
engine<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.940> we'll<00:04:30.060> go<00:04:30.180> for<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.450> ride<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:30.810> see

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
engine and we'll go for a ride and see

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.580 
engine and we'll go for a ride and see
if<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.139> check<00:04:31.320> engine<00:04:31.590> light<00:04:31.740> comes<00:04:31.919> back<00:04:32.130> on

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
if the check engine light comes back on

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.110 
if the check engine light comes back on
after<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:35.010> ride<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.460> can<00:04:35.580> see<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.910> light

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
after the ride you can see the light

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.969 
after the ride you can see the light
didn't<00:04:36.479> come<00:04:36.630> back<00:04:36.780> on<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.470> we<00:04:37.500> fixed<00:04:37.889> the

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
didn't come back on so we fixed the

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.920 
didn't come back on so we fixed the
problem<00:04:38.010> that's<00:04:38.940> how<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.180> check<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.630> replace

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
problem that's how you check and replace

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.170 
problem that's how you check and replace
an<00:04:40.080> air<00:04:40.260> fuel<00:04:40.530> ratio<00:04:40.560> sensor<00:04:41.340> hopefully<00:04:42.030> the

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
an air fuel ratio sensor hopefully the
