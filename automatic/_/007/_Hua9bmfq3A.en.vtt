00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
powerful for a computer you would

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.780 
powerful for a computer you would
normally<00:01:14.790> find<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:16.439> size<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.430> you're<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
normally find in this size if you're a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.300 
normally find in this size if you're a
person<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.619> wants<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
person that really really wants a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.090 
person that really really wants a
computer<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> size<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> netbook<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.560> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
computer the size of a netbook but you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.530 
computer the size of a netbook but you
find<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> screens<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.450> too

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
find that the screens or a little too

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
find that the screens or a little too
crammed<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> resolutions<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.710> quite<00:01:26.100> high

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
crammed the resolutions not quite high

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160 
crammed the resolutions not quite high
enough<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.880> find<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> processor<00:01:27.869> might<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
enough you find the processor might be a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.929 
enough you find the processor might be a
little<00:01:28.290> too<00:01:28.409> slow<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.250> need<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.670> for

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
little too slow for what you need it for

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.490 
little too slow for what you need it for
maybe<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> doesn't<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.689> quite<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.229> amount

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
maybe it doesn't have quite the amount

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.310 
maybe it doesn't have quite the amount
of<00:01:31.530> RAM<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> want<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
of RAM that you want this is not that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.510 
of RAM that you want this is not that
much<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.829> expensive<00:01:35.100> than<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.400> netbook

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
much more expensive than a netbook

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.060 
much more expensive than a netbook
either<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.150> mean<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.799> really

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
either I mean it's a really really

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.620 
either I mean it's a really really
impressive<00:01:38.820> computer<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.329> let's<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.540> ahead

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
impressive computer so let's go ahead

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.560 
impressive computer so let's go ahead
and<00:01:39.810> show<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.890> around<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:42.119> thing<00:01:42.360> is

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
and show you all around this thing is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.069 
and show you all around this thing is
this<00:01:42.840> three-pound<00:01:43.649> beast<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.880> laptop<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
this three-pound beast of a laptop it

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.510 
this three-pound beast of a laptop it
does<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.710> course<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> integrated

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
does have of course the integrated

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
does have of course the integrated
webcam<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.420> going<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.720> useful<00:01:49.229> for

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
webcam so it's going to be useful for

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.560 
webcam so it's going to be useful for
doing<00:01:49.680> video<00:01:50.430> blogging<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.509> on

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
doing video blogging and going on

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.440 
doing video blogging and going on
youtube<00:01:52.020> or<00:01:52.140> streaming<00:01:52.560> stuff<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.100> all

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
youtube or streaming stuff it's all

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
youtube or streaming stuff it's all
going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.600> possible<00:01:55.200> from<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.159> notebook

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
going to be possible from this notebook

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.830 
going to be possible from this notebook
an<00:01:57.110> 11.6<00:01:58.110> inch<00:01:58.670> led-backlit<00:01:59.670> display<00:02:00.360> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
an 11.6 inch led-backlit display so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.420 
an 11.6 inch led-backlit display so
you're<00:02:01.110> guaranteed<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.280> have

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you're guaranteed to have

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.300 
you're guaranteed to have
extraordinarily<00:02:03.180> great<00:02:04.140> color<00:02:04.530> everything

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
extraordinarily great color everything

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.219 
extraordinarily great color everything
is<00:02:05.430> going<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> look<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.750> nice<00:02:07.049> and

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
is going to look really really nice and

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.950 
is going to look really really nice and
it<00:02:07.350> runs<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> resolution<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.720> 1366<00:02:09.720> x<00:02:10.879> 768

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
it runs at a resolution of 1366 x 768

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
it runs at a resolution of 1366 x 768
eh<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.740> also<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.130> high<00:02:13.580> res<00:02:14.030> screen<00:02:14.780> as<00:02:15.020> we

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980
