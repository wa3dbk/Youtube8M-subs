 passed just received 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.280

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.859
 before the championship the page 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.170
 ever come to it 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.479
 to want to make championship easy 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.679
 only because of the very good successes the 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.920
 we told you about the training or 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.100
 has anyone pushed you more like that ? 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.920

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.150
 who always has to keep it that way 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.270

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.630
 better we thought with him 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.750
 Let's try how to do things 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.070
 other people have said in the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.670
 world championship because we stop 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:08.610
 always year by year have improved one 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.259
 enormous increase everything is therefore ok 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.480
 yes, always trains together as 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.209
 training partner always there like that 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.300
 couple typical clichÃ© I was once 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:26.069
 so as a quintet but not to say 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.280
 I had a training 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.030
 since august and christian 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.190
 So now one is still looking for one 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.500
 training okay so what education 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.730
 maybe we'll find over here 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.420
 I have to be a specialist for warehouse logistics 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:48.450
 also apply for body attack ok so much 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.920
 first to the banter and now what 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.489
 of you see and start and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.170
 did actually ex that you times from 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.120
 sometimes biceps and plays catch 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.500
 triceps today i start with biceps 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.450
 Okay, what's yours? 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.549
 training philosophy what we are 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.160
 He trains in the classic volume 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.560
 training with training something t7 what makes 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.019
 He is now me both in training 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.910
 so repeat until 15 with light 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.019
 weight because the strength always holds 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.650
 gets less 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.870
 but it was masterphase halt harder 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.470
 but now it has 15 repetitions 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.000
 volume kick here is finite 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:05:52.009
 okay, we are curious to see you soon 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:05:52.009
