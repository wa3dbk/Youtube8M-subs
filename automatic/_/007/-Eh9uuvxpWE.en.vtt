00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
is it a huge competition among the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.260 
is it a huge competition among the
pilots<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.780> your<00:00:51.960> country<00:00:55.070> yes<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
pilots in your country yes I think so I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.380 
pilots in your country yes I think so I
don't<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.559> many<00:00:58.710> pilots<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.120> seems

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
don't know that many pilots but it seems

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.990 
don't know that many pilots but it seems
like<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.079> quite<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> few<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.640> are

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
like there is a quite a few that are

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.359 
like there is a quite a few that are
trying<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.629> jobs<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.739> yeah<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.070> think

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
trying to get jobs so yeah I think

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.020 
trying to get jobs so yeah I think
there's<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.820> somewhat<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.750> competition<00:01:08.030> and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
there's a somewhat of a competition and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.399 
there's a somewhat of a competition and

you decide to choose a pouts career for
a<00:01:16.860> long<00:01:16.979> time<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.490> childhood<00:01:18.180> dream

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
a long time it was a childhood dream

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.399 
a long time it was a childhood dream
that<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.400> during<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:20.909> teens<00:01:21.180> put<00:01:21.930> away<00:01:22.049> because

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that I during my teens put away because

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
that I during my teens put away because
of<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:23.040> thought<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> had<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> learn<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.210> lot<00:01:24.420> about

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
of I thought I had to learn a lot about

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.560 
of I thought I had to learn a lot about
physics<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.380> mathematics<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.070> such<00:01:26.570> but

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
physics and mathematics and such but

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.069 
physics and mathematics and such but
then<00:01:27.720> later<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.409> figured<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.869> this<00:01:30.869> is

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
then later on I figured out that this is

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.780 
then later on I figured out that this is
what<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.650> want<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> would<00:01:32.640> just

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
what I really want to do so I would just

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.510 
what I really want to do so I would just
have<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.200> learn<00:01:34.200> some<00:01:34.799> things<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.250> didn't

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
have to learn some things that I didn't

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.760 
have to learn some things that I didn't
didn't<00:01:35.909> care<00:01:36.270> much<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.470> it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
didn't care much for but and then it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
didn't care much for but and then it
would<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.150> it<00:01:39.150> would<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> best<00:01:39.630> thing<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
would be it would be the best thing to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510 
would be it would be the best thing to
do<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.650> would<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.009> something<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.400> I

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
do so I I would do something that I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.050 
do so I I would do something that I
actually<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.360> doing<00:01:42.570> yes<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.610> did<00:01:44.939> it

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
actually like doing yes and I did it

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.810 
actually like doing yes and I did it
change<00:01:45.299> from<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> start<00:01:46.110> till<00:01:46.500> now<00:01:46.759> what<00:01:47.759> do

would you would have to study some
things<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.170> aren't<00:01:52.500> very<00:01:52.649> interesting<00:01:53.310> did

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
things that aren't very interesting did

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.719 
things that aren't very interesting did

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
think I have a very good ability to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.600 
think I have a very good ability to

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
situations which is a good quality I

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.120 
situations which is a good quality I
think<00:03:04.120> because<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:05.350> know<00:03:05.470> when<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:05.950> find

think because you you know when you find

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.120 
think because you you know when you find
there<00:03:06.370> also<00:03:06.550> always<00:03:06.880> something<00:03:07.300> new<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.690> you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
there also always something new that you

there also always something new that you
encounter<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.550> adapt<00:03:10.210> to<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.690> maybe

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
encounter and have to adapt to and maybe

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.900 
encounter and have to adapt to and maybe

regulations<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.390> way<00:04:18.540> of<00:04:18.690> doing<00:04:18.959> things<00:04:19.170> I

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
regulations and way of doing things I

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.220 
regulations and way of doing things I
guess<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.260> basic<00:04:22.950> difference<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.790> that<00:04:24.230> in

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
guess the basic difference is that in

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.090 
guess the basic difference is that in
the<00:04:25.680> u.s.<00:04:25.920> they<00:04:26.100> focus<00:04:26.490> more<00:04:26.520> on<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:28.080> hands<00:04:28.980> on

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
the u.s. they focus more on the hands on

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.670 
the u.s. they focus more on the hands on
flying<00:04:29.430> parts<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.810> maybe<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.440> Europe

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
flying parts and and maybe in Europe

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.950 
flying parts and and maybe in Europe
they<00:04:32.130> focus<00:04:32.580> more<00:04:32.610> on<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.180> Norway<00:04:33.480> more<00:04:33.840> on

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
they focus more on and Norway more on

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.270 
they focus more on and Norway more on
the<00:04:34.890> theoretical<00:04:35.790> knowledge<00:04:35.940> of<00:04:36.420> flying<00:04:37.280> but

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
the theoretical knowledge of flying but

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.580 
the theoretical knowledge of flying but
so<00:04:38.640> it's<00:04:38.820> like<00:04:39.180> very<00:04:39.210> good<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.720> have<00:04:39.900> both<00:04:40.170> to

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
so it's like very good to have both to

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.980 
so it's like very good to have both to
have<00:04:40.890> those<00:04:41.100> move<00:04:41.340> schools<00:04:41.760> yeah<00:04:42.480> I<00:04:42.510> think<00:04:42.720> so

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
have those move schools yeah I think so

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.030 
have those move schools yeah I think so
mm-hmm<00:04:43.980> okay<00:04:44.610> so<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:45.270> last<00:04:45.390> question<00:04:46.040> could

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
mm-hmm okay so the last question could

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.340 
mm-hmm okay so the last question could
