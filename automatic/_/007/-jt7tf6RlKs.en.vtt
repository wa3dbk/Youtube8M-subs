now<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.259> GFS<00:01:49.740> model<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.310> remember

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
now this is the GFS model and remember

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.219 
now this is the GFS model and remember
this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.659> showing<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.200> some

this is going to be showing you some

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.280 
this is going to be showing you some
very<00:01:52.770> long<00:01:53.130> range<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.090> Saturday<00:01:54.899> here

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
we have a development pressure area but

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.260 
we have a development pressure area but
once<00:02:48.960> again<00:02:49.110> beyond<00:02:50.070> three<00:02:50.550> or<00:02:50.730> four<00:02:50.940> days
