 here is another edition of the med news in 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.880
 video here on youtube 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.710
 first of all just to remember the 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.930
 Average is enough time on facebook 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.850
 no instagram so if you do not know 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.890

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.620
 instagram stealing nerd - and also in 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.739
 official facebook is mid -level also 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.410
 it's in the neshat there people are like 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.059
 officer at indy nilson adds a lot of 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:01.760
 cool thing behind the scenes in our 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:05.360
 work is fair but now we go to what 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.940
 really interested in the 8 revelations that 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.520
 the low trailer in a superman verse 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.810
 introduce us to start 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.540
 position number one 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.970
 we realize we discover that a 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.700
 beat numbers in the battle of 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.040
 metropolis when the superman faces the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.229
 sodium in the movie is our first uncle 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.640
 He's looking up and seeing the whole thing. 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.280
 that destruction that the two are 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.220
 causing it and then he sees a building 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.750
 wayne enterprises falling on his reaction 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.940
 unlike all other people 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.070
 who are running away on the run 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.800
 of that institution and gives that smoke is 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.110
 run towards the rubble to 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.790
 save a little girl who was there in the 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.790
 half this scene was mythical 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.660
 in position number two the joker knows the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.370
 batman identity as well 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.490
 the trailer folks my pocket and me 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.430
 holding a newspaper there amended a 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.130
 thing written in law and says so you 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.440
 let his family die but if who 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.400
 is reading whats the best is bruce wayne one 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.830
 newspaper 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.840
 then this may mean that the joker 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.740
 in this expanded universe of economic 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.050
 at the movies 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.170
 knowing of him batman entities that is the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.080
 witch in or it means that dim 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.840
 sum todd already go everybody of the dead 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.060
 the red hood is already loose on the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.790
 gotham streets and there he set fire to 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.510
 message to one who was a great 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.300
 tutor of yesteryear the hood yet 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.760
 surtiria a queen down by not 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.400
 to have killed a joker that is coming to 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.770
 alison todd after one next scene 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.130
 uniform show of hunger 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.350
 It's all black so closed in yellow. 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.820
 with some laughter that makes it clear to 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.420
 the people who are the joker who have peck 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.060
 then it would also be 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.580
 Do not say one can send some 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.010
 problematic messages but then it will 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.440
 that the joker and the jason todd are really 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.570
 face character this probably will not 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.310
 will happen and we will not get into 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.470
 more details here but if you want 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.930
 really know more about the theory of 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.220
 being the result writes here in 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.070
 comments that we make another one 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.959
 video in the third place in the same way 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.390
 that we know there by various dialogues 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.090
 especially the batman with the alviverde 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.130
 and also previously that I think of 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.940
 I saw a building that was always destroyed by 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.610
 Super man 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.430
 so we know that Batman is no longer 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.760
 very partner and a superman but what the 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.519
 people choose with training is that the clark 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.980
 kent is not the biggest fan of the bat either 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.350
 in fact he is well gate a batman 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.840
 we feel this mainly for the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.850
 clark kent's dialogue with 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.459
 daily planet in which he speaks of 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.220
 threatening and vigilant crazy that leaves the 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.860
 black style 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.210
 los angeles near region was that mark 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:06.140
 some melo will still have a kit of marmoset 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.210
 intense toying bock technomy foot 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.490
 the fourth and one of the coolest 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.620
 revelations that this trailer presents 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.350
 For us it is that the body of the general 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.570
 OsÃ³rio is being kept in the web store is 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.859
 most likely under the care of 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.239
 health of the former pilot 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.180
 first we see the scene of a 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.520
 giant dog being loaded by 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.680
 some security guards with the bodyguard 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.290
 former rider in front in a following scene 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.600
 We see a guy who can not 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.020
 identify exactly who is opening a 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.740
 zipper inside a bag in which such a body 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.920
 From the eyes 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.410
 this may mean that alex corp and 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.280
 lex luthor let's use a search 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.710
 with the body of sodium will make a 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.480
 research with the body of sodium to create 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.340
 the villain apocalypse 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.160
 then it is very likely that we see this 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.350
 character in this movie or in the next 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.870
 movies told who not only knows 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.580
 to give an introduction the apocalypse is the 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.800
 character who kills Superman in 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.530
 the fifth revelation comic that is not 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.450
 none are related so the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.940
 You will see thomas and the mink and 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.010
 die again in this crazy dispute 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.750
 for me who dies another cinema with a 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.060
 Uncle, it seems the parents of both 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.910
 are finally taking the lead and 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.460
 adding another dot in the dispute in 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.860
 a flashback scene we see he does not 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.560
 just a shot as well as burial of tones 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.710
 and of course we cry in 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.560
 tears and shouts and dispense the woman 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.820
 wonder is also in the movie what it says 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.740
 nowadays you do not know 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.690
 but what really will fall are the scenes 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.540
 action in which she appears in hitting the 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.520
 Brazilian then there is a little smile 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.890
 after taking a hit that was 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.530
 amazing what the director zack snyder 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.510
 talked about it is that gal gadot a 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.490
 character interpreted by her 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.040
 will be a great link between 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.660
 batman and superman and the other members of 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.270
 Justice League for the movie that goes 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.830
 to arrive in 2017 at the movies so we 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.070
 you can expect something really cool from 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.800
 her participation in the film 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.990
 in seventh place one leaves for the 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.240
 eating although it is not mentioned 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.520
 in no time in the trailer in a scene 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.430
 and has a boy underwater 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.220
 holding an object in an 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.070
 something that we do not even distinguishable 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.170
 can be this origin of the beyond 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.810
 or rather his first appearance in that 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.270
 new expanded universe of the psychologist 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.400
 mild it will be interpreted by 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.530
 human rights cinemas what the director 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.320
 zack snyder guaranteed is that 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.270
 viewers will know yes about the existence 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.790
 of the King of the Seas in this first 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.900
 batman and superman that will give rise to 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.240
 justice league 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.030
 and to end a reference the 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.720
 frank miller dark knight 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:51.570

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.200
