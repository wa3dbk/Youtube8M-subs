00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.850
 hello to all the friends these maestros 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.260
 88 player I hope you are well 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.240
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.619
 new video on fifa 15 months 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.020
 today no gameplay since we get 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.140
 found su for the third episode 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.430
 is the last episode of my series on 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.190
 the most promising young players 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.119
 of fifa 15 they are under 21 years old 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.520
 with a potential greater than 85 and 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.809
 start right now with mass hashim 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.510
 turn 66 of general and 88.2 potential yes 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.940
 you heard of the guys 88 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.039
 he has 22 points of possible progression 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.649
 so it's just huge it's really 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.649
 simply huge 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.120
 he plays a kite he is only 16 years old he 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.829
 plays offensive midfielder he can play too 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.139
 attacker he can play left at 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.269
 right really very versatile he has 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:00.949
 already proved quite a lot even though 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.989
 he's still not a great player 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.790
 hence its overall rating but it really 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.860
 a potential is huge if you want 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.360
 a versatile player at that position is 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.680
 really cheap I advise you 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.830
 because in two three years of career 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.480
 he can become really good so that's it 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.750
 I absolutely recommend this player 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.630
 continue with brill Mbolo 73.2 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.710
 general and 87 potential there too 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.680
 it is heavy 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.230
 he plays the fc basel therefore an accused 17 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.090
 years very good attackers especially for 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.800
 his age he is not very versatile he 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.080
 was really a good to the players a 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.270
 big improvement margin he did 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.950
 good land this last season 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.110
 so here's an attacker that I will 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.250
 absolutely advises 87.2 general it 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.830
 there are not many on the market 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.540
 especially at this price of 87.2 potential 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.990
 let's talk so that's really a good 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.900
 attacker 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.720
 we continue with ross barkley 78.2 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.950
 general and 86.2 potential so I had 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.040
 does a video about him it's really a 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.600
 excellent player a very good middle of 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.150
 very versatile terrain he can play in 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.490
 6 in a system in 4-2-3-1 he that joy 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.720
 really say a good player he has 20 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.900
 years so that's why he has 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.180
 general already higher 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.250
 that the latter should see and they 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.050
 play at everton even though the rains by 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.050
 a lot of clubs including manchester 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.520
 city ​​so here's in any case it's a 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.840
 very good environment that I advise you 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.440
 absolutely also for your fashion 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.260
 career we continue with timo werner 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.240
 71.2 general and 86.2 potential there too 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.520
 the 15 points of progress margin 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.840
 so it's really a lot 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.130
 he can play winger he can play 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.540
 attacker he can play in nine 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.430
 he can play from left to right it's 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.380
 really a very good player especially 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.240
 he is only 18 he plays stuttgart 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.530
 I know him not long ago and 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.420
 he's really a good player 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.070
 I watched some videos of him he 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.300
 make big games this season so 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.450
 I recommend it absolutely 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.630
 continue with aymeric cham 73.2 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.130
 general and 86.2 potential you the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.840
 maybe know more easily 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.459
 because he plays at liverpool and he has 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.880
 did last two seasons earlier 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.340
 rather successful even though he has not yet 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.440
 proven great things that's why 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.150
 that he has only 73 of general for 20 years 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.920
 it's not huge but it has a big 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.060
 potential 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.470
 so here it is really a player that 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.870
 I advise you he can play too 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.709
 defensive midfielder as a defender so a 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.260
 versatile player 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.880
 we see there is really a good player 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.130
 but especially for liverpool who wanted 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.040
 recruit it and will not cost very much and 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.140
 we finish with adnan januzaj 75.2 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.019
 general and 86 potential for 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.459
 only 19 years old who plays right wing 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.310
 he is not very versatile he is 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.660
 left-handed but it's excellent it's 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.220
 really especially on fifa you can 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.320
 do a lot of things with him it's 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.030
 really a very good player and I think 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.970
 that it will not cost much if you 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.080
 want to recruit him and he progresses very 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.120
 quickly so here it is really a 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.350
 excellent player if we do if you 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.420
 playing a little bit he can 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.519
 really go up and reach his 86's 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.320
 potential so here is na nga we have a 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.480
 player to recruit absolutely if you 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.790
 look for a good level right winger 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.290
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.540

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.580
