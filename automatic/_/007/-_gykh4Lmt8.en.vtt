00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.820
 good guys little by little we're going 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.830
 discovering the proposals of the 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.110
 leading mobile manufacturers for 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.509
 this year and how could it be otherwise 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.630
 way now that we already know the htc one 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.820
 m8 must be forced to compare it 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.820
 with the reference of this market the 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.439
 galaxy s 5 first of all say that this 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.839
 comparative is done on 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.120
 Features and benefits of the 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.000
 paper trying to give an objective focus 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.949
 of what each serial terminal offers 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.920
 without going to assess the functions 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.559
 internal or software of each model in 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.020
 this comparison of the htc one m 8 and the 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.120
 galaxy s 5 we highlight the sections 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.129
 main screen ram memory 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.160
 battery processor dimensions weight 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.050
 camera prices and so on so let's 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.449
 it at the screen level both 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.350
 terminals are gorgeous 5 inches 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:05.979
 super lcd 3 to 1080p on the one m 8 front 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.780
 at 5.1 inches superamoled ls 5 there will be 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.759
 than to analyze them thoroughly with the two 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.640
 mobile phones but we already imagine that 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.349
 quality of the 86 highlights in this subject the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.580
 processor is similar in both 

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:18.820
 terminals 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.910
 they are equipped with a start 801 although the galaxy 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.630
 s 5 takes the clock frequency to 2.5 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.700
 gigahertz before the 21 htc one m 8 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.830
 they share 2 gigas of ram and 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.780
 connectivity standards where 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.000
 we found differences between both is 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.820
 for example in the internal memory 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.190
 while the s 5 stays in 32 gigas 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.130
 for the larger version the one m 8 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.990
 offer a 64 gb model 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.300
 at the camera level we can only say 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.760
 that both employ technologies very 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.700
 different and the numbers do not have much 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.410
 meaning in this case it does matter 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.340
 the numbers when we talk about battery 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.890
 we found 2,800 milliamps before the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.530
 2600 htc one we also have 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.260
 differences in the size and weight 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.979
 thickness and weight of the s5 are 81 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.730
 millimeters and 145 grams before the 935 and 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.440
 160 of the one 8 in conclusion in what 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.690
 regards a technical comparison and 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.989
 on paper the samsung terminal 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.000
 takes advantage to HTC and we shall see 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.000
 forward which of the two wins
