00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
know like the AI of the enemy how to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.990 
know like the AI of the enemy how to
make<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.360> enemy<00:00:33.510> shoot<00:00:34.430> how<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.489> draw<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
you mean usually comes back to the AI

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.010 
you mean usually comes back to the AI
they<00:00:43.530> want<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.860> how<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.010> make<00:00:44.250> an<00:00:44.370> AI<00:00:45.020> well

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
they want to know how to make an AI well

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.900 
they want to know how to make an AI well
this<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.550> game<00:00:47.700> maker

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
this this is not really a game maker

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
this this is not really a game maker
question<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.390> more<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.930> question<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.469> just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
question it's more of a question in just

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.860 
question it's more of a question in just
basic<00:00:50.160> programming<00:00:50.730> right<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:51.719> not

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
basic programming right there's not

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.810 
basic programming right there's not
really<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.140> super<00:00:52.980> function<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.670> oh

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
really one super function that's like oh

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.130 
really one super function that's like oh
hey<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.629> bucktin<00:00:55.399> you<00:00:56.399> type<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.879> IA<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.020> then

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
hey I bucktin you type in IA I and then

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
hey I bucktin you type in IA I and then
suddenly<00:00:58.410> they<00:00:58.559> start<00:00:58.800> running<00:00:59.340> around<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
suddenly they start running around and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.920

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
shooting at you well no more so it comes

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
shooting at you well no more so it comes
down<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.769> you're<00:01:04.890> wanting<00:01:05.100> right

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
them to like walk around objects trying

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.480 
them to like walk around objects trying
to<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.710> how<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.040> where<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to get to you how do they know where you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.620 
to get to you how do they know where you
are<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:33.590> these<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.729> AI<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.180> just

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
are right these are like AI is just

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.179 
are right these are like AI is just
really<00:01:37.020> hard<00:01:37.049> some<00:01:37.470> people<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:37.770> talented<00:01:38.070> at

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
really hard some people are talented at

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.490 
really hard some people are talented at
making<00:01:38.220> them<00:01:38.700> I'm<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.420> exactly<00:01:39.960> majorly

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
making them I'm not exactly majorly

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
making them I'm not exactly majorly
talented<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.880> really<00:01:42.210> comes

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
talented at them it just really comes

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.149 
talented at them it just really comes
down<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.540> programming<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:45.079> like<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.259> game<00:01:47.009> maker

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
down to programming so like a game maker

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.800 
down to programming so like a game maker
has<00:01:47.369> its<00:01:47.549> own<00:01:47.640> built-in<00:01:47.970> pathfinding

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
has its own built-in pathfinding

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.139 
has its own built-in pathfinding
functions<00:01:49.290> okay<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.670> that's<00:01:50.970> that's

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
functions okay and that's that's that's

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.100 
functions okay and that's that's that's
very<00:01:51.360> important<00:01:52.490> yep<00:01:53.490> steps<00:01:53.880> step<00:01:54.630> towards

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
very important yep steps step towards

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.289 
very important yep steps step towards
step<00:01:55.470> avoiding<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.579> there's<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> script

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
step avoiding so there's a script

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
step avoiding so there's a script
version<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.020> well<00:01:58.229> where<00:01:59.219> it'll

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
version of this as well where it'll

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.069 
version of this as well where it'll
allow<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:01.189> move<00:02:02.189> towards<00:02:02.700> an<00:02:02.790> object

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
allow you to move towards an object

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.899 
allow you to move towards an object
whilst<00:02:04.079> dodging<00:02:05.040> objects<00:02:05.549> which<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
whilst dodging objects which is a

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.889 
whilst dodging objects which is a
pathfinding<00:02:06.829> function<00:02:07.829> okay<00:02:08.869> now<00:02:09.869> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
pathfinding function okay now that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.490 
pathfinding function okay now that
that's<00:02:10.110> basic<00:02:10.860> right<00:02:11.959> but<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:12.989> just<00:02:13.260> want<00:02:13.470> you

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
that's basic right but I just want you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.910 
that's basic right but I just want you
to<00:02:13.680> go

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
to go

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.510 
to go
to<00:02:14.069> understand<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:15.990> it's<00:02:16.170> not

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
to understand that it's it's it's not

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.660 
to understand that it's it's it's not
just<00:02:17.900> how<00:02:18.900> do<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.230> make<00:02:19.440> an<00:02:19.620> enemy<00:02:19.770> because

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
just how do I make an enemy because

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.030 
just how do I make an enemy because
there's<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.120> many<00:02:21.480> different<00:02:21.870> things<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.680> it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
there's so many different things and it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.130 
there's so many different things and it
really<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.520> totally<00:02:24.000> different<00:02:24.420> per<00:02:24.720> game

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
really is totally different per game

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.699 
really is totally different per game
it's<00:02:25.860> not<00:02:26.069> easy<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.700> make<00:02:26.880> an<00:02:27.000> enemy<00:02:27.500> okay<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
it's not easy to make an enemy okay and

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.170 
it's not easy to make an enemy okay and
this<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.280> not<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:29.520> something<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.060> just

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
this is not really something I can just

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.870 
this is not really something I can just
stick<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.510> tutorial<00:02:31.010> because<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.400> tutorial

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
stick in a tutorial because a tutorial

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.870 
stick in a tutorial because a tutorial
is<00:02:33.330> where<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.720> attempt<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.470> help<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.640> learn

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
is where I attempt to help you to learn

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.670 
is where I attempt to help you to learn
something<00:02:36.390> right<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.260> teaching

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
something right it's it's a teaching

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.640 
something right it's it's a teaching
thing<00:02:38.750> when<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.870> when<00:02:40.080> you're<00:02:40.200> asking<00:02:40.500> how<00:02:40.590> to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
thing when you when you're asking how to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.080 
thing when you when you're asking how to
make<00:02:40.800> an<00:02:40.890> enemy<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:41.310> more<00:02:41.610> like<00:02:41.850> you're

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
make an enemy it's more like you're

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.600 
make an enemy it's more like you're
asking<00:02:42.209> for<00:02:42.510> an<00:02:42.780> example<00:02:43.380> an<00:02:43.739> example<00:02:44.099> is<00:02:44.310> well

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
asking for an example an example is well

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.589 
asking for an example an example is well
it's<00:02:44.730> not<00:02:44.819> really<00:02:44.910> teaching<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.420> it's<00:02:45.540> just

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
it's not really teaching you it's just

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.750 
it's not really teaching you it's just
giving<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.410> edible<00:02:47.130> things<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.700> you

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
giving you the edible things that you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.180 
giving you the edible things that you
can<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.090> know<00:02:48.209> just<00:02:48.810> learn<00:02:49.440> yourself<00:02:49.620> and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
can you know just learn yourself and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.130 
can you know just learn yourself and
move<00:02:50.370> their<00:02:50.790> scripts<00:02:51.239> over<00:02:51.569> into<00:02:51.870> your<00:02:52.019> own

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
move their scripts over into your own

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.130 
move their scripts over into your own
game<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.190> I'm<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:53.549> putting<00:02:53.930> links<00:02:54.930> in

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
game so I'm going to be putting links in

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.759 
game so I'm going to be putting links in
the<00:02:55.260> description<00:02:55.709> below<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:57.769> different

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
the description below to different

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.039 
the description below to different
examples<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.340> I've<00:02:59.489> found<00:02:59.700> that<00:03:00.049> showcase

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
examples that I've found that showcase

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.440 
examples that I've found that showcase
AI<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.850> then<00:03:02.850> they're<00:03:03.030> going<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.209> be<00:03:03.299> at<00:03:03.420> a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
AI and then they're going to be at a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.059 
AI and then they're going to be at a
little<00:03:03.569> example<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.319> can<00:03:04.470> download<00:03:04.680> them

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
little example so you can download them

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.580 
little example so you can download them
you<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.459> see<00:03:05.700> their<00:03:06.030> code<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.230> can

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
you can see their code but I can

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.229 
you can see their code but I can
guarantee<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:08.010> it'll<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.549> different<00:03:08.850> code

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
guarantee you it'll be different code

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.990 
guarantee you it'll be different code
for<00:03:09.870> every<00:03:10.500> single<00:03:10.920> AI<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.730> it'll<00:03:11.910> be

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
for every single AI and it'll be

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.009 
for every single AI and it'll be
completely<00:03:12.180> different<00:03:12.870> ok<00:03:14.239> so<00:03:15.239> Eddie<00:03:15.660> go<00:03:15.840> down

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
completely different ok so Eddie go down

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.310 
completely different ok so Eddie go down
