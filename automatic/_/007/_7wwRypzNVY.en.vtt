00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.100
 do not 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.980
 today it is that without dark magician and today the 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.680
 others we have a doubt and we need that 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.150
 you answer us with the truth it's good 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.699
 what is it about 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.160
 lately you're kind of distracted and I think 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.710
 we know the reason and that has us 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.860
 all somewhat worried but what happens 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.590
 what do they want to know do you like the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.100
 I asshole the keeper wow but of what 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.230
 you're talking about why you say that because 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.989
 every time you look at it it looks like you're 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.079
 hypnotized none of that I do not know why 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.210
 are saying those things seriously and 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.030
 because you're always saying that you see 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.129
 well or what do you like how it looks to me 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.489
 that are signs that you feel something 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.350
 for him to hear they are misinterpreting 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.109
 they were just a few comments nothing more 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.709
 I was just being a little kind to him 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:01.429
 seriously it's all kind of sure that 

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:04.989
 is everything yes that's all right then no 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:08.049
 there's nothing else to do here 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.430
 but what's wrong they think I like it 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.950
 here but what nonsense or maybe not rays 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.880
 Now that I think about it, I do not know why I 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.549
 I'm attracted to the one who will be lightning not 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.560
 will tell us nothing and now what we do 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.229
 I am not convinced that we have 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.610
 told the true truth now of plan b 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.619
 plan b and what is the plan b easy use your 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.899
 spell to take the appearance of 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.890
 someone else and impersonate kieffer 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.380
 I already understand if the dark magician 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.560
 pretends to be keeper then we will know 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.659
 what does he really feel about everything 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.299
 what you have to do is act as 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.580
 if I tried to conquer csi and then 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.950
 she will reveal the truth to us I already understood 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.560
 if she feels uncomfortable is that she does not 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.560
 feel nothing for the asshole well I will 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.680
 here I go I wonder what it was all 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.110
 that from a while ago I hope nothing 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.000
 strange happen there are you yes I know I've 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.310
 been looking everywhere 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.430
 I've been good here all day 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.730

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.909

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.629
 with everything that has happened I never 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.819
 had given account of the law to lady that 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.159
 I had here I confess I like it 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.739
 to have you here and I hope we can be 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.890
 more than partners for it because I 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.810
 are you saying those things because 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.239
 I could keep it a secret for more 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.840

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.060

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.110
 most romantic atmosphere

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.750

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.579

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.700

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.349

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.290

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.350

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.570

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.160

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.160

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.879
 Holy shit that yuyo tournament was 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.949

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.129
 semifinals and all because I could not use 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.330

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.529
