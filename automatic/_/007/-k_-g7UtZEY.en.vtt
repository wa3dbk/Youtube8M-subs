what's a transmission well you have a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.250 
what's a transmission well you have a
choice<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.699> two<00:01:02.760> transmissions<00:01:03.600> net<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.019> comes

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
choice of two transmissions net it comes

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.859 
choice of two transmissions net it comes
with<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> five-speed<00:01:05.430> manual<00:01:05.880> transmission<00:01:05.909> or

with a five-speed manual transmission or

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.469 
with a five-speed manual transmission or
you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.220> 5-speed<00:01:08.760> automatic<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
you can get a 5-speed automatic and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.030 
you can get a 5-speed automatic and
interesting<00:01:09.900> thing<00:01:10.049> about<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.470> automatic

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
interesting thing about the automatic

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.070 
interesting thing about the automatic
transmission<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.479> actually<00:01:12.659> an

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
transmission is that it's actually an

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.050 
transmission is that it's actually an
intelligent<00:01:13.770> transmission<00:01:14.430> there's<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.760> shift

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
intelligent transmission there's a shift

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.410 
intelligent transmission there's a shift
logic<00:01:15.900> pattern<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.430> shift<00:01:17.700> points<00:01:17.790> will

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
logic pattern so the shift points will

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.179 
logic pattern so the shift points will
be<00:01:18.570> adjusted<00:01:19.080> by<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.290> car<00:01:19.650> automatically

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
be adjusted by the car automatically

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.460 
be adjusted by the car automatically
depending<00:01:20.670> upon<00:01:20.759> your<00:01:21.330> individual<00:01:22.170> driving

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
depending upon your individual driving

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.830 
depending upon your individual driving
characteristic<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.490> call<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> thinks<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.420> me

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
characteristic so call it thinks for me

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.450 
characteristic so call it thinks for me
so<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> don't<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.710> much<00:01:25.979> thinking<00:01:26.369> I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
so I don't have to do so much thinking I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.429 
so I don't have to do so much thinking I
like<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.880> something<00:01:27.420> else<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:27.960> vehicle

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
like that something else in this vehicle

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
like that something else in this vehicle
which<00:01:28.680> Toyota<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.189> famous<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.729> its<00:01:29.939> its

funny at first but actually it allows

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.650 
funny at first but actually it allows
the<00:03:24.169> rain<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.769> sheet<00:03:25.190> off<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:26.060> window<00:03:26.389> so<00:03:26.630> you

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
the rain to sheet off the window so you

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.449 
the rain to sheet off the window so you
have<00:03:26.959> less<00:03:27.200> need<00:03:27.380> for<00:03:27.440> wipers<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.160> of<00:03:28.250> course

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
have less need for wipers and of course

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.400 
have less need for wipers and of course
you<00:03:28.849> don't<00:03:29.030> have<00:03:29.150> wipers<00:03:29.510> on<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.660> side<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.260> it

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
you don't have wipers on the side so it

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.099 
you don't have wipers on the side so it
aged<00:03:31.329> visibility<00:03:32.329> now<00:03:32.599> if<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.840> or<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.019> were
