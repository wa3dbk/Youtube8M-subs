00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.309
 to do the test we will use the 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.540
 multimeter and let's see if there is 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:24.320
 continuity in what is number one and 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.780
 with earth this number one we have it 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.990
 to connect to earth to know if 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:34.730
 there is continuity and I think there is no 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.680
 way to try it here from here this 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.309
 electrode we would have to connect it in 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.970
 the number one and the other tip the 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.000
 we would have to connect with earth to 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.030
 know if there is continuity but 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.670
 in the cable does not arrive 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.010
 out to be able to do it so 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.290
 I'll show you what it has to be in 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.390
 any store where they sell parts 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.670
 for cars costs about three 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.309
 dollars out there remember that this is the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.530
 cable that is connected to the motor and 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.160
 This is the land so I will 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.160
 connect here 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.260
 Now once it's in, we're going to 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.810
 connect the other end 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.990
 with what is the electrode of 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.680
 multimeter I'm going to put it here in what 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.680
 is number one 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.430
 now once I have placed it in the 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.100
 number 1 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.290
 I'm going to connect the other end with the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.050
 cable and let's see if there is 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.630
 continuity 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.090
 and you're going to hear the sound this sound 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.660
 is telling us that there is 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 continuity the number one with earth 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.840
 this would be indicating us also 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.800
 Canada exists in no short circuit 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.390
 in what is the internal connection now 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.540
 once we have proven that there is 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.720
 continuity in what is number one 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.119
 of slot number 1 where it connects to 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.220
 volleyball with earth and that exists 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.800
 continuity let's continue with the test 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.160
 Now what we have to do is put 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.310
 the key and we're going to put it in the number 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.310
 two 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:26.819
 now once we have put the key 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.780
 we also need to have what is this 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.510
 the switch of the emergency lights 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.939
 We need to have it off, not have it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.650
 turned on but off 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.969
 Now once we have ensured 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.239
 which is off let's check if 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:48.120
 there is voltage at number 3 with earth 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.000
 and what we have to determine now is 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:57.060
 if there is voltage in what is the number 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.239
 3 with earth the 1 is negative and that of the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.889
 right is the positive so that 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.829
 would be number 3 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:07.650
 let's test if there is voltage in the 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.930
 number 3 and land for how are we going to 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.699
 test if there is voltage we are going to 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.939
 always use what the 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:16.500
 multimeter but we are going to put it here in 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.540
 what it is 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.450
 in the latter 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.909
 let's insert what black is what 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.430
 let's insert here we are going to insert what 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:29.400
 is at number 1 I'm going to connect the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.980
 electrode black color which is the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.099
 negative I'll connect it in the slot 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.200
 number 1 which is the negative too and the 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:42.329
 red I'll connect it at number 3 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:46.319
 that would be the positive and here you can see 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:50.609
 clearly there is voltage and you can 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.650
 see that there is voltage on December 19 so 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.019
 with this we are proving that there is no 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.239
 no short circuit in the connection 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.269
 internal and that everything is working 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.970
 correctly now once we have 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.400
 proven that there is voltage we are going to take out 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.150
 the key 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.409
 and we 're going to turn it off and now we're going to 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.989
 purl 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:14.629
 now let's turn on the switch of the 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.669
 emergency lights and let's see what 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.769
 happens again I will do the test 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.360
 I'm going to connect the red wires and the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:27.500
 black in 1 and in 3 and I'm going to review 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:30.010
 if there is voltage I will connect it 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.010
 Y 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:39.920
 you can clearly see that there is 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:44.000
 voltage of 12 66 this would indicate us that 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:47.240
 there is no short circuit too 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.550
 in what is the internal system and that 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.560
 everything is working correctly 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.230
 remember that this test is done with the 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.050
 key outside with the ignition switch 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.750
 off and with the lights switch 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:05.090
 Emergency on and everything has gone 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.090
 well and we will continue with the test
