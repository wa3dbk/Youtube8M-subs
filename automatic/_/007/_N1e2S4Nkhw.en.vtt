00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hi, how am I, my name is nothing and I'm going 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.040
 to say what it is that breakfast all 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.920
 days to have energy and maintain the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.769
 body with fullness let's see one thing 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.719
 first I'll do it and then I'll go 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.500
 to explain seeing what it contains first 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.990
 We drink water 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:26.290
 water within trolley we will place 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.050
 now the protein shakes and 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.900
 nutrients of herbalife valencia is 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.020
 a company that is already in 90 countries I 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.110
 I take it since I played basketball 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.000
 so I do not want to recommend everything 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.739
 for the people who are in the 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.410
 personal health care that 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.559
 practice the administration they do 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.440
 exercise that make your body a 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:55.020
 temple then we have a party of 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.489
 protein that we're going to place an excuse 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.760
 This is vanilla flavor but also 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.239
 of 12 flavors and we will take cookies 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.990
 and green cookies with cream and let's 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.920
 place two caps for the protein 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.100
 and the carbohydrate and the nutrients 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.880
 It vibrates exactly that the body needs 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.280
 do not have in this shake and now we're going to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.729
 see things first let's put it to 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.970
 liquefy very easy we put it speed 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.409
 minimum that will make you have 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.890
 consistency we keep there 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.740
 and let's go in what it says to liquefy 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.760
 once we have in liquified we are going 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.240
 to add a little bit of iron then 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.260
 the body before absorbing the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.200
 nutrients that we need 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.750
 otherwise I have lived in Spain 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.640
 lived several countries was born in 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.690
 Argentina people have a bad 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.360
 custom seeing that it makes like a coffee 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.090
 with milk you eat a toast with 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.420
 butter and disease there have nothing 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.100
 of protein there you have what the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.530
 body needs the fuel that 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.320
 you need in the most important food that 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.540
 It is the breakfast to later perform the 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.700
 works and the tasks that he will do 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.000
 we have the necessary nutrients in 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.700
 Spain they eat bread with oil and with 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.550
 tomato and anchovies in the morning 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.460
 some have even the audacity 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.790
 to put a beer in the morning or 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.690
 a coffee with white sugar what that goes 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.910
 to generate day after day a deterioration in 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.520
 your cells and we will have a 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.550
 cell rejuvenation if there will not be a 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.630
 oxidation on your cell phone that will generate 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.790
 that the body 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:58.740
 then the second step after 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:02.540
 to have put it on him once I sent you 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.540
 I do not beat it a little more 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.870
 we do not have the same shake 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.739
 special I like the weight look 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.450
 what aim and now let's go take 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.209
 with the saplings because we have to 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.709

 body energy vitality power 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.840
 creativity because the cells defend 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.269
 our whole body depends on the 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.790
 cells this is cellular nutrition of 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.180
 advance the balance is a company that 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.180
 is in 90 countries is since 35 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.120
 years and fundamentally all 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.910
 components that they have are natural 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.349
 natural means that this amounts to 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.230
 the eggs with an apple with nuts and 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.660
 with the right fiber you are not going to 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.530
 grab the eggs the nuts the apple 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.530
 all the time 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.780
 feed yourself correctly not at all 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.340

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.560
 is very aware of the 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.750

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.510
 it took me a while to make this smoothie by mouth 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.050
 and this is not true then by certain 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.050
 moments 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.819
