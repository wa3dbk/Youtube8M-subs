 works tell about odyssey about 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.770
 temptations and enemies who met 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.989
 he is on his way 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.280
 this is a reflection of what we are experiencing 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.320
 modern society 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.890
 we have no hope to meet 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.390
 hero we lost that hope

 other quite sharp meet and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.799
 exalted is one of the poorest 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.259
 areas of athens place where the effects of measures 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.210
 austerity are most obvious this 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.430
 street artist offered his version 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.290
 prayers for the city and the country that can 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.439
 get out of the crisis and get on the road 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.600
 economic recovery is very long 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.850
 way according to the blip co he returned to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.770
 Athens from Britain in the midst of a crisis to 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.770
 leave your messages on the walls of the city 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.970
 information that people get from the media 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.829
 nothing more than the propaganda of the authorities on 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.909
 in fact we are not given a chance to find out 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.100
 other opinions 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.189
 and art makes it possible here 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 why am I doing this in the works of blip 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.909
 there are almost no references 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.280
 ancient greek history its mythology 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.280
 topics are austerity and its consequences 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.170
 Today, the main thing is money, I do not mind 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.399
 rich people but they don’t have to be 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.440
 so rich 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.000
 they might have less money 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.170
 so that others have the opportunity 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.400
 live better 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.590
 the very address life fucked psyche happy 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.310
 that besides street art they have 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.560
 Job 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.540
 but like many other Greeks they have 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.120
 have friends and relatives who are not 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.610
 lucky and yet they believe that their country 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.069
 reborn however the change according to their words 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.930
 must come from the people but for now 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.870
 artists continue to leave their 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.260
 appeals on the walls of matt cut rt 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.260
