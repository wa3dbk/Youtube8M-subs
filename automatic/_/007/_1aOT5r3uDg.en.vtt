00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.289
 dribbling the servers helps and has four 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.750
 cereal search options are the options 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.500
 more important that I will soon 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.760
 tell her about each one here my page 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.409
 search and server configuration 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.049
 how to configure the server 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.560
 first no host name that is 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.880
 creating the match 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.000
 the clue 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.680
 the meeting that they meet is 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.360
 exists in four sessions of the book to 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.509
 you can enter the listing of 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.509
 servers ask to practice which is 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.939
 35 qualification 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.350
 remembering that the galley that both the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.180
 assignment of 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.579
 qualification each one takes around 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.649
 10 minutes each 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.049
 the session will depend on the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.180
 number back to the tables and a car 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.759
 available for each session or 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.640
 on this server only has the abarth formula 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.159
 on the server below you have the mclaren and 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.100
 bmw and this will win from server to 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.380
 server 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.920
 the number of players not in the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.890
 starting and she thinks the servers are 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.900
 Which I recommend even you can be me 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.390
 a quick game because it really 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.010
 you are to do are whole accepted coast 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.709
 it will take a long time 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.630
 many times you just come from practicing and 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.420
 qualification are already 20 minutes and 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.209
 count on another 10 or 20 minutes of 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.069
 ie more than 30 minutes 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.900
 run you do not care you can 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:40.230
 to do also understood 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:43.989
 it is in them that show all the option that has 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.640
 track of players' stage 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:51.010
 the car you can select beauty 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.489
 understood by the options I said to 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.480
 you are the four search options here 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.430
 of servers 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.310
 the first option includes more 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.080
 empty and are starting to get into a 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.790
 book 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.860
 the second option includes all 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.769
 server listings I do not recommend 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.840
 dictated option enabled by what it does 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.670
 search servers have blocking 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.220
 often only a few servers 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.769
 Italian or European staff can 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.530
 being really not recommending 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.780
 of the key the activators servers 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.380
 locked only if you have access to a 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.750
 rost server that you already have the password for 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.739
 you can play with the staff is 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.590
 making the game and the last session he 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.140
 shows the options are initializing 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.680
 then leading the crew to leave first and 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.790
 last option enabled give an updated 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.160
 here it will take a while until it showed 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.930
 servers that are now beginning the 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.560
 latencies they are a bit high 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.420
 yes but until 270 is judged you will not 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.980
 have problems often 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.030
 pressure on neighbor or other but is well 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:09.100
 rare even up to 270 you will get 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.720
 here apply the server to show mode 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.449
 first the time that is missing 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.270
 here the game is sinking the time that the 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:17.640
 staff takes local power 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.690
 nook you will simply click here 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.270
 an option that requires nozzle and goes 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.280
 appear here remembering that you always 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.740
 have to select the car that is already 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.590
 here just do not need to link the O there 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.170
 car selection not you can already come 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.990
 here select the car and request 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.900
 book and the smaller one you find 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.110
 two options that the option to cancel the 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.200
 booking.com you enter into another game 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.020
 and the option to refresh the list of players 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.850
 and will update the history of all 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:56.790
 players who will be playing here 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.270
 adds the session that you have chosen the 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.040
 server name track type car 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.310
 be used and the time will 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.750
 start finishing this count is ideal 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.760
 You come here. 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.150
 refresh players and click on jewelry 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.640
 can be as much here as those that 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.080
 option also the option to cancel the 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.460
 I'm leaving for school 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.010
 we're going to stay here john we did not have 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.450
 No problem, that 's how it works. 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.550
 staff had a lot of trouble should have a 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.650
 some friends and prevent making a video 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.440
 they are not understanding layout not 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.390
 I'm understanding how matches work. 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.620
 power multiplayer have so much 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.420
 big difficulty 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.950
 and when are you going to play with a friend? 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.600
 configure help was set to the same 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.280
 so this is for you get a 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.210
 server and can enter 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.520
 together because the server in question 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.950
 seconds less than one minute and 30 seconds 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:01.919
 seconds , he already lota maintenance and up 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:03.810
 even in case here you had a problem you 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.610
 It was not disabled but I'll do it again. 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.500
 no problem 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:13.610
 the same way there update and go fetch 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.610
 the empty servers 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.110
 select one of the cars I want 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:32.390
 and wait for the time count or click 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.400
 in one case he is asking for a little 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:39.500
 more time because there are no 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:42.370
 people there have to wait even if 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.370
 two more players appear 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.040
 I'll try jewelry 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.260
 I'll wait, time can happen. 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.110
 even often happens you do not 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.820
 takes sides but sometimes happens 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.740
 or had a server problem and 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.870
 I need to play again and only you 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:05.680
 the same procedure in cinema at the beginning 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:10.370
 of the video and I will show this world - 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:13.850
 how much time is left to count 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:18.040
 time running start taxis time to 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:22.330
 bridge makes the setap fast or active it 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.330
 lippi and the guard
