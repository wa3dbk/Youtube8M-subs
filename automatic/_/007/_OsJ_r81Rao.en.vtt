can I can wait to kill and it should be
I<00:02:16.640> believe<00:02:16.760> at<00:02:17.090> 20,000<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.080> think<00:02:18.320> something

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
I believe at 20,000 I think something

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.300 
I believe at 20,000 I think something
like<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.460> change<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.990> lower<00:02:21.920> or

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
like that change it to a lower or

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.930 
like that change it to a lower or
whatever<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.090> want<00:02:23.270> but<00:02:24.050> mine's<00:02:24.590> only

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
whatever you want but mine's only

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.080 
whatever you want but mine's only
150,000<00:02:25.940> but<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.950> 15,000<00:02:27.950> actually<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.400> still

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
150,000 but on 15,000 actually I still

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.790 
150,000 but on 15,000 actually I still
need<00:02:29.210> to<00:02:29.300> make<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.510> lower<00:02:29.720> i<00:02:30.020> recommend

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
need to make that lower i recommend

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.610 
need to make that lower i recommend
nothing<00:02:31.310> lower<00:02:31.460> than<00:02:31.550> 500<00:02:32.300> so<00:02:32.540> maybe<00:02:33.380> the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
nothing lower than 500 so maybe the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.380 
nothing lower than 500 so maybe the
thousands<00:02:34.040> maybe<00:02:34.190> 10,000<00:02:34.910> would<00:02:35.000> be<00:02:35.150> fine

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
thousands maybe 10,000 would be fine

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.800 
thousands maybe 10,000 would be fine
that<00:02:35.960> is<00:02:36.140> how<00:02:36.410> how<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.130> waits<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.550> kill<00:02:37.810> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
that is how how it waits to kill the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.570 
that is how how it waits to kill the
service<00:02:39.230> packs<00:02:39.560> when<00:02:39.800> in<00:02:39.920> restarting<00:02:40.220> now

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
service packs when in restarting now

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.950 
service packs when in restarting now
because<00:02:40.910> Windows<00:02:41.210> takes<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.510> long<00:02:41.690> time<00:02:41.720> to

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
because Windows takes a long time to

because Windows takes a long time to
restart<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:43.790> know<00:02:43.940> it's<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.660> way<00:02:44.810> to

it's<00:02:52.490> like<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.850> know<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.500> turns<00:02:54.500> up<00:02:54.650> all

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
it's like you know it's turns up all

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.990 
it's like you know it's turns up all

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
stays so it takes forever so here you

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.030 
stays so it takes forever so here you
can<00:02:58.400> make<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.910> change<00:02:59.630> that<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.050> then<00:03:00.860> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
can make that change that and then the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.250 
can make that change that and then the

change<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.450> decimal<00:03:42.020> and<00:03:42.230> it's<00:03:42.709> that<00:03:42.860> I

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
change it to decimal and it's that I

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.600 
change it to decimal and it's that I
believe<00:03:44.900> it's<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.850> 44th<00:03:46.850> originally<00:03:48.550> 48,000<00:03:49.550> or

believe it's a 44th originally 48,000 or
something<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.000> just<00:03:50.270> change<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.050> to<00:03:51.170> 4,000

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
something that just change it to 4,000

something that just change it to 4,000
make<00:03:51.950> sure<00:03:52.100> in<00:03:52.250> decimal<00:03:52.640> just<00:03:52.820> said<00:03:52.910> okay<00:03:53.150> and

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
make sure in decimal just said okay and

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.930
