for<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> many<00:02:01.979> other<00:02:02.189> things<00:02:02.540> but<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.600> guess<00:02:03.899> now

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
for a many other things but I guess now

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.569 
for a many other things but I guess now
I'll<00:02:04.259> go<00:02:04.380> ahead<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.560> wait<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:05.040> these<00:02:05.159> cards

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
that wave know that profiles so I guess

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.330 
that wave know that profiles so I guess
we'll<00:02:10.080> push<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.379> back<00:02:10.590> until<00:02:11.009> hopefully

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.140 
want to test this card up for I say too
much<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.100> but<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.640> could<00:02:59.820> really<00:02:59.970> come<00:03:00.120> in

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
much on it but it could really come in

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.060 
much on it but it could really come in
handy<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.600> course<00:03:00.780> given<00:03:01.110> what<00:03:01.620> your<00:03:01.739> monsters

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
handy of course given what your monsters

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.280 
handy of course given what your monsters
and<00:03:02.340> attack<00:03:02.580> moose<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:03.720> also<00:03:03.870> making<00:03:04.140> it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
and attack moose and then also making it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.540 
and attack moose and then also making it
were<00:03:04.380> there<00:03:04.530> infected<00:03:04.860> by<00:03:04.950> effects<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.400> that's

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
were there infected by effects so that's

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.850 
were there infected by effects so that's
not<00:03:05.640> bad<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.120> but<00:03:06.840> i<00:03:06.870> guess<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.380> downside<00:03:07.739> is

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
not bad and but i guess the downside is

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.650 
not bad and but i guess the downside is
if<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.040> control<00:03:08.280> non<00:03:08.489> tell<00:03:08.700> Emma<00:03:08.880> tell<00:03:09.630> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
if you control non tell Emma tell a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.050 
if you control non tell Emma tell a
night<00:03:09.870> monster<00:03:10.320> then<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.040> used<00:03:11.459> dry<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.760> card

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
night monster then I used dry this card

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.390 
night monster then I used dry this card
but<00:03:12.410> yeah<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.440> mean<00:03:13.560> more<00:03:13.890> likely<00:03:14.250> you're<00:03:14.340> gonna

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
but yeah I mean more likely you're gonna

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.130 
but yeah I mean more likely you're gonna
have<00:03:14.610> tell<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.850> night<00:03:15.420> monsters<00:03:15.840> anyway

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
have tell the night monsters anyway

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.750 
have tell the night monsters anyway
especially<00:03:16.980> since<00:03:17.040> we're<00:03:17.250> getting<00:03:17.430> more<00:03:17.580> of

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
especially since we're getting more of

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.800 
especially since we're getting more of
them<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.060> was<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> little<00:03:18.269> bit<00:03:18.390> more<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.660> pain

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
them it was a little bit more of a pain

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.240 
them it was a little bit more of a pain
back<00:03:19.019> then<00:03:19.170> because<00:03:19.230> there's<00:03:19.470> only<00:03:19.650> like<00:03:19.890> I

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250
