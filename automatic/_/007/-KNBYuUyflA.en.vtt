hi<00:00:02.159> my<00:00:02.370> name<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.760> but<00:00:02.970> I'm<00:00:03.060> going<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.330> show

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hi my name is a but I'm going to show

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.930 
hi my name is a but I'm going to show
you<00:00:03.540> how<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.870> draw<00:00:04.200> f<00:00:04.410> dash<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.890> x<00:00:05.009> from<00:00:05.580> graph

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
you how to draw f dash of x from graph

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.360 
you how to draw f dash of x from graph
of<00:00:06.180> f<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.690> X<00:00:06.899> so<00:00:07.680> essentially<00:00:08.130> what<00:00:08.220> we're

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
of f of X so essentially what we're

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.900 
of f of X so essentially what we're
doing<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.940> pretty<00:00:09.300> simple<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.950> graph<00:00:11.700> of

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
doing is pretty simple it's a graph of

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.480 
doing is pretty simple it's a graph of
the<00:00:12.090> gradient<00:00:12.389> function<00:00:13.160> from<00:00:14.160> whatever

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the gradient function from whatever

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.609 
the gradient function from whatever
function<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.059> have<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.990> I'm<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.230> gonna<00:00:16.350> draw

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
function you have so I'm just gonna draw

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.750 
function you have so I'm just gonna draw
some<00:00:16.890> f<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.850> X<00:00:18.000> all<00:00:18.539> right<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.609> it's<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.699> to

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
some f of X all right and it's going to

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.880 
some f of X all right and it's going to
look<00:00:20.880> like<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.720> my<00:00:21.900> f<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.109> X<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
look like this so my f of X is going to

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.660 
look like this so my f of X is going to
look<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:27.949> that

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.870 

there<00:00:32.270> we<00:00:32.360> go<00:00:32.590> that's<00:00:33.590> f<00:00:33.830> of<00:00:33.950> X<00:00:34.100> okay<00:00:34.400> some

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
there we go that's f of X okay some

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.030 
there we go that's f of X okay some
random<00:00:35.120> shape<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:35.810> I'm<00:00:36.620> going<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:36.860> walk<00:00:37.010> you

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
random shape and I'm going to walk you

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.920 
random shape and I'm going to walk you
through<00:00:37.220> how<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:39.520> find<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:41.390> graph<00:00:41.630> of<00:00:41.780> the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
through how to find the graph of the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.090 
through how to find the graph of the
gradient<00:00:42.140> function<00:00:42.410> or<00:00:42.800> f<00:00:43.160> dash<00:00:43.430> of<00:00:43.640> x<00:00:43.760> so

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
gradient function or f dash of x so

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.070 
gradient function or f dash of x so
three<00:00:46.100> simple<00:00:46.670> steps<00:00:46.730> three<00:00:47.690> very<00:00:47.840> simple

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
three simple steps three very simple

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.900 
three simple steps three very simple
steps<00:00:48.500> have<00:00:48.920> you<00:00:49.040> doing<00:00:49.309> this<00:00:49.400> in<00:00:49.580> no<00:00:49.699> time

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
steps have you doing this in no time

00:00:49.910 --> 00:01:00.250 
steps have you doing this in no time
first<00:00:50.840> thing<00:00:52.030> identify<00:00:54.940> stationary<00:00:55.940> points

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.370 

on<00:01:01.059> f<00:01:02.059> of<00:01:02.359> X<00:01:03.640> simple<00:01:04.640> okay<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:05.900> let's<00:01:06.049> find<00:01:06.290> the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
on f of X simple okay so let's find the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.050 
on f of X simple okay so let's find the
stationary<00:01:06.830> point<00:01:06.890> record<00:01:07.400> that<00:01:07.640> stationary

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
stationary point record that stationary

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.889 
stationary point record that stationary
points<00:01:08.479> are<00:01:08.570> simply<00:01:08.960> where<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.009> gradient<00:01:10.490> of

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
points are simply where the gradient of

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:19.380 
points are simply where the gradient of
f<00:01:11.899> of<00:01:12.020> X<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.409> zero<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:15.880> you'll<00:01:16.880> know<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.860> right

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
f of X is zero so you'll know that right

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:28.180 
f of X is zero so you'll know that right
here<00:01:20.920> there<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.570> minimum<00:01:24.460> right<00:01:25.570> here<00:01:27.190> there

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
here there is a minimum right here there

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.080 
here there is a minimum right here there
is<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.369> maximum<00:01:28.580> and<00:01:30.490> right<00:01:31.490> about<00:01:31.670> here

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
is a maximum and right about here

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.460 
is a maximum and right about here
there's<00:01:32.330> a<00:01:32.420> stationary<00:01:32.960> point<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.350> inflection

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
there's a stationary point of inflection

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.029 
there's a stationary point of inflection
so<00:01:34.069> we<00:01:34.159> have<00:01:34.310> three<00:01:34.990> stationary<00:01:35.990> points<00:01:36.409> on<00:01:36.530> f

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
so we have three stationary points on f

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.880 
so we have three stationary points on f
of<00:01:37.399> X<00:01:37.789> right<00:01:38.770> easy<00:01:40.840> okay<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.229> first<00:01:42.440> thing<00:01:42.619> I'm

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
of X right easy okay the first thing I'm

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.660 
of X right easy okay the first thing I'm
going<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.159> do<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:45.399> link<00:01:46.399> this<00:01:46.670> line<00:01:46.940> down<00:01:48.039> so<00:01:49.039> so

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
going to do is link this line down so so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.219 
going to do is link this line down so so
I'm<00:01:49.729> going<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:49.909> draw<00:01:50.119> f<00:01:50.270> dash<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.690> x<00:01:50.810> right

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
I'm going to draw f dash of x right

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.940 
I'm going to draw f dash of x right
beneath<00:01:51.709> f<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.369> X<00:01:52.569> so<00:01:53.569> we<00:01:54.049> sort<00:01:54.440> of<00:01:54.530> trace<00:01:54.770> this

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
beneath f of X so we sort of trace this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.050 
beneath f of X so we sort of trace this
line<00:01:55.009> down<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:56.619> we<00:01:57.619> say<00:01:57.860> because<00:01:58.340> these

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
line down and we say because these

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.630 
line down and we say because these
points<00:01:59.690> are<00:01:59.950> stationary<00:02:00.950> points<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.490> means

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
points are stationary points that means

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.940 
points are stationary points that means
the<00:02:01.729> gradient<00:02:02.179> is<00:02:02.270> 0<00:02:02.299> right<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.560> since<00:02:03.770> we're

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
the gradient is 0 right so since we're

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.830 
the gradient is 0 right so since we're
drawing<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.310> gradient<00:02:04.670> function<00:02:04.849> you<00:02:05.660> know

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
drawing the gradient function you know

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.070 
drawing the gradient function you know
that<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.259> gradient<00:02:06.440> function<00:02:06.709> will<00:02:06.979> be<00:02:07.069> 0<00:02:07.369> at

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
that the gradient function will be 0 at

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.410 
that the gradient function will be 0 at
this<00:02:09.080> point<00:02:09.580> it<00:02:10.580> will<00:02:10.700> be<00:02:10.819> 0<00:02:10.930> at<00:02:13.030> its<00:02:14.030> point<00:02:14.360> of

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
this point it will be 0 at its point of

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.420 
this point it will be 0 at its point of
inflection<00:02:14.599> and<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:16.310> will<00:02:16.430> also<00:02:17.319> be<00:02:18.319> 0<00:02:18.650> at<00:02:19.390> this

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
inflection and it will also be 0 at this

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.750 
inflection and it will also be 0 at this
maximum<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:23.360> makes<00:02:23.599> sense<00:02:23.840> doesn't<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.760> so

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
maximum that makes sense doesn't it so

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.140 
maximum that makes sense doesn't it so
basically<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.400> basically<00:02:28.430> where<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
basically so basically where the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.680 
basically so basically where the
gradient<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.780> 0<00:02:29.810> f<00:02:30.560> dash<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.700> x<00:02:31.819> should<00:02:32.180> equal<00:02:32.450> 0

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
gradient is 0 f dash of x should equal 0

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.290 
gradient is 0 f dash of x should equal 0
ok<00:02:33.379> cool<00:02:33.769> so<00:02:34.040> that's<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.310> first<00:02:34.459> part<00:02:34.730> pretty

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
ok cool so that's the first part pretty

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.250 
ok cool so that's the first part pretty
simple<00:02:36.849> second<00:02:37.849> point

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.070 

find<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.129> regions

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.290 

on<00:02:46.940> f<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.150> X<00:02:48.950> with<00:02:50.990> positive<00:02:51.990> or<00:02:52.280> negative

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
on f of X with positive or negative

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.550 
on f of X with positive or negative
gradient<00:02:55.550> so<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:57.420> want<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.630> cut<00:02:57.840> up<00:02:57.960> your<00:02:58.170> f<00:02:58.440> of

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
gradient so you want to cut up your f of

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.510 
gradient so you want to cut up your f of
X<00:02:58.850> into<00:02:59.850> different<00:03:00.570> slots<00:03:01.470> different<00:03:02.160> parts

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
X into different slots different parts

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.370 
X into different slots different parts
and<00:03:02.790> each<00:03:03.480> part<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.900> going<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.080> either<00:03:04.170> have

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
and each part is going to either have

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.960 
and each part is going to either have
positive<00:03:04.800> gradient<00:03:05.040> or<00:03:05.340> negative<00:03:05.820> gradient

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
positive gradient or negative gradient

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.030 
positive gradient or negative gradient
right<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.410> let's<00:03:07.590> start<00:03:07.860> from<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.730> very<00:03:08.820> left

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
right so let's start from the very left

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.910 
right so let's start from the very left
firstly<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:12.000> part<00:03:12.320> what<00:03:13.320> does<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.500> have<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
firstly this part what does it have the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.710 
firstly this part what does it have the
gradient<00:03:14.700> there<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.090> see<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.510> lines

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
gradient there you see that the lines

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.260 
gradient there you see that the lines
pointing<00:03:16.520> downwards<00:03:17.520> if<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.820> go<00:03:17.910> from<00:03:18.030> left

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
pointing downwards if you go from left

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.360 
pointing downwards if you go from left
to<00:03:18.390> right<00:03:18.710> so<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:20.130> gradient<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.610> negative<00:03:22.370> so

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
to right so the gradient is negative so

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.990 
to right so the gradient is negative so
you<00:03:23.430> can<00:03:23.610> say<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.190> section<00:03:26.640> here<00:03:26.880> is

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
you can say that this section here is

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000 
you can say that this section here is
negative<00:03:28.850> moving<00:03:29.850> across<00:03:31.850> this<00:03:32.850> section<00:03:33.300> here

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
negative moving across this section here

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.380 
negative moving across this section here
if<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.100> go<00:03:35.250> from<00:03:35.490> left<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.820> right<00:03:35.910> you'll<00:03:36.209> see

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
if you go from left to right you'll see

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.860 
if you go from left to right you'll see
that<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.600> goes<00:03:36.750> up<00:03:37.220> right<00:03:38.420> this<00:03:39.420> section<00:03:39.810> is

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
that it goes up right this section is

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.670 
that it goes up right this section is
positive<00:03:40.820> notice<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:41.940> you're<00:03:42.060> pretty<00:03:42.600> much

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
positive notice that you're pretty much

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.130 
positive notice that you're pretty much
dividing<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.830> line<00:03:44.090> according<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.360> the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
dividing the line according to the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.500 
dividing the line according to the
stationary<00:03:46.620> points<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.130> we<00:03:47.220> have<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:48.240> this

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
stationary points that we have so this

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.530 
stationary points that we have so this
graph<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.810> going<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.110> have<00:03:49.200> four<00:03:49.440> sections<00:03:50.540> so

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
graph is going to have four sections so

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.890 
graph is going to have four sections so
this<00:03:52.350> section<00:03:52.890> is<00:03:53.010> positive<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:54.600> I'll<00:03:54.660> mark

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
this section is positive so I'll mark

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.979 
this section is positive so I'll mark
that<00:03:55.250> positive<00:03:56.330> now<00:03:57.330> what<00:03:57.480> about<00:03:57.570> this<00:03:57.780> third

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
that positive now what about this third

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.090 
that positive now what about this third
section<00:03:59.930> positive<00:04:00.930> again<00:04:01.170> isn't<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.470> because

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
section positive again isn't it because

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.320 
section positive again isn't it because
you<00:04:02.220> have<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.370> point<00:04:02.580> of<00:04:02.700> inflection<00:04:04.820> so<00:04:05.820> again

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
you have a point of inflection so again

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.030 
you have a point of inflection so again
mark<00:04:06.989> this<00:04:07.140> line<00:04:07.380> positive<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:08.239> finally<00:04:09.239> I

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
mark this line positive and finally I

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.350 
mark this line positive and finally I
meant<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.160> rub<00:04:11.310> out<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.640> red<00:04:11.880> green<00:04:12.120> thing

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
meant to rub out that red green thing

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.520 
meant to rub out that red green thing
but<00:04:12.870> that's<00:04:13.110> okay<00:04:13.489> finally<00:04:14.489> um<00:04:15.290> this<00:04:16.290> last

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
but that's okay finally um this last

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.370 
but that's okay finally um this last
section<00:04:16.769> here<00:04:18.470> this<00:04:19.470> last<00:04:19.709> section<00:04:21.380> the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
section here this last section the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.650 
section here this last section the
gradient<00:04:22.830> is<00:04:22.950> negative<00:04:23.850> right<00:04:24.210> because<00:04:24.540> it

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
gradient is negative right because it

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.070 
gradient is negative right because it
goes<00:04:24.810> downwards<00:04:25.320> from<00:04:25.530> left<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.070> right<00:04:26.160> so

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
goes downwards from left to right so

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.030 
goes downwards from left to right so
this<00:04:28.080> last<00:04:28.410> part<00:04:28.650> is<00:04:28.890> negative<00:04:29.310> okay<00:04:30.300> easy<00:04:31.669> so

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
this last part is negative okay easy so

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.790 
this last part is negative okay easy so
that's<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.190> second<00:04:35.520> step<00:04:35.729> out<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.510> way

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
that's the second step out of the way

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.040 
that's the second step out of the way
the<00:04:38.370> last<00:04:38.580> step<00:04:38.849> is<00:04:39.030> really<00:04:39.300> putting<00:04:39.720> all<00:04:39.990> of

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
the last step is really putting all of

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.240 
the last step is really putting all of
our<00:04:40.409> information<00:04:40.800> together<00:04:43.310> so<00:04:44.310> basically

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
our information together so basically

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:56.719 
our information together so basically
draw<00:04:47.300> line<00:04:48.530> that<00:04:50.060> fits<00:04:53.599> the<00:04:54.599> region's<00:04:55.729> the

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
draw line that fits the region's the

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:03.290 
draw line that fits the region's the
positive<00:04:57.330> or<00:04:57.509> negative<00:04:57.870> regions

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.159 

and

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
and

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.800 
and
goes<00:05:05.830> through<00:05:08.099> our<00:05:09.099> stationary<00:05:09.849> points<00:05:10.240> so

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
goes through our stationary points so

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:18.839 
goes through our stationary points so
we're<00:05:11.080> f<00:05:11.699> dash<00:05:12.699> of<00:05:12.879> x<00:05:13.029> equals<00:05:13.810> zero<00:05:15.930> yeah<00:05:17.849> so

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
we're f dash of x equals zero yeah so

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.860 
we're f dash of x equals zero yeah so
very<00:05:19.090> simple<00:05:20.370> we<00:05:21.370> know<00:05:21.550> that<00:05:21.849> for<00:05:22.360> this<00:05:22.509> very

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
very simple we know that for this very

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.140 
very simple we know that for this very
first<00:05:23.169> section<00:05:23.650> at<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.889> left<00:05:24.129> the<00:05:24.669> gradient

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
first section at the left the gradient

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.869 
first section at the left the gradient
is<00:05:25.620> negative<00:05:26.620> right<00:05:27.159> but<00:05:27.370> notice<00:05:27.669> that<00:05:27.699> the

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:27.879 
is negative right but notice that the

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.140 
is negative right but notice that the
gradient<00:05:28.349> gets<00:05:29.550> more<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.669> more<00:05:30.729> shallow

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
gradient gets more and more shallow

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.839 
gradient gets more and more shallow
until<00:05:31.689> it<00:05:31.840> hits<00:05:31.990> zero<00:05:32.469> at<00:05:32.860> this<00:05:33.279> first<00:05:33.520> point

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
until it hits zero at this first point

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.450 
until it hits zero at this first point
here<00:05:34.180> so<00:05:35.080> I'm<00:05:35.139> just<00:05:35.259> going<00:05:35.409> to<00:05:35.469> maybe<00:05:36.279> just

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
here so I'm just going to maybe just

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.709 
here so I'm just going to maybe just
label<00:05:36.849> my<00:05:36.969> points<00:05:37.330> a<00:05:37.449> B<00:05:38.400> C<00:05:39.400> just<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.330> make<00:05:40.479> life

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
label my points a B C just to make life

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.189 
label my points a B C just to make life
easy<00:05:40.960> so<00:05:41.729> left<00:05:42.729> of<00:05:42.969> a<00:05:43.180> we<00:05:43.719> see<00:05:43.960> that<00:05:44.139> the

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
easy so left of a we see that the

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.089 
easy so left of a we see that the
grading<00:05:44.499> is<00:05:44.589> negative<00:05:44.949> right<00:05:45.569> but<00:05:46.569> but<00:05:47.229> it's

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
grading is negative right but but it's

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.579 
grading is negative right but but it's
increasing<00:05:48.969> and<00:05:49.120> hits<00:05:49.449> zero<00:05:49.810> at<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.289> so<00:05:50.349> we're

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:50.589 
increasing and hits zero at a so we're

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:54.989 
increasing and hits zero at a so we're
going<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:50.770> do<00:05:50.830> this<00:05:50.999> do<00:05:51.999> this<00:05:52.800> yeah<00:05:53.879> so<00:05:54.879> we

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:54.999 
going to do this do this yeah so we

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:58.350 
going to do this do this yeah so we
start<00:05:55.210> out<00:05:55.419> negative<00:05:55.779> gradient<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:57.210> green<00:05:58.210> is

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
start out negative gradient the green is

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.200 
start out negative gradient the green is
negative<00:05:58.719> right<00:05:59.469> because<00:05:59.650> the<00:05:59.889> this<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.969> line

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
negative right because the this the line

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.239 
negative right because the this the line
is<00:06:01.419> below<00:06:01.719> below<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:02.979> x-axis<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:04.349> then<00:06:05.349> we

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:06.249 
is below below the x-axis and then we

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:07.619 
is below below the x-axis and then we
see<00:06:06.460> that<00:06:06.490> from<00:06:06.699> this<00:06:06.909> second<00:06:07.270> section

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:07.629 
see that from this second section

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.610 
see that from this second section
between<00:06:07.810> a<00:06:08.050> and<00:06:08.199> B<00:06:08.469> the<00:06:08.650> gradient<00:06:09.009> is<00:06:09.099> positive

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
between a and B the gradient is positive

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.570 
between a and B the gradient is positive
but<00:06:11.620> it's<00:06:11.649> certainly<00:06:11.889> going<00:06:12.159> to<00:06:12.219> be<00:06:12.339> positive

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
but it's certainly going to be positive

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.619 
but it's certainly going to be positive
until<00:06:13.740> be<00:06:14.740> because<00:06:15.310> at<00:06:15.430> be<00:06:15.789> it<00:06:16.000> has<00:06:16.120> to<00:06:16.180> be<00:06:16.360> zero

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
until be because at be it has to be zero

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.959 
until be because at be it has to be zero
again<00:06:16.990> so<00:06:17.500> we<00:06:17.620> sort<00:06:17.800> of<00:06:17.860> come<00:06:18.099> back<00:06:18.129> down<00:06:18.520> like

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
again so we sort of come back down like

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.749 
again so we sort of come back down like
so<00:06:19.240> and<00:06:19.569> then<00:06:19.949> that'd<00:06:20.949> be<00:06:21.159> it<00:06:21.339> goes<00:06:21.520> positive

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 
so and then that'd be it goes positive

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.499 
so and then that'd be it goes positive
again<00:06:22.149> right<00:06:22.449> so<00:06:23.430> we<00:06:24.430> can<00:06:24.610> sort<00:06:25.210> of<00:06:25.270> do<00:06:25.389> that

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
again right so we can sort of do that

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.070 
again right so we can sort of do that
again

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.240 

and<00:06:29.520> you<00:06:30.520> need<00:06:30.639> to<00:06:30.729> keep<00:06:30.879> in<00:06:31.030> mind<00:06:31.060> that<00:06:31.389> at<00:06:31.569> sea

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
and you need to keep in mind that at sea

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.129 
and you need to keep in mind that at sea
again<00:06:33.250> our<00:06:33.520> gradient<00:06:33.729> hits<00:06:34.000> zero<00:06:34.270> so<00:06:34.930> let's

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
again our gradient hits zero so let's

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.070 
again our gradient hits zero so let's
bring<00:06:35.650> our<00:06:35.860> curve<00:06:36.069> down<00:06:36.340> and<00:06:36.840> then<00:06:37.840> what

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
bring our curve down and then what

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.640 
bring our curve down and then what
happens<00:06:38.500> look<00:06:39.219> what<00:06:39.370> happens<00:06:39.669> at<00:06:39.819> sea<00:06:40.650> it

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
happens look what happens at sea it

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.499 
happens look what happens at sea it
crosses<00:06:42.250> the<00:06:42.280> line<00:06:42.520> it<00:06:42.789> goes<00:06:42.939> into<00:06:43.090> negative

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
crosses the line it goes into negative

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.249 
crosses the line it goes into negative
right<00:06:43.840> but<00:06:44.620> what<00:06:45.060> happens<00:06:46.060> say<00:06:46.659> you<00:06:47.139> know

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:47.259 
right but what happens say you know

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.480 
right but what happens say you know
about<00:06:48.479> here<00:06:49.479> and<00:06:49.719> around<00:06:50.710> there<00:06:51.009> you<00:06:51.159> see<00:06:51.340> that

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
about here and around there you see that

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.089 
about here and around there you see that
the<00:06:51.580> gradient<00:06:51.789> is<00:06:52.180> still<00:06:52.539> negative<00:06:52.719> but<00:06:53.259> not

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:54.099 
the gradient is still negative but not

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:56.490 
the gradient is still negative but not
very<00:06:54.430> negative<00:06:55.000> in<00:06:55.300> fact<00:06:55.659> it<00:06:55.810> almost<00:06:56.020> goes

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
very negative in fact it almost goes

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.179 
very negative in fact it almost goes
flat<00:06:57.300> so<00:06:58.300> what<00:06:58.479> you<00:06:58.599> want<00:06:58.780> to<00:06:58.900> demonstrate<00:06:59.189> is

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:00.189 
flat so what you want to demonstrate is

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:03.029 
flat so what you want to demonstrate is
that<00:07:00.340> you<00:07:00.909> really<00:07:01.240> know<00:07:01.389> your<00:07:01.419> stuff<00:07:01.659> and<00:07:02.349> so

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 
that you really know your stuff and so

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.369 
that you really know your stuff and so
you<00:07:03.099> see<00:07:03.219> that<00:07:03.460> the<00:07:03.639> gradient<00:07:04.199> initially<00:07:05.199> as

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:05.379 
you see that the gradient initially as

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:10.050 
you see that the gradient initially as
it<00:07:05.620> passes<00:07:05.889> see<00:07:06.340> it<00:07:06.789> goes<00:07:07.349> negative<00:07:09.060> quite

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
it passes see it goes negative quite

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.080 
it passes see it goes negative quite
negative<00:07:10.270> but<00:07:11.259> then<00:07:11.440> it's<00:07:11.650> sort<00:07:11.830> of<00:07:11.919> like

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
negative but then it's sort of like

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.420 
negative but then it's sort of like
turns<00:07:13.090> back<00:07:13.389> on<00:07:13.419> itself<00:07:13.599> and<00:07:14.169> gets<00:07:14.740> less

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
turns back on itself and gets less

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.969 
turns back on itself and gets less
negative<00:07:15.759> and<00:07:16.210> then<00:07:17.050> sort<00:07:17.379> of<00:07:17.469> approaches

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:17.979 
negative and then sort of approaches

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:21.629 
negative and then sort of approaches
zero<00:07:18.219> doesn't<00:07:18.699> it<00:07:18.759> as<00:07:18.940> our<00:07:19.900> curve<00:07:20.319> as<00:07:20.560> it<00:07:21.460> sort

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 
zero doesn't it as our curve as it sort

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:24.149 
zero doesn't it as our curve as it sort
of<00:07:21.669> plays<00:07:21.940> out<00:07:22.240> so<00:07:22.539> it<00:07:22.599> comes<00:07:22.750> as<00:07:22.930> this<00:07:23.259> it<00:07:23.919> does

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:24.159 
of plays out so it comes as this it does

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:30.179 
of plays out so it comes as this it does
something<00:07:24.430> like<00:07:24.580> this<00:07:26.759> so<00:07:27.759> at<00:07:28.979> sort<00:07:29.979> of<00:07:30.039> like

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:30.189 
something like this so at sort of like

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:33.629 
something like this so at sort of like
this<00:07:30.729> area<00:07:31.090> here<00:07:31.529> the<00:07:32.529> gradient<00:07:32.979> the<00:07:33.129> curve<00:07:33.520> is

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 
this area here the gradient the curve is

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:36.029 
this area here the gradient the curve is
almost<00:07:33.849> flat<00:07:34.150> the<00:07:34.930> grading<00:07:35.259> is<00:07:35.379> almost<00:07:35.680> zero

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 
almost flat the grading is almost zero

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:40.649 
almost flat the grading is almost zero
and<00:07:36.340> we<00:07:36.909> represent<00:07:37.449> that<00:07:38.879> down<00:07:39.879> here<00:07:40.270> where

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.659 
and we represent that down here where

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:43.080 
and we represent that down here where
the<00:07:40.779> gradient<00:07:41.169> is<00:07:41.500> still<00:07:41.919> negative<00:07:42.099> but<00:07:42.879> very

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.090 
the gradient is still negative but very

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.909 
the gradient is still negative but very
close<00:07:43.389> to<00:07:43.779> zero<00:07:44.219> cool<00:07:45.219> and<00:07:46.560> so<00:07:47.560> that's<00:07:47.710> it

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 
close to zero cool and so that's it

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:50.839 
close to zero cool and so that's it
that's<00:07:48.789> drawing<00:07:49.719> the<00:07:50.289> gradient<00:07:50.680> function

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:50.849 
that's drawing the gradient function

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:53.909 
that's drawing the gradient function
from<00:07:51.849> the<00:07:52.120> original<00:07:52.419> function<00:07:52.810> three<00:07:53.770> easy

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 
from the original function three easy

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.829 
from the original function three easy
steps<00:07:54.009> hope<00:07:54.699> you've<00:07:54.849> enjoyed<00:07:54.940> yourself<00:07:55.539> I'll

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:55.839 
steps hope you've enjoyed yourself I'll

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:59.789 
steps hope you've enjoyed yourself I'll
