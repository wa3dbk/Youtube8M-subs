other my tips for discovery is really
just<00:01:04.400> learning<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.790> layout<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.180> map

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
just learning the layout of the map

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.179 
just learning the layout of the map
understanding<00:01:06.079> how<00:01:06.110> that<00:01:06.350> chasm<00:01:06.740> can<00:01:06.920> impact
