that<00:00:26.039> I'm<00:00:26.130> going<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.490> try<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> thinly<00:00:27.689> slice

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.990 
pork chops I don't like my meat looking
undercooked<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.740> I<00:02:10.800> made<00:02:11.039> some<00:02:11.340> rice<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.640> roni

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
undercooked so I made some rice a roni

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.530 
undercooked so I made some rice a roni
or<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> generic<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.260> I'm<00:02:13.349> also<00:02:13.590> going<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.069> warm

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
or a generic and I'm also going to warm

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.509 
or a generic and I'm also going to warm
some<00:02:14.689> canned<00:02:14.959> peas<00:02:15.319> these<00:02:15.860> will<00:02:16.040> work<00:02:16.189> as<00:02:16.340> my

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
some canned peas these will work as my

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.899 
some canned peas these will work as my
sides<00:02:16.909> and<00:02:17.469> my<00:02:18.469> pork<00:02:18.739> chops<00:02:18.980> are<00:02:19.129> done<00:02:19.159> as<00:02:19.790> you

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
sides and my pork chops are done as you

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.670 
sides and my pork chops are done as you
can<00:02:20.060> see<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.269> has<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> little<00:02:20.780> charred<00:02:21.049> mark<00:02:21.409> by

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
can see it has a little charred mark by

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.929 
can see it has a little charred mark by
broiling<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:23.269> I<00:02:24.109> did<00:02:24.379> flip<00:02:24.709> these<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.700> turn

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
broiling and I did flip these like turn

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.399 
broiling and I did flip these like turn
them<00:02:26.090> while<00:02:26.269> they<00:02:26.420> were<00:02:26.450> broiling<00:02:26.989> by<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.230> way

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
them while they were broiling by the way

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.429 
them while they were broiling by the way
so<00:02:27.799> each<00:02:28.010> side<00:02:28.400> can<00:02:28.640> get<00:02:28.790> some<00:02:28.939> color<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.290> now

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
so each side can get some color so now

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.559 
so each side can get some color so now
it's<00:02:30.590> time<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.890> plate<00:02:31.189> this<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.909> I'm<00:02:32.329> going<00:02:32.510> to
