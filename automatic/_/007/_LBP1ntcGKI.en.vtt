now that's actually watching this video
what<00:04:44.560> do<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:44.770> feel<00:04:44.980> about<00:04:45.190> roomy<00:04:45.790> and<00:04:45.910> sucky

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
what do you feel about roomy and sucky

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.850

think<00:04:48.160> this<00:04:48.250> series<00:04:48.670> actually<00:04:48.880> should<00:04:49.240> focus

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
think this series actually should focus

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.660 
think this series actually should focus
on<00:04:49.840> something<00:04:50.080> like<00:04:50.320> that<00:04:50.530> another<00:04:51.310> thing

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
on something like that another thing

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.700 
on something like that another thing
they<00:04:52.180> really<00:04:52.660> are<00:04:52.780> starting<00:04:53.170> to<00:04:53.260> actually<00:04:53.590> use

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
they really are starting to actually use

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.350 
they really are starting to actually use
a<00:04:53.740> lot<00:04:53.980> more<00:04:54.040> voice<00:04:54.400> actors<00:04:54.850> in<00:04:54.880> this<00:04:55.090> series<00:04:55.330> I

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
a lot more voice actors in this series I

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.940

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
don't know also I mean there's like a

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.230 
don't know also I mean there's like a
bunch<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.430> different<00:04:57.670> characters<00:04:58.030> side

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
bunch of different characters side

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.150 
bunch of different characters side
characters<00:04:58.690> useless<00:04:59.260> characters<00:04:59.590> just<00:04:59.710> added

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
characters useless characters just added

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.740 
characters useless characters just added
in<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.310> background<00:05:00.760> which<00:05:01.180> is<00:05:01.210> really

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
in the background which is really

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.270 
in the background which is really
different<00:05:02.020> because<00:05:02.260> usually<00:05:02.590> be<00:05:02.800> just<00:05:02.980> having

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
different because usually be just having

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.790 
different because usually be just having
other<00:05:03.430> voice<00:05:03.640> actors<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.210> Rumi<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:04.930> well<00:05:05.590> we

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
other voice actors of Rumi and well we

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.050 
other voice actors of Rumi and well we
don't<00:05:05.950> really<00:05:06.010> have<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.250> voice<00:05:06.400> actor<00:05:06.760> Seki

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
don't really have a voice actor Seki

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.520 
don't really have a voice actor Seki
because<00:05:07.210> he<00:05:07.330> really<00:05:07.540> hasn't<00:05:07.660> talked<00:05:07.960> yet<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:08.320> I

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
because he really hasn't talked yet so I

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.200 
because he really hasn't talked yet so I
just<00:05:09.040> could<00:05:09.190> say<00:05:09.310> Ruby's<00:05:09.670> usually<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.000> only

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
just could say Ruby's usually the only

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.390 
just could say Ruby's usually the only
one<00:05:10.330> talking<00:05:10.600> but<00:05:11.380> having<00:05:12.040> these<00:05:12.130> other

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
one talking but having these other

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.800 
one talking but having these other
characters<00:05:12.820> actually<00:05:13.000> coming<00:05:13.390> into<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.630> play

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
characters actually coming into the play

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.330 
characters actually coming into the play
and<00:05:14.140> I<00:05:14.380> guess<00:05:14.560> he's<00:05:14.710> spicing<00:05:15.220> up<00:05:15.280> the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
and I guess he's spicing up the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.980 
and I guess he's spicing up the
atmosphere<00:05:15.580> of<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.090> series<00:05:16.420> along<00:05:16.930> with

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
atmosphere of the series along with

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.180 
atmosphere of the series along with
their<00:05:17.230> different<00:05:17.590> comments<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.070> stuff

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
their different comments and stuff

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.310 
their different comments and stuff
really<00:05:18.850> makes<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:19.300> more<00:05:19.540> entertaining<00:05:19.840> it

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
really makes it more entertaining it

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.110 
really makes it more entertaining it
really<00:05:20.680> does<00:05:20.920> and<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.550> gives<00:05:21.730> an<00:05:21.850> entire

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
really does and it gives an entire

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.930 
really does and it gives an entire
refreshing<00:05:22.870> feel<00:05:23.140> to<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.500> series<00:05:23.830> so<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.490> love
