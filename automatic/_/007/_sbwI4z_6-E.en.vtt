00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
us additional insight into kinds of

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.260 
us additional insight into kinds of
things<00:02:06.040> that<00:02:06.130> are<00:02:06.310> flying<00:02:06.790> around<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.120> solar

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
things that are flying around the solar

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.010 
things that are flying around the solar
system<00:02:07.660> from<00:02:07.840> its<00:02:08.050> from<00:02:08.679> its<00:02:08.830> origin<00:02:09.489> onward

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.660 
system from its from its origin onward
and<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.650> really<00:02:11.830> not<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.069> question<00:02:12.340> so

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
and so this is really not a question so

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.220 
and so this is really not a question so

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
much just about the moon but about the

much just about the moon but about the

that predicted temperatures on the order
of<00:02:26.770> about<00:02:27.660> 100<00:02:28.660> Kelvin<00:02:29.080> if<00:02:29.980> temperatures<00:02:30.550> are

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
of about 100 Kelvin if temperatures are

of about 100 Kelvin if temperatures are
above<00:02:30.820> about<00:02:31.270> 100<00:02:31.600> Kelvin<00:02:31.930> we<00:02:32.650> lose<00:02:32.830> interest

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
above about 100 Kelvin we lose interest

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.800 
above about 100 Kelvin we lose interest
because<00:02:33.550> water<00:02:33.820> ice<00:02:34.030> could<00:02:34.180> probably<00:02:34.390> escape

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
because water ice could probably escape

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.930 
because water ice could probably escape
if<00:02:35.050> they're<00:02:35.590> below<00:02:35.890> 100<00:02:36.220> Kelvin<00:02:36.550> we<00:02:36.790> get

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
if they're below 100 Kelvin we get

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.280 
if they're below 100 Kelvin we get
really<00:02:37.090> excited<00:02:37.450> because<00:02:37.660> water<00:02:37.960> ice<00:02:38.110> and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
really excited because water ice and

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.540 
really excited because water ice and
other<00:02:38.470> compacts<00:02:38.980> could<00:02:39.130> be<00:02:39.190> trapped<00:02:39.460> there

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
other compacts could be trapped there

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.900 
other compacts could be trapped there
basically<00:02:40.180> forever<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:41.490> we<00:02:42.490> predicted

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
basically forever and we predicted

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.460 
basically forever and we predicted
temperatures<00:02:43.300> below<00:02:43.570> 100<00:02:43.960> Kelvin<00:02:44.230> with<00:02:44.350> our

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
temperatures below 100 Kelvin with our

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.410 
temperatures below 100 Kelvin with our
models<00:02:44.800> but<00:02:45.400> now<00:02:45.550> diviners<00:02:46.060> actually

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
models but now diviners actually

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.140 
models but now diviners actually
revealing<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:47.770> in<00:02:48.040> fact<00:02:48.400> temperatures<00:02:49.120> are

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
revealing that in fact temperatures are

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.550 
revealing that in fact temperatures are
there<00:02:49.980> below<00:02:50.980> 100<00:02:51.610> Kelvin<00:02:51.970> maybe<00:02:52.780> even<00:02:53.050> tens

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
there below 100 Kelvin maybe even tens

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.410 
there below 100 Kelvin maybe even tens
of<00:02:53.770> Kelvin<00:02:54.190> below<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:55.180> we're<00:02:55.300> getting

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
of Kelvin below that so we're getting

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.110 
of Kelvin below that so we're getting
pretty<00:02:55.750> close<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.530> basically<00:02:57.190> very<00:02:57.550> cold<00:02:57.880> like

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
pretty close to basically very cold like

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.780 
pretty close to basically very cold like
the<00:02:58.240> coldness<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.630> space<00:02:59.430> so<00:03:00.430> one<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.610> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the coldness of space so one of the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.910 
the coldness of space so one of the
goals<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.120> divine<00:03:01.540> our<00:03:01.690> team<00:03:01.870> has<00:03:02.080> is<00:03:02.620> we

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
goals that divine our team has is we

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.150 
goals that divine our team has is we
have<00:03:03.310> developed<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.150> very<00:03:04.750> sophisticated

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
have developed a very sophisticated

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.710 
have developed a very sophisticated
three-dimensional<00:03:06.160> model<00:03:06.490> of<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.730> moon<00:03:06.910> that

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
three-dimensional model of the moon that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.870 
three-dimensional model of the moon that
we<00:03:08.320> can<00:03:08.500> run<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.980> predict<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.460> temperatures

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
we can run and predict the temperatures

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.200 
we can run and predict the temperatures
that<00:03:10.570> we<00:03:10.720> are<00:03:10.960> measuring<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:11.530> diviner<00:03:12.210> and

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
that we are measuring with diviner and

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.480 
that we are measuring with diviner and
so<00:03:13.540> diviner<00:03:14.080> becomes<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.920> tool<00:03:15.130> that<00:03:15.340> we<00:03:15.460> use

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
so diviner becomes the tool that we use

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.520 
so diviner becomes the tool that we use
to<00:03:15.940> tell<00:03:16.120> us<00:03:16.300> if<00:03:16.450> our<00:03:16.570> model<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.020> accurate<00:03:17.260> or

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
to tell us if our model is accurate or

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.530 
to tell us if our model is accurate or
not<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.490> goal<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.940> get<00:03:19.060> our<00:03:19.210> model

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
not and the goal is to get our model

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.300 
not and the goal is to get our model
accurate<00:03:19.930> enough<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:20.590> just<00:03:21.130> like<00:03:21.250> a

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
accurate enough so that just like a

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.640 
accurate enough so that just like a
weather<00:03:21.610> forecasting<00:03:22.390> model<00:03:22.660> on<00:03:22.750> earth<00:03:22.900> we

weather forecasting model on earth we

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.110 
weather forecasting model on earth we
not<00:03:23.830> only<00:03:23.860> can<00:03:24.190> run<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.490> for<00:03:24.700> what's<00:03:24.910> going<00:03:25.030> to

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
not only can run it for what's going to

not only can run it for what's going to
happen<00:03:25.420> tomorrow<00:03:25.510> but<00:03:26.020> we<00:03:26.110> can<00:03:26.260> run<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.590> for

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
happen tomorrow but we can run it for

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.350 
happen tomorrow but we can run it for
what's<00:03:26.950> going<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.250> happen<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.760> thousand<00:03:28.270> years

what's going to happen a thousand years
from<00:03:28.480> now<00:03:28.870> or<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.230> billion<00:03:29.830> years<00:03:30.040> ago<00:03:30.130> and

really then unlock what we think the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
what the differences are between the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.860 
what the differences are between the
surface<00:03:56.800> materials<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:57.970> for<00:03:58.239> example<00:03:58.270> if

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
surface materials so for example if

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.080 
surface materials so for example if
you're<00:03:59.470> at<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.650> beach<00:03:59.770> the<00:04:00.280> beach<00:04:00.459> sand<00:04:00.790> gets

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
you're at the beach the beach sand gets

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.760 
you're at the beach the beach sand gets
really<00:04:01.510> hot<00:04:01.690> during<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.959> day<00:04:02.020> and<00:04:02.290> cold<00:04:02.620> at

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
really hot during the day and cold at

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.890 
really hot during the day and cold at
night<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:03.640> another<00:04:03.820> hand<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.300> big<00:04:04.450> chunk<00:04:04.810> of

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
night but another hand a big chunk of

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.110 
night but another hand a big chunk of
rock<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.800> may<00:04:05.950> be<00:04:06.010> laying<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.610> up<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.060> the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
rock that you may be laying on up in the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.000 
rock that you may be laying on up in the
mountains<00:04:07.480> it's<00:04:08.290> pretty<00:04:08.470> much<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.830> same<00:04:08.950> a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
mountains it's pretty much the same a

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.440 
mountains it's pretty much the same a
temperature<00:04:09.459> most<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.000> day<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.120> most<00:04:10.360> of

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
temperature most of the day and most of

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.140 
temperature most of the day and most of
the<00:04:10.540> night<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:12.310> what<00:04:12.489> that<00:04:12.520> tells<00:04:12.850> you<00:04:13.030> is

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
the night and so what that tells you is

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.640 
the night and so what that tells you is
that<00:04:13.239> by<00:04:13.390> measuring<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> temperature<00:04:14.140> of

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
that by measuring the temperature of

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.190 
that by measuring the temperature of
surfaces<00:04:15.190> on<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.400> moon<00:04:15.580> over<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.630> over<00:04:16.959> a

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
surfaces on the moon over and over a

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.949 
surfaces on the moon over and over a
lunar<00:04:17.530> day<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.880> can<00:04:19.060> derive<00:04:19.480> whether

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
lunar day you can derive whether

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.840 
lunar day you can derive whether
surfaces<00:04:20.620> are<00:04:20.739> made<00:04:20.890> of<00:04:21.010> rock<00:04:21.310> or<00:04:21.549> made<00:04:21.730> of

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
more loose material like sand the second

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.850 
more loose material like sand the second
surface<00:04:25.450> investigation<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:26.470> called<00:04:26.740> the

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
surface investigation is called the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.130 
surface investigation is called the
thermophysical<00:04:27.250> investigation<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.300> here<00:04:29.020> we

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
thermophysical investigation and here we

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.210 
thermophysical investigation and here we
use<00:04:29.350> our<00:04:29.530> temperature<00:04:30.039> day

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
use our temperature day

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.480 
use our temperature day
data<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:31.300> determine<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:32.260> rock<00:04:32.860> abundance<00:04:33.340> how

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
data to determine the rock abundance how

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.120 
data to determine the rock abundance how
rocky<00:04:33.790> is<00:04:34.690> particular<00:04:35.350> area<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.950> lunar

rocky is particular area of the lunar

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.790 
rocky is particular area of the lunar
surfaces<00:04:36.580> or<00:04:36.790> how<00:04:36.940> much<00:04:37.090> soil<00:04:37.360> has<00:04:37.660> we<00:04:38.620> also

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
surfaces or how much soil has we also

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.100 
surfaces or how much soil has we also
look<00:04:39.130> at<00:04:39.340> how<00:04:39.730> rough<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.480> surfaces<00:04:40.900> on<00:04:41.080> a

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
look at how rough the surfaces on a

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.890 
look at how rough the surfaces on a
small<00:04:41.470> scale<00:04:41.800> we<00:04:42.670> can<00:04:42.820> map<00:04:43.000> Rock<00:04:43.390> abundance

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
small scale we can map Rock abundance

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.740 
small scale we can map Rock abundance
with<00:04:44.200> diviner<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.820> so<00:04:46.000> we'll<00:04:46.180> be<00:04:46.330> looking<00:04:46.360> at

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
with diviner and so we'll be looking at

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.990 
with diviner and so we'll be looking at
places<00:04:47.020> that<00:04:47.470> potentially<00:04:48.340> would<00:04:48.490> be<00:04:48.610> target

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
places that potentially would be target

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.060 
places that potentially would be target
landing<00:04:49.330> sites<00:04:49.540> and<00:04:49.720> seeing<00:04:49.990> whether<00:04:50.830> they're

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
landing sites and seeing whether they're

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.730 
landing sites and seeing whether they're
safe<00:04:51.340> for<00:04:51.550> landing<00:04:51.850> or<00:04:51.940> not<00:04:52.380> one<00:04:53.380> thing<00:04:53.530> that's

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
safe for landing or not one thing that's

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.080 
safe for landing or not one thing that's
very<00:04:53.800> exciting<00:04:54.220> about<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.850> lunar

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
very exciting about the lunar

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.490 
very exciting about the lunar
reconnaissance<00:04:55.180> orbiter<00:04:55.660> mission<00:04:55.990> is<00:04:56.320> that

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
reconnaissance orbiter mission is that

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.260 
reconnaissance orbiter mission is that
it's<00:04:56.650> not<00:04:56.770> just<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:57.250> scientific<00:04:57.880> mission<00:04:58.180> to

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
it's not just a scientific mission to

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.300 
it's not just a scientific mission to
the<00:04:58.300> moon<00:04:58.420> and<00:04:58.780> we're<00:04:59.140> all<00:04:59.290> scientists<00:04:59.770> here

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
the moon and we're all scientists here

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.950 
the moon and we're all scientists here
on<00:05:00.460> diviner<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.060> that's<00:05:01.570> sort<00:05:01.780> of<00:05:01.810> our

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
on diviner and that's sort of our

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.950 
on diviner and that's sort of our
interest<00:05:02.350> but<00:05:02.560> what<00:05:03.400> is<00:05:03.630> exciting<00:05:04.630> is<00:05:04.690> that<00:05:04.750> we

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
interest but what is exciting is that we

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.590 
interest but what is exciting is that we
play<00:05:05.170> a<00:05:05.200> part<00:05:05.680> in<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.890> larger<00:05:06.220> role<00:05:06.370> of<00:05:06.700> really

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
play a part in a larger role of really

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.930 
play a part in a larger role of really
humankind's<00:05:08.200> return<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.860> moon<00:05:09.040> part<00:05:09.880> of
