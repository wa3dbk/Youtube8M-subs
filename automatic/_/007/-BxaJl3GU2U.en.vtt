00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.100
 variety of knife types to which the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.250
 owing to the growth in high 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 gastronomy and various professionals. 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.690
 men today are also more 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.179
 interested in the kitchen that must be 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.550
 so that then growth is due to 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.530
 high gastronomy 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.770
 Only you have idea São Paulo has to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.140
 more than 40 gastronomic colleges 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.310
 That's why your madwoman found herself in the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.440
 need to manufacture the models are 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.660
 used in the kitchen but taking my god 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.940
 more specific is very specific 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.200
 we will then begin to see their game 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.429
 specific right 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.880
 Can you explain a little to me? 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:12.569
 you stopped me for here we go there its 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.150
 first break here is the knife of the boss of the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.610
 boss knife né some apps said that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.209
 this range should be the extension of your 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.620
 hand 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.090
 she goes out to cut military gear or the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.000
 What else do I need? 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.910
 ie is the number knife in the kitchen 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.819
 this here for example how it works 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.989
 I have here I see that she has a 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.420
 one for us and I think it's a 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.620
 decoration reminisces along with your hand ne 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.540
 use light only speak with a slicing knife at 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.569
 and when you use the knife to cut 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.450
 flesh she creates air pockets 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.549
 with that the meat does not stick to the knife she 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.409
 is easily released not only by the size 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.980
 nor is it just by the size of the imagined ones 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:58.340
 by the clash of vegetables in relation to 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.310
 how many sugar small vegetable fruits 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.379
 ingredients also questions but one 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.919
 The engine has not been turned 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.989
 very well and I got it right because 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.939
 we used to have these 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.650
 two knives in the kitchen and manages to 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.650
 solve life with them, right? 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.319
 but why not facilitate the bread knife 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.030
 our closet continues to facilitate the 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.459
 life to cut the bread that knife with 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.409
 Good duel ceglia because she in a March 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.049
 bread time to cut it actually is 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.540
 long and that watered the beer you 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.549
 can cut breadcrumbs without 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.840
 Damage to the core this is a good knife. 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.439
 specific 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.919
 it was made for sushi sashimi 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:44.659
 We do not know how to do it. 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:50.209
 low is easy not 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:55.009
 We have here a sharp and 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.829
 a mexico faith i use or this or 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:59.569
 this or this or any on working together 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:08.620
 of these 12 who work together 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:14.900
 I have here a stone of filó 400 thousand 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:16.759
 only this stone is abrasive and here on the side 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.840
 of your stone cries 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.630
 then how does it proceed? 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.449
 the sabella spinning has to be submerged 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.630
 for 10 minutes because water does not 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.470
 can see snippets she is not a 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:37.310
 to enjoy the full extent of the stone is 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.310
 always cutting the leg on the other side 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:45.419
 joão lado turns one side repeats the 

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:47.819
 the move will maranhão to gold - the 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.709
 Brasilia Brazil realized that the wire 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.249
 came back 

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:58.699
 zachary if he did not know how to advise her 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:58.699
 use that way I find the knife wire 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:08.909
 cry talk to candê cries seals doing 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.009
 the function 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:13.439
 so there is an option here is a bit more 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.360
 easy lets say like this and with less 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.769
 errors - margin of error 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.229
 usually when the person does not know 

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:21.479
 I recommend this odor after all. 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.999
 We now have another knife with me. 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.709

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:52.529
 flee it does not get dark it does not catch 

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:53.669
 smell it preserves the taste and
