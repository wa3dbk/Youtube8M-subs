we're<00:00:00.690> going<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.900> play<00:00:01.050> some<00:00:01.110> numbers<00:00:01.709> here<00:00:01.740> at

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
we're going to play some numbers here at

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.999 
we're going to play some numbers here at
the<00:00:02.220> scientific<00:00:02.850> notation<00:00:03.570> you<00:00:04.009> hopefully

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
the scientific notation you hopefully

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.369 
the scientific notation you hopefully
have<00:00:05.040> already<00:00:05.850> watched<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.420> presentation<00:00:06.930> on

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
have already watched the presentation on

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.180 
have already watched the presentation on
how<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.589> make<00:00:08.370> significant<00:00:09.090> figures<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:10.190> you

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
how to make significant figures and you

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.890 
how to make significant figures and you
need<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.790> know<00:00:12.030> how<00:00:12.179> many<00:00:12.240> significant

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
need to know how many significant

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.259 
need to know how many significant
figures<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.400> number<00:00:14.790> before

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
figures you have and the number before

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.790 
figures you have and the number before
you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.690> place<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.170> into<00:00:16.289> scientific

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
you can place it into scientific

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.910 
you can place it into scientific
notation<00:00:17.539> scientific<00:00:18.539> notation<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.439> deal

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
notation scientific notation is to deal

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.220 
notation scientific notation is to deal
with<00:00:20.100> very<00:00:20.310> large<00:00:20.580> numbers<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.300> very<00:00:21.810> small

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
with very large numbers and very small

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.800 
with very large numbers and very small
numbers<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:22.890> many<00:00:23.160> many<00:00:23.400> decimal<00:00:23.820> places<00:00:23.970> so

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
numbers with many many decimal places so

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.960 
numbers with many many decimal places so
let's<00:00:24.960> start<00:00:25.140> with<00:00:25.260> these<00:00:25.380> four<00:00:25.680> over<00:00:26.039> here<00:00:26.310> we

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
let's start with these four over here we

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
let's start with these four over here we
have<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.750> eight<00:00:28.080> two<00:00:28.410> zero<00:00:28.439> zero<00:00:28.949> zero

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
have one eight two zero zero zero

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.150 
have one eight two zero zero zero
according<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.109> our<00:00:31.170> significant<00:00:31.859> figure

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
according to our significant figure

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.209 
according to our significant figure
rules<00:00:32.489> there<00:00:32.880> are<00:00:32.910> one<00:00:33.360> two<00:00:33.690> three

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
rules there are one two three

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.330 
rules there are one two three
significant<00:00:35.219> figures<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.510> number<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
significant figures in this number and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.860 
significant figures in this number and
then<00:00:38.340> we're<00:00:38.820> assuming<00:00:39.090> there's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> decimal

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
then we're assuming there's a decimal

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.810 
then we're assuming there's a decimal
place<00:00:40.140> right<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.309> end<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.700> this

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
place right here at the end of this

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.119 
place right here at the end of this
number<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> we're<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.829> actually

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
number so we're going to actually

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.150 
number so we're going to actually
capture<00:00:44.670> how<00:00:45.420> many<00:00:45.780> decimal<00:00:46.379> places<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.950> have

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
capture how many decimal places we have

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.240 
capture how many decimal places we have
to<00:00:47.430> move<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.170> reach<00:00:49.410> right<00:00:49.739> after

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to move and like to reach right after

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.150 
to move and like to reach right after
the<00:00:50.370> first<00:00:50.760> digital<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.350> will<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the first digital so it will be the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.020 
the first digital so it will be the
answer<00:00:53.399> will<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.449> 1<00:00:55.230> point<00:00:55.949> 8<00:00:56.840> 2<00:00:57.840> times<00:00:58.800> 10<00:00:59.550> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
answer will be 1 point 8 2 times 10 and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.029 
answer will be 1 point 8 2 times 10 and
how<00:01:00.629> many<00:01:00.870> steps<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.500> need<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> fit<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
how many steps do we need to fit that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.429 
how many steps do we need to fit that
decimal<00:01:02.399> point<00:01:02.460> between<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.180> 1<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.420> 8<00:01:03.809> that's

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
decimal point between the 1 and 8 that's

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.690 
decimal point between the 1 and 8 that's
one<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:05.400> three<00:01:06.180> four<00:01:06.720> five<00:01:07.380> steps<00:01:07.860> that's

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
one two three four five steps that's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.010 
one two three four five steps that's
times<00:01:09.119> 10<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> positive<00:01:10.470> 5<00:01:12.020> three

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
times 10 to the positive 5 three

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.080 
times 10 to the positive 5 three
significant<00:01:13.680> figures<00:01:13.710> times<00:01:14.549> 10<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
significant figures times 10 to the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.249 
significant figures times 10 to the
positive<00:01:15.920> 563<00:01:16.920> point<00:01:17.700> zero<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.420> how<00:01:19.080> many

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
positive 563 point zero one how many

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.469 
positive 563 point zero one how many
significant<00:01:19.770> figures<00:01:19.799> are<00:01:20.369> there<00:01:20.670> there's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
significant figures are there there's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.190 
significant figures are there there's
one<00:01:22.049> two<00:01:22.590> three<00:01:23.159> four<00:01:23.640> all<00:01:24.119> four<00:01:24.570> digits<00:01:25.049> are

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
one two three four all four digits are

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.749 
one two three four all four digits are
significant<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.670> answer<00:01:27.210> will<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:28.790> six

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
significant so the answer will be six

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.109 
significant so the answer will be six
2301<00:01:32.759> times<00:01:33.630> 10<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.710> how<00:01:35.130> many<00:01:35.369> digits<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:35.970> had

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
2301 times 10 and how many digits we had

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.819 
2301 times 10 and how many digits we had
to<00:01:36.240> move<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> nap<00:01:37.290> between<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
to move this to get a nap between the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.039 
to move this to get a nap between the
Fernan<00:01:38.310> through<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.520> first<00:01:38.759> digit<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.600> one

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
Fernan through the first digit it's one

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.620 
Fernan through the first digit it's one
decimal<00:01:40.860> place

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
decimal place

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.830 
decimal place
times<00:01:41.900> 10<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.530> first<00:01:43.360> there's<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.420> small

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
times 10 to the first there's a small

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.410 
times 10 to the first there's a small
number<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:45.500> much<00:01:45.710> less<00:01:46.009> than<00:01:46.070> one<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.270> it's

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
number it's much less than one so it's

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.310 
number it's much less than one so it's
going<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.810> have<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.080> negative<00:01:48.970> exponent<00:01:49.970> we

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
going to have a negative exponent we

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.940 
going to have a negative exponent we
have<00:01:51.320> how<00:01:51.770> many<00:01:51.799> significant<00:01:52.759> digits<00:01:53.140> 1<00:01:54.140> 2

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
have how many significant digits 1 2

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.340 
have how many significant digits 1 2
these<00:01:55.549> are<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.970> only<00:01:56.210> two<00:01:56.570> significant

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
these are the only two significant

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.660 
these are the only two significant
digits<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.040> number

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
digits in this number

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.300 
digits in this number
so<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.509> answer<00:01:59.930> is<00:01:59.960> going<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.320> be<00:02:00.409> one<00:02:00.799> point

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
so the answer is going to be one point

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.730 
so the answer is going to be one point
zero<00:02:02.020> times<00:02:03.020> 10

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
zero times 10

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.770 
zero times 10
now<00:02:04.159> how<00:02:04.340> many<00:02:04.399> decimal<00:02:04.909> places<00:02:05.000> does<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.509> take

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
now how many decimal places does it take

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.639 
now how many decimal places does it take
to<00:02:06.470> get<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:06.890> into<00:02:07.520> scientific<00:02:08.420> notation

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
to get this into scientific notation

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.559 
to get this into scientific notation
it's<00:02:09.649> one<00:02:10.130> two<00:02:10.819> three<00:02:11.540> four<00:02:12.350> five<00:02:12.890> six<00:02:13.569> seven

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
it's one two three four five six seven

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.270 
it's one two three four five six seven
eight

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
eight

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.520 
eight
it's<00:02:16.280> eight<00:02:16.640> decimal<00:02:17.120> places<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.019> because

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
it's eight decimal places and because

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.590 
it's eight decimal places and because
the<00:02:18.769> number<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.160> less<00:02:19.550> than<00:02:19.610> one

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
the number is less than one

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.220 
the number is less than one
it's<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.200> negative<00:02:21.860> direction<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:23.600> father<00:02:23.870> one

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
we have two billion dollars so we have

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.340 
we have two billion dollars so we have
two<00:02:28.190> with<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.610> bunch<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.060> zeros<00:02:29.510> right<00:02:29.840> after<00:02:30.260> me
