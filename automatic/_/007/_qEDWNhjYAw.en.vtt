about<00:00:06.170> the<00:00:06.439> unique<00:00:06.710> challenges<00:00:06.740> that<00:00:07.519> one

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
about the unique challenges that one

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.240 
about the unique challenges that one
would<00:00:07.910> face<00:00:08.179> working<00:00:08.660> in<00:00:08.750> animation<00:00:09.250> versus

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
would face working in animation versus

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.039 
would face working in animation versus
the<00:00:10.550> challenges<00:00:11.059> that<00:00:11.089> one<00:00:11.360> would<00:00:11.540> work<00:00:11.690> with

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
the challenges that one would work with

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.470 
the challenges that one would work with
that<00:00:12.490> one<00:00:13.490> would<00:00:13.639> face<00:00:13.849> two<00:00:14.089> when<00:00:14.240> working

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
that one would face two when working

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.609 
that one would face two when working
with<00:00:14.780> real<00:00:15.019> human<00:00:15.860> characters<00:00:17.679> well<00:00:19.240> Erica<00:00:20.240> I

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
with real human characters well Erica I

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.800 
with real human characters well Erica I
do<00:00:21.619> I<00:00:21.650> look<00:00:21.859> here<00:00:22.160> okay

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
do I look here okay

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.620 
do I look here okay
I<00:00:23.840> think<00:00:24.740> that<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:25.640> challenges<00:00:26.240> are<00:00:26.390> really

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
I think that the challenges are really

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.929 
I think that the challenges are really
mostly<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.710> same<00:00:27.740> you're<00:00:28.400> still<00:00:28.669> dealing

in<00:00:48.109> all<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.469> important<00:00:48.920> areas<00:00:49.100> it's<00:00:49.489> very

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
in all the important areas it's very

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.630 
in all the important areas it's very
much<00:00:49.969> like<00:00:50.079> live-action<00:00:51.079> I<00:00:51.230> think<00:00:51.469> that<00:00:51.770> it's

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
much like live-action I think that it's

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.270 
much like live-action I think that it's
different<00:00:53.149> in<00:00:53.390> that<00:00:53.420> it's<00:00:53.780> slower<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.590> a

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
different in that it's slower and a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.750 
different in that it's slower and a
little<00:00:56.149> more<00:00:56.350> exacting<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.500> an<00:00:57.620> animator<00:00:58.070> has

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
little more exacting and an animator has

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.810 
little more exacting and an animator has
to<00:00:58.969> stay<00:00:59.239> an<00:00:59.570> animator<00:01:00.289> to<00:01:00.620> tries<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.399> get<00:01:01.550> in<00:01:01.699> a

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
to stay an animator to tries to get in a

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.669 
to stay an animator to tries to get in a
moment<00:01:02.239> just<00:01:02.390> like<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.660> live-action<00:01:02.960> actor

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
moment just like a live-action actor

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.500 
moment just like a live-action actor
only<00:01:04.129> there<00:01:04.640> in<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:05.030> moment

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
only there in a moment

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.039 
only there in a moment
for<00:01:06.020> weeks<00:01:06.970> so<00:01:07.970> it's<00:01:08.119> kind<00:01:08.299> of<00:01:08.330> like<00:01:08.479> trying<00:01:08.960> to

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
for weeks so it's kind of like trying to

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.990 
for weeks so it's kind of like trying to
catch<00:01:09.259> lightning<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:09.950> bottle<00:01:10.159> one<00:01:10.640> volt

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
catch lightning in the bottle one volt

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.109 
from those very elemental materials are
really<00:02:02.210> important<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.229> would<00:02:03.500> say<00:02:03.710> draw<00:02:04.219> we

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
really important so I would say draw we

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.940 
really important so I would say draw we
have<00:02:05.240> some<00:02:05.450> excellent<00:02:05.840> animators<00:02:06.439> who<00:02:06.619> don't

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
have some excellent animators who don't

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.210 
have some excellent animators who don't
draw<00:02:07.250> but<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:09.380> other<00:02:09.530> thing<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:09.830> would<00:02:09.950> say<00:02:10.100> is

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
draw but the other thing I would say is

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.700 
draw but the other thing I would say is
don't<00:02:10.250> just<00:02:10.700> look<00:02:10.910> at<00:02:11.090> animation<00:02:11.750> look<00:02:12.350> at<00:02:12.530> all

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
don't just look at animation look at all

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.160 
don't just look at animation look at all
the<00:02:12.980> arts<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.490> look<00:02:13.940> outside<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.690> anime

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
the arts and look outside of anime

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.990 
the arts and look outside of anime
and<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.620> think<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.250> way<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.459> keep<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.849> art

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
and I think that the way to keep the art

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.540 
and I think that the way to keep the art
form<00:02:17.300> vital<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.170> continually<00:02:18.800> be<00:02:19.069> bringing

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
form vital is to continually be bringing

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.910 
form vital is to continually be bringing
in<00:02:19.670> new<00:02:19.849> influences<00:02:20.569> draw<00:02:20.840> from<00:02:21.500> your<00:02:21.560> life

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
in new influences draw from your life

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.229 
in new influences draw from your life
from<00:02:22.760> plays<00:02:23.209> from<00:02:23.750> books<00:02:24.080> paintings<00:02:25.239> music

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
from plays from books paintings music

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.990 
from plays from books paintings music
drop<00:02:26.989> bring<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.470> other<00:02:27.650> arts<00:02:28.069> into<00:02:28.580> animation

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
drop bring the other arts into animation

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.180 
drop bring the other arts into animation
don't<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:29.660> keep<00:02:29.840> feeding<00:02:30.230> on<00:02:30.500> animation<00:02:31.099> we

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
don't just keep feeding on animation we

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.490 
don't just keep feeding on animation we
get<00:02:31.370> people<00:02:31.730> who<00:02:31.850> only<00:02:32.150> look<00:02:32.720> at<00:02:32.870> animation

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
get people who only look at animation

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.430 
get people who only look at animation
and<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.830> think<00:02:34.040> that's<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.280> mistake
