once in a while an invention comes along
that<00:00:03.389> makes<00:00:03.540> everybody<00:00:03.870> go<00:00:04.080> why<00:00:04.440> didn't<00:00:04.710> we

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
that makes everybody go why didn't we

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.660 
that makes everybody go why didn't we
think<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.100> before

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670

solar freaking roadways it's such a
brilliant<00:00:08.340> idea<00:00:08.429> but<00:00:08.910> nobody<00:00:09.150> had<00:00:09.510> really<00:00:09.719> put

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
brilliant idea but nobody had really put

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.830 
brilliant idea but nobody had really put
much<00:00:10.380> thought<00:00:10.740> behind<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.730> until<00:00:12.179> Julie<00:00:12.690> and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
much thought behind that until Julie and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.499 
much thought behind that until Julie and
Scot<00:00:13.110> Bruce<00:00:13.440> aw<00:00:13.679> came<00:00:14.099> along<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.580> Sandpoint

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
Scot Bruce aw came along of Sandpoint

Idaho<00:00:15.949> they<00:00:16.949> came<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.369> with<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.670> concept

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
Idaho they came up with this concept

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.730 
Idaho they came up with this concept
they've<00:00:18.420> been<00:00:18.600> slowly<00:00:18.840> developing<00:00:19.590> it

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
they've been slowly developing it

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.810 
they've been slowly developing it
they've<00:00:20.359> raised<00:00:21.359> money<00:00:21.810> now<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.470> an<00:00:22.830> IndieGoGo

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
they've raised money now on an IndieGoGo

they've raised money now on an IndieGoGo
campaign<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:25.050> taken<00:00:25.619> off<00:00:25.769> largely<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.760> part

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
campaign it's taken off largely in part

to<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.630> video<00:00:27.990> let's<00:00:28.199> take<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.890> little

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to this video let's take a just a little

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.170 
to this video let's take a just a little
quick<00:00:29.730> look<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> video<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.820> every<00:00:32.820> panel

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
quick look at the video so every panel

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.850 
quick look at the video so every panel
has<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> series<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.780> LED<00:00:34.350> lights<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.829> the

kind of took off people saw this video
and<00:01:09.180> went<00:01:09.330> oh<00:01:09.479> my<00:01:09.750> god<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.560> sounds<00:01:10.920> like

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and went oh my god that that sounds like

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.320 
and went oh my god that that sounds like
a<00:01:11.040> great<00:01:11.310> world<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.790> live<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
a great world to live in what a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.719 
a great world to live in what a
brilliant<00:01:12.810> idea<00:01:13.159> what<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.340> say<00:01:14.700> about

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
brilliant idea what do they say about

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.399 
brilliant idea what do they say about
the<00:01:15.119> actual<00:01:15.509> material<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.229> would

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the actual material what this would

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.710 
the actual material what this would
essentially<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.280> replace<00:01:17.580> every<00:01:18.060> piece

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
essentially have to replace every piece

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
essentially have to replace every piece
of<00:01:18.750> concrete<00:01:19.110> Wow<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.070> yeah<00:01:20.310> what

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
of concrete Wow what there yeah what

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.789 
of concrete Wow what there yeah what
they're<00:01:20.700> proposing<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.630> did<00:01:21.840> replace

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
they're proposing is if we did replace

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.530 
they're proposing is if we did replace
all<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> highways<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> country<00:01:24.360> with

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
all the highways in the country with

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
all the highways in the country with
this<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.530> would<00:01:25.830> generate<00:01:26.729> enough

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this it would generate enough

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.480 
this it would generate enough
electricity<00:01:27.710> three<00:01:28.710> times<00:01:28.950> more<00:01:29.159> electricity

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
electricity three times more electricity

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.910 
electricity three times more electricity
than<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:30.030> need<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:30.990> country<00:01:31.049> three<00:01:31.680> times

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
than we need in this country three times

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.499 
than we need in this country three times
more<00:01:32.130> power<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.700> could<00:01:32.820> sell<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.299> other

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
more power that could sell it to other

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.480 
more power that could sell it to other
countries<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.229> mean<00:01:34.500> obviously<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.070> huge

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
countries I mean obviously it's a huge

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.870 
countries I mean obviously it's a huge
project<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.329> build<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.490> he's<00:01:38.490> already

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
project to build this but he's already

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.200 
project to build this but he's already
gotten<00:01:39.920> $750,000<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.189> grant<00:01:41.549> money<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:42.090> the

to<00:02:59.319> learn<00:02:59.440> more<00:02:59.500> about<00:02:59.709> is<00:03:00.010> how<00:03:00.160> sustainable

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
to learn more about is how sustainable

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.490 
to learn more about is how sustainable
this<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.239> because<00:03:01.600> if<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:01.989> sustainable

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
this is because if it is sustainable

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.460 
this is because if it is sustainable
then<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.519> can<00:03:03.780> catechol<00:03:04.780> each<00:03:04.870> ange<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.319> way

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
then it can catechol each ange the way

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.620 
then it can catechol each ange the way
