00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
of the things I want to talk about is

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.299 
of the things I want to talk about is
that<00:00:37.040> it<00:00:38.040> was<00:00:38.399> strange<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.329> find<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that it was strange to find that the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.670 
that it was strange to find that the
blizzard<00:00:41.730> dragon<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> combination<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.350> sea

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
blizzard dragon is a combination of sea

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
blizzard dragon is a combination of sea
and<00:00:43.950> flame<00:00:45.289> because<00:00:47.149> from<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> naked<00:00:48.690> eye<00:00:48.870> are

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and flame because from the naked eye are

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.939 
and flame because from the naked eye are
from<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.620> guess<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.780> opinion<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.500> blizzard

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
from I guess like opinion the blizzard

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.979 
from I guess like opinion the blizzard
dragon<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.460> assume<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> ice

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
dragon I assume that it's like the ice

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.189 
dragon I assume that it's like the ice
element<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:56.129> some<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.030> coal<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.719> something

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
element or some the coal or something

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
element or some the coal or something
it's<00:00:58.379> something<00:00:58.559> cold<00:00:58.949> we're<00:00:59.160> freezing<00:00:59.670> but

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
it's something cold we're freezing but

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.229 
it's something cold we're freezing but
I'm<00:01:00.600> surprised<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:02.280> fire<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I'm surprised that it is a fire and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.700 
I'm surprised that it is a fire and
water<00:01:03.570> dragon<00:01:04.470> anyways<00:01:05.339> um<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:07.049> description

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
water dragon anyways um the description

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.890 
water dragon anyways um the description
of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> dragon<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.640> says<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.360> weirdly

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
of the dragon it says that weirdly

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.649 
of the dragon it says that weirdly
enough<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> dragon<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.950> made<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.670> snow<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
enough the dragon is made of snow and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.039 
enough the dragon is made of snow and
ice<00:01:13.280> seems<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:15.060> hot<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> wet

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
ice seems to like hot and wet

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.620 
ice seems to like hot and wet
environments<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.119> rare<00:01:18.330> dragon

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
environments to see this rare dragon

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.370 
environments to see this rare dragon
flop<00:01:19.140> around<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.790> pile<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.509> lava<00:01:22.020> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
flop around in a pile of lava is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.149 
flop around in a pile of lava is
definitely<00:01:23.070> worth<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.580> effort<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> what

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
definitely worth the effort so what

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
definitely worth the effort so what
they're<00:01:26.369> saying<00:01:26.400> about<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.479> really

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
they're saying about that I'm not really

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.200 
they're saying about that I'm not really
sure<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.259> I'm<00:01:29.130> assuming<00:01:29.729> they're<00:01:29.880> trying<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
sure but I'm assuming they're trying to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.190 
sure but I'm assuming they're trying to
imply<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.900> made<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> snow<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.460> ice

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
imply that it's made out of snow and ice

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.260 
imply that it's made out of snow and ice
anyways<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:35.040> dragon<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.579> really<00:01:35.850> simple<00:01:36.119> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
anyways this dragon is really simple to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.640 
anyways this dragon is really simple to
breed<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.630> you're<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.930> beginning<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.470> game

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
hours is definitely a really short time

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.469
