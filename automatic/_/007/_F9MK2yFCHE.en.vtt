00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.160
 spoken a product has very popular that 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.919
 It's a beautiful and we know it or it's us. 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.490
 more shapes and shapes 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:18.710
 from our cridinho to online 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.949
 hainan liquid jewelery in pen 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.410
 there is a huge amount of 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.929
 lines and damage a video explain 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.810
 exactly what is the difference they 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.029
 They sang God so let's start with 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.620
 ign in gel already I have here in my 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:41.960
 hands my name presents if so a 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.090
 a little and you open the lid what 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.310
 found here is Iran in the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.600
 cream gel composition what do you 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.850
 they want to call 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.070
 this product has to be used 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.870
 always with a brush 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.170
 what shocked its use can be 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.000
 brush or bridge on the first floor at the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.339
 legislated basically can use the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.310
 but on brush day the effect will be 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.070
 different is there I will not say it is 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.560
 very easy to apply and so for 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.020
 you climb that have not yet entered 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.050
 A lot of makeup is a bit 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 I'm afraid and try on a designer 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.680
 I think this is a great product for 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.230
 we start because it's very easy 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.150
 application and it is easy to 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.909
 any error so far only goes there with 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.850
 swabs smoke and any error makes it 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.460
 simple as this is ours, there is a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.150
 year in cream gel with you guys 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.960
 to call 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:46.010
 then we have alan it is also very 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.560
 famous that Iran is this player 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.409
 we'll meet with the Basque brushes 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.290
 maintains two variants how many filters or 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.000
 so brush because you can already 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.010
 you want to go pro elaine aquino 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.409
 try this tip as I go 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.100
 show why it is much wants accounts 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.490
 filter is much easier while 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.700
 the others sometimes have as many people 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.560
 They go back and forth from side on way 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.870
 in a so I think we are 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.390
 practice much more than helping us 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.459
 ian so it can reduce more 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.500
 brush stroke 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.500
 which lead Bayern Munich by 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.599
 example in comparison to it neither cream 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.300
 the advantage is that it will get a trace 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.120
 much cleaner much more defined if 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.080
 Do you like what is t'ai that? 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.690
 ali liner even almost of the genre opinion 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.989
 so he had the same commitment and 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.220
 I think it's going to be your hainer dare 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.019
 now if you want it is not even smoked 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.760
 anything that is criminal textures to 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.170
 I give you more now 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.239
 of all machines and until it gets more 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.370
 in Flemish but it's also what I want is 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.510
 I need to be better because the minimum 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.489
 mistake makes everything fight then we have too 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:09.160
 the irineu powder in which you can 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.370
 use with where I am showing 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.760
 these things are what you want in 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.459
 that we have here iran powder and you 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.889
 can be used with a dry brush or 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.010
 was a much more 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:27.370
 formed much more natural wet goes 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.769
 become more similar with the machine of the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.170
 team I just showed you what 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:36.430
 will make a much cleaner stroke with 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.010
 the advantage that if I want to smoke 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.560
 this product is powder can smoke a lot 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.959
 better than a liquid product 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.810
 especially when it is liquid to the test 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.150
 and I do not smoke but it was soon 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.579
 but you can use both 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.470
 variants in dry salt for those who have 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.720
 more fear fights more fights for like this 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.569
 say or just who wants a look 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.299
 more shopping and thinking wet for who 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.880
 wants me to go more assumed and that already 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:07.720
 you have more security in your dash and now 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.930
 to finish let's talk about a type going 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.200
 there is that elaine in pencil in which we 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.109
 we have for example an innovative pencil 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.130
 that what you do not need to spin 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.480
 just go up and down and then we have the 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.840
 pencil spinning pencil 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.970
 a traditional one of the flagship that we already 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.910
 we did and we managed to control 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.700
 postures of the spout through the 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.350
 many of these airliners pencil as 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.170
 You want to call the hillside 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.390
 and it never had any 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.330
 turns out to be very practical for us 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.880
 here we have a blurred effect the pencil is 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.680
 The effect is very similar to that of a 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.810
 gel panel 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.140
 the only difference is that maybe the 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.560
 all the teams that I showed here today 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.600
 I get less defined ie have the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.660
 tendency to fall behind so they create more 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.460
 because they also point to a 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.310
 thicker path 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.980
 but so much that they let us smoke better 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.310
 and it is that I also caused many mistakes 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.370
 because the minimum to the minimum in the swab 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.890
 or call we can disguise all the 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.150
 mistakes that we create and ready to 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.370
 money online 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.010
 so a general way is clear that we 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.500
 we have many on the market we have lots 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.060
 news and more and more brands will 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.400
 to invent even if I do not have 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.840
 pest problems new products 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.450
 but overall I'm here 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.820
 explained or comes out in the 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.960
 we find and you can cause 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.550
 ways 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.380
 it is clear that every product that is the 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.750
 waterproof will set pound during 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.570
 much longer and every product that does not 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.310
 and it's going to happen exactly the opposite 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.190
 those that are easier to apply 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.290
 are those in cream or even powder when the 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.930
 brush is dry and the ones that are bigger 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.000
 definition of the trace that is a toy or 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.190
 thomas then with a wet brush will 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.480
 be a more difficult crime but trafficking 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.580
 it's more like it 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.070
 so I hope these tips the 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.560
 young man at the point of purchase where you 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.990
 choose the week plus a frame 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.760
 caused the leak for these and many 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.560
 more information and leave everything 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.600
 available on my block that the 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.030
 here information down the road 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.150
 as usual it can can also 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.950
 to follow the instagram by the flow by 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.449
 these facts do not tire too 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.129
 imply in facebook's taste 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:34.639
 very happy on this side saints who 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:36.919
 came back giving the session every day 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.809
 or must have stopped whoever arrives 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.249
 some time must be that I 

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:42.110
 I disappeared for a while. 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:44.569
 this is because I had however is not that 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.580
 I have forgotten that voice is not 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.499
 I really do not want to leave. 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.629
 follows are not major objectives of the year 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.430
 I had a virus with even a crucible 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:53.330
 graphs extended for about one 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.430
 week 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.219
 I think what matters is that I'm already in the back 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.289
 I'm already uploading videos again 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:01.789
 I'm ready for you, I do not know if you 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.039
 they repaired a large one in front 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:07.370
 because I also have promotions 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:09.620
 plural and the lights are different from 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.330
 condition is in front study was done 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.580
 To think with great affection for
