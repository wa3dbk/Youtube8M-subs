00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
automatically through a little program

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.280

in order for you to run HD texture packs
which<00:00:10.530> look<00:00:10.740> really<00:00:11.010> great<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.460> though<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.059> is

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
which look really great and though it is

which look really great and though it is
not<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.570> mod<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.710> on<00:00:13.889> servers

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
not a mod you can do this on servers

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.160 
not a mod you can do this on servers
like<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.630> client-side<00:00:16.020> on

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
like you can do it client-side on

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.310 
like you can do it client-side on
servers<00:00:16.820> and<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.359> won't<00:00:18.510> get<00:00:18.600> banned<00:00:18.779> don't

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
servers and you won't get banned don't

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.019 
servers and you won't get banned don't
have<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.859> feel<00:00:20.039> guilty<00:00:20.070> because<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.850> think

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
have to feel guilty because you think

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.939 
have to feel guilty because you think
your<00:00:21.119> modding<00:00:21.420> or<00:00:21.539> anything<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.470> perfectly

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
your modding or anything it's perfectly

you<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.020> figuring<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.619> what<00:01:22.799> version

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
you know it's figuring out what version

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.320 
you know it's figuring out what version
of<00:01:23.070> Minecraft<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.729> how<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
of Minecraft you have how it's going to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.320 
of Minecraft you have how it's going to
install<00:01:24.600> things<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.740> fine<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.640> what

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
install things and it's fine just what

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.690 
install things and it's fine just what
up<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.659> quickly<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> need<00:01:29.579> to

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
up really quickly so now you need to
check<00:01:29.880> HD<00:01:30.329> textures<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:31.079> HD<00:01:31.500> Fox<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.950> can

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
check HD textures in HD Fox you can

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980 
check HD textures in HD Fox you can
choose<00:01:32.460> things<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.939> Qatar<00:01:33.150> grass<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:33.720> this
