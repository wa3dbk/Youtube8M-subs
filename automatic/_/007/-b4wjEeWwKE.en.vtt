types<00:00:57.149> overall<00:00:57.660> generally<00:00:58.109> aren't<00:00:58.379> showing<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
types overall generally aren't showing a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.799 
types overall generally aren't showing a
lot<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.859> love<00:00:59.100> each<00:00:59.340> generation<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> think

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
lot of love each generation so I think

that for first Jim one of the three

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.910 
that for first Jim one of the three

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
shit ton of fire types introduced so I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
think the fire type eeveelution is just

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.550

it's just amazing I love it now even
though<00:01:31.680> most<00:01:31.890> evolutions<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.689> same

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049

like<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.450> said<00:01:39.810> flareon<00:01:40.380> lacked<00:01:40.710> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
like I just said flareon lacked that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.469 
like I just said flareon lacked that
moveset<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:41.700> why<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.000> number<00:01:42.240> 5<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
moveset that's why it was number 5 I

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.210 
moveset that's why it was number 5 I
like<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.770> move<00:01:43.950> set

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
like it but I just like that move set

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.780 
like it but I just like that move set
for<00:01:44.670> me<00:01:44.880> Vaporeon<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.899> number<00:01:46.200> 4<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:47.460> because

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
for me Vaporeon is number 4 just because

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.810 
for me Vaporeon is number 4 just because
I<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.270> don't<00:01:48.540> care<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.840> its<00:01:49.140> design<00:01:49.470> um<00:01:49.820> to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
I really don't care for its design um to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.810 
I really don't care for its design um to
me<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> think<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> idea<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.549> water

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
me I think with just the idea of a water

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.330 
me I think with just the idea of a water
type<00:01:54.149> evolution<00:01:54.810> there's<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.619> many<00:01:55.890> things

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
type evolution there's so many things

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.190 
type evolution there's so many things
that<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.640> could<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:56.939> done<00:01:57.200> involving

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that they could have done involving

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.230 
that they could have done involving
water<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.770> know<00:01:58.890> water<00:01:59.159> makes<00:01:59.399> up<00:01:59.579> so<00:01:59.939> much<00:02:00.180> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
water you know water makes up so much of

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.969 
water you know water makes up so much of
our<00:02:00.540> daily<00:02:00.750> life<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.409> whether<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.770> comes

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
our daily life you know whether it comes

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.700 
our daily life you know whether it comes
to<00:02:02.390> mythical<00:02:03.390> stories<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.079> average

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to mythical stories or just average

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.319 
to mythical stories or just average
everyday<00:02:04.950> things<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> know<00:02:05.729> there's<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.210> many

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
everyday things you know there's so many

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.359 
everyday things you know there's so many
different<00:02:06.659> things<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:07.049> water<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.890> part<00:02:08.250> of

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
different things that water is a part of

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.190 
different things that water is a part of
so<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> think<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.050> like

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
so I think that just going for like

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.230 
so I think that just going for like
adding

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
adding

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.810 
adding
in<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.570> tail<00:02:11.840> like<00:02:12.380> like<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> fishtail<00:02:13.220> or<00:02:13.670> some

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
in a tail like like a fishtail or some

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.190 
in a tail like like a fishtail or some
shit<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.090> saying<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.450> it's<00:02:14.570> mistaken<00:02:15.020> for<00:02:15.140> a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
shit and saying that it's mistaken for a

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.230 
shit and saying that it's mistaken for a
mermaid<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:16.100> me<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.340> think<00:02:16.820> they<00:02:16.940> could<00:02:17.150> have

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
mermaid to me I think they could have

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.940 
mermaid to me I think they could have
just<00:02:17.420> done<00:02:17.690> more<00:02:18.020> that's<00:02:18.290> all<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.650> is

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
just done more that's all it is

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.170 
just done more that's all it is
you<00:02:19.040> know<00:02:19.130> I<00:02:19.160> mean<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.400> don't<00:02:19.520> have<00:02:19.640> any<00:02:19.820> hate<00:02:20.000> on

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
you know I mean I don't have any hate on

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.300 
you know I mean I don't have any hate on
Vaporeon<00:02:20.780> water<00:02:21.410> types<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.860> my<00:02:21.950> favorite

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
Vaporeon water types of my favorite

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.330 
Vaporeon water types of my favorite
types<00:02:22.460> of<00:02:22.730> Vaporeon<00:02:23.530> sometimes<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:24.710> under

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
types of Vaporeon sometimes I under

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.950 
types of Vaporeon sometimes I under
blowing<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.640> Vaporeon<00:02:26.180> just<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.690> think<00:02:26.750> the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
blowing the Vaporeon just I think the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.810 
blowing the Vaporeon just I think the
design<00:02:27.290> just<00:02:27.320> could<00:02:27.830> have<00:02:27.920> been<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> lot<00:02:28.190> better

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.330

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.620 
have Glacia now for you guys that
haven't<00:02:37.130> noticed<00:02:37.550> already<00:02:37.730> I'm<00:02:38.030> not<00:02:38.210> actually

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
haven't noticed already I'm not actually

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.320 
haven't noticed already I'm not actually
including<00:02:39.320> Eevee<00:02:39.860> in<00:02:40.070> this<00:02:40.400> top<00:02:40.760> five<00:02:41.090> these

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
including Eevee in this top five these

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.400 
including Eevee in this top five these
are<00:02:41.480> eeveelutions

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
are eeveelutions

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.230 
are eeveelutions
so<00:02:42.890> like<00:02:43.070> Eevee<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.580> doesn't<00:02:43.880> count<00:02:44.060> like

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
so like Eevee just doesn't count like

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.510 
so like Eevee just doesn't count like
he's<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.690> evolutions<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.470> even<00:02:45.920> by<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
he's just the evolutions of even by the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.190 
he's just the evolutions of even by the
way<00:02:46.700> we<00:02:46.880> have<00:02:47.000> Glaceon<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.720> number<00:02:47.960> three

way we have Glaceon in the number three

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.840 
way we have Glaceon in the number three
slot<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:48.920> be<00:02:49.010> honest<00:02:49.250> with<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.460> guys<00:02:49.490> when

I<00:02:49.880> first<00:02:50.180> saw<00:02:50.420> Glaceon<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.290> leafy<00:02:51.560> on<00:02:51.680> when

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
I first saw Glaceon and leafy on when

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.310 
I first saw Glaceon and leafy on when
forth<00:02:52.520> Jim<00:02:52.730> first<00:02:52.910> came<00:02:53.180> out<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:53.570> thought<00:02:54.110> they

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
forth Jim first came out I thought they

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.180 
forth Jim first came out I thought they
were<00:02:54.380> complete<00:02:54.980> as<00:02:55.630> completely<00:02:56.630> unoriginal

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
were complete as completely unoriginal

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.890 
were complete as completely unoriginal
completely<00:02:58.190> just<00:02:58.460> like<00:02:58.640> what<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.150> fuck<00:02:59.630> I

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
completely just like what the fuck I

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.750 
completely just like what the fuck I
still<00:03:00.500> feel<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.710> way<00:03:00.800> about<00:03:00.980> Leafeon<00:03:01.490> I

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
still feel that way about Leafeon I

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.000 
still feel that way about Leafeon I
think<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> name<00:03:02.330> Leafeon<00:03:02.960> is<00:03:03.350> completely

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
think the name Leafeon is completely

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.130 
think the name Leafeon is completely
unoriginal<00:03:04.250> leaf<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.360> itself<00:03:05.660> was<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> decent

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
unoriginal leaf on itself was a decent

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.900 
unoriginal leaf on itself was a decent
Pokemon<00:03:06.560> don't<00:03:06.680> get<00:03:06.770> me<00:03:06.830> wrong<00:03:06.890> it's<00:03:07.280> just<00:03:07.760> I

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
Pokemon don't get me wrong it's just I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.190 
Pokemon don't get me wrong it's just I
feel<00:03:08.510> like<00:03:08.570> they<00:03:08.720> could<00:03:08.810> have<00:03:08.870> done<00:03:09.020> more

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
feel like they could have done more

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.380 
feel like they could have done more
exist<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.190> could<00:03:10.340> have<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:10.460> been<00:03:10.670> better<00:03:10.910> but

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
exist it could have just been better but

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.910 
exist it could have just been better but
for<00:03:11.450> me<00:03:11.690> glaze<00:03:11.930> sound<00:03:12.260> like<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.500> said<00:03:12.710> I<00:03:12.740> didn't

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
really like it at first but um slowly
