00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
hi guys done I just wanted to give you

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.130 
hi guys done I just wanted to give you
guys<00:00:03.780> an<00:00:04.080> update<00:00:04.549> I<00:00:05.549> had<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.600> change<00:00:06.899> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
guys an update I had to change the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.079 
guys an update I had to change the
controller<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> drill<00:00:11.690> to<00:00:12.690> speed

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
controller on this to a drill to speed

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.420 
controller on this to a drill to speed
basically<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.179> turn<00:00:15.859> set<00:00:16.859> temperature<00:00:17.250> on

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
basically to turn set temperature on

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.849 
basically to turn set temperature on
whatever<00:00:17.970> temperature<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.359> set<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.859> with

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
whatever temperature you set it on with

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.580 
whatever temperature you set it on with
this<00:00:19.980> little<00:00:20.039> set<00:00:20.699> screw<00:00:20.730> here<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:24.750> when<00:00:25.529> I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
this little set screw here it's when I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.720 
this little set screw here it's when I
spoke<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.010> them<00:00:26.099> they<00:00:26.220> said<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.670> supposed

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
spoke with them they said it's supposed

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.339 
spoke with them they said it's supposed
to<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:27.000> said<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.439> some<00:00:28.439> around<00:00:28.619> 185<00:00:29.070> 180<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.119> 190

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
to be said it some around 185 180 to 190

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.799 
to be said it some around 185 180 to 190
so<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.380> really<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:33.000> screwing<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.420> everything

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so I really not screwing with everything

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.639 
so I really not screwing with everything
but<00:00:34.649> uh<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.850> second<00:00:36.270> fan<00:00:36.450> will<00:00:36.630> turn<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.020> at

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
but uh in the second fan will turn on at

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.889 
but uh in the second fan will turn on at
15<00:00:38.040> degrees<00:00:38.309> hotter<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.540> really<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.750> really

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
15 degrees hotter so I really I really

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.000 
15 degrees hotter so I really I really
enjoyed<00:00:43.320> using<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.239> PWM<00:00:45.239> controllers<00:00:45.950> but<00:00:46.950> uh

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
enjoyed using the PWM controllers but uh

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.240 
enjoyed using the PWM controllers but uh
there's<00:00:48.000> there<00:00:48.390> was<00:00:48.420> an<00:00:48.629> issue<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> had<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
there's there was an issue so I had to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.029 
there's there was an issue so I had to
switch<00:00:50.370> over<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.000> type<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> controller

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
switch over to this type of controller

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.380 
switch over to this type of controller
but<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:53.879> figured<00:00:53.910> out

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
but I think I got it all figured out

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.510 
but I think I got it all figured out
it's<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.500> little<00:00:55.710> bit<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:55.949> wiring<00:00:56.280> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it's just a little bit more wiring that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.400 
it's just a little bit more wiring that
I<00:00:56.640> wanted<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:59.600> think<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.260> got

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
I wanted to do but I think I think I got

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.229 
I wanted to do but I think I think I got
it<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.590> figured<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.980> these<00:01:02.579> these<00:01:02.910> four

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it all figured out these these four

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.539 
it all figured out these these four
these<00:01:04.049> four<00:01:04.110> kits<00:01:04.970> as<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.510> here<00:01:07.549> I've

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
these four kits as you can see here I've

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.990 
these four kits as you can see here I've
been<00:01:09.920> sitting<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.310> two<00:01:11.790> months

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
been sitting here for about two months

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.410 
been sitting here for about two months
because<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.020> waiting<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.340> controllers<00:01:14.420> but

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
because I was waiting on controllers but

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.980 
because I was waiting on controllers but
I<00:01:15.479> got<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.170> derale<00:01:16.470> controller<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
I got the derale controller and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.950 
I got the derale controller and
literally<00:01:18.990> got<00:01:19.259> them<00:01:19.409> within<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:20.220> days

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
literally got them within like two days

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
literally got them within like two days
you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.290> some<00:01:22.470> differences<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.759> this

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you can see some differences with this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.020 
you can see some differences with this
one<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.270> also<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.110> end<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.680> using<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.159> temperature

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
one I also I end up using a temperature

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.999 
one I also I end up using a temperature
sensor<00:01:27.570> actually<00:01:28.200> goes<00:01:28.500> an<00:01:28.650> upper<00:01:28.860> radiator

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
sensor actually goes an upper radiator

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.980 
sensor actually goes an upper radiator
hose<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.329> some<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> previous

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
hose kind of like some of the previous

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.760 
hose kind of like some of the previous
ones<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.320> did<00:01:33.079> these<00:01:34.079> four<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> went<00:01:34.590> ahead<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
ones I did these four I went ahead and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.569 
ones I did these four I went ahead and
built<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> harness<00:01:35.930> just<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.490> know

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
built the harness just because you know

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.850 
built the harness just because you know
I<00:01:38.610> kind<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.000> feel<00:01:39.150> bad<00:01:39.350> it's<00:01:40.350> been<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.770> on

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
I kind of feel bad it's been going on

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.460 
I kind of feel bad it's been going on
for<00:01:41.100> two<00:01:41.280> months<00:01:41.630> I'm<00:01:42.630> actually<00:01:42.930> kind<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
for two months I'm actually kind of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.310 
for two months I'm actually kind of
surprised<00:01:43.860> nobody<00:01:44.630> turn<00:01:45.630> me<00:01:45.659> into<00:01:45.899> PayPal

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
surprised nobody turn me into PayPal

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.770 
surprised nobody turn me into PayPal
over<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.579> tomorrow<00:01:48.210> should<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
over this but tomorrow should have it

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.810 
over this but tomorrow should have it
shipped<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.130> get<00:01:50.340> my<00:01:50.460> way<00:01:50.579> out<00:01:50.729> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
shipped out if I can get my way out of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.990 
shipped out if I can get my way out of

guys install it as you can see here
there's<00:02:02.850> ignition<00:02:03.390> wire<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.930> one<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.320> do

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
there's ignition wire this one you do

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.180 
there's ignition wire this one you do
have<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.710> run<00:02:04.829> ignition<00:02:05.250> wire<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.979> use

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
have to run ignition wire you just use

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.630 
have to run ignition wire you just use
that<00:02:08.369> open<00:02:08.670> relay<00:02:09.030> there<00:02:09.599> really<00:02:10.459> would<00:02:11.459> be

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
that open relay there really would be

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.070 
that open relay there really would be
but<00:02:12.180> most<00:02:12.360> these<00:02:12.480> trucks<00:02:12.750> are<00:02:12.810> gonna<00:02:12.930> have

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
but most these trucks are gonna have

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.610 
but most these trucks are gonna have
their<00:02:13.200> real

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
their real

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.800 
their real
I'm<00:02:14.310> not<00:02:14.459> actually<00:02:14.819> not<00:02:14.970> even<00:02:15.090> sure<00:02:15.330> it's<00:02:15.510> four

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
I'm not actually not even sure it's four

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.289 
I'm not actually not even sure it's four
but<00:02:16.080> that's<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.709> good<00:02:16.860> ignition<00:02:17.310> source<00:02:19.190> before

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
but that's a good ignition source before

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.720 
but that's a good ignition source before
the<00:02:21.299> wiring<00:02:21.569> harness<00:02:21.870> actually<00:02:22.409> went<00:02:23.310> up

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the wiring harness actually went up

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.990 
the wiring harness actually went up
around<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.569> front<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.989> truck<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.409> around

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.930 
around in front of the truck and around
I<00:02:27.739> felt<00:02:28.739> like<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.069> was<00:02:29.190> necessary<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:29.819> go

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
I felt like it was necessary just go

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.759 
I felt like it was necessary just go
ahead<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.239> run<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.540> wires<00:02:30.870> straight

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769

electric<00:04:29.650> fan<00:04:29.890> kids<00:04:30.190> form<00:04:30.520> but<00:04:31.180> uh<00:04:31.770> anyway

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
electric fan kids form but uh anyway

electric fan kids form but uh anyway
well<00:04:33.280> I<00:04:33.490> guess<00:04:33.850> I'll<00:04:34.030> let<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.360> guys<00:04:34.480> go<00:04:34.720> I

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
well I guess I'll let you guys go I

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.240 
well I guess I'll let you guys go I
guess<00:04:35.320> there's<00:04:35.590> one<00:04:35.710> more<00:04:35.890> thing<00:04:36.070> actually

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
guess there's one more thing actually

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.680 
guess there's one more thing actually

fan this this Bank is a green wire that

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.330 
fan this this Bank is a green wire that
we<00:04:48.880> turn<00:04:49.120> your<00:04:49.300> AC<00:04:49.570> on<00:04:50.040> turn<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.190> don't

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
we turn your AC on turn it you don't

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.630 
we turn your AC on turn it you don't
wanna<00:04:51.460> turns<00:04:51.640> one<00:04:51.970> one<00:04:52.630> fan<00:04:52.870> on<00:04:53.140> I<00:04:53.380> think<00:04:54.340> I

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
wanna turns one one fan on I think I

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.860 
wanna turns one one fan on I think I
think<00:04:54.910> I've<00:04:54.970> got<00:04:55.120> this<00:04:55.240> one<00:04:55.420> hooked<00:04:55.540> up<00:04:55.720> for

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
think I've got this one hooked up for

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.610 
think I've got this one hooked up for
that<00:04:56.020> but<00:04:56.890> uh<00:04:56.920> this<00:04:57.640> this<00:04:58.120> wiring<00:04:58.390> harness

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
that but uh this this wiring harness

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.280 
that but uh this this wiring harness
goes<00:04:59.620> all<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.830> way<00:04:59.920> down<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.400> clutch<00:05:01.290> you

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
goes all the way down to the clutch you

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.020 
goes all the way down to the clutch you
see<00:05:02.800> where<00:05:02.950> I've<00:05:03.010> got<00:05:03.160> it<00:05:03.250> hooked<00:05:03.370> up<00:05:03.550> there<00:05:03.790> I

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
see where I've got it hooked up there I

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.410 
see where I've got it hooked up there I
just<00:05:04.600> did<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.380> military-style<00:05:06.300> saw<00:05:07.300> our

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
just did a military-style saw our

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.350 
just did a military-style saw our
connection<00:05:07.840> just<00:05:07.990> make<00:05:08.530> a<00:05:08.560> cut<00:05:08.860> in<00:05:09.040> the<00:05:09.880> the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
connection just make a cut in the the

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.870 
connection just make a cut in the the
covering<00:05:10.780> for<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.470> wire<00:05:11.680> just<00:05:12.400> wrap<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.640> wire

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
covering for the wire just wrap a wire

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.970 
covering for the wire just wrap a wire
around<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.420> solder<00:05:13.630> it<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.560> then<00:05:14.770> you<00:05:14.950> uh

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
around and solder it and then you uh

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.700 
around and solder it and then you uh
heat<00:05:15.640> shrink<00:05:15.910> it<00:05:16.060> but<00:05:16.810> inside<00:05:17.140> that<00:05:17.200> harness

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
heat shrink it but inside that harness

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.460 
heat shrink it but inside that harness
then<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.280> clutch<00:05:18.520> is<00:05:19.060> a<00:05:19.120> red<00:05:19.330> wire<00:05:19.570> that's

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
then the clutch is a red wire that's

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.980 
then the clutch is a red wire that's
read<00:05:20.710> when<00:05:20.890> I<00:05:20.920> hooked<00:05:21.070> that<00:05:21.250> up<00:05:21.310> I<00:05:21.750> don't<00:05:22.750> think

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
read when I hooked that up I don't think

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.180 
read when I hooked that up I don't think
it's<00:05:23.230> still<00:05:23.320> necessary<00:05:23.620> to<00:05:23.920> hook<00:05:24.070> at<00:05:24.160> the

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
it's still necessary to hook at the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.330 
it's still necessary to hook at the
green<00:05:24.430> wire<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:25.720> went<00:05:26.080> ahead<00:05:26.170> did<00:05:26.410> mine

air-condition wire hooked up on the
previous<00:05:43.840> controllers<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:44.740> didn't<00:05:45.520> see<00:05:45.640> an

previous controllers I didn't see an
issue<00:05:45.820> but<00:05:46.440> anyway<00:05:47.440> with<00:05:47.980> the<00:05:48.070> ones<00:05:48.250> that<00:05:48.400> I'm

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
issue but anyway with the ones that I'm

issue but anyway with the ones that I'm
sending<00:05:48.760> out<00:05:48.970> the<00:05:49.660> green<00:05:49.870> wire<00:05:50.080> will<00:05:50.290> to

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
sending out the green wire will to

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.140 
sending out the green wire will to
actually<00:05:50.650> terminate<00:05:50.980> over<00:05:51.160> here<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.790> used<00:05:52.090> to

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
actually terminate over here and used to

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.440 
actually terminate over here and used to
run<00:05:52.330> it<00:05:52.419> back<00:05:53.430> is<00:05:54.430> that<00:05:54.760> I've<00:05:55.060> been<00:05:55.120> honest<00:05:55.360> if

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
run it back is that I've been honest if

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.850 
run it back is that I've been honest if
there<00:05:55.540> was<00:05:55.630> someplace<00:05:55.810> in<00:05:56.169> here<00:05:56.350> you<00:05:56.470> can<00:05:56.620> hook

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
there was someplace in here you can hook

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.860 
there was someplace in here you can hook
up<00:05:56.980> that<00:05:57.100> green<00:05:57.340> wire<00:05:57.550> but<00:05:58.270> they<00:05:58.390> see<00:05:58.450> but<00:05:58.780> I

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
up that green wire but they see but I

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.050 
up that green wire but they see but I
couldn't<00:05:59.169> find<00:05:59.290> anything<00:05:59.530> and<00:05:59.770> you<00:06:00.060> think

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
couldn't find anything and you think

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.540 
couldn't find anything and you think
it's<00:06:01.180> underneath<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:01.630> dash<00:06:01.840> but<00:06:02.400> all<00:06:03.400> right

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
it's underneath the dash but all right

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.400 
it's underneath the dash but all right
