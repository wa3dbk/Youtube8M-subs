00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:10.376
 Good morning, Katrina. 

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:12.276
 Good morning, Captain Whitaker. 

00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:14.744
 Here is the report with the 102 passengers on board. 

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:16.979
 Arrange them, we'll leave. 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.113
 How are you feeling, Whip? 

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:30.580
 Looks like you did an incredible maneuver, man. 

00:00:31.237 --> 00:00:31.937
 He saved many lives. 

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:36.751
 We're losing altitude. 

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:37.698
 I'm out of control. 

00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:39.800
 Are we going to fall? Hold your positions. 

00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:42.469
 The way it landed has no explanation if not a miracle. 

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:44.959
 I do not see anything, just houses! 

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:47.647
 Evan, listen to me, we'll put our nose down. 

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:49.992
 The plane smashed to 30,000 feet. 

00:00:50.862 --> 00:00:52.925
 Let's give it a Looping. What do you mean, a '' Looping ''? 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.172
 Ready? Here we go. 

00:00:57.574 --> 00:00:58.808
 FEBRUARY 22, 2013 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:02.892
 I'm on the list, honey. 

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:05.811
 It's an absurdity of people of all kinds waiting for you. 

00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:06.998
 You're a celebrity, man. 

00:01:06.998 --> 00:01:09.552
 You will never have to pay for a drink while you live. 

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:11.820
 Captain Whitaker is a true American hero. 

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:14.077
 This is your lawyer, he came from Chicago. 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.358
 Why do I need a lawyer? 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.573
 Do not you remember the blood test you did on the day of the accident? 

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:21.612
 There was alcohol in her body. You can spend your life in prison. 

00:01:22.347 --> 00:01:23.626
 THE WINNER OF OSCAR 

00:01:25.998 --> 00:01:27.349
 The hearing begins in 10 days. 

00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:29.510
 It will be under pressure. 

00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:30.508
 Are you hiding something? 

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:31.932
 DIRECTOR OF '' NAUFRAGO '' AND '' FORREST GUMP '' 

00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:35.877
 Are you going to shoot me? I can enter? 

00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:37.934
 Yes, come in. I'll shoot you in there. 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.742
 That was an act of God. Do you think God would do that? 

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:44.021
 Our investigators will conclude that the aircraft failed. 

00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.918
 The FAA has put ten pilots in simulators recreating the events. 

00:01:47.918 --> 00:01:51.175
 Each pilot killed everyone on board. You're the only one who could. 

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:55.084
 You saved my mother. 

00:01:58.107 --> 00:02:00.770
 I'd like to talk about the days leading up to the accident. 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:02.247
 This whole thing is killing me. 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.781
 Get out! 

00:02:04.548 --> 00:02:06.349
 I drank the night before the flight. 

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:08.341
 Does Whitaker know he will be arrested? 

00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:09.599
 My client will not be arrested. 

00:02:10.303 --> 00:02:11.881
 That's a lie Whip ... It's a lie. 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.058
 I'm trying to save your life! What life? 

00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:18.864
 We're going to hit! 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.222
 Prepare for impact. 

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:24.580
 No one could land that plane as I landed. 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.563
 The flight 

00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:29.013
