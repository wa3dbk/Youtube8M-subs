00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.750 

good<00:00:01.020> ideas<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.740> my<00:00:02.010> custom<00:00:02.280> fishing

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
good ideas this is my custom fishing

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.539 
good ideas this is my custom fishing
pack<00:00:03.000> on<00:00:03.149> my<00:00:03.300> toe<00:00:03.360> here<00:00:03.689> I've<00:00:04.279> rewired<00:00:05.279> the

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
pack on my toe here I've rewired the

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.610 
pack on my toe here I've rewired the
whole<00:00:05.730> lot<00:00:05.940> I've<00:00:06.150> got<00:00:06.509> two<00:00:07.049> point<00:00:07.440> two

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
whole lot I've got two point two

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.400 
whole lot I've got two point two
millimeter<00:00:08.099> wire<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:08.790> now<00:00:09.260> originally<00:00:10.260> it

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
millimeter wire on it now originally it

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.720 
millimeter wire on it now originally it
had<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.830> 0.8<00:00:11.429> millimeter<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> it's<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.460> lot

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
had the 0.8 millimeter so it's a lot

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.720 
had the 0.8 millimeter so it's a lot
bigger<00:00:14.940> wire<00:00:15.299> I've<00:00:15.599> got<00:00:16.289> two<00:00:17.100> extra<00:00:17.369> turns

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
bigger wire I've got two extra turns

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.189 
bigger wire I've got two extra turns
over<00:00:18.350> what<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.970> one<00:00:20.970> millimeter<00:00:21.480> wire<00:00:21.750> has<00:00:22.020> on

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
over what the one millimeter wire has on

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.769 
over what the one millimeter wire has on
it<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.250> millimeter<00:00:23.670> why<00:00:23.880> has<00:00:24.090> 44

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
it so the one millimeter why has 44

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.859 
it so the one millimeter why has 44
turns<00:00:25.019> I've<00:00:25.230> got<00:00:25.350> 46<00:00:26.189> turns<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:27.470> 2.2<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.619> here

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
turns I've got 46 turns of 2.2 on here

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.240 
turns I've got 46 turns of 2.2 on here
I've<00:00:31.349> got<00:00:32.149> taken<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.480> knee<00:00:34.170> taking<00:00:35.100> out

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I've got taken out the knee taking out

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.459 
I've got taken out the knee taking out
those<00:00:35.399> ceramic<00:00:35.850> magnets<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> step

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
those ceramic magnets out of the step

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.639 
those ceramic magnets out of the step
out<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> road<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.489> put<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.820> these

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
out of the road are not put in these

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.299 
out of the road are not put in these
near<00:00:40.649> diamonds<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:41.940> them<00:00:42.120> there

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
near diamonds if you can see them there

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
near diamonds if you can see them there
this<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.660> magnet<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.780> bottom<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
this a magnet on the bottom on the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020 
this a magnet on the bottom on the
magnet<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.500> top<00:00:46.649> stuff<00:00:47.039> used<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.520> I've<00:00:47.700> doubled

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
magnet on top stuff used to I've doubled

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.970 
magnet on top stuff used to I've doubled
them<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> best<00:00:49.170> dick<00:00:49.500> nice<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.920> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
them up to get the best dick nice for it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.970 
them up to get the best dick nice for it
was<00:00:50.129> available<00:00:51.320> there<00:00:52.320> about<00:00:52.500> 10<00:00:52.739> times

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
was available there about 10 times

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.600 
was available there about 10 times
stronger<00:00:53.280> maybe<00:00:53.610> more<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.379> than<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> ceramic

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
stronger maybe more so than the ceramic

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.360 
stronger maybe more so than the ceramic
so<00:00:56.989> it's<00:00:57.989> not<00:00:58.230> making<00:00:58.440> good<00:00:58.680> power<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.190> thing

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
so it's not making good power this thing

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.060 
so it's not making good power this thing
I've<00:00:59.489> already<00:00:59.730> run<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.090> that's<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.649> it's<00:01:01.649> making

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
I've already run it that's a it's making

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.340 
I've already run it that's a it's making
2<00:01:02.969> kilowatt<00:01:04.280> but<00:01:05.280> my<00:01:05.549> problem<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.060> these<00:01:07.020> calls

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
2 kilowatt but my problem is these calls

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.649 
2 kilowatt but my problem is these calls
are<00:01:07.619> getting<00:01:07.770> very<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:09.000> hot<00:01:11.270> I'm<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.479> sure

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
are getting very very hot I'm not sure

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.590 
are getting very very hot I'm not sure
if<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.430> will<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> cave<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
if it will be a cave on at that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.330 
if it will be a cave on at that
temperature<00:01:15.930> or<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.380> certainly<00:01:16.830> creates<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
temperature or not certainly creates a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.990 
temperature or not certainly creates a
little<00:01:17.460> bit<00:01:17.549> more<00:01:17.670> resistance<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:19.729> I'm<00:01:20.729> going

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
little bit more resistance but I'm going

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.929 
little bit more resistance but I'm going
to<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> somehow<00:01:21.659> look<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.670> how<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> make

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to have to somehow look at how to make

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.609 
to have to somehow look at how to make
some<00:01:24.240> sort<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.479> cooling<00:01:24.869> system<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.560> I'm

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
some sort of cooling system on it so I'm

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.370 
some sort of cooling system on it so I'm
a<00:01:25.650> better<00:01:25.860> fan<00:01:26.159> than<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.729> got<00:01:27.150> up<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
a better fan than what I have got up you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.749 
a better fan than what I have got up you
can<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.920> side<00:01:29.630> whoops<00:01:31.490> not<00:01:32.490> sure<00:01:32.700> if

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
can see on this side whoops not sure if

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.160 
can see on this side whoops not sure if
you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.329> I've<00:01:33.450> drilled<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:33.840> extra

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
you can see that I've drilled out extra

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.420 
you can see that I've drilled out extra
holes<00:01:34.380> along<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.720> cool<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
holes along here so that you can cool a

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.170 
holes along here so that you can cool a
little<00:01:38.430> bit<00:01:38.640> better<00:01:40.670> before<00:01:41.670> when<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> was

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
little bit better before when I was

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.120 
little bit better before when I was
running<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.720> bridge<00:01:43.170> rectifiers<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.860> didn't

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
running the bridge rectifiers I didn't

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.499 
running the bridge rectifiers I didn't
have<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> heatsink<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.210> these<00:01:45.329> were

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
have the heatsink on and these were

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.050 
have the heatsink on and these were
getting<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:45.930> hot<00:01:46.110> they<00:01:46.259> were<00:01:46.380> smoking<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.060> I

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
getting so hot they were smoking and I

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.730 
getting so hot they were smoking and I
thought<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.479> was<00:01:48.600> way<00:01:48.780> too<00:01:48.840> hot<00:01:49.170> even<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.619> I

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
thought that was way too hot even if I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.399 
thought that was way too hot even if I
put<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.009> heatsink<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.840> put<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
put the heatsink on but I put the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.530 
put the heatsink on but I put the
heatsink<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:54.119> makes<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.509> huge

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
heatsink on and it makes a huge

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.450 
heatsink on and it makes a huge
difference<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.320> didn't<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.979> would<00:01:56.130> but

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
difference I didn't think it would but

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.340 
difference I didn't think it would but
it<00:01:56.850> does<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.570> as<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> white

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
it does and as you can see the white

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.130 
it does and as you can see the white
stuffing<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.890> oh<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.399> hate<00:02:00.060> heat<00:02:00.659> transfer

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
stuffing is oh I hate heat transfer

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.209 
stuffing is oh I hate heat transfer
paste<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:03.060> got<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:03.979> now<00:02:04.979> what<00:02:05.130> I'll

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
paste so got that on there now what I'll

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.359 
paste so got that on there now what I'll
do<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.430> I'll<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.880> fire<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.079> up<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:08.160> I'll

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
do is I'll just fire this up and I'll

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.170 
do is I'll just fire this up and I'll
show<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.789> amps<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:10.640> vaults<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.940> vault

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
show the amps and the vaults the vault

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.140 
show the amps and the vaults the vault
so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
so

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.089 
so
I'm<00:02:13.299> going<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.540> run<00:02:13.659> it<00:02:13.780> at<00:02:13.870> 500<00:02:14.440> rpm<00:02:14.799> and<00:02:15.010> then

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
I'm going to run it at 500 rpm and then

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.839 
I'm going to run it at 500 rpm and then
I'm<00:02:15.190> going<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.370> run<00:02:15.549> it<00:02:15.670> at<00:02:15.760> 700<00:02:16.390> rpm<00:02:17.069> at<00:02:18.069> 500

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
I'm going to run it at 700 rpm at 500

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.720 
I'm going to run it at 700 rpm at 500
rpm<00:02:19.239> it's<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:20.049> making<00:02:20.379> about<00:02:20.590> 13<00:02:21.040> amps<00:02:21.489> but

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
rpm it's it's making about 13 amps but

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.080 
rpm it's it's making about 13 amps but
it's<00:02:22.000> not<00:02:22.920> making<00:02:23.920> enough<00:02:24.220> volts<00:02:24.670> it's<00:02:24.819> making

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
it's not making enough volts it's making

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.860 
it's not making enough volts it's making
about<00:02:25.239> 110<00:02:25.930> volts<00:02:26.379> I<00:02:27.370> really<00:02:28.030> wanted<00:02:28.330> 200

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
about 110 volts I really wanted 200

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.270 
about 110 volts I really wanted 200
volts<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.260> I'm<00:02:29.349> not<00:02:29.500> getting<00:02:29.769> that<00:02:29.860> out<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.190> it

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
volts and I'm not getting that out of it

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.830 
volts and I'm not getting that out of it
so<00:02:30.549> I'm<00:02:30.700> not<00:02:30.849> sure<00:02:30.909> what<00:02:31.120> I'm<00:02:31.209> going<00:02:31.299> to<00:02:31.360> do<00:02:31.569> but

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
so I'm not sure what I'm going to do but

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.780 
so I'm not sure what I'm going to do but
it's<00:02:32.560> making<00:02:32.799> about<00:02:32.920> 160<00:02:33.670> volts<00:02:33.849> at<00:02:34.090> 700<00:02:35.019> rpm

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
it's making about 160 volts at 700 rpm

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.420 
it's making about 160 volts at 700 rpm
it's<00:02:36.790> getting<00:02:37.060> pretty<00:02:37.239> hot<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:38.069> if<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.340> get

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
it's getting pretty hot so if I can get

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.880 
it's getting pretty hot so if I can get
a<00:02:39.459> good<00:02:39.640> cooling<00:02:40.030> system<00:02:40.360> working<00:02:40.659> on<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.989> and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
a good cooling system working on it and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.710 
a good cooling system working on it and
maybe<00:02:42.400> run<00:02:42.610> out<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.790> bit<00:02:42.940> faster<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.420> might<00:02:43.629> get

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
maybe run out a bit faster I might get

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.110 
maybe run out a bit faster I might get
some<00:02:43.930> more<00:02:44.049> volts<00:02:44.440> out<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.709> it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
some more volts out of it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.099 
some more volts out of it
we'll<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:46.329> I'll<00:02:46.540> just<00:02:46.720> have<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.959> keep

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
we'll just I'll just have to keep

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.020 
we'll just I'll just have to keep
playing<00:02:47.349> around<00:02:47.500> with<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.160> anyway<00:02:48.849> I'll

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
playing around with it so anyway I'll

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.080 
playing around with it so anyway I'll
start<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.540> up<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.870> we'll<00:02:50.500> see<00:02:50.760> see<00:02:51.760> how<00:02:51.940> it's

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
start it up and we'll see see how it's

00:02:52.090 --> 00:05:37.520 
start it up and we'll see see how it's
all<00:02:52.239> going

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.320 

well<00:05:38.530> I<00:05:38.800> don't<00:05:39.190> know<00:05:39.280> what's<00:05:39.460> going<00:05:39.700> on<00:05:40.120> with

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
well I don't know what's going on with

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.690 
well I don't know what's going on with
the<00:05:40.420> amp<00:05:40.570> set<00:05:40.780> I<00:05:40.810> think<00:05:40.930> of<00:05:41.230> bucket<00:05:41.920> up<00:05:42.010> my<00:05:42.190> aunt

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
the amp set I think of bucket up my aunt

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.780 
the amp set I think of bucket up my aunt
meter<00:05:43.030> my<00:05:43.510> multimeter<00:05:44.050> because<00:05:44.550> we<00:05:45.550> couldn't

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
meter my multimeter because we couldn't

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.990 
meter my multimeter because we couldn't
I<00:05:46.030> was<00:05:46.540> taking<00:05:46.900> so<00:05:47.020> long<00:05:47.050> to<00:05:47.320> put<00:05:47.500> in<00:05:47.590> the

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
I was taking so long to put in the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.990 
I was taking so long to put in the
delete<00:05:49.000> into<00:05:49.300> it<00:05:49.420> because<00:05:49.600> of<00:05:49.870> looks<00:05:50.200> like<00:05:50.380> the

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
delete into it because of looks like the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.660 
delete into it because of looks like the
the<00:05:52.000> connections<00:05:52.480> melted<00:05:53.250> because<00:05:54.250> it's<00:05:54.520> only

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
the connections melted because it's only

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
the connections melted because it's only
a<00:05:54.760> tener<00:05:55.750> as<00:05:56.170> we<00:05:56.410> see<00:05:56.590> there's<00:05:56.860> turnout<00:05:57.690> rated

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
a tener as we see there's turnout rated

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.470 
a tener as we see there's turnout rated
and<00:05:58.870> I<00:05:58.950> was<00:05:59.950> pushing<00:06:00.190> up<00:06:00.400> over<00:06:00.760> that<00:06:00.910> before<00:06:01.090> so

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
and I was pushing up over that before so

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.240 
and I was pushing up over that before so
I<00:06:01.540> probably<00:06:01.720> meld<00:06:02.050> with<00:06:02.140> it<00:06:02.260> but<00:06:02.440> it<00:06:02.500> was<00:06:02.620> it

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
I probably meld with it but it was it

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.830 
I probably meld with it but it was it
was<00:06:03.310> popping<00:06:03.670> out<00:06:03.760> our<00:06:04.260> thirteen<00:06:05.260> point<00:06:05.530> five

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
was popping out our thirteen point five

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.290 
was popping out our thirteen point five
amps<00:06:07.840> before<00:06:08.170> which<00:06:08.350> is<00:06:08.470> pretty<00:06:08.620> good<00:06:09.300> for

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
amps before which is pretty good for

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.540 
amps before which is pretty good for
this<00:06:10.870> considering<00:06:11.650> they<00:06:11.890> only<00:06:12.190> made<00:06:12.430> about

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
this considering they only made about

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.690 
this considering they only made about
three<00:06:12.940> or<00:06:13.060> four<00:06:13.240> amps<00:06:13.860> originally<00:06:14.860> from<00:06:15.130> the

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
three or four amps originally from the

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.480 
three or four amps originally from the
standard<00:06:16.120> view<00:06:16.330> but<00:06:16.930> that<00:06:17.380> is<00:06:19.740> top<00:06:20.740> I<00:06:21.010> can't<00:06:21.340> I

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
standard view but that is top I can't I

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.300 
standard view but that is top I can't I
can't<00:06:21.730> keep<00:06:22.120> my<00:06:22.270> hand<00:06:22.480> on<00:06:22.600> it<00:06:22.660> just<00:06:23.280> touch<00:06:24.280> it

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
can't keep my hand on it just touch it

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.310 
can't keep my hand on it just touch it
but<00:06:24.670> yeah<00:06:25.390> can't<00:06:25.900> keep<00:06:26.290> my<00:06:26.410> hand<00:06:26.620> on<00:06:26.740> it<00:06:27.180> so

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
but yeah can't keep my hand on it so

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.400 
but yeah can't keep my hand on it so
what<00:06:29.320> it's<00:06:29.470> getting<00:06:29.680> yeah<00:06:30.960> you<00:06:31.960> have<00:06:32.110> to<00:06:32.230> run

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
what it's getting yeah you have to run

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.990 
what it's getting yeah you have to run
some<00:06:32.650> sort<00:06:32.890> of<00:06:32.980> cooling<00:06:33.370> system<00:06:33.700> I<00:06:33.790> don't<00:06:33.850> know

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
some sort of cooling system I don't know

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.550 
some sort of cooling system I don't know
what<00:06:34.150> I'm<00:06:34.240> going<00:06:34.420> to<00:06:34.450> do<00:06:34.630> so<00:06:34.900> if<00:06:34.990> you<00:06:35.020> guys<00:06:35.320> got

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
what I'm going to do so if you guys got

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.040 
what I'm going to do so if you guys got
any<00:06:35.830> good<00:06:36.010> ideas<00:06:36.430> on<00:06:36.910> how<00:06:37.090> to<00:06:37.120> cool<00:06:37.660> this<00:06:37.840> thing

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
any good ideas on how to cool this thing

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.090 
any good ideas on how to cool this thing
let<00:06:38.470> me<00:06:38.560> know<00:06:38.880> thanks<00:06:39.880> a<00:06:39.940> lot
