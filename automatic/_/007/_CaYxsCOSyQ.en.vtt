 your team but that only one can 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.830
 continue in the competition it seems to me that 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:21.640
 It has been an excellent battle for 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.470

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.510
 karina you did it very well effectively 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.730
 at the start like that they leave the 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.060
 comfortable but fast you put yourself in the 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.650
 where it had to be me is 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.800

 You sang the notes very well instead 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.040
 santi I made mention of the difference 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.419
 that between you sing and interpret 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:54.270
 are you interpreting you do we can 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.100

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.770

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.660
 please whatever the decision is not 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.030

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.180
 They want to say goodbye to their coach Pedro 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:59.050
 I want to say thank you for everything I 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:03.840
 have you taught in this experience that I'm going 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.840
 to continue in my musical career yes sir 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.310
 I wanted to tell you that I feel very 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.480
 proud that all three have 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.480
 flipped the chair for me 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.870
 girls grade 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.990
 had an amazing evolution karina 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.630
 I sing very well singing very nice all 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.940
 the things that I told you in the essays what 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.360
 they did and they did a lot better 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.360
 from what I expected 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:42.140
 thank everything helped a lot 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.270
 and I was able to take this moment to 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.069
 maximum even if I do not win I feel very 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.909
 happy to have gotten here and I'm going 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.909
 to keep going 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:02.029
 santi from the beginning called me a lot 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:05.839
 attention 

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:07.849
 I think it is a strong candidate for 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:10.399
 win this beautiful voice project 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:12.889
 which is why has it been perhaps the advice that 

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:15.169
 has given you your coach that has helped you 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:17.209
 be a better artist when we were in the 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:21.549
 piano told me that there was always 

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:21.549
 feelings and what I did
