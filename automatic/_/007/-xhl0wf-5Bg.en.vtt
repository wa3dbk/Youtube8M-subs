there's<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.489> hub<00:02:22.640> we<00:02:23.330> pull<00:02:23.570> them<00:02:23.690> out<00:02:25.360> we<00:02:26.360> hold

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
there's the hub we pull them out we hold

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.590 
there's the hub we pull them out we hold
that<00:02:26.630> up<00:02:26.720> for<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.049> see<00:02:28.150> there's<00:02:29.150> two<00:02:29.330> ports

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
that up for you to see there's two ports

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.370 
that up for you to see there's two ports
on<00:02:29.720> top<00:02:30.310> then<00:02:31.310> there's<00:02:31.459> another<00:02:31.489> five<00:02:31.910> ports

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
on top then there's another five ports

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.930 
on top then there's another five ports
so<00:02:33.380> it's<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.590> total<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:33.920> seven<00:02:34.070> ports<00:02:34.489> plus

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
so it's a total of seven ports plus

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.140 
so it's a total of seven ports plus
there's<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.810> USB<00:02:36.650> port<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:37.670> plugs<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.030> into

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
there's the USB port that plugs it into

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.729 
there's the USB port that plugs it into
your<00:02:38.269> computer<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.870> don't<00:02:39.080> lose<00:02:39.350> one

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
your computer so you don't lose one

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.170 
your computer so you don't lose one
automatically<00:02:40.519> by<00:02:40.700> plugging<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.000> get

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
automatically by plugging in so you get

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.530 
automatically by plugging in so you get
seven<00:02:44.480> ports<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:45.380> exchange<00:02:46.040> for<00:02:46.220> one<00:02:46.540> there's

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
seven ports in exchange for one there's

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.170 
seven ports in exchange for one there's
also<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:49.540> holder<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.920> some<00:02:51.920> sort<00:02:52.190> for<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.489> pen<00:02:52.790> or

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
also a holder of some sort for a pen or

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.240 
also a holder of some sort for a pen or
what<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.140> don't<00:02:54.410> know<00:02:54.530> put<00:02:55.280> cables<00:02:55.700> through

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
what I don't know put cables through

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.100 
what I don't know put cables through
true<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.270> can<00:02:57.390> put<00:02:57.510> your<00:02:57.600> cables<00:02:57.960> through

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
true you can put your cables through

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.470 
true you can put your cables through

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
that sorry so it's a cable organ

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.650 
that sorry so it's a cable organ
organizational<00:03:01.290> tool<00:03:01.730> or<00:03:02.730> pen<00:03:02.970> holder<00:03:03.210> and

there's<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.440> user<00:03:04.590> manual<00:03:05.480> not<00:03:06.480> really<00:03:06.750> much<00:03:06.870> to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
there's a user manual not really much to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.840 
there's a user manual not really much to
it<00:03:07.170> because<00:03:07.560> it's<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.740> an<00:03:07.950> USB<00:03:08.310> port<00:03:08.580> after

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
it because it's just an USB port after

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.180 
it because it's just an USB port after
all<00:03:10.250> but<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.340> does<00:03:11.490> give<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.760> full<00:03:12.120> USB<00:03:12.660> 2.0

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
all but it does give you full USB 2.0

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.210 
all but it does give you full USB 2.0
speed<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.490> all<00:03:15.330> ports<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:17.070> no<00:03:17.850> that's<00:03:18.150> nice<00:03:19.220> it

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
speed in all ports so no that's nice it

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.590 
speed in all ports so no that's nice it
comes<00:03:20.459> with<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:21.570> know<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:22.770> USB<00:03:23.160> cord

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
comes with the you know the USB cord

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.480 
comes with the you know the USB cord
which<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.930> would<00:03:25.050> really<00:03:25.230> be<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.440> shame<00:03:26.250> if<00:03:26.280> it

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
which it would really be a shame if it

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.040 
which it would really be a shame if it
didn't<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:27.360> there<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.510> go<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:27.750> plug

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
didn't so there you go you just plug

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.920 
didn't so there you go you just plug
that<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:29.060> put<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.120> into<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.300> put<00:03:30.600> into<00:03:30.810> your

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
that in put it into the put into your

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.560 
that in put it into the put into your
computer<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.590> have<00:03:31.680> seven<00:03:31.950> ports<00:03:32.570> odd

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
computer and you have seven ports odd

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.060 
computer and you have seven ports odd
that<00:03:33.810> they<00:03:33.930> put<00:03:34.110> two<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.350> them<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.530> top<00:03:34.770> there

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
that they put two of them on top there

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.870 
that they put two of them on top there
i'm<00:03:35.220> not<00:03:35.370> quite<00:03:35.610> sure<00:03:35.640> but<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:38.640> mean<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.820> look

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
i'm not quite sure but I mean you look

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.570 
i'm not quite sure but I mean you look
at<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.150> look<00:03:39.510> at<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.660> packaging<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.580> some

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
at the look at the packaging and some

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.750 
at the look at the packaging and some
guy<00:03:41.730> has<00:03:41.940> his<00:03:42.209> uh<00:03:42.239> his<00:03:42.860> flash<00:03:43.860> drive<00:03:43.890> plugged

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
guy has his uh his flash drive plugged

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.860 
guy has his uh his flash drive plugged
into<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:44.970> top<00:03:45.150> one<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.450> guess<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.780> know

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
into the top one so I guess you know

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.720 
into the top one so I guess you know
that<00:03:45.900> would<00:03:46.140> be<00:03:46.170> oh<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:47.160> there<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.370> go<00:03:47.489> it

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
that would be oh and there you go it

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.520 
that would be oh and there you go it
actually<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.270> little<00:03:48.570> organizational<00:03:49.320> tool

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
actually is a little organizational tool

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.040 
actually is a little organizational tool
but<00:03:50.520> that's<00:03:50.790> not<00:03:50.910> plugged<00:03:51.180> into<00:03:51.270> anything<00:03:51.450> so

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
but that's not plugged into anything so

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.010 
but that's not plugged into anything so
I'm<00:03:52.140> not<00:03:52.260> quite<00:03:52.530> sure<00:03:53.750> what<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:54.870> here

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
I'm not quite sure what in here

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.010 
I'm not quite sure what in here
acessories<00:03:55.530> goal<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.420> if<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.870> always

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
acessories goal is like if you always

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.810 
acessories goal is like if you always
plug<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.320> digital<00:03:58.739> camera<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.550> you<00:03:59.670> always

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
plug a digital camera in and you always

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.050 
plug a digital camera in and you always
want<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.120> ah<00:04:00.560> ok<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.370> plug<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.730> cable<00:04:03.000> into

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
want to ah ok so you plug the cable into

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.630 
want to ah ok so you plug the cable into
the<00:04:03.209> icy<00:04:03.660> so<00:04:03.840> it's<00:04:03.989> an<00:04:04.049> accessory

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
the icy so it's an accessory

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.190 
the icy so it's an accessory
organizational<00:04:05.640> wire<00:04:06.090> tool<00:04:06.900> or<00:04:07.590> something<00:04:09.200> it

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
organizational wire tool or something it

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.199 
organizational wire tool or something it
also<00:04:10.320> comes<00:04:10.440> with<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.680> power<00:04:10.799> cable<00:04:11.209> because

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
also comes with a power cable because

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.170 
also comes with a power cable because
this<00:04:12.420> is<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.799> power<00:04:13.799> switch<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:15.000> just

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
this is a power switch so you just

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.800 
this is a power switch so you just
obviously<00:04:15.810> hook<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.200> in<00:04:16.350> there<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:18.209> that's

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
obviously hook that in there and that's

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.210 
obviously hook that in there and that's
it<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.350> plug<00:04:19.500> in<00:04:19.650> those<00:04:19.739> two<00:04:19.919> things<00:04:20.070> and

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
it so you plug in those two things and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.830 
it so you plug in those two things and
the<00:04:20.340> rest<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.580> these<00:04:20.640> ports<00:04:20.970> are<00:04:21.090> for<00:04:21.299> for<00:04:21.750> your

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
the rest of these ports are for for your

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.650 
the rest of these ports are for for your
usage<00:04:22.250> let's<00:04:23.250> actually<00:04:23.520> organize<00:04:24.300> organize

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
usage let's actually organize organize

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.480 
usage let's actually organize organize
those<00:04:25.140> right<00:04:25.500> now<00:04:27.169> by<00:04:28.169> putting<00:04:29.160> them<00:04:29.370> into

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
those right now by putting them into

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.070 
those right now by putting them into

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
there because we want to make use of

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.810 
there because we want to make use of
that<00:04:31.229> little<00:04:31.979> crazy<00:04:32.669> thing<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:33.630> um<00:04:34.610> did<00:04:35.610> not

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
that little crazy thing so um did not

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.580 
that little crazy thing so um did not
pull<00:04:36.000> up<00:04:36.120> my<00:04:36.240> notes<00:04:36.450> yet<00:04:36.720> let<00:04:37.080> me<00:04:37.169> tell<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.470> how

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
pull up my notes yet let me tell you how

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.380 
pull up my notes yet let me tell you how
much<00:04:37.710> that<00:04:37.770> costs<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:39.710> belkin<00:04:40.710> USB<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.850> plus

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
much that costs the belkin USB a plus

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.440 
much that costs the belkin USB a plus
hub<00:04:42.660> costs<00:04:43.320> 6999<00:04:44.280> so<00:04:45.180> you're<00:04:45.360> basically

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
hub costs 6999 so you're basically

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.630 
hub costs 6999 so you're basically
paying<00:04:45.810> 10<00:04:46.200> bucks<00:04:46.440> per<00:04:46.860> extra<00:04:47.550> port<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:50.400> top

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
paying 10 bucks per extra port to top

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.219 
paying 10 bucks per extra port to top
loads<00:04:50.910> obviously<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.900> what<00:04:52.020> we<00:04:52.110> already

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
loads obviously that what we already

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.080 
loads obviously that what we already
talked<00:04:52.530> about<00:04:52.650> an<00:04:52.890> internal<00:04:53.310> weight<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.850> in

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
talked about an internal weight is in

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.719 
talked about an internal weight is in
here<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:54.450> it<00:04:54.570> makes<00:04:54.720> sure<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.710> pads<00:04:56.430> stay

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
here so it makes sure that the pads stay

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.650 
here so it makes sure that the pads stay
anchored<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.210> your<00:04:57.360> desk<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:59.700> this<00:05:00.479> is

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
anchored to your desk and the this is

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.030 
anchored to your desk and the this is
actually<00:05:01.020> this<00:05:01.169> power<00:05:01.380> supply<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.740> actually

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
actually this power supply is actually

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.770 
actually this power supply is actually
there<00:05:02.160> for<00:05:02.520> your<00:05:02.610> power<00:05:02.820> devices<00:05:03.240> not<00:05:03.570> for<00:05:03.720> the

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
there for your power devices not for the

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.180 
there for your power devices not for the
hub<00:05:03.930> itself<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:04.440> in<00:05:04.560> case<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:04.919> have<00:05:05.010> power

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
hub itself so in case you have power

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.310 
hub itself so in case you have power
devices<00:05:05.580> this<00:05:06.270> will<00:05:06.479> power<00:05:06.690> them<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.110> charge

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
devices this will power them and charge

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.930 
devices this will power them and charge
them

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
them

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.730 
them
and<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.630> comes<00:05:09.750> with<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:10.020> belkin<00:05:10.320> lifetime

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
and it comes with a belkin lifetime

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.220 
and it comes with a belkin lifetime
warranty<00:05:11.130> so<00:05:11.730> there<00:05:12.210> you<00:05:12.270> have<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:12.480> 70<00:05:13.050> bucks

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
warranty so there you have it 70 bucks

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.890 
warranty so there you have it 70 bucks
for<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:13.770> hub<00:05:13.980> actually<00:05:14.400> do<00:05:14.520> like<00:05:14.760> it<00:05:14.900> despite

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
for a hub actually do like it despite

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.260 
for a hub actually do like it despite
the<00:05:16.370> blue<00:05:17.370> I<00:05:17.640> actually<00:05:18.120> wish<00:05:18.510> that<00:05:19.500> this<00:05:19.680> was

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
the blue I actually wish that this was

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.730 
the blue I actually wish that this was
interchangeable<00:05:21.270> somehow<00:05:21.600> to<00:05:21.990> black<00:05:22.380> or

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
interchangeable somehow to black or

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.210 
interchangeable somehow to black or
silver<00:05:23.250> or<00:05:24.110> you<00:05:25.110> know<00:05:25.200> I'd<00:05:25.530> even<00:05:25.680> see<00:05:25.920> take

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
silver or you know I'd even see take

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.070 
silver or you know I'd even see take
pink<00:05:26.640> /<00:05:26.970> periwinkle<00:05:27.540> blue<00:05:27.570> any<00:05:28.470> day<00:05:28.710> so<00:05:30.080> yes

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
pink / periwinkle blue any day so yes

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.520 
pink / periwinkle blue any day so yes
there<00:05:31.410> is<00:05:31.590> a<00:05:32.070> hole<00:05:32.460> in<00:05:32.670> it<00:05:32.790> though<00:05:33.000> so<00:05:33.420> there<00:05:34.290> is

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
there is a hole in it though so there is

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.610 
there is a hole in it though so there is
a<00:05:34.560> benefit<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.520> blue<00:05:35.900> you<00:05:36.900> can<00:05:37.080> stuff

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
a benefit to the blue you can stuff

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.740 
a benefit to the blue you can stuff
things<00:05:38.130> in<00:05:38.370> there<00:05:38.580> like<00:05:39.590> children<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:41.750> that's

things in there like children and that's
it<00:05:42.990> that's<00:05:43.290> what<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.680> belkin<00:05:44.040> USB<00:05:44.370> +<00:05:45.060> hub<00:05:45.270> will

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
it that's what the belkin USB + hub will

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.940 
it that's what the belkin USB + hub will
actually<00:05:45.750> will<00:05:45.990> test<00:05:46.200> it<00:05:46.290> out<00:05:46.410> will<00:05:46.650> put<00:05:46.770> up<00:05:46.860> a
