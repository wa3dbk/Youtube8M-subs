00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.420 
many times is going to seal in the
treatment<00:03:55.600> that<00:03:55.990> they<00:03:56.380> just<00:03:56.650> put<00:03:56.890> in<00:03:57.130> it's

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
treatment that they just put in it's

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.490 
treatment that they just put in it's
going<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.730> take<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.910> very<00:03:57.970> long<00:03:58.180> time<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:58.990> then

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
going to take a very long time and then

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.720 
going to take a very long time and then
it's<00:03:59.650> all<00:03:59.830> going<00:04:00.070> to<00:04:00.100> be<00:04:00.220> ruined<00:04:00.610> because

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
it's all going to be ruined because

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.540 
it's all going to be ruined because
after<00:04:01.420> they<00:04:01.990> seal<00:04:02.320> that<00:04:02.590> in<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:03.100> gotta<00:04:03.280> rinse

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
after they seal that in you gotta rinse

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.410 
after they seal that in you gotta rinse
your<00:04:03.760> hair<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.290> they<00:04:05.290> don't<00:04:05.610> wash<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:06.910> I<00:04:07.150> don't

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
your hair and they don't wash it I don't

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.420

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
think they just rinse it and then they

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.790 
think they just rinse it and then they
put<00:04:09.610> on<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.730> mask<00:04:10.030> for<00:04:10.390> like<00:04:10.570> a<00:04:10.600> minute<00:04:11.440> I<00:04:11.740> think

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
put on a mask for like a minute I think

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.650 
put on a mask for like a minute I think
a<00:04:12.250> minute<00:04:12.640> or<00:04:12.880> two<00:04:12.910> minutes<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.420> then<00:04:13.540> they

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
a minute or two minutes and then they

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.449 
a minute or two minutes and then they
rinse<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.990> mask<00:04:14.200> out<00:04:14.470> then<00:04:14.890> they<00:04:15.010> style<00:04:15.280> your

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
rinse the mask out then they style your

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.880 
rinse the mask out then they style your
hair<00:04:15.490> and<00:04:15.700> you're<00:04:15.850> done<00:04:16.290> basically<00:04:17.290> these<00:04:17.829> are

blow-dried<00:04:25.540> hair<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:26.050> my<00:04:26.680> hair<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.950> usually

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220

blow-dried hair and my hair is usually
kinky<00:04:27.640> curly<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:29.500> straightened<00:04:30.070> my<00:04:30.130> hair

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
like completely strained it I did not

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.330 
like completely strained it I did not
think<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.320> was<00:04:32.410> going<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.710> straighten<00:04:32.980> my<00:04:33.100> hair

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
think it was going to straighten my hair

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.980 
think it was going to straighten my hair
I<00:04:33.550> thought<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.210> was<00:04:34.270> just<00:04:34.450> going<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.720> take<00:04:34.840> the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
I thought it was just going to take the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.260 
I thought it was just going to take the
frizz<00:04:35.200> out<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.650> make<00:04:35.800> it<00:04:35.830> wavy<00:04:36.190> but<00:04:37.060> it

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
frizz out and make it wavy but it

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.520 
frizz out and make it wavy but it
completely<00:04:37.480> straightened<00:04:38.169> it<00:04:38.200> which<00:04:38.380> has

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
completely straightened it which has

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.800 
completely straightened it which has
been<00:04:38.680> awesome<00:04:38.919> though<00:04:39.370> because<00:04:39.580> I<00:04:40.060> don't<00:04:40.570> do

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
been awesome though because I don't do

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.600 
been awesome though because I don't do
anything<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.380> my<00:04:41.530> hair<00:04:41.560> like<00:04:41.890> I<00:04:42.070> blow<00:04:42.310> dry<00:04:42.580> it

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.500 
I don't do anything but you can see
though<00:04:47.110> that<00:04:47.140> my<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:48.520> kinks<00:04:48.910> in<00:04:49.000> my<00:04:49.060> hair<00:04:49.360> are

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
though that my the kinks in my hair are

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.120 
though that my the kinks in my hair are
starting<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:49.840> come<00:04:50.050> back<00:04:50.080> then<00:04:50.650> again<00:04:50.890> like<00:04:51.040> I

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
starting to come back then again like I

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.490 
starting to come back then again like I
said<00:04:51.160> this<00:04:51.460> is<00:04:51.520> second<00:04:51.940> day<00:04:52.090> hair<00:04:52.390> so<00:04:52.720> that's

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
said this is second day hair so that's

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.740 
said this is second day hair so that's
probably<00:04:53.740> part<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.160> reason<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.700> but<00:04:55.030> um

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
probably part of the reason to but um

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.050 
probably part of the reason to but um
the<00:04:56.530> waves<00:04:56.770> are<00:04:57.130> starting<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.610> come<00:04:57.880> back<00:04:57.910> a

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
actual bottle of the product might be

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.630 
actual bottle of the product might be

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
check into it I end up paying 150 for

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.110 
check into it I end up paying 150 for
mine<00:06:07.450> and<00:06:07.810> it's<00:06:08.560> supposed<00:06:08.860> to<00:06:09.010> last<00:06:09.250> for<00:06:09.760> three

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
mine and it's supposed to last for three

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.100 
mine and it's supposed to last for three
months<00:06:10.710> 12<00:06:11.710> weeks<00:06:11.880> and<00:06:12.880> she<00:06:13.630> said<00:06:13.870> that<00:06:14.080> my

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
months 12 weeks and she said that my

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.170 
months 12 weeks and she said that my
wave<00:06:14.440> should<00:06:15.160> start<00:06:15.430> coming<00:06:15.550> back<00:06:15.820> so<00:06:16.060> I<00:06:16.120> could

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
wave should start coming back so I could

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.660 
wave should start coming back so I could
style<00:06:16.630> my<00:06:16.810> hair<00:06:16.840> wavy<00:06:17.260> and<00:06:17.620> then<00:06:18.280> the<00:06:18.430> curl

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
style my hair wavy and then the curl

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.160 
style my hair wavy and then the curl
will<00:06:18.880> eventually<00:06:19.330> come<00:06:19.480> back<00:06:19.660> but<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:19.900> curl

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
will eventually come back but the curl

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.950 
will eventually come back but the curl
should<00:06:20.410> be<00:06:20.500> healthier<00:06:21.040> and<00:06:21.190> also<00:06:21.970> my<00:06:22.630> mutation

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
should be healthier and also my mutation

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.420 
should be healthier and also my mutation
said<00:06:23.350> the<00:06:23.530> more<00:06:23.770> you<00:06:23.920> do<00:06:24.100> it<00:06:24.130> the<00:06:24.250> better

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
said the more you do it the better

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.910 
said the more you do it the better
results<00:06:25.360> the<00:06:25.570> softer<00:06:25.990> your<00:06:26.170> hair<00:06:26.440> the

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 
results the softer your hair the

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.250 
results the softer your hair the
healthier<00:06:27.370> your<00:06:27.640> hair<00:06:27.850> because<00:06:28.270> which<00:06:29.020> makes

healthier your hair because which makes

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.230 
healthier your hair because which makes
sense<00:06:29.530> even<00:06:29.710> though<00:06:29.890> it<00:06:30.070> is<00:06:30.100> a<00:06:30.220> treatment<00:06:30.700> and

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
sense even though it is a treatment and

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.660 
sense even though it is a treatment and
it<00:06:31.750> kind<00:06:31.960> of<00:06:32.050> scares<00:06:32.380> people<00:06:32.620> away<00:06:32.860> thinking

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
it kind of scares people away thinking

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.010 
it kind of scares people away thinking
it's<00:06:33.790> going<00:06:33.910> to<00:06:33.970> damage<00:06:34.150> your<00:06:34.450> hair<00:06:34.600> it<00:06:34.720> really

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
it's going to damage your hair it really

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.160 
it's going to damage your hair it really
doesn't<00:06:35.380> it<00:06:35.580> because<00:06:36.580> what<00:06:37.330> it<00:06:37.420> is<00:06:37.570> it<00:06:37.840> all<00:06:38.020> it

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
doesn't it because what it is it all it

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.590 
doesn't it because what it is it all it
is<00:06:38.260> is<00:06:38.410> it's<00:06:38.590> a<00:06:38.890> keratin<00:06:39.550> protein<00:06:40.090> so<00:06:40.420> it

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
is is it's a keratin protein so it

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.750 
is is it's a keratin protein so it
basically<00:06:41.110> takes<00:06:41.530> each<00:06:41.800> piece<00:06:42.100> of<00:06:42.280> hair<00:06:42.490> in

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
basically takes each piece of hair in

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.040 
basically takes each piece of hair in
seals<00:06:43.540> keratin<00:06:44.350> all<00:06:44.590> around<00:06:45.280> it<00:06:45.660> also<00:06:46.660> i<00:06:46.900> need

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
seals keratin all around it also i need

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.540 
seals keratin all around it also i need

it's like a salt will rip off the

results last way less maybe a four or

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.580 
results last way less maybe a four or
five<00:07:13.720> weeks<00:07:13.750> rather<00:07:14.230> than<00:07:14.380> the<00:07:14.650> 12<00:07:14.920> so<00:07:15.760> um<00:07:16.590> go

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
five weeks rather than the 12 so um go

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.250 
five weeks rather than the 12 so um go
to<00:07:17.880> rite<00:07:18.880> aid<00:07:18.910> anywhere<00:07:19.540> like<00:07:19.660> that<00:07:19.720> and

to rite aid anywhere like that and

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.810 
to rite aid anywhere like that and
there's<00:07:20.560> usually<00:07:20.740> a<00:07:20.920> whole<00:07:21.190> section<00:07:21.460> of

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820 
there's usually a whole section of

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.570 
there's usually a whole section of
