nice stitching here both sides and I'm
assuming<00:02:32.240> that<00:02:33.240> this<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:34.020> one

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
assuming that this is like one

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.510

continuous piece of leather because the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.740

monogram logo is upside in this portion

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.620 
monogram logo is upside in this portion
and<00:02:43.500> then<00:02:45.740> it's<00:02:46.740> sort<00:02:46.830> of<00:02:46.950> upside<00:02:47.280> down<00:02:47.630> I'm

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
and then it's sort of upside down I'm

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.960 
and then it's sort of upside down I'm
assuming<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.170> one<00:02:49.320> piece<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.650> leather<00:02:49.980> one

this is the natural color I mean this is

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.520 
this is the natural color I mean this is
natural<00:03:55.769> light<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.070> don't<00:03:56.340> have<00:03:56.489> any<00:03:57.200> light<00:03:58.200> any

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
right so I'm getting natural light from

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.740 
right so I'm getting natural light from
the<00:04:04.170> right<00:04:04.350> here's<00:04:05.130> sort<00:04:05.880> of<00:04:05.970> if<00:04:06.300> I<00:04:06.450> didn't

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
the right here's sort of if I didn't

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.750 
the right here's sort of if I didn't
show<00:04:07.350> you<00:04:07.440> from<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.680> other<00:04:07.769> side<00:04:08.160> that's<00:04:08.489> like

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
show you from the other side that's like

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.120 
show you from the other side that's like
the<00:04:09.060> color<00:04:09.300> appearance<00:04:09.660> it's<00:04:10.320> hard<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.739> I

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
the color appearance it's hard to I

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.699 
the color appearance it's hard to I
think<00:04:11.580> this<00:04:11.910> is<00:04:12.090> correctly<00:04:12.570> picking<00:04:13.080> up<00:04:13.260> the

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
think this is correctly picking up the

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.890 
think this is correctly picking up the
color<00:04:13.980> but<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.820> color<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.239> sort<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.480> hard<00:04:15.780> to

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
color but the color is sort of hard to

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.690 
color but the color is sort of hard to
describe

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.790 
tell it's being I know that there are
other<00:04:20.789> colors<00:04:21.419> in<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.780> LV<00:04:22.109> family<00:04:22.530> that

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
other colors in the LV family that

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.500 
other colors in the LV family that
you're<00:04:23.430> not<00:04:23.580> really<00:04:23.729> sure<00:04:24.060> what<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.050> color<00:04:25.289> is

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
you're not really sure what the color is

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.540 
you're not really sure what the color is
and<00:04:27.290> this<00:04:27.470> is<00:04:27.560> definitely<00:04:27.740> like<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:28.070> pale<00:04:28.340> pink

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
and this is definitely like a pale pink

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.940 
and this is definitely like a pale pink
one<00:04:29.210> thing<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.510> I<00:04:29.600> did<00:04:29.810> not<00:04:29.990> realize<00:04:30.440> until<00:04:30.620> I

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
one thing that I did not realize until I

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.790 
one thing that I did not realize until I
actually<00:04:31.660> received<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.840> item<00:04:33.170> in<00:04:33.350> my<00:04:33.560> hands

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
actually received the item in my hands

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800 
actually received the item in my hands
was<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.370> has<00:04:34.550> this<00:04:34.850> third<00:04:35.240> glazing<00:04:35.750> on

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
was that it has this third glazing on

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.170 
was that it has this third glazing on
the<00:04:35.960> side<00:04:36.170> and<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.770> was<00:04:36.890> sort<00:04:37.040> of<00:04:37.130> thrown<00:04:37.610> off<00:04:37.910> by

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
the side and I was sort of thrown off by

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.880 
the side and I was sort of thrown off by
that<00:04:38.210> only<00:04:38.840> because<00:04:39.200> I<00:04:39.230> hadn't<00:04:39.590> seen<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.770> I

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
that only because I hadn't seen that I

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.500 
that only because I hadn't seen that I
hadn't<00:04:40.160> seen<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.520> on<00:04:40.610> Instagram<00:04:41.000> hadn't

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
hadn't seen that on Instagram hadn't

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.810 
hadn't seen that on Instagram hadn't
seen<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:42.170> on<00:04:42.350> YouTube<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.920> it<00:04:43.430> doesn't<00:04:43.790> show

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
seen it on YouTube and it doesn't show

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.790 
seen it on YouTube and it doesn't show
it<00:04:44.120> on<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.420> website<00:04:44.600> so<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.110> just<00:04:45.500> sort<00:04:45.740> of

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
it on the website so you just sort of

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.060 
it on the website so you just sort of
see<00:04:46.040> this<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:47.150> you<00:04:47.570> see<00:04:47.810> this<00:04:48.230> but<00:04:48.770> you<00:04:48.800> don't

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
see this and you see this but you don't

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.950 
see this and you see this but you don't
see<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:50.210> cool<00:04:50.390> evening<00:04:50.720> I'm<00:04:51.290> okay<00:04:52.250> with<00:04:52.460> it<00:04:52.960> I

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
see the cool evening I'm okay with it I

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.920 
see the cool evening I'm okay with it I
wish<00:04:54.530> I<00:04:54.620> had<00:04:54.830> just<00:04:54.860> known<00:04:55.280> that<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:55.930> advance

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
wish I had just known that in advance

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.159 
wish I had just known that in advance
but<00:04:57.650> I'm<00:04:58.520> fine<00:04:58.820> with<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:59.150> I<00:04:59.210> think<00:04:59.570> that<00:04:59.630> if<00:04:59.930> the

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
but I'm fine with it I think that if the

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.220 
but I'm fine with it I think that if the
glazing<00:05:00.950> was<00:05:01.340> actually<00:05:02.030> light<00:05:02.570> like<00:05:02.930> those<00:05:03.140> a

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
glazing was actually light like those a

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.050 
glazing was actually light like those a
pink<00:05:03.560> glaze<00:05:03.860> or<00:05:04.160> something<00:05:04.460> like<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.669> I

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
pink glaze or something like that I

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.930 
pink glaze or something like that I
think<00:05:05.419> that<00:05:05.930> it<00:05:06.140> would<00:05:06.440> show<00:05:06.500> we're<00:05:07.490> a<00:05:07.520> lot

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
think that it would show we're a lot

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.840 
think that it would show we're a lot
more<00:05:08.230> and<00:05:09.230> this<00:05:09.350> is<00:05:09.530> probably<00:05:09.740> the<00:05:10.190> more

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
more and this is probably the more

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.420 
more and this is probably the more
practical<00:05:13.270> finishing<00:05:14.270> treatment<00:05:14.950> so<00:05:15.950> yeah<00:05:16.100> I

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
practical finishing treatment so yeah I

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.750 
practical finishing treatment so yeah I
love<00:05:16.940> this<00:05:17.919> I'm<00:05:18.919> really<00:05:19.220> excited<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.610> start

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760
