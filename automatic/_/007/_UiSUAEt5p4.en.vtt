00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:01.800
 Heine 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.109
 Treichl's childhood had come to an end just after this video 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.139
 not that the rally of init thinks 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.530
 It's always been badly marketed 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.530
 not included are another 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.540
 Although it can be almost 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.960
 instead of the carpentry workshop 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.170
 Definitely a landmark guest here too I now have this one 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.289
 background 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.710
 and save 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.970
 same Tinto 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.470
 it has to be homemade 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.570
 Hann I just had some pictures made this time 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.710
 and then got it together lift 2 posters he glued himself now a poster 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.710
 and to be at home whether the photos are to the eaten child 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.960
 Red on 1 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.400
 I had time to use it out in the evening too dark it is just 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.650
 never 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.130
 and then I do not have to compete so well, then I could be so good 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.450
 so lit up 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.550
 Kleist this is not for German train it saves that easily 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.590
 it looks like it looks like it's drab 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.120
 By the time it has worked out quite well I the place is setting that up a lot 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.850
 but otherwise I think about it 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.440
 So not that I think now I have this day and I want that in too 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.710
 Marienehe a little stupid if you always just behind behind 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.830
 So I was moved in. He moved into the room it is planned that the depth and pull 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560
 custom made 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.560
 in a intercity bourgeois speech 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.320
 but no matter 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.460
 Borns yes 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.460
 you can tell your first child with the background 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.350
 I think that's okay 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.509
 not so bad that I have to make Miami different because this 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.810
 as a sign bit back and then back then I'm finally done 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.090
 so have the photos 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.590
 homemade 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.210
 Lerch have decided 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.210
 Pakistan 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.320
 Cognis no exact reports yet 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.320
 I'm sure that I like it so much or 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.090
 everyone can write Mama Paternoster 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.259
 I'm not sure yet 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.119
 in the group is a very nice do not have artificial light if so 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:13.629
 a little bit 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.999
 Yes 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.729
 if that is not such a cold light he is now there is not only more beautiful 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.729
 how can you really achieve this is funny again 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.159
 I was right 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.540
 Well o'keefe so I found it not too long to talk a lot I found 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.540
 it only really know he is unchanged UN 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.709
 if that's the best equipment in exceptional cases 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.069
 although it really happens now 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.519
 he then I can connect that, or if we then get a cancer 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.119
 I do not hope so 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.299
 Poor in 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.589
 no longer so photos against the man of the priestly celibacy 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:53.130
 Addresses now most so eyes buried and 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.319
 how will be 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.389
 and something artistic touched something 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:59.410
 insufficient 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.410
 revised dust and I still have 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.539
 nevertheless such a pink topics 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.369
 Konrad women 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.519
 Yannick Weber write he has photos of me keep on watching 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.989
 I understand that many of you know or not 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.409
 So some of you can not ask for more on the guardrail of the year 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.760
 crisis 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.760
 Photos is the dream of sound around 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:30.279
 no when i hear that it is a matter of years part 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.279
 yes it is true we also occupied about my god 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.279
 Very difficult not very promising world 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:38.539
 leader 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:42.219
 I did not even photograph that when I photographed it 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.309
 like to do then you do not understand so important that that does not help 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.379
 embedded or pretending to be as though he were one 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.069
 express yourself artistically 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.729
 so if I am pictures make of me 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.729
 it's not because I love to sing for the Lions 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.369
 have cooked so well 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.259
 there the verdict 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:02.260
 I thank you 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.129
 something can escape 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.560
 If I say that then we come but I like the weather race 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:09.299
 finally better 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.469
 If I do not care if the result is similar, how can you do that? 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.109
 Herne 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.969
 so 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.549
 sometimes come 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.750
 and I still wonder if here maybe I will in the next video 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.490
 the slide show or so Achim SchÃ¶ffel has made couple of pictures to show up 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.870
 because sure is not really known is that they are the tests Kockisch and 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.180
 do not arrive 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.419
 I have like that 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.879
 the first children's report is equipped with the subject area 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.419
 Sunsets 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.080
 Of course also photographed the INQ chat than in the city and photos there 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.990
 Shriver wanted to see that 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.150
 quite a few but I always have so much load as I do not feel like it anymore 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.280
 and I do not want to have any photos of Nemec with other people and 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.550
 show that of course I also fall fox 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.550
 Fernando Alonso as he of a case, however, too 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.960
 I want to show that first because I do not know if I'm looking for pages 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.289
 the SPD a little uncertain that they are the same 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.400
 and thirdly 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.810
 so far prevents a tragic insistence that I may do that 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.180
 not ambitious 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.800
 so if you said he would like to have it in your time 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.800
 Sunsets flowers 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.830
 if the problem will be 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.460
 I'm not from Romania my friend he comes from and is always someone 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.469
 there 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.270
 so many still questions 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.400
 We should not be lighter now 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.559
 to come then 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.070
 the program has 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.620
 Judge we do now 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.490
 and for more than ten years 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.169
 Keita is coming 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.860
 and of course, everybody just has to talk to them at the moment 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.169
 percent
