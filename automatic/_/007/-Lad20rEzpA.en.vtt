00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:15.990
 hello to everyone with you hamish and today you 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:19.260
 briefly talk about the tank square-1 to start 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.110
 about the pros of the tank first plus it's circular 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.750
 armor she is so good at keeping a punch 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.210
 that shallow level with which we fall into 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.119
 the fight often we are not watered even in 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.329
 stern second plus is a top gun 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.730
 tank she has a very good one-time 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.370
 damage of 160 units 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.249
 very good break through in size 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.010
 120 millimeters you naturally is 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:47.159
 Soviet cannon beats the third 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.920
 plus I would call the damage per minute it 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.319
 there are almost 2000 of us here 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.359
 without rammer at the same time we have 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:57.659
 good armor penetration 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.690
 and quite good fourth accuracy and 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:04.500
 the last advantages I would call without a machine 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.600
 he we have 50 tons which is very good we 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 we can ram all without problems 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.390
 fifth level rivals some 6 and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.360
 Even some 7 problems with this will not be 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.909
 well and about us fireflies often beat off 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 now perhaps worth talking about 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.180
 cons of the tank the first one is 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.210
 mobility apt-1 it is with us 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.759
 miserable very bad and indeed everything 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.649
 know perfectly how about apt-1 until you are you 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.009
 swing top engine u will ride 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.679
 a maximum of 20 25 kilometers and then with difficulty 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.380
 Stop them engine can be done at least 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.009
 something well this mobility is very strong 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.030
 limping 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.810
 the second and most obvious minus k b1 is 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 review it we only have 310 meters on 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.780
 top and tower and it is very very small and 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.200
 It interferes very much to play 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.610
 Stereo set necessarily 3 and not 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.370
 especially critical minus and 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.740
 and the strength of the tank we have it 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.440
 small among heavy tanks 5th 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.860
 level that is even French bdr and 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.350
 strength is 10 units more but it is us 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.010
 does not interfere as we have armor 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.590
 which is tanked always and everywhere on this 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.440
 main advantages and disadvantages of apt-1 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.320
 ends and perhaps worth going to 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.930
 tactics of combat on it when it hits 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.660
 in the top we should push the main 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.180
 directions supported by allies and by 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.550
 opportunities to use the reverse diamond 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.340
 if you do everything right fight 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.890
 will be dragging since kv-1 is in the top 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.920
 it is almost always good when hit 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.959
 down the list or in the middle we need 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.560
 drive with higher level 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.370
 allies together and help them crush 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.130
 direction 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.010
 of the equipment I would advise to put 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.950
 Be sure to rammer to improve 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.170
 fan rate is mandatory 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.570
 to improve all characteristics and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.600
 stereo pipe to see normally and 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.090
 I would often like to carry on fighting perk 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.540
 say one thing is sure to deflate 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.489
 repair the rest already to your taste and in 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.930
 I will appreciate the completion 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.070
 this tank kv-1, I rate 8 medals 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.010
 Kolobanova 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.560
 out of 10 if you liked this video 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.200
 put like subscribe to the channel 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.910
 There are many interesting things to write to 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.910
 comments what would you like to see 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.780
 the next tank in this category on this 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.780
 all bye
