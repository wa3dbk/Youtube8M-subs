00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.310
 in very nice that commenting I leave a 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.109
 involved warfare but good 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.429
 first before the gameplay is a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.309
 video in which I will show you how 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 happened to prestige number 17 I commented 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.980
 the idea and you find it interesting so 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.660
 we say the comments are and see if 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.130
 I like the idea of teaching you as well 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.590
 in this case how did you pass from prestige there 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.070
 I'm unlocking me the powerful adr 9 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.660
 prestige teacher 2 rank 1 and they give me the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.699
 goal since I already had this doubt that you have 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.560
 many others then a good part of their 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.090
 instance by quite average prestige and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.130
 if he had in his truth elite of these 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.720
 for example they helped goliat and they give you 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.880
 that same weapon having the since 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.560
 different pastrana and it doubles that 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.030
 happening then well here you are going to see 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.490
 as looking for the mind in safety that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.590
 I already had because I have exactly 2 me 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.420
 wins goliat so the legend is 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.860
 denied were rolled more 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.210
 just like the one you had and already 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.980
 It is no longer I'll save just in case 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.780
 there is some system of trade or future or what 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.400
 that is but good finally I'm going to 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.200
 teach as I told you the statistics 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.570
 every time that prestige passes that of the 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.220
 promotion to 2.0 the publishing house 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.560
 another is at 130 and the project function 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.350
 is in almost 500 is fine and time 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.550
 played eight days 21 hours 28 minutes as well 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.430
 how good are we going to go if you think 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.110
 after seeing 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.620
 last parts that the last one is and that 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.540
 caught a little 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.370
 so to end this video is a 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.940
 table that nothing else almost pretty 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.940
 prestige and here 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.790
 the idea will appear so every time 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.229
 prestigious pass for example when 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.580
 arrives 3 passes the same as they are according to 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.350
 the statistics taught how will be the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.360
 prestige rule that they give me and finally 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.710
 you a little bit with that gun I do not think that 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.660
 it's interesting for you to see 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.119
 the weapons that I send and well how are they going 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.830
 my game statistics not then 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.390
 then should the comments and as 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.590
 I say it if you like this type of videos 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.119
 and I'm going to ask for many bryce and all that 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.590
 so keep doing this miniseries 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.180
 aside today do not worry because there will be 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.220
 another video warfare that surely 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.630
 it will be a challenging supplies but 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.830
 with advanced supplies using 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.720
 specifically the supply that I 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.979
 they just gave here in this video so 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.660
 Well, it's going to be quite interesting 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.310
 video I recommend that you go over and 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.229
 You can talk about lampe 11 goliat 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.240
 and that this week I'm going to do already 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.009
 end the top five best rifles no 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.570
 do not worry because it will be ready this 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.360
 week and also the comparison of the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.920
 chèvre ryder with the zebra abrasion 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.330
 so then this is a rifle I think 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.890
 I 'm not going to finally put it in the whole 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.209
 improve your rifles yes it is true that 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.590
 is his course and very well this in what 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.580
 deal a lot if you have a bit of 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.290
 skill what 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.490
 happens that it is short of bullets but 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.140
 It is very good because it has a good damage 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.820
 does not have a good reach and such but 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.410
 Well I think there are other better your 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.180
 fusion is in the game to put in the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.530
 top like almost a thousand spoiler but 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.940
 then it will not be in this 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.320
 top I think there are better expulsions in 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.180
 different options that kill much more 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.370
 quick that this is a rifle so 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.170
 Well, that's still possible, it's very 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.610
 good or I if you have it 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.350
 I recommend that you use it because you already know 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.510
 I know about his rifle when I got out 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.280
 my only and first adn because really 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.080
 I would not positive streaky me 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.120
 they are cold for DNA and it is already 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.410
 no and the one I got there I like 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.450
 go for fierce from time to time but 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.800
 the sands are already something 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.910
 different do not leaf this man that 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.680
 element of the last hip shot and 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.820
 raised an ethical dialogue with her 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.440
 I was left with the knife because there is little left 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.030
 time we put this way we take 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.410
 speakeasy my mother explain it if I the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.030
 will give more ahead are the prestige 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.709
 but I still do not have a good time 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.330
 more to see in crises so good 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.370
 here is the end of this gameplay with which 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.990
 Dengue camps and a companion that does not 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.520
 I know anything I have said so 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.870
 kids tell me what are the 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.340
 comments for redundancy how about 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.630
 it seems to you if this idea is going 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.980
 spending holidays because I'm the only one 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.930
 Spain so it 's in high prestige it 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.450
 I'm wrong here in the community of 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.340
 españa not from youtube in size plan 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.440
 big so that depends 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.150
 I like the video if I see you comment 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.940
 a lot and all that then keep doing 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.290
 this miniseries mini guide better said well 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.690
 rights has liked your likes 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.690
