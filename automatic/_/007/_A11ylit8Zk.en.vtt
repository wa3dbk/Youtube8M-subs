00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.300
 why would like to do that i have one 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.240
 version of sparrow to the e-mail client 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.039
 so we want it in the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.019
 we want to test a copy 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.340
 Two tutorials tour found that quite 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.680
 nice that we for there also equal to one 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.080
 have received code from the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.669
 developers and two more 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.469
 more kohls we in the next 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.219
 giving away lots of money via our website 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.430
 be cool yes I have the mail 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.190
 get with the bruno kohls and me 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.170
 did not have a plan how that works 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.050
 I read the internet everywhere 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.469
 great from now on can the apple mac store 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.260
 also promo codes great for developers 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.910
 journalist editorial is really great 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.989
 Great because I know that I do not 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.809
 I'm in the world 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.240
 and that's how it came to me 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.619
 I just could not find it where I am 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.740
 that can redeem 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.479
 So I'm always on the app and always 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 when I was on it 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.500
 Where I click on buy would be for me 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.049
 the logical consequence was that me 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.840
 there can enter my promo code 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.540
 but no there it was not and in this 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.200
 tutorial I want to show you how to 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.350
 redeem this promo code 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.409
 when I open the mac app store 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.329
 I always see this cityscape in it 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.869
 different projects displayed 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.479
 become 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.640
 and I mean now I see myself too 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.290
 now it is totally easy but you have 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.149
 I do not know either 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.320
 you can do it differently 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.119
 maybe link 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.479
 So I'm doing the following, I have 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.610
 So this e mail client barrel 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.790
 this is the e mail client and for the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.259
 I actually wanted the product 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.700
 yes, I would not buy it 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.770
 Of course, but we also like buying 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.450
 said to get this promo code and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.979
 then I thought of buying up there 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.840
 I'll click here I can do that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.110
 Copy link or from a friend 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.300
 I recommend that when I buy on 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.420
 maybe go with that 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.599
 promo code 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.470
 I get to buy now 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:22.630
 had to enter my id here 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:27.099
 sign up and now he asks me if I am 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.510
 really want to buy the product more 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.340
 I do not want to have my brother 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.030
 and i do not want to buy it myself 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.350
 I want to redeem it with this promo code 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.530
 That's not what it's supposed to be 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.180
 looking so now what now thinks like 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.260
 does that work we get the promo 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.690
 how do I do that 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.959
 the developer has with the promo code 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.310
 sent by e-mail that's one 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.800
 four-digit number different 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.049
 numerals et cetera and how to get the 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.360
 basically it's easy to cash in 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.610
 if you know how it works here 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.140
 right you have one click 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.370
 hello bernd hello bernd hello bernd 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.540
 funny way is the man behind the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.470
 Camera also handles account redeem 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.720
 to redeem support if I blame 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.590
 redeem my delivery debt 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.470
 no, no 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.079
 right here it is I look up 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.340
 Redeem now becomes practically something 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.430
 loaded 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.859
 and he asks me now for the cÃ´te de 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.600
 do not want to redeem and the code hole 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.079
 I now out of my e-mail 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.820
 I enter the code here then 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.620
 if I have entered this click 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.100
 I redeem 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.950
 now the code is checked I have to 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.480
 log in to my account many 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.720
 thanks for redeeming the code 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.370
 article application is now loaded 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.100
 and here you can see the bio download 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.760
 So by the feces by the promo code 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.440
 the mac store knew that right away 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.280
 a promocode for the e-mail client 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.600
 Sparrow and we have that right now 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.519
 loaded on our way like this 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.170
 barrel works, I tell you 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.630
 right in a next tutorial 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.209
 I want to say something here now 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.310
 if you have the promo code on merck than in 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.150
 my case on the imac have solved one 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.849
 about the apple app store says apple 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.409
 ok you may privately use that so often 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.150
 as you like that means you can do it 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:27.100
 install on the other computer 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.130
 So I would now on my macbook 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.040
 air what have been a redaction since 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.030
 The latest thing I would practically on 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.150
 my macbook air now also the whole 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.830
 So start the mac store would start 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.229
 he also has to show more theoretically 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.030
 hey you have him app that you have 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.350
 bought for the imac or even one 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.360
 redeemed promo code 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.340
 So I can install it here too 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.740
 we just want to get out of here 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.350
 my macbook air I start now too 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.340
 the app store clique there on buyers 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.490
 and now let's see what we have 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.130
 on shows aha here is now sparrow 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.280
 So, in fact, I'm clicking 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.630
 install again give my 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.139
 access data 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.539
 and in fact barrel is going straight on 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.490
 my macbook air installed as well 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.380
 So I can do that both on my imac 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:26.139
 as to use on my macbook air 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.070
 cool thing really cool thing must 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.070
 you turn pale 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.360
 if you do that with the mac store with the 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.590
 mac app store a little bit better 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.599
 realize that you might be a part 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.960
 from itunes or the whole is in one 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.900
 store 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.340
 then they have that once more in theirs 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.130
 life perfects what you can 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.810
 can perfect 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.750
 okay that 's it on this one 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.300

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.990
 how can you do that on all computers too 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.060
 use 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.800
 I hope that was interesting for you 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.810
 and you have now seen it too 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.560
 really easy if you know 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.659
