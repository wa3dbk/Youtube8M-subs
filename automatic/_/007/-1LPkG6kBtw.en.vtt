b<00:00:18.869> code<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.220> we're<00:00:20.880> going<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.060> go<00:00:21.180> ahead<00:00:21.240> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
b code so we're going to go ahead and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.790 
b code so we're going to go ahead and
pull<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.779> out<00:00:21.960> we're<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> change<00:00:22.619> it

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
pull it out we're going to change it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.689 
pull it out we're going to change it
we're<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.130> see<00:00:23.189> if<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.400> clear<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
we're going to see if we can clear the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.349 
we're going to see if we can clear the
codes<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.269> see<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> computer<00:00:25.140> after

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
codes and see if it's the computer after

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.599 
codes and see if it's the computer after
clears<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.570> code<00:00:27.779> after<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.980> change<00:00:29.250> out<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
clears the code after we change out the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.519 
clears the code after we change out the
lockup<00:00:29.939> solenoid<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> show

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
lockup solenoid so and I'm going to show

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.200 
lockup solenoid so and I'm going to show
you<00:00:31.560> where<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.949> one<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.640> one's<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:33.030> on

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you where this one is this one's up on

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.520 
you where this one is this one's up on
the<00:00:33.329> top<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.750> we're<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.050> go<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.290> pull<00:00:34.440> it

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the top so we're going to go and pull it

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.650 
the top so we're going to go and pull it
off<00:00:34.680> replace<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.399> put<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> new<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.480> it

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
off replace it put the new one on it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.090 
off replace it put the new one on it
then<00:00:36.809> we're<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.230> try<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> clear<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
then we're going to go try to clear the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.270 
then we're going to go try to clear the
codes<00:00:38.370> sometimes<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> queer<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
codes sometimes you got a queer with the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
codes sometimes you got a queer with the
scanner<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:42.480> sometimes<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.020> got<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
scanner and then sometimes you got to a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.709 
scanner and then sometimes you got to a
hard<00:00:43.530> queer<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.120> doesn't<00:00:45.390> clear<00:00:45.510> with

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
hard queer and if it doesn't clear with

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.940 
hard queer and if it doesn't clear with
that<00:00:45.750> then<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.379> actually<00:00:46.469> replace

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
that then you have to actually replace

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.430 
that then you have to actually replace
the<00:00:47.129> PCM<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.090> let's<00:00:48.690> go<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.050> what<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.289> do

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the PCM so let's go see what we can do

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
the PCM so let's go see what we can do
yep<00:00:49.890> another<00:00:50.300> honda<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> said<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
yep another honda like I said with the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.250 
yep another honda like I said with the
flashin<00:00:52.500> d4<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.879> I've<00:00:54.210> already<00:00:54.390> scanned<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
flashin d4 so I've already scanned it it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
flashin d4 so I've already scanned it it
came<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.010> p1<00:00:56.670> seven<00:00:57.059> five<00:00:57.300> eight

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
came up with the p1 seven five eight

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
came up with the p1 seven five eight
which<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> lock<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.530> solenoid<00:00:58.969> B<00:00:59.969> with

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
which is the lock up solenoid B with

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.280 
which is the lock up solenoid B with
with<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.640> default<00:01:02.660> anyway<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.719> we're<00:01:04.199> going

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
with the default anyway so we're going

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.390 
with the default anyway so we're going
to<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.619> pull<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.860> off<00:01:04.979> we're<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.309> to

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to go and pull it off we're going to

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.100 
to go and pull it off we're going to
replace<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.049> if

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
replace it and we're going to see if

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.109 
replace it and we're going to see if
that<00:01:07.260> fixes<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.619> problem<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:08.700> there's<00:01:08.909> your

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
that fixes the problem now there's your

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
that fixes the problem now there's your
lock<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.960> solenoid<00:01:10.260> right<00:01:10.710> there<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.159> we're

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
lock up solenoid right there so we're

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.590 
lock up solenoid right there so we're
going<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.430> go<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.700> remove<00:01:11.939> its<00:01:12.180> three<00:01:12.390> ten

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
going to go and remove its three ten

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
going to go and remove its three ten
millimeter<00:01:12.990> bolts<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.590> got<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.950> hidden<00:01:14.220> back

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
millimeter bolts you got one hidden back

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.969 
millimeter bolts you got one hidden back
here<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.320> two<00:01:16.710> 10<00:01:16.950> millimeter

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
here and you have two 10 millimeter

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
here and you have two 10 millimeter
bolts<00:01:17.549> there<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.060> three<00:01:18.270> ten<00:01:18.450> millimeter

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
bolts there so it's three ten millimeter

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.450 
bolts there so it's three ten millimeter
all<00:01:19.110> together<00:01:19.530> make<00:01:19.979> sure<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.189> clean<00:01:20.430> up

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
all together make sure you clean up

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.249 
all together make sure you clean up
around<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.150> edge<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.720> take<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.080> brake

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
around the edge of it I take some brake

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.350 
around the edge of it I take some brake
clean<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.740> clean<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.130> pretty<00:01:23.400> good<00:01:23.430> so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
clean and just clean it pretty good so

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.580 
clean and just clean it pretty good so
we<00:01:24.450> don't<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.780> any<00:01:24.840> trash<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
we don't get any trash in the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.999 
we don't get any trash in the
transmission<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:27.150> enough<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.439> kind<00:01:28.979> of

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
transmission so enough that just kind of

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.130 
transmission so enough that just kind of
pops<00:01:29.280> out<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.490> place<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.509> held<00:01:30.689> any<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
pops out of place just held any with a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.050 
pops out of place just held any with a
little<00:01:31.350> o-ring

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
little o-ring

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.120 
little o-ring
so<00:01:33.060> let<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.229> out<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.680> we're<00:01:35.009> going

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
so let me get this out there we're going

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.240 
so let me get this out there we're going
to<00:01:35.189> inspect<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:36.030> what<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.210> looks<00:01:36.240> like

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
to inspect it and see what it looks like

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.679 
to inspect it and see what it looks like
now<00:01:38.250> your<00:01:38.430> lock<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.820> solenoid<00:01:39.060> should<00:01:39.509> look

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
now your lock up solenoid should look

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
now your lock up solenoid should look
just<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.350> nice<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.920> clean<00:01:41.100> where<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
just like this nice and clean where the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.429 
just like this nice and clean where the
screens<00:01:41.729> are<00:01:42.000> when<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.720> put<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
screens are when you put it this is the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.590 
screens are when you put it this is the
new<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.799> I'm<00:01:43.950> putting<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.399> or<00:01:44.820> new<00:01:45.090> used<00:01:45.390> one

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
new one I'm putting in or new used one

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.780 
new one I'm putting in or new used one
I'm<00:01:45.750> putting<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:47.220> make<00:01:47.430> sure<00:01:47.640> it's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
I'm putting in so just make sure it's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.520 
I'm putting in so just make sure it's
nice<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.000> clean<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.140> came<00:01:49.350> off<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
nice and clean like this this came off a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.380 
nice and clean like this this came off a
good<00:01:49.829> working<00:01:50.159> transmission<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.299> my

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
good working transmission is one of my

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.389 
good working transmission is one of my
spares<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.680> gonna<00:01:52.799> go<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.009> put<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> on

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
spares so we're gonna go and put it on

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.830 
spares so we're gonna go and put it on
there<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.640> pull<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.939> off<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> other<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.540> yeah

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
there I pull it off the other one yeah

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.289 
there I pull it off the other one yeah
it's<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.649> pretty<00:01:55.950> dirty<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:56.850> stuff<00:01:57.149> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
it's just pretty dirty in there stuff so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.399 
it's just pretty dirty in there stuff so
we're<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> go<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.200> guy<00:01:58.380> on

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
we're going to go and get this guy on

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
we're going to go and get this guy on
there<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.799> try<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> quit<00:01:59.250> code<00:01:59.460> okay<00:02:00.060> we're

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
there and try to quit code okay we're

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480 
there and try to quit code okay we're
going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> do<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> test<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.560> off<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.219> little

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
going to do a test on the off a little

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.240 
going to do a test on the off a little
shaw<00:02:03.030> lock-up<00:02:03.780> solenoid<00:02:04.229> now<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> way<00:02:05.040> this

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
shaw lock-up solenoid now the way this

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
shaw lock-up solenoid now the way this
works<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:06.119> pretty<00:02:06.240> much<00:02:06.360> ground<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
works is you can pretty much ground it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.710 
works is you can pretty much ground it
to<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.409> side<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.069> each<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.239> these<00:02:09.390> clips

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
to the one side and each one these clips

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.170 
to the one side and each one these clips
right<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.080> goes<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.009> solenoid<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.910> what

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
right here goes to the solenoid so what

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.340 
right here goes to the solenoid so what
you're<00:02:12.330> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.989> take

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
you're going to do is you take

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.760 
you're going to do is you take
your<00:02:14.390> yellow<00:02:15.390> jumper<00:02:15.840> wire<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.560> course

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
your yellow jumper wire and of course

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.170 
your yellow jumper wire and of course
you're<00:02:17.130> going<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.580> hooked<00:02:17.760> up<00:02:18.000> into

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
you're going to have it hooked up into

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.490 
you're going to have it hooked up into
your<00:02:18.300> battery<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.810> then<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.020> just<00:02:19.200> plug<00:02:19.470> it

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
your battery and then you just plug it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.080 
your battery and then you just plug it
in<00:02:19.680> right<00:02:19.710> here<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.250> should<00:02:20.430> hear<00:02:20.550> oh

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
when hear that those are working the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.780 
when hear that those are working the
other<00:02:40.380> thing<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.740> want<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.980> do<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.670> do

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
other thing you want to do is you can do

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.090 
other thing you want to do is you can do
it<00:02:41.910> um<00:02:42.060> test<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.630> these<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.170> they<00:02:43.620> should<00:02:43.860> um

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
it um test on these and they should um

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.020 
it um test on these and they should um
out<00:02:44.340> from<00:02:44.730> 12<00:02:45.150> ohms<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.780> 25<00:02:46.260> ohms<00:02:46.730> do<00:02:47.730> one<00:02:47.910> on

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
out from 12 ohms to 25 ohms do one on

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.940 
out from 12 ohms to 25 ohms do one on
each<00:02:48.270> one<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.780> leads<00:02:48.990> inside<00:02:49.440> there<00:02:49.710> and

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
each one of the leads inside there and

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.950 
each one of the leads inside there and
that<00:02:50.340> goes<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.700> each<00:02:50.850> one<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.120> solenoids<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
that goes to each one the solenoids and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.390 
that goes to each one the solenoids and
that<00:02:52.230> way<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.410> can<00:02:52.680> check<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:53.220> make<00:02:53.370> sure

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
that way you can check and make sure

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.470 
that way you can check and make sure
your<00:02:53.670> solenoids<00:02:54.360> okay<00:02:54.840> 12<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:56.250> 25<00:02:56.730> ohms<00:02:57.090> each

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
your solenoids okay 12 to 25 ohms each

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.800 
your solenoids okay 12 to 25 ohms each
side<00:02:58.410> within<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.640> area<00:02:59.910> if<00:03:00.270> it's<00:03:00.420> out<00:03:00.600> of

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
side within that area if it's out of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.190 
side within that area if it's out of
that<00:03:00.930> range<00:03:01.200> then<00:03:01.710> it's<00:03:01.920> bad<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:03.990> how

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
that range then it's bad so this is how

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.720 
that range then it's bad so this is how
you<00:03:04.260> start<00:03:04.560> troubleshooting<00:03:04.950> your<00:03:05.250> D<00:03:05.460> for

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
you start troubleshooting your D for

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.360 
you start troubleshooting your D for
flashing<00:03:06.360> D<00:03:06.660> force<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:07.140> your<00:03:07.260> Honda's<00:03:07.650> anyways

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
flashing D force on your Honda's anyways

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.910 
flashing D force on your Honda's anyways
we've<00:03:08.580> already<00:03:08.700> put<00:03:09.000> another<00:03:09.440> good<00:03:10.440> solenoid

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
we've already put another good solenoid

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.310 
we've already put another good solenoid
in<00:03:11.130> there<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.090> we're<00:03:12.600> still<00:03:12.810> having<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:13.110> little

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
in there so we're still having a little

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.900 
in there so we're still having a little
bit<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.500> issue<00:03:13.680> which<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.220> lot<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.490> times<00:03:14.670> goes

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
bit of issue which a lot of times goes

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.660 
bit of issue which a lot of times goes
right<00:03:15.120> back<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.690> actual<00:03:15.960> computer

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
right back to the actual computer

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.460 
right back to the actual computer
unfortunately<00:03:17.750> back<00:03:18.750> with<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:21.470> lockup

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
unfortunately back with the lockup

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.040 
unfortunately back with the lockup
solenoid<00:03:22.970> one<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.210> things<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.690> always

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
solenoid one of the things you always

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.830 
solenoid one of the things you always
want<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.320> do<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.740> once<00:03:26.580> over<00:03:26.970> everything<00:03:27.270> so<00:03:27.810> I

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
want to do is once over everything so I

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.160 
want to do is once over everything so I
pulled<00:03:28.320> off<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.920> air<00:03:29.670> cleaner<00:03:30.210> as<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.930> see

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
pulled off the air cleaner as you see

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.290 
pulled off the air cleaner as you see
found<00:03:31.740> a<00:03:31.890> thermostat<00:03:32.460> sitting<00:03:32.850> down<00:03:33.060> there

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
found a thermostat sitting down there

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.140 
found a thermostat sitting down there
gas<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:34.440> guy<00:03:34.590> collects<00:03:35.160> turbo<00:03:35.550> she's<00:03:35.910> laying

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
gas the guy collects turbo she's laying

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.450 
gas the guy collects turbo she's laying
there<00:03:36.300> you<00:03:36.450> know<00:03:36.570> so<00:03:37.500> as<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:38.130> started

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
there you know so as I started

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.780 
there you know so as I started
inspecting<00:03:39.120> everything<00:03:39.660> what<00:03:40.530> do<00:03:40.890> you<00:03:41.070> see<00:03:41.460> is

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
inspecting everything what do you see is

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.140 
inspecting everything what do you see is
missing<00:03:42.750> right<00:03:43.170> here<00:03:43.610> well<00:03:44.610> we<00:03:44.790> have<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.940> little

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
missing right here well we have a little

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.590 
missing right here well we have a little
bit<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.420> green<00:03:45.750> on<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.260> left<00:03:46.530> side<00:03:46.830> and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
bit of green on the left side and

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.530 
bit of green on the left side and
there's<00:03:48.600> nothing<00:03:49.080> on<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.380> right<00:03:49.590> side<00:03:50.540> that's

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
there's nothing on the right side that's

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.050 
there's nothing on the right side that's
because<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.260> actual<00:03:52.860> pin<00:03:53.160> has<00:03:53.460> come<00:03:53.700> undone

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
because the actual pin has come undone

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.900 
because the actual pin has come undone
from<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.510> backside<00:03:54.990> so<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.520> to<00:03:56.670> clean

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
from the backside so I have to clean

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.820 
from the backside so I have to clean
this<00:03:57.060> up<00:03:57.240> and<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.110> problem<00:03:58.470> why<00:03:58.770> this

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
this up and that is the problem why this

corrosion on there and I use some of my

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.090 
corrosion on there and I use some of my
favorite<00:04:21.630> spray<00:04:21.960> yeah<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.350> can't<00:04:22.650> see<00:04:22.860> it's

but<00:04:24.270> it's<00:04:24.420> called<00:04:24.710> erosion<00:04:25.710> X<00:04:26.250> that<00:04:26.940> stuff<00:04:27.510> is

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
but it's called erosion X that stuff is

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.060 
but it's called erosion X that stuff is
amazing<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.710> works

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
amazing it works

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
not readily available you need to find a

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.550 
not readily available you need to find a
Marine<00:04:35.730> store<00:04:36.090> type<00:04:36.390> thing<00:04:36.660> but<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.110> stuff's

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
Marine store type thing but that stuff's

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.980 
Marine store type thing but that stuff's
great<00:04:38.010> anyways<00:04:38.940> have<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.270> repend<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.900> and

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
great anyways have to repend it and

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.660 
great anyways have to repend it and
cleaned<00:04:40.170> everything<00:04:40.290> up<00:04:40.740> as<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.190> see<00:04:41.400> the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
cleaned everything up as you see the

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.210 
cleaned everything up as you see the
lock-up<00:04:42.480> solenoid<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:43.140> already<00:04:43.650> reconnected

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
lock-up solenoid is already reconnected

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.520 
lock-up solenoid is already reconnected
and<00:04:44.400> guess<00:04:44.670> what<00:04:45.030> turn<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.780> key<00:04:45.960> on<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.260> see

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
and guess what turn the key on and see

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.240 
and guess what turn the key on and see
we<00:04:46.680> got<00:04:46.860> all<00:04:47.250> right<00:04:47.700> d4<00:04:48.480> has<00:04:48.720> come<00:04:48.960> on<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.530> it

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
we got all right d4 has come on and it

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.820 
we got all right d4 has come on and it
is<00:04:50.370> gone<00:04:50.580> off<00:04:50.880> so<00:04:51.360> what<00:04:52.080> that<00:04:52.230> does<00:04:52.440> just<00:04:52.770> like

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
is gone off so what that does just like

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.130 
is gone off so what that does just like
you<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.160> check<00:04:53.340> in<00:04:53.550> July<00:04:56.510> 24<00:04:57.510> should<00:04:57.750> come<00:04:57.930> on

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
you to check in July 24 should come on

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.280 
you to check in July 24 should come on
for<00:04:58.320> about<00:04:58.500> 1<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:58.950> 3<00:04:58.980> seconds<00:04:59.730> it<00:05:00.210> runs<00:05:00.780> all<00:05:01.080> its

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
for about 1 to 3 seconds it runs all its

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.320 
for about 1 to 3 seconds it runs all its
checks<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:01.980> if<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.430> goes<00:05:02.580> off<00:05:02.820> then<00:05:03.150> it's

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
checks and if it goes off then it's

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.520 
checks and if it goes off then it's
doing<00:05:03.540> what<00:05:03.690> it's<00:05:03.780> supposed<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:04.110> do<00:05:04.260> let's

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
doing what it's supposed to do let's

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.720 
doing what it's supposed to do let's
start<00:05:04.770> ups<00:05:05.070> here<00:05:05.220> we<00:05:05.340> go
