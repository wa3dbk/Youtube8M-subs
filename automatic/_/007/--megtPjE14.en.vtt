channel<00:00:10.710> keeps<00:00:10.920> cutting<00:00:11.160> out<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.639> gets<00:00:11.790> to

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
channel keeps cutting out and it gets to

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.749

be very annoying so of course he opened
it<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.089> went<00:00:15.299> away<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.780> then<00:00:15.960> they<00:00:16.170> it'll

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
it up it went away and then they it'll

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.120 
it up it went away and then they it'll
act<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.640> again<00:00:17.880> later<00:00:18.090> soon<00:00:18.330> as<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.449> walk<00:00:18.630> away

showing<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.050> bat<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.650> back<00:02:21.800> fender<00:02:22.190> and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
showing up the bat the back fender and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.590 
showing up the bat the back fender and
the<00:02:22.340> tank<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:23.030> think<00:02:24.790> if<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.880> want<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.209> go<00:02:26.300> do<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
the tank I think if I want to go do the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.630 
the tank I think if I want to go do the
bike<00:02:26.780> at<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.990> copper<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.500> think<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.920> may<00:02:28.610> have

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
bike at a copper I think it may have

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.550 
bike at a copper I think it may have
made<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.120> little<00:02:29.450> too<00:02:29.600> busy<00:02:30.080> with<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> black

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
made it a little too busy with a black

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.040 
made it a little too busy with a black
kinda<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:35.060> makes<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.390> other<00:02:35.450> pieces<00:02:35.690> beehive

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
kinda it makes the other pieces beehive

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.820 
kinda it makes the other pieces beehive
more<00:02:36.320> highlighted<00:02:38.140> one<00:02:39.140> thing<00:02:39.320> I<00:02:39.410> kind<00:02:39.770> of

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
more highlighted one thing I kind of

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.370 
more highlighted one thing I kind of
screwed<00:02:40.010> up<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:41.050> I'm<00:02:42.050> putting<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.350> back

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
screwed up on I'm putting it back

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.479 
screwed up on I'm putting it back
together<00:02:42.590> everything<00:02:42.980> that's<00:02:43.130> fine<00:02:43.280> was

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
together everything that's fine was

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.460 
together everything that's fine was
before<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:44.090> put<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.660> mess<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.989> links<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.410> I

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
before I put the mess the links in it I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.560 
before I put the mess the links in it I
want<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.680> go<00:02:45.770> pedal<00:02:46.160> around<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.970> master<00:02:47.390> link

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
want to go pedal around the master link

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.199 
want to go pedal around the master link
is<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.260> little<00:02:48.620> wider<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.580> when<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.790> cut<00:02:50.030> this

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
is a little wider so when I cut this

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.630 
is a little wider so when I cut this
pulley<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.810> can<00:02:51.560> cut<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:51.890> wide<00:02:52.040> enough<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.340> the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
pulley I can cut it wide enough so the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.479 
pulley I can cut it wide enough so the
massive<00:02:52.970> Lincoln's<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.830> Jambor<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.220> so

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
massive Lincoln's and Jambor it in it so

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.280 
massive Lincoln's and Jambor it in it so
I<00:02:55.700> got<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.150> pop<00:02:56.269> this<00:02:56.420> back<00:02:56.630> off<00:02:56.840> put<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.110> on<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
I got to pop this back off put it on the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.900 
I got to pop this back off put it on the
lathe<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.709> just<00:02:57.920> open<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.280> up<00:02:58.370> just<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.850> little

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
lathe and just open it up just a little

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.240 
lathe and just open it up just a little
bit<00:02:59.180> more<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.930> I'll<00:03:00.530> probably<00:03:00.650> take<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.130> and

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
bit more and I'll probably take it and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.740 
bit more and I'll probably take it and
just<00:03:01.310> kind<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:01.910> grind<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.390> end<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.660> the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
just kind of grind the end of the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.240 
just kind of grind the end of the
massive<00:03:03.200> links<00:03:03.590> just<00:03:03.769> a<00:03:03.830> little<00:03:04.010> bit<00:03:04.100> off<00:03:04.220> of

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
massive links just a little bit off of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.690 
massive links just a little bit off of
it

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
it

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.770 
it
and<00:03:05.000> that'll<00:03:05.420> be<00:03:05.450> back<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.900> normal<00:03:07.630> meet<00:03:08.630> some

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
and that'll be back to normal meet some

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.449 
and that'll be back to normal meet some
keepers<00:03:09.140> for<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.440> back<00:03:09.650> steps<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.160> pull<00:03:10.370> the

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
keepers for the back steps to pull the

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.680 
keepers for the back steps to pull the
back<00:03:10.610> wheel<00:03:10.790> which<00:03:11.030> is<00:03:11.120> basically<00:03:11.360> just<00:03:11.450> a

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
back wheel which is basically just a

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.530 
back wheel which is basically just a
bolt<00:03:11.930> weld<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.440> washer<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.250> then<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.180> stop

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
bolt weld it to a washer and then a stop

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.770 
bolt weld it to a washer and then a stop
on<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.019> then<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.769> know<00:03:15.830> you<00:03:15.980> run<00:03:16.160> your<00:03:16.780> GM

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
on it and then you know you run your GM

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.120 
on it and then you know you run your GM
nefta<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.350> hold<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.620> we<00:03:18.739> open<00:03:18.920> getting

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
nefta to hold that we open getting

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.530 
nefta to hold that we open getting
sucked<00:03:19.340> forward<00:03:19.640> instead<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.910> relying<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:20.390> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
sucked forward instead of relying on the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.990 
sucked forward instead of relying on the
center<00:03:21.110> there<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:25.220> better<00:03:25.430> outside<00:03:25.610> in<00:03:25.940> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
center there you better outside in the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.490 
center there you better outside in the
light<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.360> can<00:03:26.390> kinda<00:03:26.690> get<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.900> idea<00:03:26.930> as<00:03:27.350> you

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
light you can kinda get the idea as you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.470 
light you can kinda get the idea as you
move<00:03:27.680> around<00:03:27.799> it<00:03:28.100> kind<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:29.299> know<00:03:29.360> it

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
move around it kind of you know it

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.500 
move around it kind of you know it
changes<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:31.610> different<00:03:32.000> reflections<00:03:32.420> from

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
changes the different reflections from

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.569 
changes the different reflections from
different<00:03:32.840> directions<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.620> can<00:03:33.829> a

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:47.850 

Fathead<00:03:37.579> out<00:03:37.880> of<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.120> light<00:03:39.670> see<00:03:40.670> what<00:03:40.820> I<00:03:40.850> mean
