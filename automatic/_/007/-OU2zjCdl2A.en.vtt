00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello everyone and welcome back to a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.679
 new video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:14.309
 today I am still here with giulia ciao 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.500
 then today we will make a rather strange video 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.109
 from the usual we can say so we put 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.230
 a video titled amber and giulia 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.930
 or you will see amber or giulia here 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.119
 under the title it's pretty much we'll have 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.480
 both this fund I wrote from 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.940
 one part less while the other cases 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.180
 in short, there are questions and us 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.870
 we have to put if it's me or if it is 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.870
 the other person 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:54.180
 let's start first question who is cooler ok 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.780
 so are the serious crimes are that 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:12.860
 then it happens that ap tears easy cern 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:16.110
 and asean drills the expected guy 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.740
 when we open it like that because we don't 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.580
 we also know how white it is 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.450
 easy tear 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.450
 I would not know much then there is more clumsiness 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:38.090
 that the flowering of atri to when 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.090
 now those who cook millet arrived 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:47.860
 marine would be 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:52.650
 okay who dances better her course 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.650
 but the best was those who were more early risers 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.700
 significant one who gets up late 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:09.010
 or go lucky stable on the bed and there 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:15.130
 he then believes kiabi shoes I do n't know before 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:19.200
 see you see it's dark when we do 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.200
 so it is because it copies in the sun 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.550
 in short, I do not know who more scarface who 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.550
 eat more crap 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:45.340
 I have no more sugar now 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:50.620
 that the most spendthrift but it seems 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.140
 however, those who watch TV the most do not 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.530
 like to watch many tv we are in 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:04.920
 such plan no no no no no I don't 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:10.120
 I ate practically ok then myself 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:13.540
 they are finished however they were 13 I hope that 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.230
