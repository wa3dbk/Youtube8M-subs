life and a good many Chinese writers

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.540 
life and a good many Chinese writers
have<00:06:16.030> said<00:06:16.240> about<00:06:16.419> the<00:06:16.600> same<00:06:16.780> thing<00:06:17.550> it's

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
have said about the same thing it's

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.100 
have said about the same thing it's
curious<00:06:18.910> that<00:06:19.000> Shakespeare<00:06:19.570> was<00:06:19.630> never<00:06:19.900> very

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
curious that Shakespeare was never very

religion

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.150 
religion
I<00:06:23.330> think<00:06:24.330> this<00:06:24.450> was<00:06:24.660> his<00:06:24.780> greatness<00:06:25.020> he<00:06:25.980> took

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
I think this was his greatness he took

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.040 
I think this was his greatness he took
human<00:06:26.430> life<00:06:26.700> largely<00:06:27.180> as<00:06:27.480> it<00:06:27.600> was<00:06:27.780> and

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
human life largely as it was and

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.560 
human life largely as it was and
intruded<00:06:28.950> himself<00:06:29.370> as<00:06:29.550> little<00:06:30.210> upon<00:06:30.450> the

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
intruded himself as little upon the

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.930 
intruded himself as little upon the
general<00:06:30.960> scheme<00:06:31.080> of<00:06:31.380> things<00:06:31.440> as<00:06:31.889> he<00:06:32.340> did<00:06:32.700> upon

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
general scheme of things as he did upon

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.140 
general scheme of things as he did upon
the<00:06:33.030> characters<00:06:33.450> of<00:06:33.480> his<00:06:33.690> place<00:06:35.150> Shakespeare

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
the characters of his place Shakespeare

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.330 
the characters of his place Shakespeare
was<00:06:36.330> like<00:06:36.480> nature<00:06:36.840> herself<00:06:36.990> and<00:06:37.919> that<00:06:37.950> is<00:06:38.220> the

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
was like nature herself and that is the

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.070 
was like nature herself and that is the
greatest<00:06:38.580> compliment<00:06:39.210> we<00:06:39.360> can<00:06:39.510> pay<00:06:39.720> to<00:06:39.750> any

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
greatest compliment we can pay to any
