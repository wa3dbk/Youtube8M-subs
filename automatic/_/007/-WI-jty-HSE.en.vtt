open sixth string second fret then we'd

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.400 
open sixth string second fret then we'd

this

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.100 

then<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.140> have<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.500> second<00:05:07.160> variation<00:05:08.110> we'll

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
then I have a second variation we'll

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.800 
then I have a second variation we'll
start<00:05:09.470> on<00:05:09.560> that<00:05:09.710> same<00:05:10.070> G<00:05:10.460> major<00:05:10.670> chord<00:05:10.820> for<00:05:11.780> a

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
sign lead and run as the previous

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.770 
sign lead and run as the previous
exercise

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.150 

and<00:05:23.200> upon<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.650> sea<00:05:23.950> note<00:05:24.280> this<00:05:25.410> Secord<00:05:26.410> then
