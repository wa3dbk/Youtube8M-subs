00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
ok this is the kia optima one of the

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.090 
ok this is the kia optima one of the
things<00:00:02.580> i<00:00:02.730> really<00:00:02.760> like<00:00:02.970> about<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:04.100> its

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
simplicity you look at the IP it's very

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.749 
simplicity you look at the IP it's very
traditional<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.420> one<00:00:12.630> sense<00:00:13.049> with<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.759> three

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759

of the things I got to remember this is
a<00:01:42.750> kia<00:01:43.110> optima<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:44.189> got<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.460> compare<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.850> with

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
a kia optima you got to compare it with

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.960 
a kia optima you got to compare it with
the<00:01:45.030> old<00:01:45.390> optima<00:01:46.049> which<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.790> nothing<00:01:47.790> like

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the old optima which was nothing like

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270 
the old optima which was nothing like
this<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.540> such<00:01:48.869> an<00:01:49.020> upgrade<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.860> this
