been going around is an improvement in

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.620 
been going around is an improvement in
serie<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.560> really<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.790> smarter<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
serie and really just a smarter and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.840 
serie and really just a smarter and
deeper<00:01:25.080> integration<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.920> siri<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> can

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
deeper integration of siri so you can

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.160 
deeper integration of siri so you can
use<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.270> different<00:01:27.450> applications

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
use it with different applications

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.690 
use it with different applications
whether<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.619> from<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> app<00:01:29.220> store<00:01:29.250> or

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
whether they be from the app store or

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.940 
whether they be from the app store or
inside<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.689> iphone<00:01:31.229> because<00:01:31.470> at<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> minute

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
inside the iphone because at the minute

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.910 
inside the iphone because at the minute
in<00:01:32.070> iOS<00:01:32.460> 6<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.210> very<00:01:33.360> limited<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.409> obviously

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
in iOS 6 it is very limited so obviously

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.830 
in iOS 6 it is very limited so obviously
the<00:01:35.100> sad<00:01:35.280> fact<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.790> probably<00:01:36.390> none<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.689> us

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the sad fact is that probably none of us

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.560 
the sad fact is that probably none of us
are<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.680> WWDC<00:01:38.610> event<00:01:39.270> live
