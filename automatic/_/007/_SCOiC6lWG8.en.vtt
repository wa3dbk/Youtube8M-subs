00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.509
 we have no idea how not to be in the site so keep 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.810
 to be released back up 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.810
 So you teach me two hours 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.870
 here is his determined look m 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.030
 so can we bring peace the systems on the desk 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.710
 and to be able to change to lichuan which should not be too much 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.090
 complicated 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 it is not enough to open 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.020
 they immediately have direct access to hard drives in mind 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.410
 just unscrew 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.410
 this practice aims higher 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.420
 no 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.510
 we are on me 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.870
 he said m 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.850
 the clothes of his hard drive 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.200
 so he only makes four musical 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.340
 and with the imminent arrival of grand tourism but this winter 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.280
 this is not enough 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.280
 barak paraded a few small lives 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.790
 artist 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.890
 so we are all 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.760
 apple 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.370
 ActuSF 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.550
 short jackets 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.020
 this for the rest 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.060
 after a moment 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.180
 everything is relative 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.769
 so no 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.309
 new hard drive contains nice-morning 300 million beat to come back 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.929
 as a sport when you have to choose at 5400 rpm 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.929
 I think the 7200 impregnable things too 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.029
 and suddenly weighs on the country 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:25.729
 true 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.729
 the boat welcomed the return of others 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:37.459
 the tricolor cabinetmaker am happy here the btp is happening 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.759
 ap 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.439
 in attack 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.029
 so we have a flawed procedure 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.029
 Italy is a structure 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:17.609
 and of course 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.719
 fournier 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.719
 what you screw goal 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.339
 no no we find ourselves just now for the system station comes 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.339
 to install local ump at the limit 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.769
 these messages the signal that which is who and arles and so you have to go 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.809
 download the latest update available on tablets 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.859
 and detail life to two a usb key for example 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.739
 so that's what we're going to do here now to download 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.529
 the last update of the pistachio 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.529
 not much time 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.779
 but a sad day exception well 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:01.759
 unfortunately not since official 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.839
 there the features of a hamster 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.349
 hence a cure 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.199
 three points 40 m 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.569
 not the last 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.699
 the 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.169
 three poles 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.079
 you know 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.019
 and we can not escape 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.579
 so I'm not going to robert shiller solution 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.150
 so that's clear 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.009
 but also 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.059
 ps3 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:28.040
 in which we will create a folder 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.139
 d 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.080
 in which we will slide 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.599
 the price file 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.969
 and we end up on equalization 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.969
 so here I just put the usb key in the social crisis 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
 a first so you have to press start and select 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.969
 Why 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.669
 we are told that the muscular part of the reformer and and that we must support 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.669
 on foot texts articles or because I'm going to do 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.889
 for number that's all 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.069
 the offender has started we will perform a classic update 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.969
 actions have access 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.969
 valid 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.749
 so that's where we choose so 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:54.960
 French as the main language 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.960
 but mostly use the mini-pc 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.979
 I want 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.979
 world 

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:16.550
 but inter milan so I do not know why but a video that is cold 

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:18.749
 haye 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:21.869
 we fear makes the gentleman go to the wall 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:25.159
 2 likewise the whole meeting to safeguard what the wound is 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:29.319
 to restore the data so which are I'm happy the hard drive 6 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:35.110
 so that's the manipulation in the order 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.240
 it's about 20 minutes that it will go 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.240
 so the trend 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:45.589
 for months 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:51.559
 we had understood before the hands 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:02.699
 the controller a married man 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.589
 bahrain 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:08.589
 he is changing his look 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:12.899
 and here are all your 

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.059
 everything is OK 

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:18.059
 really rubbish 

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:24.289
 you quote me but this shit the rugbymen all the backups so that 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:25.520
 I had before 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.520
 for the amateurs nothing apparently was over 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.759
 the
