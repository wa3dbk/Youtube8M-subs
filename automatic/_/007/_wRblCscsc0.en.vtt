comm<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:08.280> lesson<00:00:08.580> what<00:00:08.880> we're<00:00:09.000> going<00:00:09.180> to

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
comm in this lesson what we're going to

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.299 
comm in this lesson what we're going to
do<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.540> continue<00:00:09.809> working<00:00:10.469> with<00:00:10.770> the<00:00:10.889> greatest

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
do is continue working with the greatest

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.549 
do is continue working with the greatest
common<00:00:11.700> factor<00:00:11.809> but<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.930> this<00:00:13.049> case<00:00:13.289> we're

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
common factor but in this case we're

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.080 
common factor but in this case we're
going<00:00:13.709> to<00:00:13.860> try<00:00:14.039> to<00:00:14.100> find<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.459> greatest<00:00:14.789> common

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
going to try to find the greatest common

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.450 
going to try to find the greatest common
factor<00:00:15.119> between<00:00:15.780> three<00:00:16.289> members<00:00:16.619> now<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:17.340> you

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
factor between three members now if you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.070 
factor between three members now if you
recall<00:00:17.820> from<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.180> last<00:00:18.480> section<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.990> were

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
recall from the last section we were

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.929 
recall from the last section we were
given<00:00:19.350> two<00:00:19.560> numbers<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.580> find<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
given two numbers and to find the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.700 
given two numbers and to find the
greatest<00:00:21.150> common<00:00:21.300> factor<00:00:21.929> between<00:00:21.960> those<00:00:22.439> two

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
greatest common factor between those two

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.800 
greatest common factor between those two
we<00:00:22.920> list<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.519> factors<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> then<00:00:24.509> we<00:00:24.630> look

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
we list the factors out and then we look

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.050 
we list the factors out and then we look
for<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> largest<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.769> that's<00:00:25.980> common<00:00:26.460> well

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
for the largest one that's common well

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.040 
for the largest one that's common well
you<00:00:27.179> see<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.419> doesn't<00:00:27.660> matter<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:27.929> you're

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you see it doesn't matter if you're

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.870 
you see it doesn't matter if you're
given<00:00:28.320> two<00:00:28.410> numbers<00:00:28.919> or<00:00:29.099> three<00:00:29.369> numbers<00:00:29.730> or

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
given two numbers or three numbers or

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
given two numbers or three numbers or
four<00:00:30.119> numbers<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:30.570> whatever<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
four numbers or whatever you can do the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.130 
four numbers or whatever you can do the
same<00:00:32.250> process<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.390> many<00:00:33.630> numbers<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:33.990> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
same process for as many numbers as you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.200 
same process for as many numbers as you
have<00:00:34.560> so<00:00:35.130> what<00:00:35.160> we're<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
have so what we're going to do here is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.090 
have so what we're going to do here is
apply<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.870> three<00:00:37.230> numbers<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.770> give<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.980> an

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
apply it to three numbers to give you an

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.139 
apply it to three numbers to give you an
idea<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.430> how<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> do<00:00:38.820> that

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
idea of how to do that

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.450 
idea of how to do that
so<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.410> wanted<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> find<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> greatest

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so if you wanted to find the greatest

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.709 
so if you wanted to find the greatest
common<00:00:41.640> factor<00:00:42.329> between<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.840> number<00:00:43.109> 6<00:00:44.719> 24

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
common factor between the number 6 24

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.700 
common factor between the number 6 24
and<00:00:46.370> 18<00:00:47.600> then<00:00:48.600> here's<00:00:48.960> how<00:00:49.199> you<00:00:49.260> would<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.680> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and 18 then here's how you would do it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.490 
and 18 then here's how you would do it
the<00:00:50.250> first<00:00:50.489> thing<00:00:50.699> you<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.359> you<00:00:52.289> would

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the first thing you do is you would

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.020 
the first thing you do is you would
write<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.070> your<00:00:53.219> first<00:00:53.399> number<00:00:53.609> which<00:00:53.910> in

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
write down your first number which in

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.369 
write down your first number which in
this<00:00:54.120> case<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.510> number<00:00:54.750> 6<00:00:55.019> and<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.230> would

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
this case is number 6 and you would

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.090 
this case is number 6 and you would
write<00:00:55.590> down<00:00:55.859> the<00:00:56.070> factors<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:57.899> number<00:00:58.769> one<00:00:58.949> is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
write down the factors so number one is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.650 
write down the factors so number one is
always<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.370> factor<00:00:59.640> because<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.359> divide

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
always a factor because it can divide

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.319 
always a factor because it can divide
evenly<00:01:01.050> into<00:01:01.170> six<00:01:01.789> number<00:01:02.789> two<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> factor

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
evenly into six number two is a factor

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.310 
evenly into six number two is a factor
because<00:01:03.989> 2<00:01:04.199> times<00:01:04.410> 3<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.800> 6<00:01:05.930> number<00:01:06.930> 3<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
because 2 times 3 is 6 number 3 is a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.670 
because 2 times 3 is 6 number 3 is a
factor<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:08.130> 3<00:01:08.430> times<00:01:08.700> 2<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.060> 6<00:01:09.320> 4<00:01:10.320> &amp;<00:01:10.470> 5

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
factor because 3 times 2 is 6 4 &amp; 5

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.530 
factor because 3 times 2 is 6 4 &amp; 5
neither<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.370> of<00:01:11.400> those<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:11.880> factors<00:01:12.210> because

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
neither one of those are factors because

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.210 
neither one of those are factors because
they<00:01:12.720> cannot<00:01:13.050> be<00:01:13.260> divided<00:01:13.590> evenly<00:01:13.830> into

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
they cannot be divided evenly into

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.000 
they cannot be divided evenly into
number<00:01:14.760> 6<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> number<00:01:15.960> itself<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.740> course

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
number 6 but the number itself of course

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.010 
number 6 but the number itself of course
is<00:01:17.280> always<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> factor<00:01:17.910> so<00:01:18.300> we<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.600> list<00:01:18.840> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
is always a factor so we can list that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.550 
is always a factor so we can list that
out<00:01:19.910> then<00:01:20.910> we<00:01:21.060> look<00:01:21.240> at<00:01:21.360> our<00:01:21.480> middle<00:01:22.110> number<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
out then we look at our middle number so

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.700 
out then we look at our middle number so
here's<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.980> number<00:01:23.220> 24<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.990> list<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
here's the number 24 and we list all the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.890 
here's the number 24 and we list all the
factors<00:01:25.890> now<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.730> little<00:01:26.880> tricky<00:01:27.120> so

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
factors now I can get a little tricky so

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.780 
factors now I can get a little tricky so
we<00:01:28.080> need<00:01:28.230> to<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.530> make<00:01:28.590> sure<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.010> do<00:01:29.160> it<00:01:29.340> step

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
we need to just make sure and do it step

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.720 
we need to just make sure and do it step
by<00:01:29.820> step<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.480> number<00:01:30.720> 1<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.230> factor<00:01:31.730> because

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
by step the number 1 is a factor because

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.760 
by step the number 1 is a factor because
they<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.970> divide<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.050> number<00:01:34.320> 2<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
they can divide in the number 2 is a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.730 
they can divide in the number 2 is a
factor<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.340> 2<00:01:35.700> times<00:01:35.970> 12<00:01:36.300> is<00:01:36.540> 24<00:01:36.810> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
marching up 13 14 15 you'll find that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
none of those can divide in so they're

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.059 
none of those can divide in so they're
not<00:02:11.790> factors<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.019> last<00:02:13.230> one<00:02:13.560> all<00:02:13.859> these

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
not factors so the last one all these

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.250 
not factors so the last one all these
lists<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.579> always<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.209> number<00:02:15.540> itself<00:02:15.900> notice

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
lists is always the number itself notice

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.520 
lists is always the number itself notice
the<00:02:16.409> last<00:02:16.590> number<00:02:16.980> is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
the last number is

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.570 
the last number is
is<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.860> number<00:02:18.130> itself<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:19.240> 1<00:02:19.510> 2<00:02:19.780> 3<00:02:20.110> 4<00:02:20.500> 6<00:02:20.830> 8<00:02:21.069> 12

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
is the number itself so 1 2 3 4 6 8 12

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.240 
is the number itself so 1 2 3 4 6 8 12
and<00:02:21.730> 24<00:02:22.209> those<00:02:22.420> are<00:02:22.569> all<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:23.020> factors<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.650> this

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
and 24 those are all the factors of this

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.990 
and 24 those are all the factors of this
number<00:02:24.580> now<00:02:24.850> let's<00:02:25.120> look<00:02:25.270> at<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> number<00:02:25.720> 18

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
number now let's look at the number 18

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.390 
number now let's look at the number 18
okay<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.990> number<00:02:29.200> 1<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.530> factor<00:02:29.770> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
okay so the number 1 is a factor the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.370 
okay so the number 1 is a factor the
number<00:02:30.640> 2<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> factor<00:02:31.240> because<00:02:31.540> 2<00:02:31.870> times<00:02:32.050> 9

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
number 2 is a factor because 2 times 9

number 2 is a factor because 2 times 9
is<00:02:32.410> 18<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.730> number<00:02:33.970> 3<00:02:34.209> is<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.330> factor<00:02:34.450> because<00:02:34.900> 3

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
is 18 the number 3 is a factor because 3

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.570 
is 18 the number 3 is a factor because 3
times<00:02:35.319> 6<00:02:35.830> is<00:02:35.950> 18

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
times 6 is 18

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.059 
times 6 is 18
4<00:02:37.150> &amp;<00:02:37.330> 5<00:02:37.540> are<00:02:37.810> not<00:02:37.840> factors<00:02:38.440> because<00:02:38.709> they<00:02:38.890> don't

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
4 &amp; 5 are not factors because they don't

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.670 
4 &amp; 5 are not factors because they don't
go<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.489> evenly<00:02:40.180> but<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.989> number<00:02:41.230> 6<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.650> a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
factor because 6 times 3 is 18 7 &amp; 8 you

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.370 
factor because 6 times 3 is 18 7 &amp; 8 you
can<00:02:45.280> skip<00:02:45.640> because<00:02:45.910> they<00:02:46.060> don't<00:02:46.239> go<00:02:46.390> in<00:02:46.569> but

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
can skip because they don't go in but

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.830 
can skip because they don't go in but
number<00:02:47.620> 9<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.430> factor<00:02:48.910> because<00:02:49.150> 9<00:02:49.360> times<00:02:49.630> 2

number 9 is a factor because 9 times 2
is<00:02:49.870> 18<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.650> then<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.519> just<00:02:51.700> keep<00:02:51.880> going<00:02:52.030> on

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
is 18 and then you just keep going on

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.150 
is 18 and then you just keep going on
and<00:02:52.360> on<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.870> last<00:02:53.080> guy<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.650> find<00:02:53.890> is<00:02:54.070> the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
and on the last guy that you find is the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.729 
and on the last guy that you find is the
number<00:02:54.370> 18<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.910> number<00:02:55.120> itself<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:55.720> all<00:02:55.930> we've

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
number 18 the number itself so all we've

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.710 
number 18 the number itself so all we've
done<00:02:56.769> is<00:02:56.980> write<00:02:57.340> all<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.760> factors<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.209> all<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
done is write all the factors of all the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.479 
done is write all the factors of all the
numbers<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.200> we<00:02:59.650> can<00:02:59.680> see<00:03:00.040> right<00:03:00.250> away<00:03:00.280> that

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
numbers and we can see right away that

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.170 
numbers and we can see right away that
the<00:03:00.790> number<00:03:01.060> 1<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.570> common<00:03:02.140> factor<00:03:02.700> okay<00:03:03.730> the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
the number 1 is a common factor okay the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.840 
the number 1 is a common factor okay the
number<00:03:04.480> 2<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.110> common<00:03:05.560> factor<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.160> number<00:03:06.280> 3

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
number 2 is a common factor the number 3

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.509 
number 2 is a common factor the number 3
is<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:07.120> common<00:03:07.569> factor<00:03:08.050> but<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.890> greatest

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
is a common factor but the greatest

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.330 
is a common factor but the greatest
common<00:03:09.910> factor<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.870> actually<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.650> number<00:03:11.950> 6

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
common factor is actually the number 6

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.000 
common factor is actually the number 6
because<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.600> is<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.900> largest<00:03:14.709> factor

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
because that is the largest factor

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.220 
because that is the largest factor
that's<00:03:15.430> common<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:15.940> all<00:03:16.060> 3<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.660> these<00:03:16.780> lists<00:03:17.140> so

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
that's common to all 3 of these lists so

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.930 
that's common to all 3 of these lists so
you<00:03:17.290> see<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.920> doesn't<00:03:18.040> matter<00:03:18.519> if<00:03:18.790> you're

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
you see it doesn't matter if you're

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.309 
you see it doesn't matter if you're
finding<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.360> greatest<00:03:19.660> common<00:03:19.959> factor

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
finding the greatest common factor

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.350 
finding the greatest common factor
between<00:03:20.350> two<00:03:20.800> numbers<00:03:21.130> or<00:03:21.670> if<00:03:21.850> you're<00:03:21.970> finding

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
between two numbers or if you're finding

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.090 
between two numbers or if you're finding
the<00:03:22.450> greatest<00:03:22.780> common<00:03:23.049> factor<00:03:23.079> between<00:03:23.350> 3<00:03:24.070> or

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
the greatest common factor between 3 or

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.940 
the greatest common factor between 3 or
4<00:03:24.459> or<00:03:24.579> 5<00:03:24.850> numbers<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.750> procedure<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.470> same

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
4 or 5 numbers the procedure is the same

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.620 
4 or 5 numbers the procedure is the same
so<00:03:27.280> you're<00:03:27.430> just<00:03:27.459> finding<00:03:27.880> all<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.239> factors

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
so you're just finding all the factors

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.270 
so you're just finding all the factors
of<00:03:28.780> each<00:03:28.930> number<00:03:29.260> which<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.829> get<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.010> little

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
of each number which you get a little

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.100 
of each number which you get a little
practice<00:03:30.459> with<00:03:30.880> as<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.390> do<00:03:31.510> these<00:03:31.690> with<00:03:31.870> with

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
practice with as you do these with with

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.319 
practice with as you do these with with
me<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.470> then<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.040> just<00:03:33.310> circle<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.760> one<00:03:33.970> that

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
me and then you just circle the one that

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.020 
me and then you just circle the one that
is<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.600> largest<00:03:34.989> one<00:03:35.230> that's<00:03:35.410> common<00:03:35.980> ok<00:03:36.880> the

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
is the largest one that's common ok the

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.960 
is the largest one that's common ok the
largest<00:03:37.480> one<00:03:37.630> that's<00:03:37.840> common<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:39.640> let's<00:03:39.850> do

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
largest one that's common so let's do

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.080 
largest one that's common so let's do
another<00:03:40.060> one<00:03:40.269> here<00:03:41.310> let's<00:03:42.310> say<00:03:42.610> we're<00:03:42.880> going

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
another one here let's say we're going

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.850 
another one here let's say we're going
to<00:03:43.239> find<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.200> greatest<00:03:44.410> common<00:03:44.590> factor

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
to find the greatest common factor

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.050 
to find the greatest common factor
between<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.549> numbers<00:03:45.790> 32<00:03:46.269> 8<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.650> 40<00:03:48.579> and<00:03:48.730> of

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
between the numbers 32 8 and 40 and of

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.670 
between the numbers 32 8 and 40 and of
course<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.450> larger<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.109> numbers<00:03:50.410> that<00:03:50.530> you

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
course the larger the numbers that you

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.229 
course the larger the numbers that you
have<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:51.190> more<00:03:51.370> factors<00:03:51.940> you're<00:03:52.060> going<00:03:52.180> to

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
have the more factors you're going to

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.970 
have the more factors you're going to
have<00:03:52.390> because<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.870> more<00:03:53.109> things<00:03:53.560> can<00:03:53.859> be

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
have because the more things can be

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.310 
have because the more things can be
multiplied<00:03:54.459> together<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:55.030> give<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.510> that

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
multiplied together to give you that

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.920 
multiplied together to give you that
number<00:03:56.670> so<00:03:57.670> let's<00:03:57.970> switch<00:03:58.150> colors<00:03:58.269> here<00:03:58.720> a

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
number so let's switch colors here a

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.229 
number so let's switch colors here a
little<00:03:59.109> bit<00:03:59.320> and<00:03:59.560> say<00:03:59.769> all<00:03:59.950> right<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.940> number

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
little bit and say all right the number

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.900 
little bit and say all right the number
32<00:04:01.900> let's<00:04:02.590> list<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.070> factors<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.670> number

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
32 let's list the factors of the number

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.240 
32 let's list the factors of the number
32<00:04:04.239> well<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.200> number<00:04:05.440> 1<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:05.709> always<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:05.950> factor

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
32 well the number 1 is always a factor

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.539 
32 well the number 1 is always a factor
the<00:04:07.180> number<00:04:07.359> 2<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.989> a<00:04:08.019> factor<00:04:08.290> because<00:04:08.829> 2<00:04:09.310> times

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
the number 2 is a factor because 2 times

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.360 
the number 2 is a factor because 2 times
16<00:04:10.120> is<00:04:10.150> actually<00:04:10.690> 32<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.650> can<00:04:11.769> also<00:04:11.890> tell<00:04:12.250> that

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
16 is actually 32 you can also tell that

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.640 
16 is actually 32 you can also tell that
this<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.640> divisible<00:04:12.910> by<00:04:13.120> 2<00:04:13.299> because<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:14.079> ends

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
this is divisible by 2 because it ends

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.300 
this is divisible by 2 because it ends
in<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.829> 2<00:04:15.630> all<00:04:16.630> right<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:17.049> number<00:04:17.229> 3<00:04:17.950> is<00:04:17.979> not<00:04:18.250> a

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
in a 2 all right the number 3 is not a

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.949 
in a 2 all right the number 3 is not a
factor<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.729> does<00:04:18.880> not<00:04:19.030> divide<00:04:19.419> in<00:04:19.690> but<00:04:19.870> the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
factor it does not divide in but the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.250 
factor it does not divide in but the
number<00:04:20.260> 4<00:04:20.739> is<00:04:21.039> a<00:04:21.729> factor<00:04:21.910> because<00:04:22.360> 4<00:04:22.780> times<00:04:22.810> 8

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
number 4 is a factor because 4 times 8

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.020 
number 4 is a factor because 4 times 8
is<00:04:23.320> 32<00:04:24.120> 5<00:04:25.120> 6<00:04:25.750> &amp;<00:04:26.050> 7<00:04:26.080> are<00:04:26.890> not<00:04:27.130> factors<00:04:27.729> because

is 32 5 6 &amp; 7 are not factors because
they<00:04:28.240> don't<00:04:28.450> divide<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:28.900> evenly<00:04:29.080> but<00:04:29.560> the

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
they don't divide in evenly but the

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.429 
they don't divide in evenly but the
eight<00:04:30.069> is<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.430> factor<00:04:30.909> because<00:04:31.210> 8<00:04:31.419> times<00:04:31.870> 4<00:04:32.379> is

only other guy you're going to find is

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.269 
only other guy you're going to find is
the<00:04:50.889> number<00:04:51.129> itself<00:04:51.520> which<00:04:51.789> is<00:04:51.969> 32<00:04:53.129> so<00:04:54.129> that

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:54.279 
the number itself which is 32 so that

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.179 
the number itself which is 32 so that
takes<00:04:54.520> care<00:04:54.789> of<00:04:54.849> this<00:04:55.629> now<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.499> second<00:04:56.979> number

doesn't<00:05:08.439> 8<00:05:09.129> does<00:05:09.729> divide<00:05:10.150> into<00:05:10.300> 8<00:05:10.509> so<00:05:10.689> those

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
doesn't 8 does divide into 8 so those

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.649 
doesn't 8 does divide into 8 so those
are<00:05:10.990> all<00:05:11.139> factors<00:05:11.469> and<00:05:12.120> then<00:05:13.120> finally<00:05:13.509> the

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
are all factors and then finally the

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.129 
are all factors and then finally the
number<00:05:13.900> 40<00:05:14.789> the<00:05:15.789> number<00:05:16.060> 1<00:05:16.240> divides<00:05:16.629> n<00:05:16.930> the

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
number 40 the number 1 divides n the

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.649 
number 40 the number 1 divides n the
number<00:05:17.379> 2<00:05:17.650> divides<00:05:18.069> then<00:05:18.340> number<00:05:18.729> 3<00:05:19.060> does<00:05:19.300> not

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
number 2 divides then number 3 does not

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.499 
number 2 divides then number 3 does not
but<00:05:20.409> the<00:05:20.529> number<00:05:20.770> 4<00:05:21.039> does<00:05:21.310> divide<00:05:21.729> n<00:05:21.879> because<00:05:22.240> 4

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
but the number 4 does divide n because 4

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.189 
but the number 4 does divide n because 4
times<00:05:22.539> 10<00:05:23.110> is<00:05:23.259> 40<00:05:23.439> the<00:05:24.159> number<00:05:24.460> 5<00:05:24.759> does<00:05:25.270> because

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
times 10 is 40 the number 5 does because

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.610 
times 10 is 40 the number 5 does because
8<00:05:26.409> times<00:05:26.439> 5<00:05:27.009> is<00:05:27.310> 40<00:05:27.699> the<00:05:28.449> number<00:05:28.719> 6<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.139> 7<00:05:29.499> do

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
8 times 5 is 40 the number 6 and 7 do

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.800 
8 times 5 is 40 the number 6 and 7 do
not<00:05:29.830> but<00:05:30.069> the<00:05:30.159> number<00:05:30.400> 8<00:05:30.610> does<00:05:30.969> because<00:05:31.539> 8

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
not but the number 8 does because 8

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.890 
not but the number 8 does because 8
times<00:05:32.050> 5<00:05:32.229> is<00:05:32.289> 40<00:05:32.469> as<00:05:32.889> we<00:05:33.009> just<00:05:33.189> said<00:05:33.659> number<00:05:34.659> 9

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
times 5 is 40 as we just said number 9

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.510 
times 5 is 40 as we just said number 9
of<00:05:35.080> course<00:05:35.289> doesn't<00:05:35.529> divide<00:05:35.860> into<00:05:35.919> here<00:05:36.370> but

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
of course doesn't divide into here but

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.909 
of course doesn't divide into here but
number<00:05:36.789> 10<00:05:37.089> does<00:05:37.419> because<00:05:37.839> 10<00:05:38.139> times<00:05:38.409> 4<00:05:38.740> is<00:05:38.770> 40

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
number 10 does because 10 times 4 is 40

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.240 
number 10 does because 10 times 4 is 40
and<00:05:39.400> you<00:05:40.089> keep<00:05:40.270> on<00:05:40.389> marching<00:05:40.659> through<00:05:41.250> through

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
and you keep on marching through through

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.309 
and you keep on marching through through
the<00:05:42.279> teens<00:05:42.699> and<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.449> really<00:05:43.629> nothing<00:05:44.050> jumps

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
the teens and and really nothing jumps

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.719 
the teens and and really nothing jumps
out<00:05:44.469> at<00:05:44.620> you<00:05:44.710> until<00:05:44.979> you<00:05:45.099> get<00:05:45.219> to<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.490> number

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
out at you until you get to the number

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.350 
out at you until you get to the number
20<00:05:46.210> because<00:05:46.389> 20<00:05:47.349> times<00:05:47.560> 2<00:05:47.889> is<00:05:48.099> 40<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:48.669> then<00:05:49.240> you

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
20 because 20 times 2 is 40 and then you

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.029 
20 because 20 times 2 is 40 and then you
keep<00:05:49.509> on<00:05:49.629> marching<00:05:49.839> to<00:05:50.169> through<00:05:50.439> the<00:05:50.560> 20s<00:05:50.919> and

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
keep on marching to through the 20s and

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.350 
keep on marching to through the 20s and
the<00:05:51.159> only<00:05:51.339> other<00:05:51.550> place<00:05:51.819> you're<00:05:51.969> going<00:05:52.120> to<00:05:52.180> end

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
the only other place you're going to end

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.230 
the only other place you're going to end
up<00:05:52.479> with<00:05:52.659> a<00:05:52.689> factor<00:05:52.990> is<00:05:53.289> the<00:05:53.409> number<00:05:53.439> 40<00:05:54.149> so<00:05:55.149> you

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
up with a factor is the number 40 so you

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.760 
up with a factor is the number 40 so you
just<00:05:55.569> have<00:05:55.719> to<00:05:55.779> kind<00:05:55.990> of<00:05:56.050> take<00:05:56.169> your<00:05:56.319> time<00:05:56.560> with

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
just have to kind of take your time with

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.639 
just have to kind of take your time with
it<00:05:56.800> now<00:05:56.979> let's<00:05:57.189> look<00:05:57.339> for<00:05:57.399> the<00:05:57.550> common<00:05:58.029> factors

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:58.649 
it now let's look for the common factors

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:01.709 
it now let's look for the common factors
number<00:05:59.649> 1<00:05:59.860> is<00:06:00.009> common<00:06:00.250> number<00:06:01.029> 2<00:06:01.300> is<00:06:01.479> common

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
number 1 is common number 2 is common

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.129 
number 1 is common number 2 is common
number<00:06:02.469> 4<00:06:02.830> is<00:06:03.069> common<00:06:03.520> but<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.270> largest<00:06:04.779> one

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
number 4 is common but the largest one

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.290 
number 4 is common but the largest one
looks<00:06:05.439> like<00:06:05.529> the<00:06:05.949> number<00:06:06.219> 8<00:06:06.430> that's<00:06:06.969> the<00:06:07.149> one

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
looks like the number 8 that's the one

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.929 
looks like the number 8 that's the one
that's<00:06:07.479> common<00:06:07.870> to<00:06:07.899> all<00:06:07.990> 3<00:06:08.439> number<00:06:08.830> 8<00:06:08.979> so<00:06:09.759> what

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:09.939 
that's common to all 3 number 8 so what

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:14.909 
that's common to all 3 number 8 so what
we<00:06:10.060> say<00:06:10.360> is<00:06:10.629> the<00:06:10.719> 8<00:06:11.589> is<00:06:12.219> the<00:06:13.259> greatest<00:06:14.259> common

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
we say is the 8 is the greatest common

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.279 
we say is the 8 is the greatest common
factor<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:16.120> up<00:06:16.389> in<00:06:16.509> our<00:06:16.599> previous<00:06:16.990> problem

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
factor and up in our previous problem

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.399 
factor and up in our previous problem
the<00:06:17.770> number<00:06:18.039> 6<00:06:18.370> is<00:06:18.669> the<00:06:19.419> greatest<00:06:19.870> common

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
the number 6 is the greatest common

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.100 
the number 6 is the greatest common
factor<00:06:20.439> so<00:06:21.370> you<00:06:21.550> see<00:06:21.819> the<00:06:22.240> process<00:06:22.569> is<00:06:22.930> really

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
factor so you see the process is really

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.230 
factor so you see the process is really
the<00:06:23.379> same<00:06:23.649> in<00:06:23.889> both<00:06:24.009> of<00:06:24.069> these<00:06:24.310> cases<00:06:24.610> you<00:06:24.819> list

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
the same in both of these cases you list

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.909 
the same in both of these cases you list
the<00:06:25.419> factors<00:06:25.599> for<00:06:26.080> each<00:06:26.229> number<00:06:26.469> then<00:06:26.800> you

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
the factors for each number then you

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.290 
the factors for each number then you
just<00:06:27.099> look<00:06:27.279> for<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.520> largest<00:06:27.759> one<00:06:28.060> that's

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
just look for the largest one that's

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.300 
just look for the largest one that's
common<00:06:28.839> the<00:06:29.379> only<00:06:29.560> thing<00:06:29.710> that<00:06:29.830> can<00:06:29.949> trip<00:06:30.189> you

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
common the only thing that can trip you

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.709 
common the only thing that can trip you
up<00:06:30.339> and<00:06:30.580> you<00:06:30.699> might<00:06:30.849> need<00:06:30.969> practice<00:06:31.389> with<00:06:31.419> is

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
up and you might need practice with is

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.719 
up and you might need practice with is
getting<00:06:31.899> practice<00:06:32.500> listing<00:06:32.949> the<00:06:33.069> factors<00:06:33.490> and

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
getting practice listing the factors and

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.779 
getting practice listing the factors and
not<00:06:34.240> missing<00:06:34.689> a<00:06:34.779> number<00:06:35.080> the<00:06:35.589> only<00:06:36.430> advice<00:06:36.639> I

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789 
not missing a number the only advice I

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:38.100 
not missing a number the only advice I
can<00:06:36.819> give<00:06:37.089> you<00:06:37.120> is<00:06:37.270> just<00:06:37.300> to<00:06:37.449> practice<00:06:37.659> it<00:06:37.990> you

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
can give you is just to practice it you

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.320 
can give you is just to practice it you
need<00:06:38.319> to<00:06:38.469> be<00:06:38.560> able<00:06:38.680> to<00:06:38.800> sit<00:06:39.069> down<00:06:39.279> and<00:06:39.639> go

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
need to be able to sit down and go

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.420 
need to be able to sit down and go
through<00:06:40.659> them<00:06:40.839> and<00:06:40.990> March<00:06:41.680> through<00:06:42.129> with<00:06:42.399> each

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
through them and March through with each

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.900 
through them and March through with each
of<00:06:42.729> the

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
of the

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.580 
of the
numbers<00:06:43.120> and<00:06:43.150> see<00:06:43.450> you<00:06:43.840> know<00:06:43.960> does<00:06:44.200> it<00:06:44.230> divide

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
numbers and see you know does it divide

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.470 
numbers and see you know does it divide
in<00:06:44.830> or<00:06:45.070> not<00:06:45.280> and<00:06:45.760> that<00:06:45.910> will<00:06:46.030> tell<00:06:46.180> you<00:06:46.270> if<00:06:46.360> it's

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
in or not and that will tell you if it's

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.750 
in or not and that will tell you if it's
a<00:06:46.570> factor<00:06:46.990> and<00:06:47.710> you<00:06:47.800> can<00:06:47.980> see<00:06:48.160> it<00:06:48.250> all<00:06:48.340> boils

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760 
a factor and you can see it all boils

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.920 
a factor and you can see it all boils
down<00:06:48.790> to<00:06:48.940> knowing<00:06:49.330> your<00:06:49.570> multiplication

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
down to knowing your multiplication

tables really well you need to know that
eight<00:06:52.480> times<00:06:52.690> four<00:06:53.020> is<00:06:53.050> thirty-two<00:06:53.170> you<00:06:53.830> need

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 
eight times four is thirty-two you need

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.290 
to know that you know seven times seven

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.140 
to know that you know seven times seven
is<00:06:56.380> forty-nine<00:06:56.800> or<00:06:57.190> whatever<00:06:57.790> you<00:06:57.970> need<00:06:58.120> to
