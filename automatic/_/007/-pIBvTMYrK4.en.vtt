00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.180
 Asus has attended the 2014 edition of 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.520
 mobile world congress with your new 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.889
 generation of smartphones this tension 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.600
 new family is distinguished from the family 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.390
 of the smartphones because they are only 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.760
 phones do not come with a tablet voucher 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.599
 in this family we have the center of 4 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.460
 cm with 5 and the phone 6 each with 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.380
 different characteristics especially of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.259
 the most striking brand is the size 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.079
 of the screen is worth the first 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.930
 device that we have is 64 is a 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.870
 device they have is a screen 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.610
 of 4 inches worth is thought about 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.160
 all for those users in whom 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.650
 they pretend to have a device very 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.780
 very important and always be connected 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.510
 above all it is aimed at an audience 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.730
 young also one thing to comment is that 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.090
 the three devices come with intel 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.820
 atom is worth what with technology 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.230
 hyperthreading technology that what 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.500
 allow is the multitasking of the 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.000
 different cores of agreement and another of 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.520
 the characteristics that the three have 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.920
 phones is that they integrate the new 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.520
 system the new interface of action is 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.830
 the 6 white vale is about the goal 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.190
 of this new interface is to provide 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.690
 users a global experience not 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.619
 only with the hardware but also to 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.350
 Through the interface basically what 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.350
 we have are a lot icons with a design 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.899
 very very nice and they are flat and that 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.899
 visually, they are very agile 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.510
 another feature of this device 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.320
 so much of him 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.410
 105 as of 66 is that technology is 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.780
 pixel master vale is a technology that 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.850
 incorporates different modes in the camera 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.240
 and one of them we can do a test 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.240
 now 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.200
 It is the low light mode 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.210
 we can select it 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.270
 and what this mode allows us 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.340
 basically is to be able to make a 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.260
 photography in scenarios where the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.110
 lighting is very critical 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.200
 what it allows is basically what 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.230
 does this technology is that it combines the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.160
 hack that to the different pixels 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.160
 offering greater luminosity 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.540
 see if you can bring a little of what goes 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.250
 to know it's worth it if you want when the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.280
 camera see the luminosity that is below 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.790
 inside as you can see 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.380
 very little light and when we activate the mode 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.380
 from the camera and we take a picture 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.520
 We have your also presented 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.320
 new versions of your phone pad inside 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.240
 from the family of smartphones that already 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.230
 we presented two years ago and the year 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.080
 past 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.240
 this is the is the bat phone mini is the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.310
 same concept ie it is a smartphone 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.470
 that is integrated inside the tablet but 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.540
 in a smaller size it is worth in this 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.600
 case we can see that it is a 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.060
 4-inch smartphone agree that 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.160
 we can incorporate it into the 7 tablet 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:32.530
 It is available in black and white in 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.790
 blue red and availability still not 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.790
 we can confirm it in europe
