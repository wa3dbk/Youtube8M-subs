my<00:01:04.199> bike<00:01:04.760> you're<00:01:05.760> inflating<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.540> we've<00:01:06.689> got

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
my bike you're inflating it we've got

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.080 
my bike you're inflating it we've got
some<00:01:06.990> insulation<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.830> yeah<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.610> added<00:01:08.820> on

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
some insulation here yeah so we added on

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.560 
some insulation here yeah so we added on
basically<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> an<00:01:09.990> existing<00:01:14.000> no<00:01:15.000> well<00:01:15.390> it's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
basically to an existing no well it's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.020 
basically to an existing no well it's
it's<00:01:15.840> designed<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.860> could<00:01:17.220> insulate<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it's designed that you could insulate it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's designed that you could insulate it
and<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> could<00:01:18.390> close<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.229> we're

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and you could close it in but we're

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
and you could close it in but we're
actually<00:01:19.680> planning<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.880> using<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.299> for

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
actually planning on just using it for

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.440 
actually planning on just using it for
just<00:01:22.070> art<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.640> fancy<00:01:23.970> tool<00:01:24.180> set
