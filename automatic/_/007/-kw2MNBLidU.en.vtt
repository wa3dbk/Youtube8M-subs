so<00:00:00.750> wings<00:00:01.319> are<00:00:01.560> out<00:00:01.650> how<00:00:02.220> exciting<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.899> made

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
so wings are out how exciting and made

and<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:11.059> so<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.360> know<00:00:13.019> explain<00:00:13.380> how<00:00:13.650> you

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
and so on so you know explain how you

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.320 
and so on so you know explain how you
design<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> good<00:00:14.400> aircraft

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
design a good aircraft

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.870 
design a good aircraft
now<00:00:16.320> there's<00:00:16.500> three<00:00:16.770> main<00:00:17.340> things<00:00:17.670> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
now there's three main things you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.580 
now there's three main things you
consider<00:00:18.150> when<00:00:18.420> building<00:00:18.570> an<00:00:18.810> aircraft<00:00:19.260> or

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
to a thrust center of mass it's quite

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.519 
to a thrust center of mass it's quite

it the points are your plane is how to

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.090 
it the points are your plane is how to
describe<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.809> as<00:00:34.739> you're<00:00:34.860> trying<00:00:35.010> to

it's<00:00:40.800> tenth<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.399> mass<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.940> rise<00:00:42.180> above<00:00:42.210> the

if<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:48.140> put<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.289> clock<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:49.920> I

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
if I put this I put this clock here I

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.389 
if I put this I put this clock here I
tend<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.180> mass<00:00:51.420> move<00:00:51.809> forward<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:53.250> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
tend to have mass move forward and if I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.900 
tend to have mass move forward and if I
put<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.699> over<00:00:54.440> well<00:00:55.440> over<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.520> move

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
put it over well over here move

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.180 
put it over well over here move
backwards

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
backwards

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.740 
backwards
similarly<00:00:59.190> put<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.609> there<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.059> left<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
similarly put it there and left the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.360 
similarly put it there and left the
other<00:01:00.989> side<00:01:01.230> moves<00:01:01.500> right<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.190> so

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
other side moves right and so on so

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.080 
other side moves right and so on so
forth<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.339> tied<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.790> makes<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
forth so that then tied it makes you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.480 
forth so that then tied it makes you
like<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.299> center<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.630> lift<00:01:07.189> that's<00:01:08.189> different

in between the final intent of these
blocks<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.619> between<00:02:10.649> each

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460

blocks in between each
first<00:02:12.530> acid<00:02:13.530> importantly<00:02:14.070> because<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.520> you

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
first acid importantly because if you

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.670 
first acid importantly because if you
send<00:02:14.820> two<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.090> math<00:02:15.300> it's<00:02:15.870> really<00:02:16.380> far<00:02:16.650> down

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
send two of math it's really far down

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.460 
send two of math it's really far down
because<00:02:17.310> say<00:02:17.490> all<00:02:17.700> these<00:02:17.850> guns<00:02:18.120> down<00:02:18.420> here<00:02:18.690> and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
because say all these guns down here and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.380 
because say all these guns down here and
your<00:02:19.620> thrusters<00:02:20.010> are<00:02:20.160> really<00:02:20.370> high<00:02:20.550> up<00:02:20.580> it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
your thrusters are really high up it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.450 
your thrusters are really high up it
games<00:02:21.690> your<00:02:22.110> plane<00:02:22.290> gonna<00:02:22.500> flip<00:02:22.890> forward

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
games your plane gonna flip forward

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.000 
games your plane gonna flip forward
because<00:02:23.730> thus<00:02:23.880> trusters<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.590> like<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:25.800> like<00:02:25.980> a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
because thus trusters I like it's like a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.680 
because thus trusters I like it's like a
putting<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.790> top<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.060> wheel<00:02:27.270> it's<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.630> to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
putting on top of a wheel it's going to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.000 
putting on top of a wheel it's going to
flip<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.770> wheel<00:02:28.920> forward<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.490> over<00:02:31.010> so

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
flip just the wheel forward and over so

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.260 
flip just the wheel forward and over so
if<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.160> have<00:02:32.280> craft<00:02:32.520> it's<00:02:32.700> falling<00:02:33.000> forward

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
if you have craft it's falling forward

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.480 
if you have craft it's falling forward
need<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.960> either<00:02:34.710> moving<00:02:35.400> forward<00:02:36.350> move<00:02:37.490> heavy

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
need to either moving forward move heavy

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.630 
need to either moving forward move heavy
stuff<00:02:38.580> back<00:02:39.230> or<00:02:40.230> move<00:02:40.710> yours<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.220> as<00:02:41.400> further

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
stuff back or move yours just as further

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.910 
stuff back or move yours just as further
down<00:02:43.130> nice<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.250> simple<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.500> last<00:02:46.740> thing

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
down nice and simple and one last thing

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.470 
down nice and simple and one last thing
just<00:02:47.330> remember<00:02:48.330> if<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.280> um<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:51.000> put<00:02:51.330> these

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
just remember if you um you put these

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.560 
just remember if you um you put these
tail<00:02:51.780> wings<00:02:52.290> here<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:53.940> more<00:02:54.120> stable

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
tail wings here just so it's more stable

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.860 
tail wings here just so it's more stable
one<00:02:54.660> turning<00:02:55.110> don't<00:02:55.680> have<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.130> okay<00:02:56.970> lops<00:02:57.570> like

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
one turning don't have it okay lops like

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.260 
one turning don't have it okay lops like
a<00:02:57.900> dead<00:02:58.620> fish<00:02:58.950> when<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.430> try<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.610> turn<00:02:59.880> your

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
a dead fish when you try to turn your

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.950 
a dead fish when you try to turn your
slides<00:03:00.720> down<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:02.270> think<00:03:03.270> visually<00:03:03.720> they're

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
slides down I think visually they're

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.030 
slides down I think visually they're
bringing<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.290> made<00:03:04.440> any<00:03:04.560> sense

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
bringing that made any sense

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.190 
bringing that made any sense
but<00:03:05.490> I'm<00:03:05.760> hoping<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.510> helped<00:03:06.720> at<00:03:06.870> least<00:03:07.020> some

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
but I'm hoping it helped at least some

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.730 
but I'm hoping it helped at least some
of<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.380> design<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> good<00:03:07.770> aircraft<00:03:09.590> leave<00:03:10.590> it

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
of you design a good aircraft leave it

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.370 
of you design a good aircraft leave it
there<00:03:11.070> well<00:03:11.940> now<00:03:12.120> as<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.600> don't<00:03:12.780> have<00:03:12.930> any<00:03:13.110> wings

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
there well now as I don't have any wings

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.870 
there well now as I don't have any wings
to<00:03:13.650> demonstrate<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.340> build<00:03:14.550> an<00:03:14.730> aircraft

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
to demonstrate you build an aircraft

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.970 
to demonstrate you build an aircraft
from<00:03:15.180> scratch<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.410> didn't<00:03:16.590> want<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.830> lose

my lovely livery plasma Bala but I hope

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.420 
my lovely livery plasma Bala but I hope
this<00:03:20.640> was<00:03:20.880> helping<00:03:21.150> out<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.240> bit
