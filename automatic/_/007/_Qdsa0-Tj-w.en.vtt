00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.433
Peek a boo!

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:05.933
Hi!

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.567
Guess what?

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:10.833
It was raining all morning and when it stopped...

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:14.400
I got to see a beautiful rainbow!

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.049
Do you know what colors are in the rainbow?

00:00:18.049 --> 00:00:20.503
Why don't we go over them together

00:00:20.503 --> 00:00:23.746
The first color in the rainbow is RED

00:00:28.346 --> 00:00:32.112
The second color in the rainbow is ORANGE

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:41.446
The next color in the rainbow is YELLOW just like the sunshine

00:00:46.028 --> 00:00:49.211
Those are the first three colors, let's keep going

00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:52.044
Next we have the color GREEN

00:00:56.477 --> 00:00:59.077
And then we have the color BLUE

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.617
We're almost there, two more colors to go

00:01:06.617 --> 00:01:08.692
And they're unique

00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:15.359
The next color is INDIGO, it's a mixture between blue and purple

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:23.788
And the last color of the rainbow is VIOLET

00:01:23.788 --> 00:01:26.842
It's a mixture between purple and pink

00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:35.224
All the colors in the rainbow are so beautiful

00:01:35.224 --> 00:01:39.589
So keep your eyes to the sky and be looking for those rainbows

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:42.590
There may be a pot of gold on the other side!

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.790
Thanks for joining me
