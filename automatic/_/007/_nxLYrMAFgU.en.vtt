00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.900
 how to remedy the lack of doctors 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.580
 in our country obviously it's not 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.810
 thanks to the medical studies that remains 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.820
 still difficult 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.680
 you know the first year of college 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.290
 is part of the obstacle course 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.360
 they are only 15% of students to be 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.259
 admitted and look what's going on in 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.419
 the amphitheatres 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:34.810
 report to Marc de Chevigny and 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:37.390
 guillaume bending rough craft than that 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.450
 of university professor in first 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.900
 year of medicine in the amphitheater this 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.210
 morning tribune football atmosphere and neither 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.740
 projectiles and jokes do not 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.740
 fly very high 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.640
 of ritual it's all the time like that 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.690
 then a match at the curve is the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.740
 whorehouse 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.850
 I am last year it was in the 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.740
 waters under benches names that this 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.980
 year I'm telling you think that 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.490
 it is to release the pressure 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.700
 of stress it's going 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.899
 to avoid cracking in fact and then for 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.360
 try to crack especially the 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.399
 bonuses upon arriving because beyond the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.780
 carabins folklore competition in 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.880
 medicine and every year rougher 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.549
 this packed amphitheater does 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.140
 represents a half promotion the 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.360
 course must be filmed and rebroadcast 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.810
 the afternoon in front of the other half of 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.240
 students 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.280
 a few years ago we were fighting 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.780
 literally for the best seats 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.759
 the administration is now trying to 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.880
 put an end to the law of the jungle 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.880
 students all have an access card 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.950
 telling them for the whole year 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.840
 their exact place in the lecture halls it's 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.429
 quasi military but it's the only one 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.580
 system that we found that can be 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.700
 at least fair but here for less 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.860
 250 places in the second year 1300 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.479
 applicants are trying their luck and the 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.130
 faculty can not refuse to 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.000
 register in first year I think 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.970
 that there are still a number 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.799
 of students as they say that we who 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.959
 have nothing to do in 1st year of health 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.680
 only problem and we know that the only 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.450
 solution the only reasonable solution 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.730
 I like reasonable and kind of 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.370
 pre-selection on inter-subject file 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.109
 waiting for private courts thrive 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.970
 we find everything that is missing from 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.380
 the university of small groups of 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.769
 available cultures a more ambiance 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.350
 serene 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.450
 all for 1500 euros a year it works 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.890
 like that to pass it needs to be 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.530
 money between minutes 5 sec it works 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.420
 to counter this form of injustice the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.590
 universities develops tutorials 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.359
 free 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.920
 but like every year three quarters 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.480
 students will need next June 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.480
 to find another vocation
