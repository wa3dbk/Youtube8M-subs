00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
and next thing you know we're looking at

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.260 
and next thing you know we're looking at
five<00:02:35.070> six<00:02:35.490> seven<00:02:35.910> hundred<00:02:36.500> dollars<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:38.270> head

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
five six seven hundred dollars of head

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.210 
five six seven hundred dollars of head
scratching<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:42.440> then<00:02:43.440> they<00:02:43.650> tell<00:02:43.890> them<00:02:44.040> it's

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
scratching and then they tell them it's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.130 
scratching and then they tell them it's
they<00:02:44.700> think<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.420> ECM<00:02:46.230> spin<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:49.020> know

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
they think it's ECM spin so you know

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.040 
they think it's ECM spin so you know
probably<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.010> best<00:02:50.300> making<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.540> best<00:02:51.750> tip

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
probably the best making the best tip

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.070 
probably the best making the best tip
for<00:02:52.340> 2010<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.540> if<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.870> down<00:02:55.080> your<00:02:55.380> truck

for 2010 is if you can down your truck
it<00:02:58.080> might<00:02:58.440> be<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:59.220> lot<00:02:59.790> better<00:02:59.970> choice<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.750> to

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
it might be a lot better choice just to

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.810 
it might be a lot better choice just to
have<00:03:01.800> somebody<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:04.200> know<00:03:04.320> diagnose<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.580> and

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
have somebody you know diagnose it and
