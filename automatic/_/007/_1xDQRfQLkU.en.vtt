let<00:00:09.070> that<00:00:09.250> go<00:00:09.430> so<00:00:09.610> well<00:00:09.790> I<00:00:10.030> didn't<00:00:10.389> make<00:00:10.480> glass

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
let that go so well I didn't make glass

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.810 
let that go so well I didn't make glass
stuff<00:00:11.410> was<00:00:11.559> kind<00:00:11.680> of<00:00:11.830> stuck<00:00:12.280> in<00:00:12.309> there<00:00:12.639> because

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
stuff was kind of stuck in there because

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.690 
stuff was kind of stuck in there because
I<00:00:13.420> don't<00:00:14.170> want<00:00:14.290> to<00:00:14.350> get<00:00:14.469> it<00:00:14.590> out<00:00:14.740> I<00:00:15.190> just<00:00:15.520> wasn't

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
I don't want to get it out I just wasn't

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.630 
I don't want to get it out I just wasn't
very<00:00:15.820> prepared<00:00:16.299> and<00:00:16.720> my<00:00:16.870> tongs<00:00:17.410> to<00:00:18.250> grab<00:00:18.610> a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
little crucible pick up pour out so I'm

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.390 
little crucible pick up pour out so I'm
just<00:00:22.539> gonna<00:00:22.630> get<00:00:22.869> my<00:00:23.019> cutting<00:00:23.470> torch<00:00:23.679> yeah

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
just gonna get my cutting torch yeah

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.509 
just gonna get my cutting torch yeah
yeah<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:26.080> hit<00:00:26.349> that<00:00:26.380> glass<00:00:26.679> until<00:00:27.099> it<00:00:27.310> melts

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
yeah it hit that glass until it melts

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.820 
yeah it hit that glass until it melts
again<00:00:27.960> let's<00:00:28.960> see<00:00:29.050> if<00:00:29.109> I<00:00:29.170> get<00:00:29.320> my<00:00:29.439> gold<00:00:29.650> out<00:00:29.800> of

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
again let's see if I get my gold out of

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:37.529 
again let's see if I get my gold out of
there<00:00:30.070> or<00:00:30.189> not

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.139 

yeah<00:00:38.539> it's<00:00:38.749> way<00:00:38.960> more<00:00:38.989> intense<00:00:39.530> now<00:00:40.149> that's

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
yeah it's way more intense now that's

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:48.050 
yeah it's way more intense now that's
the<00:00:41.420> kind<00:00:41.629> of<00:00:41.659> density<00:00:42.050> that<00:00:42.079> will<00:00:42.350> not<00:00:42.530> hold

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.830 

okay<00:00:49.060> so<00:00:49.180> I<00:00:49.330> cheated<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:52.120> used<00:00:52.360> a<00:00:52.510> cutting

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
okay so I cheated and used a cutting

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.640 
okay so I cheated and used a cutting
torch<00:00:55.230> I'm<00:00:56.230> hoping<00:00:56.830> the<00:00:57.010> camera<00:00:57.370> will<00:00:57.550> show

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
torch I'm hoping the camera will show

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.380 
torch I'm hoping the camera will show
the<00:00:59.650> beauty<00:00:59.980> gold<00:01:00.190> down<00:01:00.430> there<00:01:00.790> I<00:01:00.820> can't<00:01:01.180> get

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
the beauty gold down there I can't get

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.229 
the beauty gold down there I can't get
to<00:01:01.629> it<00:01:01.949> glass<00:01:02.949> that<00:01:03.250> form<00:01:03.489> was<00:01:03.670> so<00:01:03.820> thick<00:01:04.089> it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
to it glass that form was so thick it

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.740 
to it glass that form was so thick it
wasn't<00:01:04.510> pour<00:01:04.720> out<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:04.989> crucible<00:01:05.260> and<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
wasn't pour out of the crucible and you

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.109 
wasn't pour out of the crucible and you
see<00:01:07.869> there's<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.080> little<00:01:08.320> bit<00:01:08.440> of<00:01:08.530> gold<00:01:09.119> right

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
see there's a little bit of gold right

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.969 
see there's a little bit of gold right
there<00:01:10.210> on<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.510> lip<00:01:10.720> just<00:01:11.020> wrote<00:01:11.410> that<00:01:11.619> damn

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
there on the lip just wrote that damn

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.160 
there on the lip just wrote that damn
coat<00:01:12.310> I'm<00:01:12.850> cold<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.360> warm<00:01:13.600> there<00:01:13.780> just<00:01:13.990> for<00:01:14.080> a

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
coat I'm cold that warm there just for a

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.950 
coat I'm cold that warm there just for a
little<00:01:14.290> bit<00:01:14.440> of<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.650> water<00:01:15.010> spilled<00:01:15.960> there's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
little bit of the water spilled there's

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.940 
little bit of the water spilled there's
a<00:01:16.990> little<00:01:17.140> bit<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.290> gold<00:01:17.440> all<00:01:17.619> around<00:01:17.860> the

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
a little bit of gold all around the

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.560 
a little bit of gold all around the
edges<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.399> crucible<00:01:18.700> too<00:01:18.970> but<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.390> main

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
edges of the crucible too but the main

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.380 
edges of the crucible too but the main
Mead<00:01:20.640> I'd<00:01:21.640> say<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:21.910> looks<00:01:22.030> like<00:01:22.149> I<00:01:22.210> might<00:01:22.330> have

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
Mead I'd say it looks like I might have

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.940 
Mead I'd say it looks like I might have
to<00:01:23.380> little<00:01:23.740> tiny<00:01:23.950> beads<00:01:24.190> down<00:01:24.550> in<00:01:24.729> there<00:01:25.830> so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.680 

but<00:01:29.950> looks<00:01:30.729> like<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:30.940> main<00:01:31.090> bit<00:01:31.330> of<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.509> gold

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
but looks like the main bit of the gold

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.660 
but looks like the main bit of the gold
is<00:01:31.899> down<00:01:32.080> in<00:01:32.229> there<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:34.060> this<00:01:34.180> glass<00:01:34.420> is<00:01:34.690> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
is down in there and this glass is so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.529 
is down in there and this glass is so
all<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.820> way<00:01:36.880> down<00:01:37.030> at<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.180> bottom<00:01:37.330> of<00:01:37.450> that

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
all the way down at the bottom of that

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.230 
all the way down at the bottom of that
hole<00:01:38.039> actually<00:01:39.039> used<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.490> cutting<00:01:39.789> torch<00:01:40.000> to

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
hole actually used the cutting torch to

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.880 
hole actually used the cutting torch to
form<00:01:40.479> that<00:01:40.690> hole<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.170> glass<00:01:41.410> was<00:01:41.710> kind<00:01:41.860> of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
form that hole the glass was kind of

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.700 
form that hole the glass was kind of
like<00:01:42.009> plastic<00:01:42.369> with<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.360> cutting<00:01:43.630> torch<00:01:43.869> it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
like plastic with the cutting torch it

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.350 
like plastic with the cutting torch it
never<00:01:44.920> would<00:01:45.100> completely<00:01:45.550> liquefied<00:01:45.850> but<00:01:46.300> I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
never would completely liquefied but I

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
never would completely liquefied but I
can<00:01:46.539> move<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.810> around<00:01:47.220> with<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.340> torch<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
can move it around with the torch and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.750 
can move it around with the torch and
punched<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.340> hole<00:01:51.490> in<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.820> kind<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:54.070> I<00:01:54.400> think

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
punched a hole in it kind of and I think

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.850 
punched a hole in it kind of and I think
the<00:01:54.850> solution<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:55.960> problem<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.740> add

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
the solution to that problem is to add

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.090 
the solution to that problem is to add
more<00:01:56.890> borax<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:58.060> make<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.330> glass<00:01:58.540> melt<00:01:59.100> and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
more borax to make the glass melt and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:09.410 
more borax to make the glass melt and
liquefy<00:02:00.640> better

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.479
