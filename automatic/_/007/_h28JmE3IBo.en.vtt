00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.670
 pearn it's a cracking of people these are 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.010
 people who crack and so suddenly 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.970
 who want a little escape from 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.890
 two of the codes of that of the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.540
 manipulation of the politics of the 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.450
 culture even in this dance piece 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:41.370
 everyone crack in his way his way 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:46.140
 and to break free and then is there a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.690
 issue is what in this marginalizing in 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.430
 being a little clandestine of life 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.489
 abroad is what we can find a 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.600
 new issue in the foreign word he 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.880
 is the strange word as strange it is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.610
 different and the difference for me 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.150
 it's end it's culture and culture 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.150
 scary 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.630
 how did we get to this park is 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.810
 good as it's a dance piece 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.479
 polymorphous 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.090
 we did it in a shed 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.250
 clandestine representation we already have 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.470
 does so in the public space 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.880
 we did it on stage a version that 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.729
 is cynical a 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.080
 and then that's a garden version 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.080
 nature public spaces 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.080
 at the start the company so 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.300
 who was born in 2008 it was all but the 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.240
 scene so we actually wanted to 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.830
 to invest different places and the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.740
 first the first performance we have 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.500
 did it was so in 2008 in september 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.590
 2008 in the showcases of the galleries 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.640
 lafayette little one in fact one learns to 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.270
 civilize 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.830
 we learn to be polite we learn here 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.690
 and then when you grow up you learn to 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.230
 deconstruct so we it was also 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:19.560
 the idea of ​​deconstructing and 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.569
 to appropriate also Russian for me 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.040
 to be a dancer it's never been an end 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.010
 I did not want to learn to dance for 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.480
 to be a dancer because when I danced 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.280
 I did not like that I only had to do 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.410
 solos and I had a lot of trouble 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.690
 to dance with others and then I 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.450
 realized that the scene was not 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.069
 not something important for me 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.480
 it was not the first thing I did not 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.459
 did not live for me on stage 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.110
 me what I like in the dance and the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.079
 choreography video is the theater 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.610
 it's the multidisciplinary mix and 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.160
 also help themselves 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.230
 meet people and create a 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:00.599
 osmosis between people and then always 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:01.620
 very invented here is a lot of 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.220
 things to do here there are ruins 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.590
 magnificent 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.849
 there is a wood there is water that's in 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.239
 full heart of Toulouse is a lung 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.879
 green 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.879
 it's a little known place this place 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:15.019
 so I'm afraid he's too well known 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.019
 because I still want to invest 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.920
 and 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.620
 so
