in I'm just going to take it and

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.470 
in I'm just going to take it and
actually<00:00:46.960> drag<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:48.010> drop<00:00:48.340> it<00:00:48.399> right<00:00:48.760> on<00:00:49.149> to

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
actually drag and drop it right on to

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.639 
actually drag and drop it right on to
the<00:00:49.510> scene<00:00:49.930> here<00:00:50.410> and<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.719> notice<00:00:52.989> it<00:00:53.140> so<00:00:53.320> it's

a<00:00:53.770> little<00:00:53.890> bit<00:00:54.010> large<00:00:55.000> work<00:00:55.449> on<00:00:55.629> that<00:00:55.809> the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
a little bit large work on that the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.650 
a little bit large work on that the
second<00:00:56.620> but<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.340> other<00:00:57.640> thing<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:58.030> notice<00:00:58.300> is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
this is actor one instance one is it

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.620 
this is actor one instance one is it
actor<00:01:12.430> one<00:01:12.880> prototype<00:01:14.280> okay<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.330> we'll<00:01:16.480> talk

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
actor one prototype okay so we'll talk

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.140 
actor one prototype okay so we'll talk
about<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.960> difference<00:01:17.320> between<00:01:18.150> prototype

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
about the difference between prototype

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.860 
about the difference between prototype
and<00:01:19.390> instance<00:01:20.290> this<00:01:20.440> is<00:01:20.650> crucial<00:01:21.280> to

and instance this is crucial to

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.210

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.600 
click on the global version of the actor
all<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.900> lock<00:02:29.260> goes<00:02:29.620> away<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.130> it's<00:02:30.250> clear

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
all that lock goes away and it's clear

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.060 
all that lock goes away and it's clear
which<00:02:30.820> means<00:02:31.120> if<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:32.020> edit<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.530> global

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
which means if you edit the global

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.440 
which means if you edit the global
version<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.730> want<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.030> bring<00:02:34.270> in

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
version and you want to bring in

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.200 
version and you want to bring in
multiple<00:02:35.110> copies<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.280> actor<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.970> that

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
multiple copies of the actor of that

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.080 
multiple copies of the actor of that
actor<00:02:37.690> then<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.530> will<00:02:38.710> take<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.220> those

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
actor then it will take on those

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.640 
actor then it will take on those
features<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.260> know<00:02:41.380> it's<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.590> little

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
features so I know it's a little

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.920 
features so I know it's a little
difficult<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.160> understand<00:02:42.580> now<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:43.060> not

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
difficult to understand now but not

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.800 
difficult to understand now but not
totally<00:02:44.430> necessary<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:46.300> understand<00:02:46.690> all<00:02:46.780> that

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
totally necessary to understand all that

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.630 
totally necessary to understand all that
right<00:02:47.350> this<00:02:47.560> instant<00:02:47.770> but<00:02:48.160> we're<00:02:48.310> going<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.520> be

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
right this instant but we're going to be

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.950 
right this instant but we're going to be
working<00:02:48.790> this<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.300> common<00:02:49.780> theme

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
working this is a common theme

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.270 
working this is a common theme
throughout<00:02:50.170> but<00:02:50.500> anyway<00:02:50.740> just<00:02:50.890> remember

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
throughout but anyway just remember

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.680 
throughout but anyway just remember
there's<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.610> difference<00:02:51.880> between<00:02:51.940> prototype

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
there's a difference between prototype

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.330 
there's a difference between prototype
and<00:02:52.960> and<00:02:54.660> instance<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:56.320> particular<00:02:56.680> actor

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
and and instance of a particular actor

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.340 
and and instance of a particular actor
so<00:02:58.030> at<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:58.210> point<00:02:58.510> what<00:02:58.810> we're<00:02:58.930> going<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.110> do

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
so at this point what we're going to do

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.150 
so at this point what we're going to do
is<00:03:00.280> we're<00:03:00.610> going<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.820> try<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.630> make<00:03:01.990> this<00:03:02.620> actor

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
is we're going to try to make this actor

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.180 
is we're going to try to make this actor
move<00:03:03.780> okay<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:04.990> so<00:03:05.440> we're<00:03:05.800> going<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:05.980> go<00:03:06.070> down

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
move okay and so we're going to go down

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.160 
move okay and so we're going to go down
to<00:03:06.220> behaviors<00:03:06.910> here<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:08.460> if<00:03:09.460> you<00:03:09.640> go<00:03:09.760> to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
to behaviors here and if you go to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.910 
to behaviors here and if you go to
persistent<00:03:11.170> behaviors<00:03:13.020> we<00:03:14.020> are<00:03:14.170> looking<00:03:14.380> for

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
persistent behaviors we are looking for

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.970 
persistent behaviors we are looking for
the<00:03:15.070> move<00:03:15.370> command<00:03:15.930> okay<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.650> while<00:03:17.950> you're

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
the move command okay not while you're

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.620 
the move command okay not while you're
there<00:03:18.310> kind<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.730> glanced<00:03:19.000> over<00:03:19.150> some<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.540> these

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
there kind of glanced over some of these

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.900 
there kind of glanced over some of these
other<00:03:19.840> ones<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.530> get<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.890> idea<00:03:20.920> first<00:03:21.790> of

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
other ones so you get the idea first of

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.500 
other ones so you get the idea first of
all<00:03:22.410> if<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.560> click<00:03:23.800> move<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.580> then<00:03:24.910> take<00:03:25.210> it<00:03:25.420> and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
all if I click move and then take it and

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.320 
all if I click move and then take it and
drag<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.380> drop<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.770> in<00:03:27.070> this<00:03:27.250> area<00:03:27.850> here

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
drag it and drop it in this area here

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.260 
drag it and drop it in this area here
I'm<00:03:29.400> you'll<00:03:30.400> notice<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.790> couple<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:31.180> things

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
I'm you'll notice a couple of things

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.030 
I'm you'll notice a couple of things
this<00:03:31.720> window<00:03:32.200> comes<00:03:32.500> up<00:03:32.740> and<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:34.360> have<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:35.290> 0<00:03:35.920> in

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
this window comes up and I have a 0 in

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.770 
this window comes up and I have a 0 in
there<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:36.430> there's<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.640> moving<00:03:37.000> direction<00:03:37.330> is

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
there so there's a moving direction is

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.160 
there so there's a moving direction is
relative<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:38.920> says<00:03:39.040> actor<00:03:39.520> there<00:03:40.170> in

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
relative to and it says actor there in

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.060 
relative to and it says actor there in
an<00:03:41.770> additive<00:03:42.400> way<00:03:42.730> at<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.240> speed<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.680> hope

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
an additive way at a speed of and hope

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.250 
an additive way at a speed of and hope
on<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.460> behavior<00:03:45.730> stop<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:46.960> we're<00:03:47.080> going<00:03:47.170> to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
on the behavior stop so we're going to

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.140 
on the behavior stop so we're going to
do<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.410> couple<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:47.980> quick<00:03:48.160> things<00:03:48.190> here<00:03:48.610> this<00:03:49.060> is

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
do a couple of quick things here this is

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.700 
do a couple of quick things here this is
a<00:03:49.180> little<00:03:49.360> dial<00:03:49.690> here<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.230> can<00:03:50.380> kind<00:03:50.650> of

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
a little dial here you can kind of

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.550 
a little dial here you can kind of
rotate<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:52.720> notice<00:03:52.990> those<00:03:53.110> numbers

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
rotate it and you notice those numbers

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.250 
rotate it and you notice those numbers
move<00:03:54.010> dynamically<00:03:54.760> as<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.090> do<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.600> so<00:03:56.020> it's

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
move dynamically as I do that so it's

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.630 
move dynamically as I do that so it's
kind<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.620> little<00:03:56.800> tricky<00:03:57.160> I'm<00:03:57.310> not<00:03:57.340> too

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
kind of a little tricky I'm not too

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.200 
kind of a little tricky I'm not too
crazy<00:03:57.880> about<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:59.110> dial<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.250> like<00:04:00.520> to<00:04:00.550> use<00:04:00.970> I

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
crazy about the dial so I like to use I

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.150 
crazy about the dial so I like to use I
like<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.450> just<00:04:01.600> type<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:02.050> a<00:04:02.140> number<00:04:02.320> just

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
like to just type in a number just

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.000 
like to just type in a number just
remember<00:04:03.640> um<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.840> know<00:04:04.960> think<00:04:05.260> about<00:04:05.350> angles

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
remember um you know think about angles

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:14.910 
remember um you know think about angles
here<00:04:06.310> so<00:04:06.580> if<00:04:06.670> i<00:04:06.760> type<00:04:07.030> in<00:04:07.890> 180<00:04:11.160> it's<00:04:13.560> gonna<00:04:14.560> go

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
here so if i type in 180 it's gonna go

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.190 
here so if i type in 180 it's gonna go
you<00:04:15.370> know<00:04:15.520> to<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.090> direction<00:04:16.480> so<00:04:16.780> notice<00:04:17.049> the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
you know to that direction so notice the

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.340 
you know to that direction so notice the
dial<00:04:17.530> is<00:04:17.770> there<00:04:18.010> but<00:04:18.190> if<00:04:18.280> i<00:04:18.370> were<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.609> type<00:04:18.850> in<00:04:19.090> 0

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.590 

notice<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.590> dial<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.550> dot<00:04:24.940> is<00:04:25.150> on<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.419> right

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
notice the dial that dot is on the right

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.860 
notice the dial that dot is on the right
side<00:04:25.990> so<00:04:26.440> left<00:04:26.890> is<00:04:27.220> 180<00:04:27.970> right

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
side so left is 180 right

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.400 
side so left is 180 right
is<00:04:29.080> zero<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.100> I<00:04:30.700> want<00:04:31.030> this<00:04:31.150> actor<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.960> move<00:04:32.170> to

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
is zero so I want this actor to move to

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:40.080 
is zero so I want this actor to move to
the<00:04:32.500> left<00:04:33.360> 180<00:04:35.310> okay<00:04:37.230> and<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:39.520> don't<00:04:39.730> want<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:40.030> to

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
the left 180 okay and I don't want it to

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.450 
the left 180 okay and I don't want it to
go<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.390> fast<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.470> as<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:41.620> want<00:04:41.830> us<00:04:41.920> to<00:04:41.980> be<00:04:42.100> able<00:04:42.280> to

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
go so fast so as I want us to be able to

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.950 
go so fast so as I want us to be able to
see<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:42.790> so<00:04:43.690> we're<00:04:43.840> going<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:44.050> go<00:04:44.820> it's<00:04:45.820> try<00:04:46.120> 130

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
see it so we're going to go it's try 130

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.340 
see it so we're going to go it's try 130
and<00:04:48.120> then<00:04:49.120> hit<00:04:49.330> OK<00:04:51.450> all<00:04:52.450> right<00:04:52.660> now<00:04:53.110> we're

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
and then hit OK all right now we're

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.620 
and then hit OK all right now we're
ready<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.650> sort<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.100> see<00:04:54.400> what<00:04:54.760> happens<00:04:55.330> on

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
ready to sort of see what happens on

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.090 
ready to sort of see what happens on
this<00:04:55.900> stage<00:04:56.230> so<00:04:56.500> that's<00:04:56.680> this<00:04:56.830> is<00:04:56.980> the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
this stage so that's this is the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.310 
this stage so that's this is the
background<00:04:57.550> programming<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:58.960> we're<00:04:59.170> doing

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
background programming that we're doing

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.560 
background programming that we're doing
here<00:04:59.770> and<00:04:59.920> so<00:05:00.520> let's<00:05:00.700> see<00:05:00.940> now<00:05:01.120> this<00:05:01.270> little

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
here and so let's see now this little

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.770 
here and so let's see now this little
green<00:05:01.900> play<00:05:02.350> button<00:05:02.380> if<00:05:02.950> we<00:05:03.820> hit<00:05:04.090> that<00:05:04.150> we're

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
green play button if we hit that we're

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.970 
green play button if we hit that we're
actually<00:05:04.990> going<00:05:05.350> to<00:05:05.440> see<00:05:05.620> what's<00:05:05.800> going<00:05:05.950> to

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
actually going to see what's going to

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.250 
actually going to see what's going to
happen<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.580> actor<00:05:07.090> that's<00:05:07.630> on<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:08.020> stage

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
happen to the actor that's on the stage

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.050 
happen to the actor that's on the stage
so<00:05:08.560> let's<00:05:08.710> go<00:05:08.830> ahead<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.010> do<00:05:09.190> that<00:05:11.790> okay<00:05:12.790> you

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
so let's go ahead and do that okay you

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:21.500 
so let's go ahead and do that okay you
see<00:05:13.240> that

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.810 

let's<00:05:22.140> do<00:05:22.290> that<00:05:22.470> again<00:05:25.010> and<00:05:26.010> go<00:05:26.310> back<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.700> the

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
let's do that again and go back to the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.320 
let's do that again and go back to the
editor<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.840> brings<00:05:28.050> everything<00:05:28.350> back<00:05:28.560> up<00:05:29.330> so

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
editor that brings everything back up so

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.240 
editor that brings everything back up so
you<00:05:30.390> see<00:05:30.860> that<00:05:31.860> I'm<00:05:32.820> selected<00:05:33.360> on<00:05:33.450> the

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
you see that I'm selected on the

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.500 
you see that I'm selected on the
instance<00:05:35.250> of<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.520> actor<00:05:35.910> I<00:05:35.940> want<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.300> be<00:05:36.390> on

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
instance of the actor I want to be on

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.750 
instance of the actor I want to be on
the<00:05:36.630> global<00:05:37.170> instance<00:05:37.560> of<00:05:37.740> it's<00:05:37.950> like<00:05:38.190> get<00:05:38.730> a

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
the global instance of it's like get a

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.940 
the global instance of it's like get a
good<00:05:39.030> look<00:05:39.210> at<00:05:39.420> what's<00:05:39.750> how<00:05:40.020> we<00:05:40.080> program<00:05:40.740> this

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
good look at what's how we program this

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:49.540 
good look at what's how we program this
is<00:05:41.100> so<00:05:41.250> let's<00:05:41.430> try<00:05:41.930> putting<00:05:42.930> in<00:05:46.340> let's<00:05:47.340> try<00:05:47.550> 90

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
is so let's try putting in let's try 90

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.810 
is so let's try putting in let's try 90
see<00:05:50.550> what<00:05:50.670> happens<00:05:50.940> if<00:05:51.030> we<00:05:51.120> put<00:05:51.270> 90<00:05:51.540> and<00:05:52.820> let's

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
see what happens if we put 90 and let's

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:02.150 
see what happens if we put 90 and let's
do<00:05:54.030> that<00:05:54.180> again<00:05:54.560> let's<00:05:55.560> preview<00:05:59.900> okay<00:06:01.160> that

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
do that again let's preview okay that

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.790 
do that again let's preview okay that
brings<00:06:02.430> animates<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.390> ship<00:06:03.630> forward<00:06:05.210> and<00:06:06.800> if

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
brings animates the ship forward and if

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.430 
brings animates the ship forward and if
we<00:06:08.040> did<00:06:09.710> 0<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:11.430> you<00:06:12.300> can<00:06:12.450> do<00:06:12.540> numbers<00:06:12.870> you<00:06:13.320> know

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
we did 0 and you can do numbers you know

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.950 
we did 0 and you can do numbers you know
in<00:06:13.710> between<00:06:14.040> those<00:06:14.460> so<00:06:14.910> you<00:06:15.240> can<00:06:15.390> do<00:06:15.480> 0<00:06:17.960> and

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
in between those so you can do 0 and

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.580 
in between those so you can do 0 and
let's<00:06:20.000> bring<00:06:21.000> that<00:06:21.210> ship<00:06:21.510> there<00:06:21.780> for<00:06:22.050> example

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
let's bring that ship there for example

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:30.700 
let's bring that ship there for example
and<00:06:22.770> then<00:06:22.920> let's<00:06:23.190> preview<00:06:23.520> it<00:06:25.220> there<00:06:26.220> you<00:06:26.370> go

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:45.790 

okay<00:06:31.710> and<00:06:34.010> let's<00:06:35.010> try<00:06:38.270> guess<00:06:39.270> what<00:06:39.510> is<00:06:39.660> it<00:06:39.980> 270

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.320 

noticed<00:06:46.800> our<00:06:46.950> dot<00:06:47.310> just<00:06:47.910> a<00:06:48.120> visual

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
noticed our dot just a visual

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.940 
noticed our dot just a visual
confirmation<00:06:48.660> that's<00:06:49.260> the<00:06:49.380> direction<00:06:49.620> it's

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
confirmation that's the direction it's

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.000 
confirmation that's the direction it's
going<00:06:50.010> to<00:06:50.130> go<00:06:50.220> in<00:06:50.550> and<00:06:51.470> we<00:06:52.470> can<00:06:52.500> try<00:06:52.770> a<00:06:52.830> little

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
going to go in and we can try a little

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.680 
going to go in and we can try a little
faster<00:06:53.430> let's<00:06:53.580> see<00:06:53.790> what<00:06:53.940> happens<00:06:54.270> if<00:06:54.420> we<00:06:54.570> were

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
faster let's see what happens if we were

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.220 
faster let's see what happens if we were
to<00:06:54.810> make<00:06:55.020> it<00:06:56.030> 180<00:06:57.030> that<00:06:57.540> makes<00:06:57.780> any<00:06:57.990> difference

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
to make it 180 that makes any difference

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
to make it 180 that makes any difference
so<00:07:00.320> you<00:07:01.320> can<00:07:01.530> play<00:07:01.740> around<00:07:01.860> with<00:07:02.160> these

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
so you can play around with these

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.700 
so you can play around with these
numbers<00:07:02.610> when<00:07:02.910> you<00:07:03.030> design<00:07:03.420> the<00:07:04.200> great<00:07:04.410> part

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
numbers when you design the great part

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:13.040 
numbers when you design the great part
you<00:07:04.890> get<00:07:05.010> immediate<00:07:06.050> feedback<00:07:11.900> it<00:07:12.900> goes

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
you get immediate feedback it goes

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.270 
you get immediate feedback it goes
backwards<00:07:13.940> okay<00:07:14.940> so<00:07:15.810> that<00:07:16.230> in<00:07:16.440> a<00:07:16.530> nutshell<00:07:16.560> is

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
backwards okay so that in a nutshell is

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.750 
backwards okay so that in a nutshell is
the<00:07:17.760> move<00:07:18.090> command<00:07:19.670> and<00:07:22.460> understanding<00:07:23.460> how

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.760 
the move command and understanding how

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.790 
the move command and understanding how
to<00:07:23.790> program<00:07:24.510> your<00:07:25.310> actors<00:07:26.310> to<00:07:26.790> move<00:07:27.800> okay

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
to program your actors to move okay

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.690 
to program your actors to move okay
we'll<00:07:29.460> see<00:07:29.640> you<00:07:29.730> in<00:07:29.820> the<00:07:29.880> next<00:07:30.030> video
