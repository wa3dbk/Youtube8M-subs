00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
in this video we'll show you how to

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.930 
in this video we'll show you how to
change<00:00:05.990> units<00:00:06.470> and<00:00:06.680> coordinate<00:00:07.280> systems<00:00:07.670> on

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
change units and coordinate systems on

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.270 
change units and coordinate systems on

your garmin etrex 20 depending on the
type<00:00:10.490> of<00:00:10.519> work<00:00:10.910> that<00:00:10.969> you're<00:00:11.240> doing<00:00:11.299> you<00:00:11.599> may

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
type of work that you're doing you may

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.350 
type of work that you're doing you may
need<00:00:12.019> to<00:00:12.139> adjust<00:00:12.230> this<00:00:12.679> but<00:00:13.339> for<00:00:13.579> most<00:00:13.789> typical

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
need to adjust this but for most typical

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.660 
need to adjust this but for most typical
users<00:00:14.690> out-of-the-box<00:00:15.440> settings<00:00:15.919> is<00:00:16.309> pretty

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
users out-of-the-box settings is pretty

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.060 
users out-of-the-box settings is pretty
much<00:00:16.730> what<00:00:16.940> you<00:00:17.060> need<00:00:17.440> but<00:00:18.440> if<00:00:18.590> you<00:00:18.710> do<00:00:18.830> need<00:00:18.980> to

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
much what you need but if you do need to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.920 
much what you need but if you do need to
change<00:00:19.280> it<00:00:19.430> you<00:00:19.550> can<00:00:19.610> go<00:00:19.910> down<00:00:20.150> to<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.690> setup

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
change it you can go down to the setup

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.830 
change it you can go down to the setup
and<00:00:21.940> we'll<00:00:22.940> take<00:00:23.150> a<00:00:23.210> look<00:00:23.420> at<00:00:23.510> these<00:00:23.630> two

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
and we'll take a look at these two

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.660 
and we'll take a look at these two
features<00:00:24.170> here<00:00:24.350> units<00:00:24.890> in<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:25.280> position

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
features here units in the position

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.330 
features here units in the position
format<00:00:26.120> so<00:00:26.690> units<00:00:27.110> you<00:00:27.620> would<00:00:27.770> come<00:00:27.920> in<00:00:28.070> here

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
format so units you would come in here

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.790 
format so units you would come in here
so<00:00:28.520> if<00:00:28.640> your<00:00:28.880> Imperial<00:00:29.840> or<00:00:29.960> metric<00:00:29.990> type<00:00:30.680> of

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
so if your Imperial or metric type of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.499 
so if your Imperial or metric type of
person<00:00:31.160> you<00:00:31.310> can<00:00:31.460> go<00:00:31.610> in<00:00:31.760> here<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:32.059> change

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
person you can go in here and change

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.770 
person you can go in here and change
each<00:00:33.350> of<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:33.829> items<00:00:34.160> here<00:00:34.640> now<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.880> whichever

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
each of the items here now to whichever

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.870 
each of the items here now to whichever
one<00:00:35.990> that<00:00:36.110> you<00:00:36.230> want<00:00:36.470> so<00:00:37.250> we<00:00:37.340> got<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:37.520> distance

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
one that you want so we got the distance

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.080 
one that you want so we got the distance
and<00:00:38.060> speed<00:00:38.380> elevation<00:00:39.380> depth<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.250> pressure

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
and speed elevation depth and pressure

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.180 
and speed elevation depth and pressure
and<00:00:44.090> if<00:00:44.930> you<00:00:44.960> want<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.320> change<00:00:45.620> position

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
and if you want to change position

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.770 
and if you want to change position
format<00:00:46.579> on<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.820> GPS<00:00:47.239> so<00:00:47.450> let's<00:00:47.630> say<00:00:47.750> for

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
format on the GPS so let's say for

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.990 
format on the GPS so let's say for
example<00:00:48.350> you're<00:00:48.590> doing<00:00:49.930> search<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.079> rescue

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
example you're doing search and rescue

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.860 
example you're doing search and rescue
police<00:00:53.000> were<00:00:53.270> fire<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.680> you're<00:00:54.800> using<00:00:55.870> nad83

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
police were fire and you're using nad83

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.799 
police were fire and you're using nad83
maps<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:57.860> UTM<00:00:58.370> this<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.059> where<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.360> change<00:00:59.600> it

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
maps and UTM this is where you change it

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.670 
maps and UTM this is where you change it
go<00:01:00.620> into<00:01:00.739> position<00:01:01.219> format<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.260> position

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
go into position format so the position

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.079 
go into position format so the position
format<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:04.339> have<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.610> whole<00:01:04.850> bunch<00:01:04.879> of

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
format you have a whole bunch of

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.890 
format you have a whole bunch of
different<00:01:05.210> formats<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:05.990> can<00:01:06.170> use<00:01:07.900> so

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
different formats that you can use so

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.149 
different formats that you can use so
let's<00:01:09.229> take<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.620> look<00:01:09.860> here<00:01:11.799> see<00:01:12.799> if<00:01:12.860> we<00:01:12.979> can

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
let's take a look here see if we can

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:21.370 
let's take a look here see if we can
find<00:01:13.400> UTM<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:18.200> datum<00:01:19.600> there<00:01:20.600> let's<00:01:21.140> take<00:01:21.350> a

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
find UTM the datum there let's take a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.770 
find UTM the datum there let's take a
look<00:01:21.619> at<00:01:27.400> right<00:01:28.400> now<00:01:28.820> at<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:29.060> 3<00:01:29.360> now<00:01:29.540> you<00:01:29.570> would

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
look at right now at a 3 now you would

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.630 
look at right now at a 3 now you would
check<00:01:29.990> on<00:01:30.020> your<00:01:30.229> map<00:01:30.439> to<00:01:30.680> see<00:01:30.830> what<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.490> data

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
check on your map to see what the data

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.399 
check on your map to see what the data
ms<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.960> sphere<00:01:33.200> word<00:01:33.409> if<00:01:33.590> needed<00:01:35.409> but

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
ms and the sphere word if needed but

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.370 
ms and the sphere word if needed but
that<00:01:36.650> is<00:01:36.830> typically<00:01:37.189> what<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.610> we<00:01:38.150> use<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.229> now

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
that is typically what you we use so now

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.280 
that is typically what you we use so now
if<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.770> were<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:39.979> mark<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.820> waypoint<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:42.020> see

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
if you were to mark a waypoint you see

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.190 
if you were to mark a waypoint you see
now<00:01:42.470> that<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.830> position<00:01:43.220> format<00:01:43.580> has<00:01:43.729> changed

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
now that the position format has changed

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.870 
now that the position format has changed
now<00:01:45.200> if<00:01:45.350> you're<00:01:45.500> doing<00:01:45.830> something<00:01:46.189> else<00:01:46.490> such

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
now if you're doing something else such

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.179 
now if you're doing something else such
as<00:01:47.140> geocaching<00:01:48.140> or<00:01:48.380> anything<00:01:48.530> like<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:48.799> you

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
as geocaching or anything like that you

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.840 
as geocaching or anything like that you
may<00:01:49.430> want<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.729> go<00:01:49.880> back<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:51.460> reset<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
may want to go back and reset the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.760 
may want to go back and reset the
position<00:01:52.970> format<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:54.200> don't<00:01:54.590> get

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
position format so that you don't get

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.590 
position format so that you don't get
erroneous<00:01:55.670> errors<00:01:56.000> especially<00:01:56.210> with<00:01:56.509> the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
erroneous errors especially with the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.960 
erroneous errors especially with the
data<00:01:56.810> here<00:01:57.680> we<00:01:57.770> can<00:01:57.920> just<00:01:57.950> restore<00:01:58.460> defaults

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
data here we can just restore defaults

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.270 
data here we can just restore defaults
by<00:01:59.360> hitting<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.750> menu<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.259> then<00:02:00.979> we're<00:02:01.130> back

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
by hitting the menu and then we're back

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.690 
by hitting the menu and then we're back
to<00:02:01.360> normal

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
to normal

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.969 
to normal
those<00:02:04.700> are<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.180> two<00:02:05.329> main<00:02:05.479> settings<00:02:05.869> on<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
those are the two main settings on the
