alright<00:01:20.520> let's<00:01:20.729> go<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.420> built<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> be

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
alright let's go it's built not to be

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.620 
alright let's go it's built not to be
fast<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.220> cool<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.299> built<00:01:24.509> for

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
fast or to be cool but it's built for

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.990 
fast or to be cool but it's built for
one<00:01:24.810> purpose<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:26.009> lots<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.430> miles<00:01:26.729> per

one purpose to get lots of miles per
gallon<00:01:27.950> we<00:01:28.950> competed<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.030> Shell

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
gallon we competed at the Shell

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.810 
gallon we competed at the Shell
eco-marathon<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:31.320> Texas<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.579> set<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
eco-marathon in Texas and we set a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.390 
eco-marathon in Texas and we set a
record<00:01:33.060> at<00:01:33.240> 1,700<00:01:33.869> miles<00:01:34.049> per<00:01:34.259> gallon<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.250> one

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
record at 1,700 miles per gallon so one

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.880 
record at 1,700 miles per gallon so one
of<00:01:35.430> our<00:01:35.549> strategies<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.479> slow<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:37.710> go

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
of our strategies is to go slow we go

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.399 
of our strategies is to go slow we go
about<00:01:38.159> an<00:01:38.369> average<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.909> 15<00:01:39.329> miles<00:01:39.600> per<00:01:39.780> hour

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
about an average of 15 miles per hour

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.330 
about an average of 15 miles per hour
we're<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.400> exactly<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.689> speed<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.890> we

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
we're not exactly going for speed but we

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.420 
we're not exactly going for speed but we
do<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:45.000> high<00:01:45.149> gas<00:01:45.360> mileage<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.979> way<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.310> we

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
do get high gas mileage the way that we

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
do get high gas mileage the way that we
achieve<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:48.090> high<00:01:48.270> gas<00:01:48.509> mileage<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.170> a

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
achieve this high gas mileage is a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
achieve this high gas mileage is a
little<00:01:49.740> method<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.340> call<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.909> burning<00:01:51.329> Coast

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
little method we call the burning Coast

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080 
little method we call the burning Coast
method<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.740> burn<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.340> about<00:01:53.460> two<00:01:53.880> or<00:01:54.060> three

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
method we burn for about two or three

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.749 
method we burn for about two or three
seconds<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> speed<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.610> we

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
seconds get up to a speed and then we

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.359 
seconds get up to a speed and then we
Coast<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.509> another<00:01:57.780> two<00:01:58.110> minutes<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:59.070> way<00:01:59.219> we

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
Coast for another two minutes the way we

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.700 
Coast for another two minutes the way we
were<00:01:59.460> able<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> get<00:02:00.060> 1,700<00:02:00.659> miles<00:02:01.170> per<00:02:01.380> gallon

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.450 
were able to get 1,700 miles per gallon
was<00:02:02.070> by<00:02:02.399> making<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.850> car<00:02:03.030> lightweight<00:02:03.479> by

was by making the car lightweight by

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.850 
was by making the car lightweight by
reducing<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> coefficient<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.299> friction
