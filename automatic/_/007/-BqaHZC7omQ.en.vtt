00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
fable one we had loads of different

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.359 
fable one we had loads of different
ideas<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.630> how<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.530> wanted<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.009> move

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
ideas about how we wanted to move

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.639 
ideas about how we wanted to move
forward<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.850> combat<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.500> always

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
forward with a combat and we always

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.249 
forward with a combat and we always
would<00:01:20.009> come<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.899> new<00:01:21.899> thing<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
would come up with a new thing and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.690 
would come up with a new thing and
they'd<00:01:22.530> always<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> standard<00:01:23.220> problem<00:01:23.579> of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
they'd always with a standard problem of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.149 
they'd always with a standard problem of
well<00:01:23.909> how<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.240> work<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.450> into<00:01:25.070> into<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
well how do we work this into into the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.950 
well how do we work this into into the
ginn<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> controls<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.870> so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
ginn to the controls and it was just so

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.600 
ginn to the controls and it was just so
limiting<00:01:28.409> thinking<00:01:28.740> well<00:01:28.920> we've<00:01:29.280> run<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
limiting thinking well we've run out of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.040 
limiting thinking well we've run out of
buttons<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.120> that<00:01:30.270> how<00:01:30.570> will<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.870> player

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
buttons for that how will the player

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.080 
buttons for that how will the player
actually<00:01:31.260> make<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.979> happen<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.520> by

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
actually make this happen and by

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
actually make this happen and by
stripping<00:01:33.780> back<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.320> using<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.590> button

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
stripping back to just using one button

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.800 
stripping back to just using one button
it's<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.460> well<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.240> seems<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> sky's<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it's like well it seems the sky's the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.360 
it's like well it seems the sky's the
limit<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> sudden<00:01:37.650> anything<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.340> can

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
limit all of a sudden anything we can

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.820 
limit all of a sudden anything we can
think<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.850> based<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> context<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.440> it's

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
think of based on the context that it's

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.039 
think of based on the context that it's
appropriate<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.510> with<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.720> single

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
appropriate we can do just with a single
