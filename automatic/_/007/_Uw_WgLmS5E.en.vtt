reside so you can cut the wattage of the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.520 
reside so you can cut the wattage of the
amp<00:02:05.680> in<00:02:05.890> half<00:02:06.130> from<00:02:06.759> 12<00:02:07.119> watts<00:02:07.329> to<00:02:07.570> 6<00:02:07.840> using<00:02:08.350> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
amp in half from 12 watts to 6 using the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.620 
amp in half from 12 watts to 6 using the
standby<00:02:09.009> switch<00:02:09.340> here<00:02:09.609> which<00:02:09.640> runs<00:02:10.209> from<00:02:10.390> high

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.090 
pretty cool looking to buy 12 right here
it<00:02:16.000> was<00:02:16.180> kind<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:16.989> born<00:02:17.230> out<00:02:17.350> of<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.530> idea<00:02:17.560> that

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
it was kind of born out of the idea that

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.949 
it was kind of born out of the idea that
conventional<00:02:18.820> two<00:02:18.970> by<00:02:19.090> twelves<00:02:19.480> don't<00:02:19.720> offer

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
conventional two by twelves don't offer

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.910 
conventional two by twelves don't offer
enough<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:21.570> self<00:02:22.570> monitoring<00:02:23.140> being<00:02:23.680> able<00:02:23.799> to

enough of self monitoring being able to

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.380 
enough of self monitoring being able to
hear<00:02:24.160> your<00:02:24.310> own<00:02:24.489> tone<00:02:24.820> because<00:02:25.120> they're<00:02:25.239> so

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
hear your own tone because they're so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.539 
hear your own tone because they're so
close<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.930> floor<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.280> vertical

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
close to the floor so this vertical

design was come up with my Bogner to

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.770 
design was come up with my Bogner to
kind<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.430> give<00:02:30.519> you<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.700> little<00:02:30.820> bit<00:02:31.090> more<00:02:31.359> sense

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
kind of give you a little bit more sense

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.690 
kind of give you a little bit more sense

of being able to hear yourself vogner

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.940 
of being able to hear yourself vogner
designed<00:02:34.060> this<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:35.200> little<00:02:35.500> bit<00:02:35.620> closer

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
designed this to be a little bit closer

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
to have the same amount of power and

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.710 
to have the same amount of power and
punches<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.590> 412<00:02:42.040> but<00:02:42.430> had<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.120> portability

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
punches of 412 but had the portability
