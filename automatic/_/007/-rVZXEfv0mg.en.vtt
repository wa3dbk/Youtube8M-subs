00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.480
 This time carbon rod 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:22.200
 Moreover, even if you make ordinary carbon , it is interesting that it is 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.350
 I say that 45 carbon 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:31.290
 You may not understand just by looking at it a little 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:36.990
 Now to the normal carbon it's anti-braided carbon which and said, 4 Juku' on it 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:39.720
 Kind Now the making, such as had sold all of it this way from the butt to the tip 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.050
 The feature is 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.079
 High 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.860
 Because say knitted that 4-axis carbon 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.140
 Lines by Come on you Oh Chau 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.730
 Though it is flexible 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.400
 It's easy to say 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 It's easy to shake 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.500
 The characteristics speaking the blur and its 45 carbon 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.280
 What 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 If you hold it down 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.180
 Because it is 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.330
 It's like saying it's soft but it doesn't blur 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.190
 I've made you a little contradiction of the cat 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.800
 Yes 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.690
 Something in used in well-rod of the rod and Kaneumi of the Tonamenta is because this four-axis carbon 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.430
 There is something I can do 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:27.260
 But I know thinking just butt still beg say I'm kind of form of 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.360
 Again Top because in not such a stiff also is seeded because 40 carbon 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.210
 If the water is it I was wondering if I'm facing 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.810
 so 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.180
 Such a slender 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:40.520
 After collecting carbon, it is called 40 carbon 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.460
 Since the power-related that I made this kind of Now sowing is the power to home 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.590
 It Kedomo I know about bikini 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.080
 A little more tenacious than a bikini 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.409
 This as a Ne model 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:57.290
 An original case with a Bright River listing ceiling made by the house 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.650
 It is version classical type of this 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:05.200
 And this 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.880
 Here is the latest in a rod made to focus on because the other true to the carbon lightness Fujikogyo 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.660
 It is titanium guide of 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:16.500
 Anyway, it's a lightweight face 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.410
 Though plus if me this a little longer this kind of teeth in two at length in this guide 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.270
 What 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.170
 506 heat version and then 5.4 feed version 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.160
 Made 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.870
 Well, 5.6 means you want to use it for all Mighty 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.770
 In 5.4 because you still there are many who love the trot Let's have Ensei because 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:43.710
 Is a rod made to meet the demands went so 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:47.400
 It's a very unique material, but it's not just that look and it's used 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.459
 Because I think that'll buy from say fun of this material 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.770
 Lotto's name means 4 in French 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.510
 It is the theater of the theater 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:02.130
 2562 and 2542 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.330
 Period guide specifications of de sac version f tool 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.569
 In the coffin 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:12.909
 Because it will be released simultaneously with bl guide specification total 4 types 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.909
 We wish all means please consider my best regards 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.480
 I will 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.480
 Hmm
