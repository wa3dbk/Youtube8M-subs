that pelvic alignment so we have to come

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.010 
that pelvic alignment so we have to come
around<00:00:14.670> correct<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.210> or<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.480> people<00:00:15.719> we've

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
around correct one or two people we've

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.090 
around correct one or two people we've
allowed<00:00:16.670> the<00:00:17.670> supporting<00:00:18.420> knee<00:00:18.600> up<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:19.350> to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
allowed the supporting knee up here to

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.490 
allowed the supporting knee up here to
go<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> little<00:00:20.460> bit<00:00:20.699> too<00:00:20.880> far<00:00:21.150> forward<00:00:21.510> that

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
go a little bit too far forward that

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.830 
go a little bit too far forward that
drop<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> cap<00:00:23.279> via<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.029> pelvis<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.689> could

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
drop a cap via the pelvis and you could

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.080 
drop a cap via the pelvis and you could
see<00:00:25.080> people<00:00:25.380> arching<00:00:26.039> their<00:00:26.189> backs<00:00:26.430> as

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
see people arching their backs as

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.060 
see people arching their backs as
they're<00:00:27.420> sort<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> hanging<00:00:28.199> too<00:00:28.529> far<00:00:28.769> forward

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
they're sort of hanging too far forward

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.030 
they're sort of hanging too far forward
so<00:00:29.939> you've<00:00:30.060> got<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.359> control<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.750> okay<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
so you've got to control that okay and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.860 
so you've got to control that okay and
then<00:00:32.489> again<00:00:32.730> when<00:00:32.880> you're<00:00:33.030> taking<00:00:33.540> people<00:00:33.840> off

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
piriformis so we'll move on to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.529 
piriformis so we'll move on to
piriformis<00:00:43.200> next<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.340> recap<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.510> how

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
piriformis next and just recap on how

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.049 
piriformis next and just recap on how
you<00:00:45.780> assess<00:00:46.260> muscle<00:00:46.710> length<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.190> you're

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you assess muscle length here you're

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.119 
you assess muscle length here you're
going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> bring<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> knees<00:00:48.750> together<00:00:49.129> okay

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
ankles bring the knees up into flexion

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.599 
ankles bring the knees up into flexion
at<00:00:56.610> about<00:00:56.969> 90<00:00:57.360> degrees<00:00:57.800> stay<00:00:58.800> supporting<00:00:59.489> the

she's going to pick the leg up from here
and<00:01:36.360> our<00:01:36.960> stretch<00:01:37.409> position<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.369> obviously

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and our stretch position is obviously

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
and our stretch position is obviously
dropping<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.570> leg<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.350> make<00:01:40.530> sure<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
dropping this leg out so make sure the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.539 
dropping this leg out so make sure the
knee<00:01:40.920> stays<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.520> close<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:43.220> there<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.399> can

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
knee stays in close and there we can

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.020 
knee stays in close and there we can
feel<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.299> point<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.659> bind<00:01:46.310> problem<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.759> if

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
feel the point of bind problem now is if

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.510 
feel the point of bind problem now is if
I<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.899> without<00:01:49.200> supporting<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.340> see

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
I do that without supporting you can see

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
I do that without supporting you can see
what<00:01:50.700> starts<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> happen<00:01:51.290> his<00:01:52.290> pelvis<00:01:52.799> starts

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
what starts to happen his pelvis starts

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.850 
what starts to happen his pelvis starts
to<00:01:53.310> roll<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.420> my<00:01:54.600> preferred<00:01:55.020> position<00:01:55.619> for

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
to roll so my preferred position for

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.819 
to roll so my preferred position for
this<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.939> get<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.180> hand<00:01:57.479> there<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.680> my

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
this is to get my hand there so that my

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.190 
this is to get my hand there so that my
arm<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.659> controlling<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> amount<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
arm is controlling the amount of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.410 
arm is controlling the amount of
rotation<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.950> takes<00:02:02.280> place<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.299> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
rotation that takes place and that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.319 
rotation that takes place and that
leaves<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:04.020> hand<00:02:04.350> free<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.549> sit<00:02:05.820> over<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
leaves this hand free to sit over the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
we can count it down five four three two

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.480 
we can count it down five four three two
