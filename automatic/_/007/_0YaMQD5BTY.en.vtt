00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
know we were being unselfish and most

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.450

importantly<00:00:13.170> were<00:00:13.290> getting<00:00:13.530> some<00:00:13.799> good<00:00:14.130> stops

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
importantly were getting some good stops

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.829 
importantly were getting some good stops
and<00:00:14.700> we<00:00:14.759> were<00:00:14.849> pushing<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.360> transition

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
and we were pushing it in transition

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.080

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
guys probably know how significant it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.500 
guys probably know how significant it
was<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.399> come<00:00:35.550> beat<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> ranked<00:00:36.059> team<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
was to come beat a ranked team on the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.299 
was to come beat a ranked team on the
road<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.870> maybe<00:00:37.320> finish<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> way<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.129> did

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
road and maybe finish it the way you did

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.850 
road and maybe finish it the way you did
yeah<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.059> mean<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.270> was<00:00:39.360> big<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:39.690> us<00:00:39.860> because

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
yeah I mean it was big for us because

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.160 
yeah I mean it was big for us because
they<00:00:41.250> made<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.579> run<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:42.660> got<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> little<00:00:42.989> riled

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
they made that run we got a little riled

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.319 
they made that run we got a little riled
there<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.649> regrouped<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.910> time<00:00:45.120> out

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
there but we regrouped in that time out

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.990 
there but we regrouped in that time out
so<00:00:45.600> probably<00:00:46.559> guys<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.129> stepping<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.789> because

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
so probably guys for stepping up because

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.160 
so probably guys for stepping up because
is<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> huge<00:00:48.420> step<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.840> us<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.079> right

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
is a huge step for us in the right

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.729 
is a huge step for us in the right
