the bottom now your ad rocket comes with
three<00:00:54.949> different<00:00:54.979> launch<00:00:55.430> cylinders<00:00:56.059> launch

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
three different launch cylinders launch

cylinder one is gonna give you the least

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.299 
cylinder one is gonna give you the least
resistance<00:01:00.049> so<00:01:00.530> that's<00:01:00.739> gonna<00:01:01.010> make<00:01:01.159> the

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
resistance so that's gonna make the

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.579 
resistance so that's gonna make the
workout<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.970> most<00:01:02.239> challenging<00:01:02.930> launch
