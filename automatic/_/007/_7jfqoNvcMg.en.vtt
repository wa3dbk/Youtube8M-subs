none of those things and all those

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.560 
none of those things and all those
things<00:02:02.829> together<00:02:03.070> right<00:02:03.520> totally

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
things together right totally

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.530 
things together right totally
I<00:02:04.720> think<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.829> adventure

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
I think the adventure

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.200 
I think the adventure
we<00:02:08.350> sort<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.710> fit<00:02:08.920> its<00:02:09.040> best<00:02:09.310> yeah<00:02:09.670> that's<00:02:10.090> true

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
we sort of fit its best yeah that's true

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.840 
we sort of fit its best yeah that's true
I<00:02:10.600> think<00:02:10.810> mainly<00:02:11.110> because<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.500> geometry<00:02:12.160> the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
I think mainly because of geometry the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.600 
I think mainly because of geometry the
higher<00:02:13.210> shorter<00:02:13.900> from<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:15.190> know<00:02:15.340> with

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
higher shorter from it you know with

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.430 
higher shorter from it you know with
having<00:02:15.730> all<00:02:16.000> these<00:02:16.150> braised<00:02:16.510> ons<00:02:16.840> it's<00:02:17.140> really

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
having all these braised ons it's really

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.230 
having all these braised ons it's really
nice<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:18.040> put<00:02:18.910> racks<00:02:19.210> on<00:02:20.460> fenders<00:02:21.460> panniers

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
nice to put racks on fenders panniers

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.810 
nice to put racks on fenders panniers
front<00:02:22.900> rear<00:02:23.110> racks<00:02:23.380> lowriders<00:02:24.280> up<00:02:24.490> front

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
front rear racks lowriders up front

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.790 
front rear racks lowriders up front
these<00:02:25.660> are<00:02:25.840> equipped<00:02:26.170> with<00:02:26.290> actually

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
these are equipped with actually

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.820 
these are equipped with actually
mechanical<00:02:27.700> disc<00:02:27.880> brakes<00:02:28.120> mm-hmm<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:28.960> really

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
mechanical disc brakes mm-hmm so really

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.510 
mechanical disc brakes mm-hmm so really
easy<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.550> modulate<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:33.040> know<00:02:33.160> if<00:02:33.310> there<00:02:33.490> is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
easy to modulate you know if there is

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.000 
easy to modulate you know if there is
something<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:34.660> someone<00:02:34.960> has<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.530> fear<00:02:35.860> of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
something if someone has that fear of

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.260 
something if someone has that fear of
breaking<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.400> hydraulic<00:02:36.850> line<00:02:37.000> which<00:02:37.150> I've

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
breaking a hydraulic line which I've

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.310 
breaking a hydraulic line which I've
never<00:02:37.390> seen<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:39.160> can<00:02:39.400> easily<00:02:40.150> roadside<00:02:40.990> fix

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
never seen you can easily roadside fix

mechanical disagree so with this gearing

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.199 
mechanical disagree so with this gearing
combination<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:45.340> can<00:02:45.490> ride<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.790> like<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> road

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
combination you can ride it like a road

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.640 
combination you can ride it like a road
