00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Today we eat rabbits! 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.619
 We have my boyfriend Mauri, 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:14.549
 a great professional, the best barber of animals. 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.009
 We have it along, 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.030
 you already know it, 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.189
 on our Biluta rabbit, 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.589
 which will be part of 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.710
 a grooming session, and Mauri will explain 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.569
 how we care for the Angora fur of animals. 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:29.789
 Hi, it's good to see you again! 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.669
 come on 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:31.949
 let's begin! 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.290
 In this rabbit, with specific features, 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.030
 we will use it the first time 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.580
 this brush 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.010
 with spikes that we call "butter" 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.260
 are very soft, 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.290
 to begin to manage my hair. 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.950
 Once we have the coat, 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.690
 we use this metal comb to remove it 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.260
 dead hair. 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.399
 Good. Mauri, the first question: 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.960
 Do we have to take the Angora fur animals daily? 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.440
 Okay, I think so 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.620
 it's a daily brushing, but a control 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.530
 of the fur of such a long-haired animal, 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.840
 to check if he has broken, and if so, to disqualify and comb him. 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.259
 But do not be mistaken, 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.810
 excuse me for interrupting you, do not bother me when I say that 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.110
 a rabbit or Angora cat requires more care than a fur animal 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.990
 shorten. You're right, no doubt. Because not many 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.860
 I know this, 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.960
 we see animals in the barber shop every day with a coat that can not be saved anymore. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.780
 But we're not just talking about aesthetics, but these knots 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.510
 including their dermatitis to the animals, the skin does not breathe 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.800
 and it's a problem. You are right! The broken hair, 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.880
 as the node is more tight on the skin, 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.170
 when we make them bath all the moisture stays under him, 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.500
 for example those nodes that we can not do anymore. The moisture stays down 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.740
 and causing injuries, the rabbit will scratch because it will pull on them, 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.070
 large nodes are formed, it will scratch and so 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.520
 There are different affections. So, in order not to suffer this and for the rabbit to be beautiful 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.340
 and healthy, 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.789
 with a perfect fur, 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.769
 must 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.019
 first of all to check my blanita daily, 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.570
 use this brush. 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.940
 Yes, it's a soft teeth brush, 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.810
 Phenomenal! 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.110
 So we start with this brush to brush the tips. 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.560
 Yes, it is important not to hurry, 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.599
 many do superficial brushing and I think they're done. 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.859
 No, hair should be brushed from the root, 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.529
 we start with the peaks, disable it and eliminate it 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.069
 all this dead hair. Look how it goes! 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.180
 This procedure does not hurt, it is a dead hair, lost in the fur, 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.489
 we have to eliminate it a little bit, we do not have to hurry. 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.289
 And also the brush with scrubs. Yeah, when we have a hairy area 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:03:00.439
 descended, we can start to brush with a soft brush, 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.900
 to open the hair, to give it volume, because it brush 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.920
 has teeth more than normal 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.690
 and the fur will look more beautiful afterwards. 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.830
 Mauri, what can our friends do, those who have an angora rabbit 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.429
 or a Angora cat, 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.529
 and when to call a professional? 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.349
 The home, 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.109
 what he has to do is 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.979
 first of all, to buy these utensils, 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.079
 e.g 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.620
 the Artero brand is commercializing 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.199
 different types of brushes. 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.710
 It is very important to buy such a brush, 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.880
 the one we call "butter" because it has soft brushes, 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.899
 a soft brush, and she has very soft brushes, and a metal comb. 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:47.049
 These are the basic tools. 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.349
 So with these brushes they can make a coat of care. 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.719
 Yes, yes, if they use them correctly, they will be able to do it 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.380
 maintenance without any problems. At what time 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.030
 recommend them to go to a hairdresser to make a brush 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.240
 in depth? If the owner does not have enough time and 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.129
 the animal gets to have it 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.150
 such a hair volume should go at least once every 15 days 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.919
 at a barber shop. 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.789
 But even so, it should brush the animal and at home. 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.489
 For example, keep the fur so that when we brush it, we can see the skin. 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.180
 The skin needs to breathe. If I was combing and I could not see the skin, 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.410
 means that nodes have been formed. After brushing with what we continue because 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.960
 I saw this tool. What is it called? It's a knot cutter. 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.120
 Normally, we use it in extreme cases, 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.159
 we hairdressers, we always try to save hair, 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.159
 to be more beautiful fur. We like a lot more, 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.100
 the result of grooming or hairdressing 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.270
 will be more aesthetic. 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.759
 But when we are dealing with a knot so difficult to discard, what can not be saved, 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.439
 like this one from here, 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.520
 we need to use the cutter, let's go 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.780
 at the base of the hair 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.850
 and cut it a little, until we completely eliminate it. After I dissected all my hair 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.699
 and we removed all the nodes, 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.879
 we use the comb a bit to comb the fur 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:14.360
 and to give it a form, 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.230
 after using the scissors. 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.220
 Perfect. You use the scissors for the fur to have the same length everywhere, right? 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.719
 Exact. For rounding. For example, we have these scissors, 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.660
 are of very good quality, also Artero, 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.560
 a scissor 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.689
 very aggressive, 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:34.380
 because it does not make a right cut, the result is more natural. 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.090
 It's a scissors used by all hairdressers. 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.670
 After, 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.370
 we have this scissors 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.860
 also brand Artero, has a very clean cut, 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.620
 but at the same time it creates these 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.009
 spaces, is a bit more aggressive than the previous one. To finish 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:53.710
 we use these scissors, 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.169
 are straight, have a normal tais, we use them to adjust 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.240
 all fur. 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.979
 Perfect. What do you say if I now leave you alone to do your job? We walk a little 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.199
 and we return to see the result. 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:14.369
 Very good! 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.820
 Friends, as Mauri told you, 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.370
 every 15 days or a month, we have to take the rabbit to the barber shop, 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.410
 to help us with all this fluffiness, to arrange it, to be beautiful and healthy, 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.380
 you do not say it is a rabbit, it seems a cloud!
