00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
about my mini mark Phalaenopsis which is

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.700 
about my mini mark Phalaenopsis which is
looking<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.460> very<00:00:08.700> sad<00:00:09.000> way<00:00:09.500> if<00:00:10.500> you

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
looking in a very sad way if you

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.680 
looking in a very sad way if you
remember<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.219> had<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.790> flower<00:00:12.120> spike<00:00:12.450> which

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
remember it had that flower spike which

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.780 
remember it had that flower spike which
had<00:00:12.870> two<00:00:13.170> K<00:00:13.349> keys<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.799> produced<00:00:14.190> three<00:00:14.549> more

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
had two K keys it produced three more

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.760 
had two K keys it produced three more
flower<00:00:15.059> spikes<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.900> eventually<00:00:16.289> cut

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
flower spikes that I eventually cut

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.920 
flower spikes that I eventually cut
because<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.520> wasn't<00:00:17.789> coping<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.449> now

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
because it wasn't coping and now

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.950 
because it wasn't coping and now
developed<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.680> micro<00:00:20.039> fungus<00:00:20.400> attack<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.970> am

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
developed that micro fungus attack I am

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840 
developed that micro fungus attack I am
honestly<00:00:22.619> not<00:00:22.710> sure<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> mother<00:00:23.519> plant

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
honestly not sure if the mother plant

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.849 
honestly not sure if the mother plant
will<00:00:24.090> survive<00:00:24.480> through<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.560> decided

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
will survive through this but I decided

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.790 
will survive through this but I decided
to<00:00:26.070> try<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> save<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> K<00:00:27.029> keys<00:00:27.800> unfortunately

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
to try to save the K keys unfortunately

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500 
to try to save the K keys unfortunately
the<00:00:28.980> K<00:00:29.130> keys<00:00:29.310> didn't<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.730> too<00:00:30.000> many<00:00:30.150> roots

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the K keys didn't have too many roots

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.120 
the K keys didn't have too many roots
one<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> key<00:00:31.109> keys<00:00:31.320> tried<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.769> produce<00:00:31.920> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
one of the key keys tried to produce a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.360 
one of the key keys tried to produce a
flower<00:00:32.309> spike<00:00:32.809> which<00:00:33.809> bloomed<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:35.010> that

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
flower spike which bloomed but that

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.139 
flower spike which bloomed but that
prevented<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.000> from<00:00:36.030> producing<00:00:36.690> any<00:00:37.050> roots<00:00:37.410> so

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
prevented it from producing any roots so

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.630 
prevented it from producing any roots so
here's<00:00:39.149> what<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:39.989> did<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> K<00:00:41.070> Keys<00:00:41.309> first

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
here's what I did with the K Keys first

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.580 
here's what I did with the K Keys first
of<00:00:41.879> all<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:42.930> key<00:00:43.050> key<00:00:43.230> was<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> one

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
of all this little key key was the one

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.139 
of all this little key key was the one
that<00:00:43.739> didn't<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.160> any<00:00:44.309> roots<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> tried

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
that didn't have any roots and I tried

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.090 
that didn't have any roots and I tried
to<00:00:45.300> put<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.750> Spagna<00:00:46.230> moss<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.590> what<00:00:46.739> happens

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
to put in Spagna moss see what happens

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.709 
to put in Spagna moss see what happens
but<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.360> afraid<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:49.020> lose<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.680> one

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
but I'm afraid I'm gonna lose this one

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.790 
but I'm afraid I'm gonna lose this one
doesn't<00:00:51.719> look<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.289> producing

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
doesn't look like it's producing

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.350 
doesn't look like it's producing
anything<00:00:53.430> right<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:53.940> oops

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
anything right here oops

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.180 
anything right here oops
am<00:00:54.510> i<00:00:54.629> out<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> frame<00:00:55.260> okay<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.980> looks

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
am i out of the frame okay it looks

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.910 
am i out of the frame okay it looks
pretty<00:00:56.640> yellowed<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.780> also<00:00:58.379> looks<00:00:58.829> like

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
pretty yellowed up it also looks like

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.250 
pretty yellowed up it also looks like
the<00:00:59.039> center<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.670> yellowing<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the center is yellowing up and it's a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.039 
the center is yellowing up and it's a
shame<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.680> think<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.699> will<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.059> make<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
shame I think this will now make it so a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.980 
shame I think this will now make it so a
key<00:01:04.260> key<00:01:04.439> without<00:01:04.710> roots<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:06.060> really<00:01:06.750> do

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
key key without roots will not really do

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.570 
key key without roots will not really do
anything<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.500> its<00:01:07.680> own<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.220> gonna<00:01:08.369> leave

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
anything on its own I'm just gonna leave

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
anything on its own I'm just gonna leave
it<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.909> until<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.450> dies<00:01:10.220> but<00:01:11.220> anyway<00:01:11.700> but

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it here until it dies but anyway but

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.620 
it here until it dies but anyway but
this<00:01:12.900> K<00:01:13.380> key<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
this K key you can see here that it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.679 
this K key you can see here that it
already<00:01:15.810> has<00:01:16.640> some<00:01:17.640> dotting<00:01:18.090> around<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
already has some dotting around of the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.840 
already has some dotting around of the
micro<00:01:18.990> fungus<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.560> trying<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.189> keep<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
micro fungus I'm trying to keep it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.630 
micro fungus I'm trying to keep it
healthy<00:01:21.000> spray<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.110> whatever<00:01:22.799> I'm<00:01:23.220> trying<00:01:23.400> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
save this one so yeah basically the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.980 
save this one so yeah basically the
mother<00:01:25.979> plant<00:01:26.280> transmitted<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> disease<00:01:27.210> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
mother plant transmitted the disease to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.980 
mother plant transmitted the disease to
the<00:01:28.229> baby<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.299> gonna<00:01:30.450> try<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.720> save

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the baby so I'm just gonna try to save

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.499 
the baby so I'm just gonna try to save
it<00:01:31.170> anyway<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> see<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.220> by<00:01:32.790> improving<00:01:33.210> dam

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it anyway and see if by improving dam

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.240 
it anyway and see if by improving dam
unitary<00:01:33.960> system<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> circuit<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.100> make

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
unitary system of the circuit I can make

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640 
unitary system of the circuit I can make
this<00:01:35.369> cake<00:01:35.729> he<00:01:35.880> actually<00:01:36.659> become<00:01:37.140> healthy

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
this cake he actually become healthy

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.920 
this cake he actually become healthy
again<00:01:37.970> anyway<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.299> interesting<00:01:39.329> thing<00:01:39.840> about

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
again anyway the interesting thing about

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.380 
again anyway the interesting thing about
this<00:01:40.290> cake<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.280> only<00:01:41.460> had<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:41.759> little

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this cake is that it only had one little

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.380 
this cake is that it only had one little
root<00:01:42.750> which<00:01:43.680> unfortunately<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.490> managed<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
root which unfortunately I managed to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.130 
root which unfortunately I managed to
snap<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.640> quite<00:01:47.970> okay<00:01:48.140> because

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
snap here but that's quite okay because

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.560 
snap here but that's quite okay because
as<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.490> root<00:01:50.700> has<00:01:50.939> started<00:01:51.329> to

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
as you can see the root has started to

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.319 
as you can see the root has started to
grow<00:01:51.899> pretty<00:01:52.259> nicely<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.100> pot<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.790> it's

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
grow pretty nicely in this pot and it's

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.149 
grow pretty nicely in this pot and it's
developing<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.229> fitting<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> orchid

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
developing and it's fitting the orchid

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.380 
developing and it's fitting the orchid
so<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.149> don't<00:01:57.659> think<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.340> little<00:01:59.340> orchid<00:02:00.180> here

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so I don't think this little orchid here

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.319 
so I don't think this little orchid here
will<00:02:00.570> die<00:02:00.810> also<00:02:01.259> no<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.369> thought<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.850> saw<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> new

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
will die also no I thought I saw a new

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.709 
will die also no I thought I saw a new
leaf<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.750> no<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> what<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> did<00:02:05.969> was<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> tried<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
leaf but no so what I did was I tried to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.990 
leaf but no so what I did was I tried to
put<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.290> mixture<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> sphagnum<00:02:08.459> moss<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
put it in a mixture of sphagnum moss and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.369 
put it in a mixture of sphagnum moss and
bark<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.629> little<00:02:09.869> bit<00:02:09.959> more<00:02:10.080> sphagnum

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
bark it's a little bit more sphagnum

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:10.999 
bark it's a little bit more sphagnum
moss

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
moss

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.970 
moss
then<00:02:11.459> bark<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.180> dries<00:02:12.629> up<00:02:12.810> pretty<00:02:13.260> pretty<00:02:13.650> fast

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
then bark it dries up pretty pretty fast

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.429 
then bark it dries up pretty pretty fast
so<00:02:14.879> anyway<00:02:15.450> yeah<00:02:15.780> that's<00:02:16.079> what's<00:02:16.260> been

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
so anyway yeah that's what's been

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.410 
so anyway yeah that's what's been
happening<00:02:16.470> with<00:02:16.860> my<00:02:17.099> mini<00:02:17.340> mark<00:02:17.579> I<00:02:17.849> hoped<00:02:18.269> I

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
happening with my mini mark I hoped I

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.170 
happening with my mini mark I hoped I
would<00:02:18.629> do<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> video<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.860> how<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.159> pot<00:02:20.519> up<00:02:20.670> K<00:02:20.909> keys

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
would do a video of how to pot up K keys

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.030 
would do a video of how to pot up K keys
and<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.629> on<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.200> didn't<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.829> chance

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
and so on but I didn't have the chance

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.220 
and so on but I didn't have the chance
actually<00:02:23.370> because<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.299> orchids<00:02:24.629> could<00:02:24.989> not

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
actually because the orchids could not

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.350 
actually because the orchids could not
cope<00:02:25.620> with<00:02:25.680> these<00:02:25.980> K<00:02:26.310> keys<00:02:26.519> any<00:02:26.730> longer<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.329> I

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
cope with these K keys any longer so I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.050 
cope with these K keys any longer so I
needed<00:02:28.079> to<00:02:28.230> take<00:02:28.500> some<00:02:28.739> measures<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.760> yeah

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
needed to take some measures so yeah

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.170 
needed to take some measures so yeah
hopefully<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.989> guy<00:02:31.200> will<00:02:31.230> become<00:02:31.709> healthy

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
hopefully this guy will become healthy

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.280 
hopefully this guy will become healthy
hopefully<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.299> will<00:02:33.360> develop<00:02:33.629> in<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.049> tiny

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
hopefully it will develop in this tiny

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.319 
hopefully it will develop in this tiny
little<00:02:34.440> pot<00:02:34.829> and<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.310> tiny<00:02:35.760> little<00:02:36.030> root

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
little pot and this tiny little root

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.660 
little pot and this tiny little root
will<00:02:36.629> develop<00:02:37.049> into<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.349> big<00:02:37.829> root<00:02:38.099> system<00:02:38.489> I

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
will develop into a big root system I

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.369 
will develop into a big root system I
don't<00:02:38.970> know<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.209> really<00:02:39.569> love<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.750> orchid<00:02:40.200> and

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
don't know I really love this orchid and

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.809 
don't know I really love this orchid and
I<00:02:40.470> think<00:02:40.709> I'm<00:02:40.829> gonna<00:02:40.980> lose<00:02:41.189> the<00:02:41.340> mother<00:02:41.519> plant

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
I think I'm gonna lose the mother plant

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.720 
I think I'm gonna lose the mother plant
so<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.780> little<00:02:43.049> keiki<00:02:43.409> is<00:02:43.590> my<00:02:44.010> only<00:02:44.489> chance

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
so this little keiki is my only chance

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.569 
so this little keiki is my only chance
for<00:02:45.030> survival<00:02:45.239> if<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.989> can<00:02:46.200> manage<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.129> get<00:02:47.370> rid

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
for survival if I can manage to get rid

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.849 
for survival if I can manage to get rid
of<00:02:47.670> these<00:02:47.909> pots<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.870> fungus<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.650> whatever

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
they look like they're not spreading

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.250
