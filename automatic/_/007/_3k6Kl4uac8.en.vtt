and<00:03:39.880> I've<00:03:40.030> always<00:03:40.330> really<00:03:41.049> enjoyed<00:03:41.560> NARS<00:03:42.150> I've

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150

and I've always really enjoyed NARS I've
never<00:03:43.450> really<00:03:43.840> liked<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:45.250> more<00:03:45.700> dewy<00:03:45.940> finish

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
never really liked the more dewy finish

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.780 
never really liked the more dewy finish
of<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:48.600> sheer<00:03:49.769> radiance<00:03:50.769> or<00:03:51.280> whatever<00:03:51.549> it<00:03:51.700> was

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
of the sheer radiance or whatever it was

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.310 
of the sheer radiance or whatever it was
called<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:52.420> didn't<00:03:52.959> really<00:03:53.140> like<00:03:53.290> that

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
called I didn't really like that

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.470 
called I didn't really like that
foundation<00:03:54.130> but<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:54.940> one<00:03:55.150> like<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.450> said

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
foundation but this one like I said

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.900 
foundation but this one like I said
drives<00:03:56.079> to<00:03:56.290> like<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.650> velvety<00:03:57.220> powder<00:03:57.549> finish

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
drives to like a velvety powder finish

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.650 
drives to like a velvety powder finish
so<00:03:58.500> um<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.560> feel<00:04:00.340> like<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.549> looks<00:04:00.730> like<00:04:00.880> skin<00:04:01.269> and

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
so um I feel like it looks like skin and

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.660 
so um I feel like it looks like skin and
it<00:04:01.900> looks<00:04:02.049> natural<00:04:02.350> but<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:03.130> doesn't<00:04:03.519> look

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
it looks natural but it doesn't look

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.270 
it looks natural but it doesn't look
shiny<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.390> dewy<00:04:04.780> but<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.560> also<00:04:05.709> isn't<00:04:06.040> like

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
shiny and dewy but it also isn't like

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.780 
shiny and dewy but it also isn't like
flat<00:04:06.760> matte<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.540> really<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:07.930> like<00:04:08.049> a<00:04:08.109> satin

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
flat matte so it really is like a satin

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.400 
flat matte so it really is like a satin
