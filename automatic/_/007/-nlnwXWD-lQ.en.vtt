you've got four screws down the side
once<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.300> get<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> front<00:00:45.809> bezel<00:00:46.079> off<00:00:47.210> then

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
once you get the front bezel off then

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.639 
once you get the front bezel off then
with<00:00:48.420> me<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> screen<00:00:49.050> part<00:00:50.120> get<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.750> out<00:00:52.020> all

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
with me the screen part get that out all

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.110 
with me the screen part get that out all
you<00:00:52.920> need<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.640> let<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:53.969> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you need to do is to let it on that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.720 
you need to do is to let it on that
space<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:59.100> you're<00:00:59.219> gonna<00:00:59.309> lift<00:00:59.550> up<00:01:01.010> on<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
space and you're gonna lift up on the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.890 
space and you're gonna lift up on the
plastic<00:01:03.329> piece<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:06.540> might<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
plastic piece here you might have to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.980 
plastic piece here you might have to
give<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> couple<00:01:07.380> shakes<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.810> then<00:01:12.810> it'll

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
give it a couple shakes and then it'll

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.649 
give it a couple shakes and then it'll
come<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.710> its<00:01:13.740> own<00:01:17.030> just<00:01:18.030> slide<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.450> back

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
come out on its own just slide it back

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.859 
come out on its own just slide it back
and<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:22.159> probably<00:01:23.159> some<00:01:23.869> chords

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and then I have probably some chords

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.560 
and then I have probably some chords
that<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.140> need<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> disconnect<00:01:26.420> might<00:01:27.420> off

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that you need to disconnect might off

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.539 
that you need to disconnect might off
the<00:01:27.720> bat<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:28.619> before<00:01:29.430> your

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the bat I see one before your

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:53.500 
the bat I see one before your
backlighting

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.220 

that's<00:01:54.510> disconnected<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:57.300> will<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:58.020> same

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
that's disconnected and will do the same

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:13.280 
that's disconnected and will do the same
for<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.620> bottom<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:12.300> last<00:02:12.570> but<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:12.990> need<00:02:13.170> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
for the bottom and last but we need to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.170 
for the bottom and last but we need to
look<00:02:13.440> at<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:19.730> which<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:21.030> can

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
look at is just here which we can

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.030 
look at is just here which we can
probably<00:02:21.420> get<00:02:21.780> away<00:02:21.840> with<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:24.950> flipping<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
probably get away with just flipping the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:37.250 
probably get away with just flipping the
two<00:02:26.750> over<00:02:27.750> like<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.930> can<00:02:37.080> just

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
two over like this and you can just

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.330 
two over like this and you can just
connect<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.739> I'm<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:39.770> now<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:40.920> two

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
connect it I'm here now you have two

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.900 
connect it I'm here now you have two
separate<00:02:41.700> units<00:02:42.080> in<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.230> main<00:02:43.440> unit<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.850> you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
separate units in the main unit and you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.699 
separate units in the main unit and you
have<00:02:45.060> your<00:02:45.209> screen<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:51.260> that's<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:52.440> there's

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
have your screen so that's like there's

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:00.890 
have your screen so that's like there's
two<00:02:53.190> four<00:02:57.230> one<00:02:58.640> two<00:02:59.640> three<00:02:59.880> four<00:03:00.209> five<00:03:00.630> six

right so I'm going to take these two
four<00:03:26.160> screws<00:03:26.489> out<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.060> see<00:03:27.420> what<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.660> problem

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
four screws out and see what the problem

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.600 
four screws out and see what the problem
is

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
is

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.330 
is
okay<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:30.470> that's<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:32.060> taking<00:03:33.060> apart<00:03:34.340> this

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
okay so that's it's taking apart this

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.360 
okay so that's it's taking apart this
capacitor<00:03:36.329> here<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.920> there's<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.190> one

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
capacitor here and there's that one

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.210 
capacitor here and there's that one
there<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:38.970> feel<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.870> one<00:03:40.079> he's<00:03:40.230> flat<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.130> this

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
there I feel this one he's flat and this

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.060 
there I feel this one he's flat and this
one's<00:03:41.430> concaved<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:43.140> was<00:03:43.230> round<00:03:43.530> at<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.829> top

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070

gonna<00:04:34.600> change<00:04:34.840> these<00:04:35.020> two<00:04:35.260> out<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:36.760> say<00:04:36.970> that

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
gonna change these two out and say that

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.300 
gonna change these two out and say that
it<00:04:37.270> works<00:04:37.530> then<00:04:38.530> we're<00:04:38.650> going<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.800> test<00:04:39.040> it<00:04:39.220> out

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
it works then we're going to test it out

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:57.980 
it works then we're going to test it out
see<00:04:39.790> if<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:40.000> works

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.370 

okay<00:04:58.650> so<00:04:58.710> we<00:04:58.949> have<00:04:59.130> more<00:04:59.280> issues<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.990> also

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
okay so we have more issues and also

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.810 
okay so we have more issues and also

gonna replace it and well the reason I
new<00:05:19.919> show<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.460> out<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.639> was<00:05:20.880> only<00:05:21.030> allowed<00:05:21.210> two

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
new show that out I was only allowed two

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.600 
new show that out I was only allowed two
capacitors<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.889> it<00:05:23.070> was<00:05:23.190> showing<00:05:23.400> a<00:05:23.580> short

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
capacitors and it was showing a short

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.180 
capacitors and it was showing a short
across<00:05:24.030> them<00:05:26.810> over<00:05:27.810> here<00:05:27.990> will<00:05:28.169> you<00:05:28.229> see<00:05:28.470> these

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
across them over here will you see these

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.540 
across them over here will you see these
this<00:05:29.639> hole<00:05:29.970> there<00:05:30.539> this<00:05:31.530> is<00:05:31.650> for<00:05:31.889> this<00:05:32.039> 12<00:05:32.400> volt

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
this hole there this is for this 12 volt

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.010 
this hole there this is for this 12 volt
regulator<00:05:33.030> would<00:05:33.590> well<00:05:34.970> this<00:05:35.970> chip<00:05:36.360> here<00:05:36.630> as

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
regulator would well this chip here as

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.420 
regulator would well this chip here as
you<00:05:37.110> can<00:05:37.139> see<00:05:37.259> it<00:05:37.590> it's<00:05:37.770> gonna<00:05:37.949> burnt<00:05:38.280> a<00:05:38.400> hole

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
you can see it it's gonna burnt a hole

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.210 
you can see it it's gonna burnt a hole
in<00:05:38.759> it<00:05:38.940> just<00:05:39.180> get<00:05:39.389> the<00:05:39.509> white<00:05:39.750> dot<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.440> this<00:05:41.070> is

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
in it just get the white dot and this is

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.839 
in it just get the white dot and this is
for<00:05:41.460> your<00:05:41.610> backlight<00:05:42.360> so<00:05:43.759> could<00:05:44.759> have

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
for your backlight so could have

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.170 
for your backlight so could have
replaced<00:05:45.150> this<00:05:45.690> as<00:05:46.410> well<00:05:46.800> when<00:05:47.610> we<00:05:47.669> take<00:05:47.970> the

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
replaced this as well when we take the

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.180 
replaced this as well when we take the
back<00:05:48.360> cover<00:05:48.389> off<00:05:48.930> and<00:05:49.380> you<00:05:49.470> see<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:49.919> this<00:05:50.130> is

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
back cover off and you see that this is

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.270 
back cover off and you see that this is
here<00:05:50.729> unless<00:05:51.120> your<00:05:51.560> electronic<00:05:52.560> technician

here unless your electronic technician
or<00:05:53.400> hobbyist<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:54.360> uses<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.229> home<00:05:55.410> user<00:05:55.740> don't

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
or hobbyist and uses the home user don't

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.610 
or hobbyist and uses the home user don't
bother<00:05:56.910> trying<00:05:57.240> to<00:05:57.330> replace<00:05:57.660> that<00:05:57.960> surface

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
bother trying to replace that surface

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.560 
bother trying to replace that surface
mount<00:05:58.860> it's<00:05:59.039> not<00:05:59.190> something<00:05:59.610> is<00:05:59.759> simple<00:06:00.060> to<00:06:00.360> a

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
mount it's not something is simple to a

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.870 
mount it's not something is simple to a
place<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:01.470> you<00:06:02.159> might<00:06:02.340> as<00:06:02.430> well<00:06:02.520> just<00:06:02.699> get<00:06:02.820> a

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
place and you might as well just get a

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.800 
place and you might as well just get a
new<00:06:03.060> monitor<00:06:03.389> so<00:06:04.349> if<00:06:04.470> you<00:06:04.590> see<00:06:04.770> the<00:06:04.979> chip<00:06:05.340> here

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
new monitor so if you see the chip here

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.990 
new monitor so if you see the chip here
glad<00:06:06.810> and<00:06:07.380> it<00:06:08.159> makes<00:06:08.430> the<00:06:08.520> decision<00:06:08.970> whether

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
glad and it makes the decision whether

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.969 
glad and it makes the decision whether
you<00:06:09.270> know<00:06:09.539> how<00:06:09.690> to<00:06:09.750> surface<00:06:10.229> mount<00:06:10.440> solder<00:06:10.979> and

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
you know how to surface mount solder and

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.469 
you know how to surface mount solder and
whether<00:06:13.979> it's<00:06:14.159> worth<00:06:14.400> it<00:06:14.550> to<00:06:14.729> you<00:06:14.760> to<00:06:15.180> go<00:06:15.300> any

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
whether it's worth it to you to go any

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.710 
whether it's worth it to you to go any
further<00:06:15.750> than<00:06:15.930> that

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
further than that

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.350 
further than that
well<00:06:18.720> that's<00:06:18.870> it<00:06:19.080> for<00:06:19.260> this<00:06:19.380> video<00:06:19.590> I<00:06:20.360> showed

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
well that's it for this video I showed

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.040
