00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.780
 good afternoon my name is ana char feng 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:09.709
 I am a certified lactation consultant 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:12.620
 internationally and from clc and I have a 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.450
 private consultation in the city of mexico 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.970
 Today I am going to tell you about the 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.160
 differences in the amount of fat that 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.039
 breast milk is depending on the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.529
 time is in the making 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.839
 when we breastfeed moss makes a 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.779
 couple of hours or a certain period of time 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.609
 time between one shot and the next the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.190
 milk accumulates little by little in the 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.710
 chest the first milk that will come out 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.539
 When the baby starts sucking, he will 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.780
 be a milk that has a 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:44.480
 lower fat concentration 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.519
 as the baby is taking the breast the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.430
 amount of milk fat is going 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.610
 increasing and at the end of the take already 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.010
 milk has enough fat this in 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.140
 reality would not have transcendence or 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.570
 important to comment if it were not 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.719
 because there are two situations that cause 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.970
 Anguish in the breast first is that 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.090
 Sometimes the mother when the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.299
 milk note that the color is transparent 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.759
 or bluish and you definitely do not see 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.220
 like cow's milk then mom 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.679
 may think that the milk that 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.310
 Your own milk is bad or it is not 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:24.960
 sufficiently nutritious nutritious 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.670
 then if the same mother 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.310
 extracts milk after having 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.860
 breastfed your baby or have been 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.530
 a good time breastfeeding is going to give 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.280
 account that milk is already seen not so 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.650
 transparent nor so blue but a little 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.100
 yellowish or definitely less 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.590
 transparent this what it proves is 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.180
 that our amount of fat from the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.170
 milk from the end of the shot is 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.909
 increased this actually causes 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.050
 anguish to moms because the only 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.690
 milk that we actually 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.630
 we observe is cow's milk and 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.690
 definitely human milk is so 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.229
 different from cow's milk as the 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.300
 women are different from cows 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.450
 to start human babies weigh 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.660
 approximately 9 kilos when fulfilling a 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.930
 year and calves per year 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.300
 approximately depending on the race 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.430
 They weigh half a ton because each milk 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.569
 is made to develop in a way 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.710
 optimum 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.380
 to that kind then good then 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.840
 It is good to know that our milk 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.960
 it's definitely never going to look like 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.270
 cow's milk is different and the other 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.610
 Which is why it's good to comment this 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.310
 amount of fat that is loading 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.970
 during the shot is because some moms 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.520
 are instructed to start 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.520
 breastfeed your baby for 10 minutes or 15 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.680
 and break the suction after it happened 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.710
 certain certain time like 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.320
 we comment and pass the baby to the other breast 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.050
 this in a baby that is already a little more 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.300
 big is not as important as 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.640
 in a newborn baby because a baby 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.400
 newborn is not so efficient for 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.100
 suck and it may be that ten or fifteen 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.230
 minutes is not enough time for 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.990
 that the baby reaches the milk that has 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.680
 more amount of fat then if 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.319
 we are 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.750
 breaking the suction of the first breast and 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.879
 passing the baby to the next breast before 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.859
 that the first one ends what we are 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.079
 doing is that our baby will be 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.060
 taking more milk with 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.819
 less fat it 's as if we 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.829
 we just had soup and never 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.319
 we will arrive at the stew and less at dessert 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.719
 then it may be that baby 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.060
 he is restless and does not feel 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.489
 satisfied or maybe it does not rise well 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.049
 that's why it's important to know the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.909
 amount of fat that our 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.909
 milk depending on the moment in the shot
