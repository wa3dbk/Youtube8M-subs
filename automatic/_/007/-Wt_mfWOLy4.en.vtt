pretty<00:05:05.990> interesting<00:05:06.199> to<00:05:06.580> this<00:05:07.870> one<00:05:08.870> this<00:05:09.440> one

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
pretty interesting to this one this one

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.369 
pretty interesting to this one this one
little<00:05:11.120> tiny<00:05:11.360> corner<00:05:11.780> I'm<00:05:11.960> guessing<00:05:12.289> they're

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
little tiny corner I'm guessing they're

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.490 
little tiny corner I'm guessing they're
gonna<00:05:12.440> make<00:05:12.680> this<00:05:12.770> whole<00:05:13.099> grey<00:05:14.090> background

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
gonna make this whole grey background

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.490 
gonna make this whole grey background
look<00:05:15.500> like<00:05:15.710> that<00:05:16.300> so<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:17.419> kind<00:05:17.629> of<00:05:17.719> blends<00:05:18.259> into

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
look like that so it kind of blends into

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.649 
look like that so it kind of blends into
the<00:05:18.590> jungle<00:05:19.190> theme<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:20.060> that<00:05:20.240> was<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.360> first

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
the jungle theme and that was the first

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.930 
the jungle theme and that was the first
time<00:05:20.810> we've<00:05:20.990> seen<00:05:21.169> that<00:05:21.400> anyway<00:05:22.400> so<00:05:22.789> that's

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
time we've seen that anyway so that's

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.119 
time we've seen that anyway so that's
your<00:05:23.180> conference<00:05:24.020> rumbling<00:05:24.289> let's<00:05:24.800> see<00:05:24.979> if<00:05:25.039> we

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:25.129 
your conference rumbling let's see if we

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.030 
your conference rumbling let's see if we
find<00:05:25.310> anything<00:05:25.520> else<00:05:25.819> interesting
