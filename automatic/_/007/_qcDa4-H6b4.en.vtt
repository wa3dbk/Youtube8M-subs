the<00:01:59.520> next<00:01:59.820> thing<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> last<00:02:00.780> thing<00:02:01.110> from

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the next thing the last thing from

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.789 
the next thing the last thing from
Chanel<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:03.409> Chanel

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
Chanel is the Chanel

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.190 
Chanel is the Chanel
ten<00:02:06.250> days<00:02:06.460> away<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:07.150> this<00:02:07.570> is<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.900> bronze

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
ten days away and this is the bronze

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.730 
ten days away and this is the bronze
Universal<00:02:09.750> bronzing<00:02:10.750> makeup<00:02:11.080> base<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.709> I

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
Universal bronzing makeup base so I

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.199 
Universal bronzing makeup base so I
think<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:12.220> kind<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.459> like<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.700> cream<00:02:12.970> bronzer

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
think it's kind of like a cream bronzer

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.300 
think it's kind of like a cream bronzer
but<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:13.990> guess<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.350> could<00:02:14.530> use<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.920> as<00:02:15.069> like<00:02:15.190> a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
but I guess you could use it as like a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.830 
but I guess you could use it as like a
base<00:02:15.490> for<00:02:15.730> your<00:02:15.790> powder<00:02:16.090> bronzer<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.720> I

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
base for your powder bronzer and I

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.410 
base for your powder bronzer and I
haven't<00:02:17.140> used<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.440> yet<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:18.310> cute<00:02:18.730> oh<00:02:19.150> my

okay I guess one's for your face I did

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.140 
okay I guess one's for your face I did
up<00:05:46.130> that<00:05:46.250> was<00:05:46.370> for<00:05:46.550> your<00:05:46.670> lips<00:05:46.850> you<00:05:46.940> know<00:05:46.970> what

up that was for your lips you know what
um<00:05:47.330> and<00:05:48.020> then<00:05:48.170> this<00:05:48.380> is<00:05:48.710> a<00:05:49.210> pure<00:05:50.210> rose<00:05:50.510> water

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
um and then this is a pure rose water

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.620 
um and then this is a pure rose water
spray<00:05:51.380> um<00:05:52.310> I<00:05:52.700> think<00:05:52.760> it's<00:05:53.000> kind<00:05:53.210> of<00:05:53.240> like<00:05:53.390> mac's

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
spray um I think it's kind of like mac's

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.290 
spray um I think it's kind of like mac's
fix+<00:05:54.320> so<00:05:54.590> it's<00:05:54.740> like<00:05:54.890> a<00:05:55.310> face<00:05:55.880> refresher

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300

so<00:07:02.900> this<00:07:03.080> first<00:07:03.380> one<00:07:05.170> looks<00:07:06.170> like<00:07:06.260> this<00:07:06.590> it<00:07:07.010> has

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
so this first one looks like this it has

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.100 
so this first one looks like this it has
like<00:07:07.550> the<00:07:07.670> teacher<00:07:07.910> guides<00:07:08.420> and<00:07:08.660> then<00:07:08.750> the<00:07:08.840> red

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
like the teacher guides and then the red

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.980 
like the teacher guides and then the red
and<00:07:09.440> then<00:07:10.070> that<00:07:10.310> um<00:07:10.670> my<00:07:11.210> school<00:07:11.450> colors<00:07:11.780> are

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
and then that um my school colors are

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.200 
and then that um my school colors are
red<00:07:12.410> white<00:07:13.280> and<00:07:13.460> blue<00:07:13.670> so<00:07:13.880> I<00:07:13.910> thought<00:07:14.090> this

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210 
red white and blue so I thought this

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.250 
red white and blue so I thought this
would<00:07:14.330> be<00:07:14.360> really<00:07:14.450> pretty<00:07:14.690> it<00:07:15.020> was<00:07:15.050> like<00:07:15.230> a

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260 
would be really pretty it was like a

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:21.490 
would be really pretty it was like a
white<00:07:15.500> tank<00:07:15.830> top<00:07:15.980> just<00:07:16.550> like<00:07:16.910> that<00:07:19.030> and<00:07:20.080> then<00:07:21.080> a

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500 
white tank top just like that and then a

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.190 
white tank top just like that and then a
lot<00:07:22.070> of<00:07:22.220> things<00:07:22.430> like<00:07:22.730> multi<00:07:23.270> strand<00:07:23.690> beaded

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.200 
lot of things like multi strand beaded

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.930 
lot of things like multi strand beaded
necklaces<00:07:24.680> are<00:07:24.920> really<00:07:25.220> in<00:07:25.370> for<00:07:25.640> summertime

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:25.940 
necklaces are really in for summertime

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.180 
necklaces are really in for summertime
and<00:07:26.330> then<00:07:26.870> you<00:07:26.990> look<00:07:27.140> great<00:07:27.410> again<00:07:27.830> was<00:07:28.040> like<00:07:28.160> a

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.190 
and then you look great again was like a

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.430 
and then you look great again was like a
simple<00:07:28.580> white<00:07:28.760> tank<00:07:28.970> top<00:07:29.090> um<00:07:29.600> so<00:07:29.990> this<00:07:30.110> one<00:07:30.290> is

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 
simple white tank top um so this one is

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.650 
simple white tank top um so this one is
more<00:07:30.470> of<00:07:30.920> a<00:07:31.040> like<00:07:31.280> turquoise<00:07:31.550> II<00:07:31.760> color<00:07:32.030> with
