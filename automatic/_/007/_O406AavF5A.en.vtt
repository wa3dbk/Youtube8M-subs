00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.529
 d 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.129
 determined 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.900
 and to the great lips as they are 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.610
 welcome on this occasion to a video 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.170
 more remember that I am your mature friend 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.000
 not good today is in a video 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.099
 quite interesting enough that no 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.200
 staff put me in good spirits with 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.390
 good wish that something is coming quite 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.099
 interesting and now and that is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.000
 some hours it leaked out there a 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.790
 enough information because it is not between 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.530
 yes that's not but well I think it's 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.200
 a pretty strong rumor and that's what 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.300
 it's been yesterday marcus software 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.670
 phoenix collection what does this mean 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.649
 this is going to be the remastering of the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.079
 gears of war 1 and software 2 george 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.710
 war 3 for xbox one that will be 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.800
 running 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.649
 well to full 60 pictures really something 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.989
 pretty cool 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.550
 So far it is not 100% safe 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.579
 of this information 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.820
 I want to clarify it but what is different 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.729
 this information to the previous ones by 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.970
 there also had already said this but 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.570
 like I was hesitating and this whole thing 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.270
 is that a few days ago phil spencer and 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.580
 they are retweet of a person 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.250
 about this 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.400
 and delivery phil spencer is the boss the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.770
 microsoft xbox manager this 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.420
 roll and he made a retweet 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.130
 which one I'm going to put here is in 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.410
 This whole subject is displayed so that 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.950
 you are quite aware I 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.040
 I think it is and if it has merits this 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.710
 true then it would come well already 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.660
 missing this for the saga of truth me without 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.960
 doubt it bought me the structure and 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.270
 let's go with the gears of war 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.650
 phoenix I collect good from marcus 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.990
 phoenix collection 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.180
 that's how until the day of s is done 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.800
 call this matter really quite 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.450
 interesting I'll be leaving you for 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.710
 here some images that you are going to 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.330
 be watching then so that 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.550
 as more or less an idea of what will 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.790
 all this I repeat is going to be running 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.489
 the game to what is being 1080p 60 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.630
 true pictures will be great I 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.670
 I think so and more apart as they are going to 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.209
 have all the content does not end with 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.920
 this is, if you have this disk 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.860
 this game, what he is going to do is that 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.300
 you will have all the content and for 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.760
 example all maps the years of war 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.380
 3 and all the maps of your software two 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.840
 from yesterday's software uno maps 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.180
 etcetera characters and all these things 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.060
 it's really quite interesting to them 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.680
 I repeat is a pretty information 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.200
 nice that we do not like him with 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.480
 good taste and to this day is a 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.489
 Rumor is not 100% confirmed yet 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.840
 but I tell you here I leave the images 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.940
 for you to get an idea is more 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.129
 concrete to the above information 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.050
 more then more than sure and good in 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.720
 Personally, I would like it a lot 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.459
 I really did not want anything wrong 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.220
 I believe that in order to still have a 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.379
 more time in what I do software 4 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.560
 that out there it's going to be coming out more 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.120
 or less in mid -2016 or related 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.890
 as in september october you know 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.319
 when they start doing these 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.420
 deliveries good up here the video from 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.040
 today, guys, I hope you guys have 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.069
 enjoyed the video they enjoyed 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.959
 this information personally so I 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.950
 it seems quite pretty nice to them 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.890
 I repeat I wish that true is not 100% 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.500
 but it confirmed what is being 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.900
 the retweet that this person gave to phil 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.680
 Spencer really because it leaves a lot that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.750
 really want and if you can do a 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.459
 little bit of accounts for sure 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.370
 more or less times I think this one 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.250
 it is well planned so that they can 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.620
 give time for him I software 4 I think 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.090
 we would fit very well at all 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.610
 he needs 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.550
 we need more jowhar content 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.290
