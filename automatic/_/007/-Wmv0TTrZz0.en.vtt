on the top of the list to go in

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.670 
on the top of the list to go in
hypothetically<00:00:34.080> what<00:00:34.320> would<00:00:34.470> have<00:00:34.559> been<00:00:34.620> your

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
hypothetically what would have been your

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.890 
hypothetically what would have been your
reaction<00:00:34.890> had<00:00:35.370> coach<00:00:35.640> tippet<00:00:36.059> pointed<00:00:36.720> to<00:00:36.809> you

reaction had coach tippet pointed to you
and<00:00:37.019> said<00:00:37.170> hey<00:00:37.199> Paul<00:00:37.470> get<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.739> goal<00:00:38.329> I'm<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and said hey Paul get in goal I'm a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.270 
and said hey Paul get in goal I'm a
pretty<00:00:39.630> good<00:00:39.780> athlete<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.920> used<00:00:41.130> to<00:00:41.220> play

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
pretty good athlete and I used to play

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060 
pretty good athlete and I used to play
soccer<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.290> probably<00:00:43.290> better<00:00:43.469> would<00:00:43.980> have

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
soccer so I probably better would have

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.590 
soccer so I probably better would have
been<00:00:44.160> outstanding<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.850> there

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
been outstanding in there

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.620 
been outstanding in there
I<00:00:45.660> mean<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.800> said<00:00:47.040> before<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.730> net<00:00:47.940> soccer

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
I mean like I said before the net soccer

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.940 
I mean like I said before the net soccer
net<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.930> probably<00:00:49.230> four<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:49.559> five<00:00:49.739> times

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
net is probably four or five times

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.869 
net is probably four or five times
bigger<00:00:50.280> than<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> hockey<00:00:51.360> net<00:00:51.890> so<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.579> it's

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
bigger than a hockey net so it's it's

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.410 
bigger than a hockey net so it's it's
physics

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
physics

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
physics
you<00:00:54.930> know<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.260> smaller<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.860> it'd<00:00:56.100> probably

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you know it's smaller so it'd probably

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.639 
you know it's smaller so it'd probably
be<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> lot<00:00:56.579> easier<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.230> like<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.320> said<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:58.620> just

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
be a lot easier and like I said I'm just

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.650 
be a lot easier and like I said I'm just
a<00:00:58.860> good<00:00:59.010> athlete<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.460> I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.450> would<00:01:00.570> have

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
a good athlete and I think I would have

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.029 
a good athlete and I think I would have
done<00:01:00.750> well<00:01:00.930> yeah<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> were<00:01:01.680> telling<00:01:01.980> us

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
done well yeah you were telling us

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.249 
done well yeah you were telling us
earlier<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.360> never<00:01:03.510> played<00:01:03.600> goal

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
earlier that you have never played goal

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.260 
earlier that you have never played goal
in<00:01:04.800> hockey<00:01:05.160> but<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.610> soccer<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.030> were<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
in hockey but in soccer you were a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.510 
in hockey but in soccer you were a
goalie<00:01:06.509> at<00:01:06.690> some<00:01:06.869> point<00:01:07.020> yeah<00:01:07.860> yeah<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
goalie at some point yeah yeah it's a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
goalie at some point yeah yeah it's a
pretty<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:08.789> soccer<00:01:09.390> goalie<00:01:09.690> growing<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
pretty good soccer goalie growing up and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.980 
pretty good soccer goalie growing up and
I<00:01:10.830> hung<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.459> the<00:01:11.550> cleats<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:12.179> a<00:01:12.209> young<00:01:12.450> age<00:01:12.479> but

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
I hung up the cleats at a young age but

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.279 
I hung up the cleats at a young age but
I<00:01:13.399> think<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.520> goaltending<00:01:15.179> blood<00:01:15.840> runs<00:01:16.080> deep

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
I think the goaltending blood runs deep

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.160 
I think the goaltending blood runs deep
so<00:01:16.709> I<00:01:16.740> still<00:01:17.490> got<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.819> I'm<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.569> chameleon<00:01:18.840> I

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so I still got it I'm a chameleon I

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.199 
so I still got it I'm a chameleon I
adapt<00:01:19.440> to<00:01:19.619> my<00:01:19.740> environment<00:01:20.060> what<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.149> you

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:21.209 
adapt to my environment what do you

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:22.850 
adapt to my environment what do you
think<00:01:21.390> about<00:01:21.479> goalies<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.990> general<00:01:22.349> Paul<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
think about goalies in general Paul it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.529 
think about goalies in general Paul it
takes<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> special<00:01:23.310> guy<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.729> play<00:01:24.060> goalie<00:01:24.300> in

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
takes a special guy to play goalie in

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.230 
takes a special guy to play goalie in
the<00:01:24.569> NHL<00:01:24.959> doesn't<00:01:25.319> it<00:01:25.410> yeah<00:01:26.220> most<00:01:26.849> of<00:01:27.000> them<00:01:27.060> are

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the NHL doesn't it yeah most of them are

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.210 
the NHL doesn't it yeah most of them are
weirdos<00:01:27.630> I'd<00:01:27.959> say<00:01:28.229> jason<00:01:28.649> labarbera<00:01:29.099> is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
weirdos I'd say jason labarbera is

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.850 
weirdos I'd say jason labarbera is
probably<00:01:29.750> one<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.899> most<00:01:30.990> normal<00:01:31.440> goalies

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
probably one of the most normal goalies

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.859 
probably one of the most normal goalies
I've<00:01:32.009> ever<00:01:32.190> played<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.819> think<00:01:32.970> mark<00:01:33.690> Andre
