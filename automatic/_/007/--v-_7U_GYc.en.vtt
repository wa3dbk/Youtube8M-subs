00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.789 

I<00:00:02.300> think<00:00:03.300> it's<00:00:03.449> it's<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.810> great<00:00:04.049> implementation

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
I think it's it's a great implementation

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.200 
I think it's it's a great implementation
you<00:00:04.950> know<00:00:05.040> identity<00:00:05.580> wise<00:00:05.759> we<00:00:06.060> see

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
you know identity wise we see

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.330 
you know identity wise we see
differentiation<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:07.200> manufacturers<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.099> think

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
differentiation to manufacturers I think

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.270 
differentiation to manufacturers I think
that<00:00:08.490> Chevy<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.880> rock<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.450> quite<00:00:09.990> awesome<00:00:10.530> it

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
that Chevy I rock it is quite awesome it

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.610 
that Chevy I rock it is quite awesome it
provides<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.969> bit<00:00:12.120> more<00:00:12.300> downforce<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.410> car

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
provides a bit more downforce on the car

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.300 
provides a bit more downforce on the car
and<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.549> actually<00:00:15.120> very<00:00:15.809> nice<00:00:16.199> addition<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and it's actually very nice addition the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.400 
and it's actually very nice addition the
car<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.609> definitely<00:00:17.760> quicker<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.199> little

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
car is definitely quicker it's a little

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.720 
car is definitely quicker it's a little
bit<00:00:19.529> more<00:00:19.680> stable<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.279> has<00:00:20.400> got<00:00:20.580> more

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
bit more stable it has got more

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.090 
bit more stable it has got more
downforce<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.439> challenge<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
downforce and so you can challenge the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.740 
downforce and so you can challenge the
car<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.400> change<00:00:23.699> yourself<00:00:24.090> even<00:00:24.330> more<00:00:24.390> so

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
car and change yourself even more so

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.160 
car and change yourself even more so
it's<00:00:25.380> all<00:00:25.590> pretty<00:00:26.010> positive<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.580> far<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:27.170> think

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
it's all pretty positive so far I think

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.790 
it's all pretty positive so far I think
there's<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.500> lot<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.890> positive<00:00:30.289> you<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.320> signs

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
there's a lot of positive you know signs

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
there's a lot of positive you know signs
of<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.460> need<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.969> able<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.930> use

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
of it we just need to be able to to use

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.770 
of it we just need to be able to to use
it<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:35.219> know<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> definitely<00:00:36.360> change

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
it you know we have to definitely change

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.119 
it you know we have to definitely change
a<00:00:36.899> lot<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.140> our<00:00:37.260> stuff<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.739> we're<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> little

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
a lot of our stuff and we're a little

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.299 
a lot of our stuff and we're a little
late<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.579> game<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.800> every<00:00:40.800> hour<00:00:41.160> counts

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
late in the game but every hour counts

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.880 
late in the game but every hour counts
right<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:41.989> you<00:00:42.989> know<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> technical<00:00:43.559> side<00:00:43.770> is

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
right now you know a technical side is

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979 
right now you know a technical side is
really<00:00:44.160> exciting<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.610> fun<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
really exciting and fun to see the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
really exciting and fun to see the
changes<00:00:46.140> fun<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.710> work<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.100> changes<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
changes fun to work with the changes I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.660 
changes fun to work with the changes I
think<00:00:47.850> right<00:00:48.030> now<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.530> drivability<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.399> maybe

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
think right now the drivability is maybe

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540 
think right now the drivability is maybe
more<00:00:50.789> adaptive<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.020> driver<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:53.100> nice<00:00:53.340> i

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
more adaptive to the driver it's nice i

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.160 
more adaptive to the driver it's nice i
think<00:00:53.760> definitely<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.480> Chevy<00:00:54.719> side<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> have

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
think definitely the Chevy side to have

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.720 
think definitely the Chevy side to have
the<00:00:55.289> tools<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.620> try<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.190> know<00:00:56.219> manipulate

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the tools to try and you know manipulate

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.819 
the tools to try and you know manipulate
the<00:00:56.850> car<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> maybe<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.320> more<00:00:58.590> dull<00:00:58.800> than

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the car and maybe get it more dull than

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.979 
the car and maybe get it more dull than
per<00:00:59.219> driver<00:00:59.489> you<00:01:00.210> know<00:01:00.300> between<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
per driver you know between all the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.049 
per driver you know between all the
solutions<00:01:01.289> mechanical<00:01:02.250> platform<00:01:02.820> solutions

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
solutions mechanical platform solutions

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.050 
solutions mechanical platform solutions
that<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.840> use<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.920> chassis<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.549> now

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that you can use on the chassis and now

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.260 
that you can use on the chassis and now
on<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> arrow<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:08.159> are<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:09.240> more

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
on the arrow it's a there are a lot more

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.789 
on the arrow it's a there are a lot more
than<00:01:09.510> one<00:01:09.810> way<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.530> thing<00:01:10.740> go

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
than one way to make that thing go

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
than one way to make that thing go
around<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.610> go<00:01:11.729> fast<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
around and go fast so you just have to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.670 
around and go fast so you just have to
pick<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> best<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
pick the best one and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.060 
pick the best one and
that<00:01:15.550> are<00:01:15.700> picking<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.450> choosing<00:01:16.720> but<00:01:17.410> it's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
that are picking and choosing but it's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.450 
that are picking and choosing but it's
the<00:01:18.190> challenge<00:01:18.640> of<00:01:18.730> it<00:01:18.850> all<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:19.210> lot<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.810> grip

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the challenge of it all a lot of grip

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.290 
the challenge of it all a lot of grip
obviously<00:01:21.460> I<00:01:21.490> mean<00:01:21.670> it's<00:01:21.790> just<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:22.000> lot<00:01:22.120> more

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
obviously I mean it's just a lot more

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.740 
obviously I mean it's just a lot more
downforce<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:24.130> know<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:24.520> cars<00:01:24.820> are<00:01:25.090> just<00:01:25.540> for

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
downforce you know so cars are just for

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.870 
downforce you know so cars are just for
us<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:26.050> everywhere<00:01:26.620> everywhere<00:01:27.370> on<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.640> break

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
us to everywhere everywhere on the break

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.480 
us to everywhere everywhere on the break
in<00:01:28.120> the<00:01:28.150> middle<00:01:28.300> of<00:01:28.450> corners<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:30.250> pretty

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
in the middle of corners it's pretty

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.040 
in the middle of corners it's pretty
physical<00:01:30.970> it's<00:01:31.090> amazing<00:01:31.600> actually<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:31.900> look

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
physical it's amazing actually I look

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.740 
physical it's amazing actually I look
pretty<00:01:32.229> cool<00:01:32.440> to<00:01:32.680> go<00:01:32.830> watch<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:34.150> into<00:01:34.570> turn

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
pretty cool to go watch here into turn

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.570 
pretty cool to go watch here into turn
one<00:01:35.020> standing<00:01:35.650> right<00:01:35.770> next<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:36.010> track<00:01:36.340> man

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
one standing right next to track man

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.390 
one standing right next to track man
they<00:01:36.760> look<00:01:36.940> so<00:01:37.240> fast<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.869> they<00:01:38.260> are<00:01:38.410> fast

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
they look so fast and they are fast

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.430 
they look so fast and they are fast
it<00:01:41.000> is<00:01:41.120> more<00:01:41.330> physical<00:01:41.810> because<00:01:41.960> there's<00:01:42.260> more

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
it is more physical because there's more

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.200 
it is more physical because there's more
load<00:01:42.650> on<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.830> car<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.490> cornering<00:01:43.910> speeds

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
load on the car so the cornering speeds

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.550 
load on the car so the cornering speeds
are<00:01:44.390> higher<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.080> steering<00:01:45.410> wheels

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
are higher so the steering wheels

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.280 
are higher so the steering wheels
heavier<00:01:46.010> you<00:01:46.490> brake<00:01:47.030> deeper<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:48.110> know<00:01:48.230> you

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
heavier you brake deeper so you know you

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.040 
heavier you brake deeper so you know you
give<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.590> full<00:01:48.800> emojis<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.490> yeah<00:01:50.480> it's<00:01:50.870> gonna

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
give you full emojis and yeah it's gonna

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.200 
give you full emojis and yeah it's gonna
take<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> toll<00:01:51.770> on<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.010> drivers<00:01:52.370> but<00:01:52.580> you<00:01:53.120> know

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
take a toll on the drivers but you know

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.170 
take a toll on the drivers but you know
that's<00:01:53.750> why<00:01:53.870> we<00:01:54.020> get<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.290> big<00:01:54.440> box<00:01:54.620> I<00:01:54.770> guess

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
that's why we get the big box I guess

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.280 
that's why we get the big box I guess
good<00:01:56.180> for<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.450> fans<00:01:56.660> you<00:01:56.900> know<00:01:56.960> if<00:01:57.200> the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
good for the fans you know if the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.080 
good for the fans you know if the
visibility<00:01:57.830> cause<00:01:58.040> different<00:01:58.580> in<00:01:58.730> a<00:01:58.790> between

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
visibility cause different in a between

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.880 
visibility cause different in a between
two<00:01:59.240> manufacturers<00:01:59.870> erythema<00:02:00.560> same

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
two manufacturers erythema same

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.320 
two manufacturers erythema same
manufacture<00:02:01.490> like<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.850> said<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.150> error

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
manufacture like I said the error

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.760 
manufacture like I said the error
configuration<00:02:02.930> could<00:02:03.110> be<00:02:03.200> different<00:02:03.650> and

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
configuration could be different and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.220 
configuration could be different and
that's<00:02:04.220> its<00:02:04.520> mixture<00:02:05.030> of<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.330> challenge<00:02:06.020> for

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
that's its mixture of a challenge for

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.380 
that's its mixture of a challenge for
the<00:02:06.380> engineering<00:02:07.010> for<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.670> drivers<00:02:08.060> going<00:02:08.270> to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
the engineering for the drivers going to

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.330 
the engineering for the drivers going to
be<00:02:08.479> nothing<00:02:08.750> really<00:02:09.200> different<00:02:09.350> as<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:10.160> know

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
be nothing really different as you know

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.100 
be nothing really different as you know
is<00:02:10.399> wrong<00:02:10.550> with<00:02:10.700> your<00:02:10.970> party<00:02:11.420> taking<00:02:11.780> behind

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
is wrong with your party taking behind

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.949 
is wrong with your party taking behind
to<00:02:12.230> be<00:02:12.350> honest<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:13.040> i<00:02:13.250> think<00:02:13.520> this<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.750> could

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
to be honest but i think this this could

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.170 
to be honest but i think this this could
bring<00:02:15.200> another<00:02:15.380> new<00:02:15.850> interest<00:02:16.850> will<00:02:17.060> be

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
bring another new interest will be

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.910 
bring another new interest will be
authorities<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.140> certainly<00:02:18.740> I<00:02:18.830> think

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
authorities and certainly I think

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.730 
authorities and certainly I think
everybody<00:02:19.400> really<00:02:19.700> excited<00:02:20.230> it's<00:02:21.230> exciting

racing but wherefore when see and it's
just<00:02:32.480> testing<00:02:32.870> we<00:02:33.380> won't<00:02:33.530> really<00:02:33.680> get<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.890> good
