00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
winning a world championship under your

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.499 
winning a world championship under your
guidance<00:00:08.340> what's<00:00:09.210> your<00:00:09.360> take<00:00:09.570> on<00:00:09.719> all<00:00:09.870> this

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.150 
guidance what's your take on all this
well<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.570> think<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.929> takes<00:00:13.110> time<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.440> develop<00:00:13.650> a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
well I think it takes time to develop a

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.939 
well I think it takes time to develop a
team<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.420> know<00:00:15.570> those<00:00:16.049> two<00:00:16.320> guys<00:00:16.500> are

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
team and you know those two guys are

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.849 
team and you know those two guys are
great<00:00:17.850> guys<00:00:18.029> first<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.840> all<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> think<00:00:19.350> they're

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
great guys first of all I think they're

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.029 
great guys first of all I think they're
they're<00:00:20.250> both<00:00:20.490> really<00:00:20.789> good<00:00:20.939> leaders<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
they're both really good leaders and

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.990 
they're both really good leaders and
obviously<00:00:23.039> they're<00:00:23.430> two<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.789> best

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
obviously they're two of the best

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.950 
obviously they're two of the best
players<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.840> planet<00:00:25.199> but<00:00:26.539> it<00:00:27.539> takes<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
players on this planet but it takes a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.839 
players on this planet but it takes a
while<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.500> don't<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.830> put<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.220> uniforms

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
when you don't have resources you know

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.200 
when you don't have resources you know
they<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.860> resources<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
they have resources they just have to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
they have resources they just have to
you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.840> learn<00:01:19.080> how<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.409> use<00:01:19.500> their

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you know learn how to use their

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.130 
you know learn how to use their
resources<00:01:20.100> together<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.390> Eric's<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.960> heck<00:01:22.110> of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
resources together and Eric's a heck of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.670 
resources together and Eric's a heck of
a<00:01:22.380> coach<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:24.360> know<00:01:24.450> he'll<00:01:24.930> figure<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
a coach and you know he'll figure that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
a coach and you know he'll figure that
out<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:26.100> his<00:01:26.130> staff<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.210> think<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.020> takes

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
out with his staff but I think it takes

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.260 
out with his staff but I think it takes
more<00:01:28.380> than<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.100> coaching<00:01:29.549> staff<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.060> takes

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
more than is to coaching staff it takes

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.230 
more than is to coaching staff it takes
the<00:01:30.479> commitment<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.740> entire<00:01:32.100> group<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the commitment of the entire group the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.960 
the commitment of the entire group the
players<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> coaches<00:01:34.579> warning<00:01:35.579> together

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
players and the coaches warning together

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.910 
players and the coaches warning together
and<00:01:36.270> trying<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.600> find<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.049> best<00:01:37.079> possible<00:01:37.500> way

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and trying to find the best possible way

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.640 
and trying to find the best possible way
to<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:39.060> use<00:01:39.240> their<00:01:39.479> talents<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.229> they'll

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
to to use their talents but they'll

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.050 
to to use their talents but they'll

fantastic for our Olympic team but
it's<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.940> different<00:02:15.300> set<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.630> circumstances

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
it's a different set of circumstances

it's a different set of circumstances
and<00:02:16.830> again<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.640> just<00:02:17.850> takes<00:02:18.090> time<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.420> figure

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
and again it just takes time to figure

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.170 
and again it just takes time to figure
it<00:02:19.080> out<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.560> they're<00:02:20.130> playing<00:02:20.400> against<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.000> lot
