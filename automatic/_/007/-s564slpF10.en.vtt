00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.610 

okay<00:00:06.340> now<00:00:06.790> those<00:00:07.029> tanks<00:00:07.660> are<00:00:07.810> also<00:00:07.990> pretty<00:00:08.380> old

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
okay now those tanks are also pretty old

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.890 
okay now those tanks are also pretty old
so<00:00:09.160> we<00:00:09.340> really<00:00:09.700> can't<00:00:09.940> think<00:00:10.150> about<00:00:10.270> reusing

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
so we really can't think about reusing

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.810 
so we really can't think about reusing
those<00:00:11.020> vintage<00:00:11.830> tanks<00:00:12.340> aren't<00:00:12.549> good<00:00:12.670> they<00:00:12.790> are

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
those vintage tanks aren't good they are

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.450 
those vintage tanks aren't good they are
not<00:00:12.940> good<00:00:13.389> so<00:00:14.019> what<00:00:14.200> we've<00:00:14.349> got<00:00:14.559> for<00:00:14.800> you<00:00:14.889> is<00:00:15.130> a

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
not good so what we've got for you is a

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.220 
not good so what we've got for you is a
different<00:00:15.730> style<00:00:16.180> of<00:00:16.390> tank<00:00:16.660> it's<00:00:17.050> pretty

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
different style of tank it's pretty

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.050 
different style of tank it's pretty
interesting<00:00:17.500> comes<00:00:17.800> to<00:00:17.890> us<00:00:18.009> from<00:00:18.070> Europe<00:00:18.460> the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
interesting comes to us from Europe the

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.660 
interesting comes to us from Europe the
outer<00:00:19.240> tank<00:00:19.689> is<00:00:19.900> galvanized<00:00:20.529> steel<00:00:20.890> and<00:00:21.220> that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
outer tank is galvanized steel and that

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.279 
outer tank is galvanized steel and that
won't<00:00:21.880> rust<00:00:22.150> but<00:00:22.449> the<00:00:22.539> outer<00:00:22.690> tank<00:00:22.990> is<00:00:23.109> not

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
won't rust but the outer tank is not

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.189 
won't rust but the outer tank is not
what<00:00:23.500> holds<00:00:23.619> the<00:00:23.859> oil<00:00:24.660> I've<00:00:25.660> got<00:00:25.840> a<00:00:25.869> cutaway

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
what holds the oil I've got a cutaway

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.090 
what holds the oil I've got a cutaway
here<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:28.029> inner<00:00:28.210> tank<00:00:28.570> is<00:00:29.050> a<00:00:29.109> polyethylene<00:00:29.769> a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
here the inner tank is a polyethylene a

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.790 
here the inner tank is a polyethylene a
plastic<00:00:30.820> tank<00:00:31.090> it<00:00:31.689> will<00:00:31.869> not<00:00:32.080> rust<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:32.650> so

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
plastic tank it will not rust and so

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.830 
plastic tank it will not rust and so
it'll<00:00:33.010> last<00:00:33.129> a<00:00:33.340> long<00:00:33.550> time<00:00:33.790> so<00:00:34.330> this<00:00:34.570> week

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
it'll last a long time so this week

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.150 
it'll last a long time so this week
let's<00:00:35.199> go<00:00:35.290> catch<00:00:35.500> that's<00:00:35.710> right<00:00:35.890> this<00:00:36.040> is<00:00:36.100> a

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
let's go catch that's right this is a

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.830 
let's go catch that's right this is a
second<00:00:36.460> line<00:00:36.580> of<00:00:36.610> defense<00:00:36.970> got<00:00:37.269> it<00:00:37.449> now<00:00:37.630> before

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
second line of defense got it now before

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.150 
second line of defense got it now before
we<00:00:37.989> can<00:00:38.110> think<00:00:38.290> about<00:00:38.530> putting<00:00:38.680> these<00:00:38.829> tanks

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
we can think about putting these tanks

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.130 
we can think about putting these tanks
in<00:00:39.309> though<00:00:39.550> we<00:00:39.850> have<00:00:40.000> to<00:00:40.149> get<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.480> old<00:00:40.630> tanks

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
in though we have to get the old tanks

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.170 
in though we have to get the old tanks
out<00:00:41.290> and<00:00:41.530> they<00:00:41.649> are<00:00:41.770> filled<00:00:41.980> with<00:00:42.100> oil<00:00:42.340> so<00:00:43.030> for

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
out and they are filled with oil so for

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.990 
out and they are filled with oil so for
that<00:00:43.270> we<00:00:43.390> called<00:00:43.629> an<00:00:43.780> expert<00:00:44.140> Kevin<00:00:44.410> hog<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:45.070> an

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
that we called an expert Kevin hog is an

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.190 
that we called an expert Kevin hog is an
expert<00:00:46.360> of<00:00:46.450> such<00:00:46.600> thing<00:00:46.809> say<00:00:46.960> Kevin<00:00:49.140> why<00:00:50.140> do

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
expert of such thing say Kevin why do

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.979 
expert of such thing say Kevin why do
these<00:00:50.559> tanks<00:00:51.010> have<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.280> go<00:00:51.399> well<00:00:52.149> Liz<00:00:52.450> these

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
these tanks have to go well Liz these

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.619 
these tanks have to go well Liz these
tanks<00:00:53.500> are<00:00:53.620> made<00:00:53.980> of<00:00:54.100> steel<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.550> they're<00:00:55.539> at

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
tanks are made of steel and they're at

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.540 
tanks are made of steel and they're at
least<00:00:55.809> I'd<00:00:56.350> say<00:00:56.620> these<00:00:56.800> tanks<00:00:57.070> are<00:00:57.160> 40<00:00:57.520> years

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
least I'd say these tanks are 40 years

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.610 
least I'd say these tanks are 40 years
old<00:00:57.879> so<00:00:58.300> what's<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.660> life<00:00:58.899> expectancy<00:00:59.590> of

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
old so what's the life expectancy of

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.260 
old so what's the life expectancy of
these<00:00:59.890> tanks<00:01:00.219> well<00:01:00.640> generally<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.149> life

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
these tanks well generally the life

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.689 
these tanks well generally the life
expectancy<00:01:01.750> is<00:01:01.870> 2025<00:01:02.829> years<00:01:03.010> on<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.250> steel<00:01:03.430> tank

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
expectancy is 2025 years on a steel tank

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.240 
expectancy is 2025 years on a steel tank
but<00:01:04.570> there<00:01:04.780> with<00:01:05.110> what<00:01:05.410> happens<00:01:05.710> is<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.039> vent

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
but there with what happens is the vent

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.279 
but there with what happens is the vent
of<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.580> vent<00:01:06.729> alarm<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.539> vent<00:01:07.750> allows<00:01:08.140> the

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
of the vent alarm the vent allows the

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:09.450 
of the vent alarm the vent allows the
condensation<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.800> get<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:09.009> through<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.190> tank

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
condensation to get in through the tank

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.950 
condensation to get in through the tank
into<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.150> tank<00:01:10.420> it<00:01:10.570> creates<00:01:10.869> some

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
into the tank it creates some

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.480 
into the tank it creates some
condensation<00:01:11.229> and<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:12.040> corrodes<00:01:12.280> from<00:01:12.430> the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
condensation and it corrodes from the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.399 
condensation and it corrodes from the
bottom<00:01:12.760> once<00:01:12.939> you<00:01:13.060> have<00:01:13.330> air<00:01:13.689> and<00:01:13.720> water<00:01:14.170> in

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
bottom once you have air and water in

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.840 
bottom once you have air and water in
there<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.710> can<00:01:14.830> rock<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.220> steel<00:01:15.430> tank<00:01:15.670> away

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
there it can rock the steel tank away

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.730 
there it can rock the steel tank away
you<00:01:16.240> can't<00:01:16.479> see<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:16.990> from<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.439> outside

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
you can't see that from the outside

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.410 
you can't see that from the outside
necessarily<00:01:18.400> so<00:01:18.729> what<00:01:18.909> are<00:01:18.970> we<00:01:19.030> gonna<00:01:19.150> do<00:01:19.330> to

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
necessarily so what are we gonna do to

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.420 
necessarily so what are we gonna do to
get<00:01:19.540> these<00:01:19.659> out<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:19.960> here<00:01:20.049> well<00:01:20.439> we<00:01:20.890> have<00:01:21.040> half

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
get these out of here well we have half

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.890 
get these out of here well we have half
a<00:01:21.460> tank<00:01:21.580> of<00:01:21.850> oil<00:01:22.000> approximately<00:01:22.479> in<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.570> tank

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
a tank of oil approximately in the tank

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.130 
a tank of oil approximately in the tank
and<00:01:23.140> actually<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.830> Luas<00:01:24.070> here<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.520> going<00:01:24.790> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and actually the Luas here is going to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.950 
and actually the Luas here is going to
remove<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.320> plug<00:01:26.500> from<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.740> top<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.189> tank

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
remove the plug from the top of the tank

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960 
remove the plug from the top of the tank
and<00:01:28.960> we'll<00:01:29.470> insert<00:01:29.860> a<00:01:30.130> suction<00:01:30.549> tube<00:01:30.700> down

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
and we'll insert a suction tube down

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.230 
and we'll insert a suction tube down
into<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.240> tank<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.770> we'll<00:01:33.549> pump<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.850> oil<00:01:33.909> out

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
into the tank and we'll pump the oil out

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.800 
into the tank and we'll pump the oil out
into<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.600> truck<00:01:34.869> that's<00:01:35.049> outside

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
into a truck that's outside

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.690 
into a truck that's outside
okay<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.860> your<00:01:37.950> suction<00:01:38.190> hose<00:01:38.520> right

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
okay this is your suction hose right

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.859 
okay this is your suction hose right
here<00:01:38.760> it<00:01:39.030> looks<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.420> got<00:01:39.570> some<00:01:39.600> pretty

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
here it looks like it's got some pretty

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.950

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
tank where does it go from here from

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.870 
tank where does it go from here from
here<00:02:30.600> once<00:02:31.019> your<00:02:31.170> tanks<00:02:31.560> are<00:02:31.709> installed<00:02:32.160> it'll

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
here once your tanks are installed it'll

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.670 
here once your tanks are installed it'll
be<00:02:32.970> pumped<00:02:33.300> back<00:02:33.450> into<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.840> basement<00:02:34.230> into

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
be pumped back into the basement into

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.320 
be pumped back into the basement into
the<00:02:34.800> tank<00:02:35.130> new<00:02:35.280> tanks<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.819> it'll<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.120> clean

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
the tank new tanks and it'll be clean

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.280 
the tank new tanks and it'll be clean
great<00:02:38.180> alright<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.330> all<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.720> oil<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.110> gone

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
great alright so all the oil is gone

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.720 
great alright so all the oil is gone
from<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.590> tanks<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.100> noticed<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.489> pipes

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
from the tanks and I noticed the pipes

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.060 
from the tanks and I noticed the pipes
are<00:02:41.970> cut<00:02:42.150> away<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.450> what's<00:02:42.810> next<00:02:42.989> what<00:02:43.980> we

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
are cut away so what's next what we

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.199 
are cut away so what's next what we
should<00:02:44.250> we're<00:02:44.400> ready<00:02:44.549> to<00:02:44.640> stay<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.970> tank

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
should we're ready to stay in the tank

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.120 
should we're ready to stay in the tank
up<00:02:45.420> now<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:45.900> why<00:02:46.019> do<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.140> do<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.410> well

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
up now so why do you do that well

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.560 
up now so why do you do that well
because<00:02:47.280> there's<00:02:47.549> tank<00:02:47.790> bottom<00:02:48.120> sludge<00:02:48.390> at

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
because there's tank bottom sludge at

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.310 
because there's tank bottom sludge at
the<00:02:48.660> bottom<00:02:48.959> here

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
the bottom here

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.530 
the bottom here
yeah<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.640> basically<00:02:50.940> an<00:02:51.060> accumulation

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
yeah and it's basically an accumulation

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.870 
yeah and it's basically an accumulation
of<00:02:51.720> particles<00:02:52.110> over<00:02:52.590> 40<00:02:52.920> years<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.400> some

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
of particles over 40 years and some

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.280 
of particles over 40 years and some
condensation<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:54.600> forth<00:02:54.840> because<00:02:55.140> it's

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
condensation and so forth because it's

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.690 
condensation and so forth because it's
proximately<00:02:55.590> five<00:02:55.799> gallons<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.310> sludge<00:02:56.519> in

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
proximately five gallons of sludge in

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.759 
proximately five gallons of sludge in
there<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.480> need<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.690> open<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.049> top<00:02:58.260> with

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
there and we need to open the top with

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.400 
there and we need to open the top with
this<00:02:58.920> trunk<00:02:59.160> nibbler

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
this trunk nibbler

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.810 
this trunk nibbler
once<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.530> tank<00:03:02.740> is<00:03:02.860> cut<00:03:03.040> in<00:03:03.100> half<00:03:03.130> we<00:03:03.700> can

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
once this tank is cut in half we can

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.250 
once this tank is cut in half we can
remove<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.210> lot<00:03:04.360> easier

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.990 

it's<00:03:11.739> important<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.099> use<00:03:12.190> this<00:03:12.280> non-sparking

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
it's important to use this non-sparking

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.760 
it's important to use this non-sparking
cutting<00:03:13.270> tool<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.230> events<00:03:14.319> someone

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
cutting tool so that the events someone

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.050 
cutting tool so that the events someone
has<00:03:14.860> put<00:03:15.069> something<00:03:15.280> into<00:03:15.519> this<00:03:15.610> tank<00:03:15.879> that's

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
has put something into this tank that's

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.729 
has put something into this tank that's
flammable<00:03:16.450> explosive<00:03:16.690> we<00:03:17.410> won't<00:03:17.620> have<00:03:17.709> a

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
flammable explosive we won't have a

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:30.070 
flammable explosive we won't have a
problem

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.890 

that<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.710> quite<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:30.980> machine<00:03:31.360> this<00:03:32.360> top<00:03:32.660> half

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
that is quite a machine this top half

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.430 
that is quite a machine this top half
weighs<00:03:33.140> 150<00:03:33.860> pounds<00:03:34.420> alone<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.720> can<00:03:36.170> see<00:03:36.320> why

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
weighs 150 pounds alone I can see why

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.720 
weighs 150 pounds alone I can see why
you'd<00:03:36.590> want<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.800> get<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:37.040> out<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.310> at<00:03:37.430> least

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
you'd want to get this out in at least

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.360
