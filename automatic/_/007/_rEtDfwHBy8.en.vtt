00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
so as I get to this and hopefully middle

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.760 
so as I get to this and hopefully middle
age<00:01:42.340> I'm<00:01:43.240> starting<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.660> understand<00:01:44.260> and<00:01:44.620> I

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
some of the things that I think are

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.900 
some of the things that I think are
challenges<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:00.550> particularly<00:02:01.950> time<00:02:02.950> right

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
challenges and particularly time right

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.870 
challenges and particularly time right
it's<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:05.320> very<00:02:05.440> difficult<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.700> more

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
it's it's very difficult the more

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.669 
it's it's very difficult the more
complex<00:02:07.300> our<00:02:07.540> lives<00:02:07.750> get<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.110> find<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.470> time

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
complex our lives get to find the time

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.699
