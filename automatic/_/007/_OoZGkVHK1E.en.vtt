00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello, this is a small year 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.970
 Ronda with his riddle about the wireless dash 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.259
 Ausly riddles were following us 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.730
 needed u had to click on 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.429
 single button on command 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.950
 blocks and spawn wool of any color and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.630
 wooden button on it in case of a miss 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.730
 the rooms we needed to write in the chat 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.890
 that we lost and case successfully 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.820
 hitting the button we need to enroll 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.230
 what we won 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.410
 well and i do more innovation to us 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.660
 also one diamond is issued and if 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.500
 talk about how this system works 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.210
 then I tried to do it as much as possible 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.380
 let's say so compressed that is only sortsy 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.250
 just got the size 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.809
 again by five on three blocks like this and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.329
 now we will try to explain 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.070
 try to thread how it works by 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.559
 click on this button we add 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.270
 to moms system scoreboard team under 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.140
 star name i.e. corpore teams and 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.300
 start here further this command deletes here 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 in this place by the standard flasher 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.320
 through the hopper that is like that through the block 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.660
 it flashes and in this it is a one-piece 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.760
 deleted and if the command was created and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.170
 successfully removed then lights up here 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.360
 comparator a and spawn black wool and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.220
 wooden button here in this place 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.040
 is centered further if we are successful 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 archery and onion got 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.100
 certain damages ie at 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.610
 a shot if alpari admits poher 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.750
 certain damage is trying 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.409
 There is an attempt to remove this bow with 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.350
 damages 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.439
 if onions with childbirth damage to one 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 deleted then block the comparator and us 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.970
 absolutely new 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.900
 fresh onions and gave the signal goes here and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.670
 so the solution is well , if we missed 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.110
 that is, the signal here quietly passes and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.420
 start spelled loser 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.820
 However, if we successfully hit the button 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.630
 which is right here this one 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.670
 button activates redstone further to us 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.729
 the text is written on 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.680
 that we have won further completely 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.110
 This time Tom is removed from this place 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 that is a signal to command a loser go 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.770
 just can not further through 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.380
 big-big delay through non-version 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.540
 we will spawn again in this place 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.220
 through from the command block here this one 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.110
 redstone back i have a lake command 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.910
 just something didn't work through 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.990
 a little girl delay here here 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.810
 after the button 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.540
 we have completely removed the button itself and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.790
 black wool and here here's the bottom 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.340
 we get a diamond 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.320
 the system is pretty simple I saw you 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.660
 many solutions and decided 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.910
 just put your own children 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.010
 I liked the devices 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.060
 it is difficult and my so that's all 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.510
 Thank you for your attention and see you soon 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.510
 until
