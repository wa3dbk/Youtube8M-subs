this<00:00:02.430> is<00:00:02.639> my<00:00:03.410> 2002<00:00:05.420> f-150<00:00:06.950> cargo<00:00:07.950> dump<00:00:08.490> truck<00:00:08.790> I

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
this is my 2002 f-150 cargo dump truck I

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.900 
this is my 2002 f-150 cargo dump truck I
built<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.289> for<00:00:10.400> scrapping<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.730> other

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
built this for scrapping and other

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.749 
built this for scrapping and other
things<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.959> make<00:00:13.139> life<00:00:13.379> a<00:00:13.469> little<00:00:13.619> easier<00:00:14.070> I'm

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
things to make life a little easier I'm

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.460 
things to make life a little easier I'm
going<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.419> demonstrate<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.080> dumping

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
going to demonstrate the dumping

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.950 
going to demonstrate the dumping
mechanism<00:00:17.480> as<00:00:18.920> I<00:00:19.920> approach<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:21.330> components

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
mechanism as I approach the components

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.410 
mechanism as I approach the components
are<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:25.680> pump<00:00:26.780> will<00:00:27.780> disconnect<00:00:29.420> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
are the pump will disconnect and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.670 
are the pump will disconnect and
disconnect<00:00:31.820> for<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> switch<00:00:33.320> that<00:00:34.320> way<00:00:34.500> no

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
disconnect for the switch that way no

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.890 
disconnect for the switch that way no
one<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.040> actually<00:00:36.030> use<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.630> prevent

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
one can actually use it and prevent

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.260 
one can actually use it and prevent

runs inside to a separate battery the
switch<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.600> this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> dump<00:00:58.110> assembly<00:00:58.530> in

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
switch and this is the dump assembly in

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:07.880 
switch and this is the dump assembly in
action

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.300 

this<00:01:08.490> unit<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.880> capable<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.450> lifting<00:01:10.310> five

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
this unit is capable of lifting five

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270 
this unit is capable of lifting five
tons<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.330> way<00:01:12.510> too<00:01:12.540> much<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.280> f150

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
tons but that's way too much for f150

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.590 
tons but that's way too much for f150
the<00:01:15.090> most<00:01:15.300> I<00:01:15.510> lift<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:17.600> 1,400

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the most I lift with this is 1,400

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140 
the most I lift with this is 1,400
pounds<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.230> average<00:01:19.560> lift<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.070> roughly<00:01:20.400> 1,200

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
pounds my average lift is roughly 1,200

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390 
pounds my average lift is roughly 1,200
and<00:01:21.240> under<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.620> have<00:01:22.830> more<00:01:23.100> than<00:01:23.310> enough

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and under so I have more than enough

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:34.859 
and under so I have more than enough
capacity

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
are stronger than the f-150 frame like I

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:41.010 
are stronger than the f-150 frame like I
said<00:02:27.980> it's<00:02:28.160> power<00:02:28.430> up<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.110> gravity<00:02:30.110> down

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.950 

I<00:02:41.050> have<00:02:41.680> used<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.130> system<00:02:42.190> for

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
I have used this system for

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.920 
I have used this system for
approximately<00:02:43.960> a<00:02:45.960> gear<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:48.330> it's<00:02:49.330> supported

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
approximately a gear and it's supported

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.070 
approximately a gear and it's supported
anywhere<00:02:50.350> from<00:02:51.030> actually<00:02:52.350> over<00:02:53.350> 1,400<00:02:54.070> pounds

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
anywhere from actually over 1,400 pounds

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.030 
anywhere from actually over 1,400 pounds
to<00:02:56.080> roughly<00:02:56.500> 1,400<00:02:57.400> pounds<00:02:57.700> max<00:02:57.940> on<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.240> list

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
to roughly 1,400 pounds max on the list

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.250 
to roughly 1,400 pounds max on the list
so<00:03:00.040> it's<00:03:00.310> very<00:03:00.490> rugged<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.720> far<00:03:01.960> very

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
so it's very rugged and so far very

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.110 
so it's very rugged and so far very
reliable<00:03:03.210> so<00:03:04.210> this<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:05.050> f-150<00:03:05.850> cargo<00:03:06.850> dump

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
reliable so this is the f-150 cargo dump

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.220 
reliable so this is the f-150 cargo dump
truck<00:03:07.680> thanks<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:08.830> watching
