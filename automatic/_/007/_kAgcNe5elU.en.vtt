00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:38.999 

cut<00:04:36.849> the<00:04:36.999> oil<00:04:37.029> look<00:04:37.569> good<00:04:38.229> ninjas<00:04:38.649> because<00:04:38.859> it

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
cut the oil look good ninjas because it

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.849 
cut the oil look good ninjas because it
was<00:04:39.129> so<00:04:39.429> dry<00:04:39.849> that's<00:04:40.659> where<00:04:40.929> the<00:04:41.049> oil<00:04:41.319> is<00:04:41.499> over

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:41.859 
was so dry that's where the oil is over

00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:43.709 
was so dry that's where the oil is over
there<00:04:42.039> but<00:04:42.339> other<00:04:42.759> than<00:04:42.909> that<00:04:42.999> this<00:04:43.329> thing<00:04:43.569> is

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:43.719 
there but other than that this thing is

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:49.480 
there but other than that this thing is
actually<00:04:44.909> really<00:04:45.909> really<00:04:46.899> clean<00:04:47.229> it's<00:04:47.439> dusty

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
actually really really clean it's dusty

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.360 
actually really really clean it's dusty
but<00:04:50.590> really<00:04:51.590> really<00:04:52.069> clean

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
but really really clean

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.560 
but really really clean
think<00:04:54.639> that<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:54.940> may<00:04:55.300> need<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:55.810> vote<00:04:56.050> Kings<00:04:56.410> at

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
think that I may need to vote Kings at

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.910 
think that I may need to vote Kings at
that<00:04:58.570> alternator

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.920 

apparently<00:05:02.920> that's<00:05:03.040> mine

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.860 

I'm<00:05:06.289> probably<00:05:06.620> going<00:05:07.070> to<00:05:07.160> put<00:05:07.370> new<00:05:08.330> radiator

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
I'm probably going to put new radiator

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.670 
I'm probably going to put new radiator
with<00:05:09.320> electric<00:05:10.190> fans<00:05:10.490> in<00:05:10.940> it<00:05:11.199> this<00:05:12.199> radiator

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
with electric fans in it this radiator

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.960 
with electric fans in it this radiator
looks<00:05:13.009> good<00:05:14.199> but<00:05:15.310> I'm<00:05:16.310> thinking<00:05:16.699> that's<00:05:16.820> the

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
looks good but I'm thinking that's the

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.469 
looks good but I'm thinking that's the
way<00:05:17.120> I'm<00:05:17.210> gonna<00:05:17.330> go<00:05:17.570> though<00:05:17.960> maybe<00:05:19.060> four<00:05:20.060> quart

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
way I'm gonna go though maybe four quart

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.790 
way I'm gonna go though maybe four quart
three<00:05:20.870> core<00:05:21.400> aluminum<00:05:22.400> radiator<00:05:23.800> I'm

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
three core aluminum radiator I'm

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.490 
three core aluminum radiator I'm
thinking<00:05:25.720> but<00:05:26.720> there's<00:05:26.930> nothing<00:05:27.289> wrong<00:05:27.440> with

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
thinking but there's nothing wrong with

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.050 
thinking but there's nothing wrong with
the<00:05:27.830> starter<00:05:28.580> that<00:05:29.360> it's<00:05:29.539> probably<00:05:30.229> this<00:05:31.060> de

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
the starter that it's probably this de

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.580 
the starter that it's probably this de
cèlle<00:05:32.479> noise<00:05:32.750> it's<00:05:33.080> bad<00:05:33.440> but<00:05:33.889> I<00:05:35.470> mean<00:05:36.470> it's

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
cèlle noise it's bad but I mean it's

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.460 
cèlle noise it's bad but I mean it's
good<00:05:36.770> work<00:05:37.039> to<00:05:37.280> do<00:05:37.520> but<00:05:37.910> I<00:05:38.120> mean<00:05:38.389> look<00:05:38.539> at<00:05:38.599> that

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:49.150

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.080 

all<00:05:49.550> right

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.780 

get<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.450> doing<00:05:53.750> a<00:05:53.840> few<00:05:54.050> things<00:05:54.350> and<00:05:54.680> I'll<00:05:55.550> make
