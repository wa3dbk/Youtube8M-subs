00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
got from Watson's is this oil film that

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.970 
got from Watson's is this oil film that
I<00:04:55.460> have<00:04:55.700> already<00:04:55.910> posted<00:04:56.540> on<00:04:56.660> my<00:04:56.810> blog<00:04:56.840> so<00:04:57.530> this

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
I have already posted on my blog so this

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.680 
I have already posted on my blog so this
is<00:04:58.100> very<00:04:58.280> nice<00:04:58.580> I<00:04:58.910> will<00:04:58.970> show<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.390> how<00:04:59.570> it

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
is very nice I will show you how it

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.540 
is very nice I will show you how it
works<00:04:59.930> so<00:05:00.020> this<00:05:00.200> is<00:05:00.380> from<00:05:00.680> Gatsby<00:05:01.160> I<00:05:01.190> think

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
works so this is from Gatsby I think

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.500 
works so this is from Gatsby I think
this<00:05:01.670> is<00:05:01.850> for<00:05:02.290> 135<00:05:03.290> sauce<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:03.950> it's<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:05.210> black

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
this is for 135 sauce so it's a black

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.980 
this is for 135 sauce so it's a black
film<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.800> it's<00:05:07.430> like<00:05:07.610> that<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:08.180> then<00:05:08.540> you<00:05:08.720> use

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
film so it's like that and then you use

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.560 
film so it's like that and then you use
the<00:05:09.200> powdered<00:05:09.680> area<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.280> then<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.460> put<00:05:10.790> it<00:05:10.910> up

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
the powdered area and then you put it up

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.190 
the powdered area and then you put it up
you<00:05:12.500> dab<00:05:12.770> it<00:05:12.800> on<00:05:13.100> your<00:05:13.130> face<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:13.940> then<00:05:14.090> it

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
you dab it on your face and then it

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.650 
you dab it on your face and then it
absorbs<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.410> oil<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:16.490> it's<00:05:16.700> really<00:05:16.970> nice<00:05:17.360> this

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
absorbs the oil so it's really nice this

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.750 
absorbs the oil so it's really nice this
is<00:05:17.720> my<00:05:17.960> favorite<00:05:18.440> because<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.800> don't<00:05:19.100> have<00:05:19.430> to

reapply<00:05:20.750> powder<00:05:21.140> so<00:05:21.500> often<00:05:21.950> because<00:05:22.070> I<00:05:22.250> can

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
reapply powder so often because I can

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.310 
reapply powder so often because I can
just<00:05:22.550> use<00:05:22.850> this<00:05:23.030> this<00:05:23.240> is<00:05:23.360> very<00:05:23.570> nice<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.080> I
