 Hi, I'm that pixel and you can 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.890
 find on twitter as at 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.340
 isopixel and at www.shell.com we are in 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.340
 few words 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.800
 Y 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.740
 Y 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.480
 i 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.480
 this time I bring you a theme 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.000
 interesting and I think it's a disease 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.989
 a condition very typical of 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 modern times 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.010
 have you ever felt a 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.200
 little stressed are many 3 to 2 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.629
 when they forget the cell phone to me 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.340
 It has happened to me a lot of times that you're going 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.850
 in the car and suddenly you feel that 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.420
 does not bring the phone back and you 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.360
 come back is this condition called 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.840
 homophobia and is an acronym for no mobile 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.879
 phone phobia that is the irrational fear of 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.699
 leave without the cell phone and not only 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.699
 that's the fear also to stay without 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.920
 balance to stay without a network connection 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.200
 lose it and it's a condition of 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.869
 these times which is not father the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.869
 acronym is that this symptom nomophobia 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.580
 was coined in 2011 due to a study 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.180
 that a united kingdom was made by 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.250
 the post office where they studied 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.110
 not without the symptoms of the users 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.330
 Englishmen when they forgot the phone 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.509
 mobile this study was very interesting 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.500
 because it showed that 53 percent of 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.990
 They are 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.750
 suffered from this condition and 48% of 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.800
 women is also an irrational fear or 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.110
 it is not normal 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.960
 the study showed that it is very similar to 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.260
 visit the dentist or the nerve that is 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.970
 feel the day of your wedding is something is something 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:57.180
 real and then it's something that does not 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.210
 it should be like that is that 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.360
 the invitation is to take off a little 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.310
 of the mobile to do other activities to 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.560
 meet friends for coffee 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.410
 because most of us affirm 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.600
 that due to work we have to be 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.450
 connected which is a fallacy because 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.070
 only 10% of this study had to 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.490
 be connected for work issues 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.320
 everything else is already something invented I 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.560
 I am a typical example of people who 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.950
 want to bring a tablet a phone 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.340
 mobile 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.560
 and why not the backpack with the lav is 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.480
 a need to be connected 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.160
 precisely because of my work but the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.769
 most people would not have to 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.180
 how to feel this condition or see 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.819
 affected or forget the mobile phone 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.920
 I invite you to one day turn off the 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.930
 mobile phone to see if we can equal already 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.819
 is this suggestion I'm going to 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.950
 implement on the blog to see if 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.230
 we can summon a group of 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.360
 users to really turn off the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.190
 cellular that has been all for today my 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.540
 name is raúl ramírez and you know that I 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.489
 you find on twitter as at 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.489
 isopixel and this was in a nutshell 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.360
