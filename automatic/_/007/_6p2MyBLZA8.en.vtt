let<00:01:11.340> me<00:01:11.370> just<00:01:11.610> show<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.000> break<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.480> so<00:01:12.990> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
let me just show you the break up so you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.900 
let me just show you the break up so you
can<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.620> break<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.430> pause<00:01:14.700> this

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
can see the break up you can pause this

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.290 
can see the break up you can pause this
video<00:01:15.120> to<00:01:15.420> look<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.350> all<00:01:16.590> these<00:01:16.800> scores<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
video to look at all these scores if you

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.480 
video to look at all these scores if you
want<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:21.050> so<00:01:22.050> if<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.470> compare<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.950> device<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
want to so if we compare the device you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.820 
want to so if we compare the device you
can<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.940> it<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.330> slightly<00:01:25.080> less<00:01:25.500> powerful

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
can see it is slightly less powerful

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.340 
can see it is slightly less powerful
than<00:01:25.980> they<00:01:26.280> xiaomi<00:01:26.700> redmi<00:01:26.730> note<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:28.110> comes

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
than they xiaomi redmi note it comes

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440 
than they xiaomi redmi note it comes
with<00:01:28.410> a<00:01:28.560> snapdragon<00:01:29.100> 615<00:01:29.490> processor<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.360> is

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
with a snapdragon 615 processor which is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.390 
with a snapdragon 615 processor which is
a<00:01:30.510> good<00:01:30.720> processor<00:01:31.260> but<00:01:31.440> there<00:01:31.620> is<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> heating

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
a good processor but there is a heating

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.220 
a good processor but there is a heating
issue<00:01:32.550> with<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.940> processor<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.810> will<00:01:34.050> be

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
issue with this processor we will be

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.230 
issue with this processor we will be
making<00:01:34.470> our<00:01:34.770> separate<00:01:35.220> heating<00:01:35.550> test<00:01:35.760> for

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
making our separate heating test for

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.780 
making our separate heating test for
this<00:01:36.450> device<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.680> meanwhile<00:01:38.040> let<00:01:38.340> me<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.640> one

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
this device so meanwhile let me just one

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.760 
this device so meanwhile let me just one
the<00:01:38.880> second<00:01:39.210> test<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.690> would<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.140> Nina<00:01:40.470> Mach

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the second test that would be Nina Mach

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.900 
the second test that would be Nina Mach
2<00:01:41.010> and<00:01:41.250> show<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> results<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.760> have

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
2 and show you the results so we have

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.760 
2 and show you the results so we have
run<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> Nina<00:01:45.480> mock<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:45.870> test<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> device

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
run the Nina mock to test on the device

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.700 
run the Nina mock to test on the device
and<00:01:46.800> it<00:01:47.130> has<00:01:47.310> called<00:01:47.630> 57.9<00:01:48.630> FPS<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> Nina

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and it has called 57.9 FPS in the Nina

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.950 
and it has called 57.9 FPS in the Nina
mark<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.250> test<00:01:50.550> so<00:01:51.210> i<00:01:51.240> will<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.510> move<00:01:51.810> ahead

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
mark to test so i will just move ahead

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.290 
mark to test so i will just move ahead
and<00:01:52.380> run<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> third<00:01:53.250> test<00:01:53.550> which<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:54.090> be

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
and run a third test which would be

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.780 
and run a third test which would be
quadrant<00:01:54.900> standard<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.370> ran<00:01:56.550> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
quadrant standard so we have ran the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.340 
quadrant standard so we have ran the

below this video so let me just put the
last<00:02:13.620> test<00:02:13.950> which<00:02:14.220> would<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.580> Geekbench<00:02:15.120> 3<00:02:15.210> we

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
last test which would be Geekbench 3 we

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.110 
last test which would be Geekbench 3 we
have<00:02:16.260> run<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> test<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.160> has<00:02:17.340> four<00:02:17.610> photo

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
have run the test and it has four photo

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.449 
have run the test and it has four photo
in<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.390> single<00:02:18.690> protest<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.349> 1571<00:02:20.129> in<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
in a single protest and 1571 in the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.369 
in a single protest and 1571 in the
multi-core<00:02:20.970> test<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.780> give<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> better

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
multi-core test to give you a better

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.259 
multi-core test to give you a better
idea<00:02:22.560> about<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.280> benchmark<00:02:23.760> let<00:02:23.970> me<00:02:24.090> just

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
idea about the benchmark let me just

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.930 
idea about the benchmark let me just
compare<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.810> with<00:02:24.840> other<00:02:25.230> devices<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.670> can

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
compare it with other devices so you can

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.430 
compare it with other devices so you can
see<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.659> is<00:02:27.810> more<00:02:27.959> powerful<00:02:28.170> than

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
see that it is more powerful than

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.610 
see that it is more powerful than
