00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.880
 to thousands of files in which they stand out 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.240
 of course family 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.780
 and it is that we are talking about an artificial donor that hit the state 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.519
 mostly by the decepticons 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.400
 this incident has two following months 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.909
 saddest 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:21.259
 let's see what it says 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.269
 international doctors on this subject and what their recommendations are 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.529
 science and technology today 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.980
 advanced by leaps and bounds 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.110
 and one of the tools that worldwide more subtlety is the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.150
 Internet 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.910
 and navigating with cyberspace we discovered something that called me a lot 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.190
 attention and we wanted to investigate it 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.100
 it is about the four best therefore 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.620
 is a chemical used as medicine in the treatment to lower 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.670
 of weight also that are the Qur'an pp artificial credit used in 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.340
 feeding 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.370
 in the food industry is called with the ladies the 9 51 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.610
 according to the classification of numbers that 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.080
 It is developed in specialized laboratories as sales of 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.310
 medicines has a power in tulsa before two hundred times higher than 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.550
 table sugar 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.900
 his book lights thus produces the partisans 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.970
 reality the mine and methanol 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.420
 it is used as caloric valverde sweeteners 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.979
 for different foods and beverages as a tabletop sweetener and also in the 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.210
 feeding diabetic people 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.049
 a fact that is not 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:31.990
 no worry 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.409
 is that in a recent study on carcinogenic qualities widely 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.890
 used the painter before aspartame 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.500
 it has been shown without a doubt that it is essentially a deadly toxin 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.770
 and again the industry responsible for everything they could 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.960
 to avoid 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.970
 that news like this come to light 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.270
 in the medical school Monte Sinai of New York the Dr dwelling syphilitics 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.580
 he will receive the irvin prize he is known 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.240
 for the outstanding contributions in the identification of environmental hamlets 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.780
 in your plans 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.179
 and its promotion of independent scientific research 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:16.889
 his research was done for 36 months using luis potosí in Caracas 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:22.019
 concluded that aspartame are carcinogenic monti potential the 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.139
 cancer that produces the pair also include teaching triumph madrileño the 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.189
 peripheral cranial nerves among others 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.889
 only the rats fed aspartame contracted brain tumors 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:38.180
 malignant this prodigious work has been subjected to review with more than 14 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.729
 world experts 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.619
 but we did not find the apartment 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.629
 the aspartame solís the second the goal before artificial heavier 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:47.900
 the world after city 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.269
 saccharin 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.699
 only in the united states more than eight thousand tons of panela sugar are consumed 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:54.409
 years 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.679
 although in terms of global consumption 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:59.779
 It represents 62% of the market 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.119
 and the world is consumed by more than 200 million people 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.260
 We find it in soft drinks chocolates chewing gum 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.499
 candy for three goals 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.429
 and drinks that are mainly clear 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:15.349
 we will be happy clear tv
