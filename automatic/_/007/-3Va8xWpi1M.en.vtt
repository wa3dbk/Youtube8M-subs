00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
said in the brow line I would probably

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.340 
said in the brow line I would probably
incorporate<00:00:20.369> these<00:00:20.760> together<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.109> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
do like the wet consistency because I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.399 
do like the wet consistency because I
find<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> mascara<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.759> very<00:01:36.119> dry<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:37.140> can't

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
find if a mascara is very dry you can't

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
find if a mascara is very dry you can't
really<00:01:37.619> put<00:01:37.860> more<00:01:38.070> than<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.700> two<00:01:38.939> coats<00:01:39.180> on

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
really put more than one or two coats on

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
really put more than one or two coats on
it<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.750> once<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.229> dries<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> couple

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
it like once it dries like in a couple

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.730 
it like once it dries like in a couple
seconds<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> can't<00:01:42.750> keep<00:01:42.990> layering<00:01:43.320> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
seconds like you can't keep layering it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.590 
seconds like you can't keep layering it
because<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.130> gets<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.549> hard<00:01:44.850> material

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
because it just gets that hard material

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.870 
because it just gets that hard material
which<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.439> does<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.189> really<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.670> this

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
which of this does it I really like this

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.999 
which of this does it I really like this
for<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.240> reason<00:01:48.299> now<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> kind

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
for that reason now this one in the kind

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.850 
for that reason now this one in the kind
of<00:01:50.130> orange<00:01:50.700> bronze<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.259> mascara

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
of orange bronze one this is the mascara

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.550 
of orange bronze one this is the mascara
and<00:01:53.189> primer<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> first<00:01:54.869> side<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.380> an

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and primer so the first side is an

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.249 
and primer so the first side is an
eyelash<00:01:56.009> primer<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.119> side<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
eyelash primer and the side is just a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.069 
eyelash primer and the side is just a
mascara<00:01:58.920> now<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.759> actually<00:02:00.060> prefer<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.840> one

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
mascara now I actually prefer this one

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
mascara now I actually prefer this one
to<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> green<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> think<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.670> because

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
to the green one I think one because

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.500 
to the green one I think one because
this<00:02:03.240> how

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
this how

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.300 
this how
one<00:02:03.720> less<00:02:03.930> step<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.440> it<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.920> little<00:02:05.070> bit

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
one less step to it so it's a little bit

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.020 
one less step to it so it's a little bit
quicker<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.180> apply<00:02:06.480> and<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:08.040> as<00:02:08.280> wet

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
quicker to apply and to it's not as wet

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.110 
quicker to apply and to it's not as wet
of<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.479> consistency<00:02:10.350> as<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:11.010> one<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.850> one

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
of a consistency as this one this one

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.210 
of a consistency as this one this one
none<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.750> your<00:02:12.870> lashes<00:02:13.290> clump<00:02:13.620> together<00:02:13.800> they

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
none of your lashes clump together they

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.150 
none of your lashes clump together they
all<00:02:14.400> look<00:02:14.670> really<00:02:15.480> nice<00:02:15.690> really<00:02:16.320> full<00:02:16.710> it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
all look really nice really full it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.950 
all look really nice really full it
really<00:02:17.400> helps<00:02:17.700> separate<00:02:18.210> them<00:02:18.450> really<00:02:18.930> really

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
really helps separate them really really

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.130 
really helps separate them really really
really<00:02:19.800> well<00:02:20.070> now<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:21.150> doesn't<00:02:21.600> make<00:02:21.930> your

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
really well now this doesn't make your

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.860 
really well now this doesn't make your
lashes<00:02:22.320> as<00:02:22.740> dark<00:02:23.280> as<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.940> one<00:02:24.210> does<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.660> one

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
lashes as dark as this one does this one

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.150 
lashes as dark as this one does this one
makes<00:02:25.080> them<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.320> little<00:02:25.440> darker<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.130> little

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
makes them a little darker a little

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.910 
makes them a little darker a little
longer<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.300> overall<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.200> them<00:02:28.410> both<00:02:28.620> it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
longer but overall I like them both it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.230 
longer but overall I like them both it
just<00:02:29.100> really<00:02:29.400> depends<00:02:29.790> what<00:02:29.970> kind<00:02:30.090> of

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
just really depends what kind of

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.710 
just really depends what kind of
consistency<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.640> how<00:02:32.640> full<00:02:33.390> your

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
consistency you like and how full your

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.620 
consistency you like and how full your
eyelashes<00:02:34.290> already<00:02:34.680> are<00:02:34.890> okay<00:02:35.430> now<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.420> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
look like this the next one is very

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.870 
look like this the next one is very
similar<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.690> NYC<00:02:58.230> one<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:58.980> very<00:02:59.190> similar<00:02:59.520> and

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
similar the NYC one is very similar and

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.210 
similar the NYC one is very similar and
I<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.240> these<00:03:00.600> want<00:03:01.110> as<00:03:01.440> opposed<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
I like these want as opposed to the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.000 
I like these want as opposed to the
Penguins<00:03:02.730> because<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.570> tips<00:03:03.840> are<00:03:04.080> very<00:03:04.500> very

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
Penguins because the tips are very very

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.949 
Penguins because the tips are very very
fine<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.060> could<00:03:06.209> get<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.360> really<00:03:06.570> fine

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
fine and you could get a really fine

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.290 
fine and you could get a really fine
line<00:03:06.990> or<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:08.220> could<00:03:08.400> build<00:03:08.550> them<00:03:08.760> up<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.090> lot

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
line or you could build them up a lot

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.090 
line or you could build them up a lot
now<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.780> thing<00:03:10.110> with<00:03:10.350> any<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.890> these

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
now the thing with any of these

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.280 
now the thing with any of these
eyeliners<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.910> have<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> wand<00:03:12.420> like<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:12.900> is

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
eyeliners that have a wand like this is

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.229 
eyeliners that have a wand like this is
you<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.620> have<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.830> bit<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.400> steady<00:03:14.760> hand

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
you have to have a bit of a steady hand

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.510 
you have to have a bit of a steady hand
personally<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.230> think<00:03:16.500> these<00:03:16.830> are<00:03:17.040> easier<00:03:17.489> to

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
personally I think these are easier to

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.449 
personally I think these are easier to
use<00:03:17.970> than<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.420> pen<00:03:18.630> ones<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.830> pen<00:03:20.040> ones<00:03:20.310> I

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
use than the pen ones the pen ones I

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.580 
use than the pen ones the pen ones I
have<00:03:20.700> are<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:20.970> really<00:03:21.330> thick<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.050> don't

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
have are just really thick and I don't

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.199 
have are just really thick and I don't
know<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.800> don't<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.640> thickness<00:03:23.880> of

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
know I just don't like the thickness of

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.210 
know I just don't like the thickness of
them<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.510> don't<00:03:24.690> have<00:03:24.840> as<00:03:24.959> much<00:03:25.110> control<00:03:25.530> even

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
them I don't have as much control even

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.490 
them I don't have as much control even
though<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.459> can<00:03:26.820> get<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> tighter<00:03:27.420> grip<00:03:27.810> these

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
though you can get a tighter grip these

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.350 
though you can get a tighter grip these
you<00:03:28.830> could<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.340> know<00:03:29.370> relax<00:03:29.880> your<00:03:30.120> hand

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
you could just you know relax your hand

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.900 
you could just you know relax your hand
and<00:03:30.750> do<00:03:31.080> your<00:03:31.320> eyeliner<00:03:31.560> with<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.670> think

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
and do your eyeliner with it so I think
