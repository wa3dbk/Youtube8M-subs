00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
of lasting effects also it's got the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.189

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
either side so it gives the handle a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.380 
either side so it gives the handle a
really<00:01:06.780> nice<00:01:06.960> grip<00:01:07.799> beyond<00:01:08.520> its<00:01:08.850> natural

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
really nice grip beyond its natural

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.800 
really nice grip beyond its natural
design<00:01:10.460> which<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:11.970> all<00:01:12.119> four<00:01:12.330> fingers<00:01:12.510> in

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
design which you get all four fingers in

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.010 
design which you get all four fingers in
there<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.590> alleviates<00:01:14.250> any<00:01:14.930> forward<00:01:15.930> or

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
there and that alleviates any forward or

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
there and that alleviates any forward or
backward<00:01:16.439> motion<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> knife<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.000> may

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
backward motion that the knife it may

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.600 
backward motion that the knife it may
have<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.840> whatever<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.890> may<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.130> doing<00:01:20.250> with

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
have and whatever you may be doing with

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.999 
have and whatever you may be doing with
it<00:01:23.600> another<00:01:24.600> thing<00:01:24.840> I'm<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.590> biggest<00:01:25.830> fan

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
it another thing I'm not the biggest fan

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.020 
it another thing I'm not the biggest fan
of<00:01:26.189> even<00:01:26.700> still<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.570> finish<00:01:28.850> even<00:01:29.850> though

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
of even still is the finish even though

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.319 
of even still is the finish even though
it<00:01:30.329> kind<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.659> has<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> anti-reflective

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
it kind of has that anti-reflective

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.429 
it kind of has that anti-reflective
finish<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:35.930> guess<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> does<00:01:37.229> serve

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
finish on it it's I guess it does serve

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.620 
finish on it it's I guess it does serve
a<00:01:37.470> purpose<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.729> really<00:01:38.970> my<00:01:39.030> my

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
a purpose it's just not really my my

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.460 
a purpose it's just not really my my
thing<00:01:40.100> just<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.369> that's<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.640> me<00:01:41.820> personally

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.420 

also<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.930> opening<00:01:49.290> mechanism<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> thumb

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
also the opening mechanism is a thumb

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.139 
also the opening mechanism is a thumb
disk<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> wave<00:01:51.270> feature<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.970> really<00:01:53.970> when

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
disk with a wave feature and really when

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.709 
disk with a wave feature and really when
I<00:01:54.210> first<00:01:54.450> got<00:01:55.189> sorry<00:01:56.189> yes<00:01:56.430> when<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> first<00:01:57.479> got

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
I first got sorry yes when I first got

kukri<00:03:01.590> look<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:03.630> in<00:03:03.989> my<00:03:04.260> way<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.470> thinking<00:03:04.920> I

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
kukri look so in my way of thinking I

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.770 
kukri look so in my way of thinking I
haven't<00:03:05.370> tried<00:03:05.550> this<00:03:05.700> out<00:03:05.910> yet<00:03:06.150> but<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.450> my<00:03:06.600> way

haven't tried this out yet but in my way

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.780 
haven't tried this out yet but in my way
of<00:03:06.900> thinking<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.980> would<00:03:08.130> make<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.430> knife<00:03:08.640> a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
of thinking it would make this knife a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.770 
of thinking it would make this knife a
hell<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.180> slasher<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.840> chopper<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.660> for<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
hell of a slasher in chopper and for the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.770 
hell of a slasher in chopper and for the
the<00:03:13.380> style<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.860> knife<00:03:14.330> along<00:03:15.330> with<00:03:15.570> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
the style of the knife along with the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.330 
the style of the knife along with the
price<00:03:16.140> point<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.860> would<00:03:17.040> have<00:03:17.160> no

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
price point of it I would have no

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.680

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
to me I wish it was a bit longer I kind

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.500 
to me I wish it was a bit longer I kind
of<00:04:20.459> wish<00:04:20.609> she<00:04:20.700> came<00:04:20.849> down<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.239> next

of wish she came down to this next

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.830 
of wish she came down to this next
little<00:04:21.989> notch<00:04:22.349> right<00:04:22.560> here

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.650 

which<00:04:25.830> is<00:04:26.280> probably<00:04:26.970> about<00:04:27.150> a<00:04:27.240> quarter<00:04:27.540> of<00:04:27.570> an

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
which is probably about a quarter of an

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.450 
which is probably about a quarter of an
inch<00:04:27.750> it's<00:04:28.020> really<00:04:28.230> not<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.410> much<00:04:28.770> but<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:29.250> is

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
inch it's really not that much but it is

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.790 
inch it's really not that much but it is
just<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.180> big<00:04:30.389> knife<00:04:30.660> in<00:04:30.930> what<00:04:31.080> seems<00:04:31.380> like<00:04:31.530> to

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
just a big knife in what seems like to

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.750 
just a big knife in what seems like to
meet<00:04:31.980> a<00:04:32.130> small<00:04:32.520> pocket<00:04:32.910> clip<00:04:33.380> but<00:04:34.380> on<00:04:34.590> that

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
meet a small pocket clip but on that

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.270 
meet a small pocket clip but on that
same<00:04:35.760> note<00:04:36.199> because<00:04:37.199> of<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.830> wave<00:04:38.010> feature

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
same note because of the wave feature

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.090 
same note because of the wave feature
again<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:39.660> probably<00:04:39.960> wouldn't<00:04:40.410> want<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.710> have

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
again you probably wouldn't want to have

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.129 
again you probably wouldn't want to have
to<00:04:41.130> overcome<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:42.030> lot<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.419> pocket<00:04:42.780> clip<00:04:42.930> if

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
to overcome a lot of pocket clip if

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.909 
to overcome a lot of pocket clip if
you're<00:04:43.260> trying<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.560> wave<00:04:43.740> this<00:04:43.949> knife<00:04:44.160> out<00:04:44.430> and

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
you're trying to wave this knife out and

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.040 
you're trying to wave this knife out and
when<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.010> do<00:04:47.160> get<00:04:47.340> away<00:04:47.520> with<00:04:47.639> a<00:04:47.699> knife<00:04:47.850> out<00:04:48.050> be

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
when you do get away with a knife out be

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.939 
when you do get away with a knife out be
careful<00:04:49.590> because<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:51.229> was<00:04:52.229> finding<00:04:52.500> that<00:04:52.770> the

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
careful because I was finding that the

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.140 
careful because I was finding that the
tip<00:04:53.930> could<00:04:54.930> easily<00:04:55.500> bite<00:04:55.949> into<00:04:56.699> your<00:04:56.820> finger

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
tip could easily bite into your finger

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.640 
tip could easily bite into your finger
if<00:04:57.330> you<00:04:57.479> weren't<00:04:57.720> careful<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.320> didn't<00:04:58.500> have

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
if you weren't careful and didn't have

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.370 
if you weren't careful and didn't have
your<00:04:58.800> hand<00:04:59.400> position<00:04:59.910> correctly<00:05:00.300> so<00:05:01.110> practice

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
your hand position correctly so practice

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:09.290 
your hand position correctly so practice
but<00:05:01.830> be<00:05:01.979> careful<00:05:07.490> let's<00:05:08.490> see<00:05:08.820> if<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:09.000> can<00:05:09.030> shed

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
but be careful let's see if I can shed

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.620 
but be careful let's see if I can shed
some<00:05:09.330> light<00:05:09.720> here<00:05:10.370> this<00:05:11.370> knife<00:05:11.639> has<00:05:11.669> solid

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
some light here this knife has solid

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.900 
some light here this knife has solid
steel<00:05:13.050> liners<00:05:13.470> in<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.770> which<00:05:14.460> I<00:05:14.610> thought<00:05:14.760> was

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
steel liners in it which I thought was

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.850 
steel liners in it which I thought was
kind<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.210> cool<00:05:15.389> because<00:05:15.930> usually<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.560> lot<00:05:16.740> of

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
kind of cool because usually a lot of

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.510 
kind of cool because usually a lot of
companies<00:05:18.200> will<00:05:19.200> skeletonize<00:05:19.830> their<00:05:20.100> liners

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
companies will skeletonize their liners

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.279 
companies will skeletonize their liners
to<00:05:21.000> try<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.330> take<00:05:21.539> some<00:05:21.690> of<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.840> weight<00:05:21.870> out<00:05:22.020> of

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
to try to take some of the weight out of

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.100 
to try to take some of the weight out of
a<00:05:22.350> knife<00:05:22.880> but<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:23.910> guess<00:05:24.240> cold<00:05:24.510> steel<00:05:24.750> figured

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
a knife but I guess cold steel figured

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.590 
a knife but I guess cold steel figured
the<00:05:25.199> knife<00:05:25.380> is<00:05:25.590> so<00:05:25.740> big<00:05:26.010> why<00:05:26.340> why<00:05:26.880> try<00:05:26.940> to<00:05:27.270> shed

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
the knife is so big why why try to shed

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.140 
the knife is so big why why try to shed
any<00:05:27.780> weight<00:05:28.050> off<00:05:28.260> of<00:05:28.289> it<00:05:28.650> as<00:05:28.770> it<00:05:29.550> sits<00:05:29.789> this
