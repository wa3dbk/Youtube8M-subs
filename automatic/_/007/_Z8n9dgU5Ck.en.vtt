00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.200
 shield let's continue with the second one already 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.150
 you know that some of these tests are 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.470
 something short but I like to go up a 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.259
 video for each of the tests that you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.090
 goes showing game is worth so like 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.710
 you are watching the clubman go up yes and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.240
 now we go with this america in real and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.619
 crown in enamels 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.480
 the cross rally is a frantic 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.730
 competition with several cars in the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.290
 Circuit tracks are short sprints 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.210
 of a mixture of different surfaces 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.850
 to enjoy a thrilling race 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.070
 the cars are agile and fast with that 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.630
 here it's about overtaking yourself the first 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.940
 in reaching the goal and the glory is yours 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.250
 Well, it tells us that we have a 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.580
 test that is in hold on sprint to three 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.010
 returns a test c 1 and gives us choose 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.690
 between a deposit of water subaru impreza 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.000
 another one that we have to buy that goes to 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.950
 to be that it is not or has been racing 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.170
 mitsubishi lancer evolution let's 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.940
 opt for the subaru impreza not for nothing 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.400
 simply because usually always 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.380
 that played rally games because I do not know 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.750
 I have taken the impreza subaru because I 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.150
 like the design of the car basically not 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.070
 because it's better or worse than a lancer 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.570
 evolution and tell you also that now 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.430
 let's take this regularly 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.780
