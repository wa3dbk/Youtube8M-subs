time<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.080> area<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.500> let's<00:00:13.710> move<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.130> now

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
time in this area so let's move on now

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.930 
time in this area so let's move on now
when<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.630> enter<00:00:16.109> into<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.619> next<00:00:16.770> area<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.880> is

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
when we enter into the next area this is

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.500 
when we enter into the next area this is
kind<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.810> my<00:00:19.050> trophy<00:00:19.680> hallways<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.850> training

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
kind of my trophy hallways and training

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.290 
kind of my trophy hallways and training
area<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.710> see<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:24.170> spaced<00:00:25.189> my

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
area as you can see I have spaced my

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.849 
area as you can see I have spaced my
corridor<00:00:28.519> three<00:00:29.519> tiles<00:00:30.000> instead<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> two

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
corridor three tiles instead of two

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.770 
corridor three tiles instead of two
reason<00:00:31.859> being<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.120> loot<00:00:33.329> can

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
reason being as you can see the loot can

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.190 
reason being as you can see the loot can
be<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> center<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.280> has<00:00:35.790> every<00:00:36.540> foot

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
be in the center so it has every foot

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.110 
be in the center so it has every foot
placing<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> minions<00:00:38.489> when<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.820> need<00:00:38.969> it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
placing for the minions when I need it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.700 
placing for the minions when I need it

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
and this theme goes throughout my base

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
check out the control room here as you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.170 
check out the control room here as you
can<00:01:24.350> see<00:01:24.530> I've<00:01:24.710> placed<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.220> big<00:01:25.370> screen<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.970> be

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
can see I've placed the big screen to be

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.880 
can see I've placed the big screen to be
of<00:01:26.270> stat<00:01:26.600> boosting<00:01:27.020> they're<00:01:27.320> all<00:01:27.410> minions<00:01:27.770> at

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
of stat boosting they're all minions at

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.040 
of stat boosting they're all minions at
work<00:01:28.210> it's<00:01:29.210> always<00:01:29.330> a<00:01:29.420> good<00:01:29.540> idea<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.900> build

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
work it's always a good idea to build

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.469 
work it's always a good idea to build
more<00:01:30.619> of<00:01:30.890> these<00:01:31.070> control<00:01:31.700> stations<00:01:32.150> than<00:01:32.330> you

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
more of these control stations than you

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.080 
more of these control stations than you
need<00:01:32.750> because<00:01:33.380> as<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.770> can<00:01:33.950> see<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.610> only<00:01:34.880> have

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
need because as you can see I only have

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.400 
need because as you can see I only have
five<00:01:35.330> people<00:01:35.660> working<00:01:35.900> I<00:01:36.170> have<00:01:36.290> eight

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
five people working I have eight

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.320 
five people working I have eight
stations

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
stations

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.450 
stations
unless<00:01:38.330> you're<00:01:38.570> setting<00:01:39.410> your<00:01:39.500> time<00:01:39.770> clock<00:01:40.100> to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
unless you're setting your time clock to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.590 
unless you're setting your time clock to
a<00:01:40.490> higher<00:01:41.830> minion<00:01:42.830> count<00:01:43.180> you're<00:01:44.180> going<00:01:44.540> to

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
a higher minion count you're going to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.469 
a higher minion count you're going to
always<00:01:44.780> have<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.229> DC's<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:46.369> it's<00:01:46.670> good<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.270> have

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
always have it DC's so it's good to have

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.680 
always have it DC's so it's good to have
extra<00:01:48.400> of<00:01:49.400> course<00:01:49.670> if<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:49.910> have<00:01:50.030> memory<00:01:50.360> banks

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
extra of course if you have memory banks

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.600 
extra of course if you have memory banks
that<00:01:50.990> will<00:01:51.290> alleviate<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:51.800> problem<00:01:52.190> for<00:01:52.490> you

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
that will alleviate that problem for you

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.060 
that will alleviate that problem for you
also<00:01:52.790> I<00:01:53.180> have<00:01:53.509> both<00:01:53.720> just<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.200> be<00:01:54.350> doubly<00:01:54.740> safe

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
also I have both just to be doubly safe

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.150 
also I have both just to be doubly safe
but<00:01:55.970> yeah<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:56.900> don't<00:01:57.080> really<00:01:57.290> build<00:01:57.590> my<00:01:57.650> control

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
but yeah I don't really build my control

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.499 
but yeah I don't really build my control
very<00:01:58.400> large<00:01:58.640> because<00:01:58.910> you<00:01:58.970> don't<00:01:59.119> need<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.390> to

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
very large because you don't need it to

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.140 
very large because you don't need it to
be<00:01:59.540> this<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:00.440> very<00:02:01.070> efficient<00:02:01.520> for<00:02:01.790> what<00:02:02.000> you

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
be this is very efficient for what you

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.410 
be this is very efficient for what you
need<00:02:02.330> for<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.659> game<00:02:02.870> and<00:02:03.290> your<00:02:03.830> objectives

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
need for the game and your objectives

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.249 
need for the game and your objectives
my<00:02:06.140> training<00:02:06.410> room<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.890> giant<00:02:07.850> I've<00:02:08.259> gone

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
my training room is giant I've gone

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.950 
my training room is giant I've gone
against<00:02:09.830> what<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.729> normally<00:02:11.180> would<00:02:11.480> do<00:02:11.660> which

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
against what I normally would do which

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.260 
against what I normally would do which
was<00:02:12.140> build<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.470> room<00:02:12.680> for<00:02:13.010> every<00:02:13.400> single<00:02:14.030> type

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
was build a room for every single type

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.410 
was build a room for every single type
of<00:02:14.300> minion<00:02:15.340> but<00:02:16.340> there's<00:02:16.640> just<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.150> much<00:02:17.360> stuff

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
of minion but there's just so much stuff

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.730 
of minion but there's just so much stuff
so<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:19.100> always<00:02:19.910> double<00:02:20.330> up<00:02:20.480> on<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.720> guards<00:02:21.080> and

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
so I always double up on the guards and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.770 
so I always double up on the guards and
give<00:02:22.010> them<00:02:22.190> two<00:02:22.460> things<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.180> train<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.510> because

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
give them two things to train on because

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.630 
give them two things to train on because
I<00:02:23.870> always<00:02:24.110> want<00:02:24.380> guards<00:02:24.590> ready<00:02:25.130> when<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.550> need

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
I always want guards ready when I need

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.080 
I always want guards ready when I need
them<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:27.340> everything<00:02:28.340> else<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.610> one<00:02:28.850> there's

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090

fine they are getting benefit of this
spaceman<00:02:44.060> looped<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:44.840> that's<00:02:45.140> cool<00:02:45.320> and

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
spaceman looped so that's cool and

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.210 
spaceman looped so that's cool and
continuing<00:02:47.720> on<00:02:47.870> we<00:02:48.230> have<00:02:48.410> my<00:02:48.590> batteries<00:02:49.040> which

continuing on we have my batteries which

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.980 
continuing on we have my batteries which
I've<00:02:49.370> stacked<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:49.940> here<00:02:50.180> for<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.510> rainy<00:02:50.780> day

some<00:04:55.190> time

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
some time

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
Oh last thing I almost forgot to the

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.870 
Oh last thing I almost forgot to the
South<00:05:32.510> where<00:05:32.810> I<00:05:32.840> keep<00:05:33.020> my<00:05:33.080> hotel<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.800> put<00:05:34.729> my

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
South where I keep my hotel I put my

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.040 
South where I keep my hotel I put my
hotel<00:05:35.330> here<00:05:36.010> for<00:05:37.010> one<00:05:37.160> reason<00:05:37.190> it's<00:05:38.180> all<00:05:38.600> the

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
hotel here for one reason it's all the

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.050 
hotel here for one reason it's all the
way<00:05:39.200> at<00:05:39.229> the<00:05:39.410> bottom<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.860> island<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.550> it's

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
way at the bottom of the island and it's

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.969 
way at the bottom of the island and it's
a<00:05:41.150> long<00:05:41.330> walk<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:42.320> reason<00:05:42.560> why<00:05:42.650> I<00:05:42.680> did<00:05:42.830> that

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
a long walk the reason why I did that

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.300 
a long walk the reason why I did that
was<00:05:43.190> because<00:05:43.750> the<00:05:44.750> tourists<00:05:45.290> are<00:05:45.470> very

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
was because the tourists are very

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.690 
was because the tourists are very
annoying<00:05:46.580> and<00:05:47.080> they<00:05:48.080> really<00:05:48.650> really<00:05:48.979> just

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
annoying and they really really just

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.390 
annoying and they really really just
annoy<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.810> crap<00:05:50.840> out<00:05:51.229> of<00:05:51.260> me<00:05:51.500> so<00:05:52.040> I<00:05:52.070> wanted

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
annoy the crap out of me so I wanted

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.430 
annoy the crap out of me so I wanted
them<00:05:52.490> as<00:05:52.610> far<00:05:52.820> away<00:05:52.970> from<00:05:53.090> my<00:05:53.510> base<00:05:53.840> entrances

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
them as far away from my base entrances

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.490 
them as far away from my base entrances
as<00:05:54.560> possible<00:05:55.100> well<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:56.240> also<00:05:56.419> has<00:05:56.720> a<00:05:56.750> pretty

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
as possible well that also has a pretty

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.920 
as possible well that also has a pretty
large<00:05:57.710> downside<00:05:58.430> in<00:05:59.000> the<00:05:59.270> fact<00:05:59.479> that<00:05:59.600> when

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
large downside in the fact that when

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.060 
large downside in the fact that when
your<00:06:00.080> minions<00:06:00.350> come<00:06:00.560> here<00:06:00.710> to<00:06:00.770> work<00:06:00.890> they<00:06:01.039> have

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
your minions come here to work they have

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.750 
your minions come here to work they have
to<00:06:01.190> walk<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.729> entire<00:06:01.820> length<00:06:02.300> of<00:06:02.510> the<00:06:02.660> island

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
to walk the entire length of the island

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:47.159 
the near future as well

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.129 
the near future as well
and<00:06:48.089> hopefully<00:06:48.389> will<00:06:48.599> be<00:06:48.659> a<00:06:48.689> lot<00:06:48.869> clearer<00:06:49.109> than

and hopefully will be a lot clearer than

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.459 
and hopefully will be a lot clearer than
this<00:06:49.379> because<00:06:49.559> island<00:06:50.129> 2<00:06:50.309> is<00:06:50.489> much<00:06:50.879> better

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:51.469
