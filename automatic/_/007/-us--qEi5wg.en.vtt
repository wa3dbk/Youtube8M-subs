00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 hello how about we do the same as you 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.370
 like to see the fried plates and you're 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.690
 seeing our people after that the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.360
 program where in three different videos 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.400
 categories compete to be the most the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.679
 Last week we saw the baby octopus 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.420
 cries berlin and the father who plays bass 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.430
 their tastes have been devoured by 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.260
 our super and permeates the computer and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.679
 the most ethical video of last week 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.679
 [Music] 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 but as always the three of the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 competition to be the most technical 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.620
 let's see 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.220
 a kind of done this to say anything 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.220
 safe 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.690
 two 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.399
 [Music] 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.110
 but the enthusiasm that puts you up 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.410
 after seeing the faces a little before 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.720
 of failing if you do not study because 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.870
 generally good they are usually stupid 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.320
 failures I keep in starcraft and 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.320
 work 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.780
 like these dear work parents 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.780
 teasing their children 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.659
 crow tarhoni 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.370
 I call this a good father 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.500
 worked a son alive well and I also 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.630
 I never will be and nobody in your life is a 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.280
 failure for the son but a victory 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.840
 for the father so I'll say it's in the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.030
 victory because nobody likes the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.450
 motorcycles victories 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.450
 johan 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.540
 talking about moto2 let's see this boy 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.700
 [Music] 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.350
 but it does not matter and all the minutes 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.030
 even if he has that kind of mishap 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.960
 they also make beautiful sounds 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.580
 perhaps he did not hear them 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.230
 those were our three videos of the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.860
 week so what do you think is the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.840
 master 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.790
 the snot line the balance right now 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.300
 from the ceiling or the mother who scares 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.770
 their children 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.930
