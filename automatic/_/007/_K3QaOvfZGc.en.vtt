00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.200
 that means to all shinobi serge 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.910
 ancient today we find ourselves for 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.970
 a new video so today a 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.970
 little trick with minato so a species 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.829
 of mini tutorial actually it's not for 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.840
 minato is rather against minato in 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.809
 does it just to succeed 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.030
 to counter read aisheen of minato so 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.350
 it's his technique in standby mode 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.769
 new at all so 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.620
 lbr bihar a phew I do not know what 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.150
 I'll show you that right now 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.149
 because in my opinion I really do not 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.620
 the only one to be unhappy with this 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.719
 technique that is pretty boring it's 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.399
 true good name made abuse but it's 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.440
 true that luminato is in quotation marks 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.070
 invincible just after doing his 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.809
 nest in China 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.399
 so it's true that it's pretty annoying 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.719
 and I see a lot of people complaining 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.460
 so I decide to offer you a small 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.940
 tutorial then a little trick that I have 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.520
 found with some friends to me so 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.110
 here we are going to show you all that 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.490
 I'll show you all that sooner 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.920
 while they already have in their pocket a bit of a 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.880
 micro here is so there are several knew 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.140
 so the big classics 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.660
 in my opinion that everyone suspects 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.909
 so just put the guard on it 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.720
 obviously pro manual 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.920
 then you can also mans 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.170
 fate because I warn that both 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.159
 this is simply dassier what 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.570
 stop the look you can 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.189
 also go fast and in all 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.210
 case you will not take yourself so I have 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.200
 two wii controllers in training I 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.210
 found no one to do it but I 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.880
 will really do my best thank you 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.180
 to be careless then what is it 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.189
 that we have 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.490
 so a little tip that I found 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.520
 myself, this one 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.299
 so the lirette china going away and 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:57.240
 you your thin I messed up 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.240
 so wait, let's go back and 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.070
 conversely of man is quite true that 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.810
 you have two currencies you even know 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.520
 more what a joystick and what then there 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.640
 that's it then he'll go to china 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.019
 and there you send your rain of blows 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.480
 nice if you are with a character who 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.610
 so has his hens on the other hand really 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.690
 to have a perfect timing limit that's 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.069
 because I recommend you the most 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.420
 but that's still one of the tips you 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.580
 try to show you that one 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.049
 last time wen have anyway 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.200
 must be close enough so it's really 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.489
 not the best of the best when coming back 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.230
 to the most interesting things so 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.310
 accuracy the double to not stop the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.090
 racing I do not recommend you or so 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.230
 really the most interesting thing 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.640
 I would say it's just 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.900
 sending glances yourself 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.239
 so what will happen 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.470
 either the diets will be stopped who will 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.599
 not do it or will he do it but 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.030
 he will teleport anywhere in fact 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.250
 so no it's not going to work 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.160
 so that's really a good tip 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.299
 nice wait watch you that so where 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.970
 you described nice did 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.739
 completely messing up bali racing 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.359
 simply it can be walking a hundred 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.070
 percent if it's done right 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.209
 so here I have two controllers I can not 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.350
 make you move but believe me 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.850
 that it's impossible 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.260
 believe me I have tomorrow it's not 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.989
 possible so when you see like 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.220
 you just saw it at the word Nazi 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.000
 it really works is pretty fast 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.180
 so here it stops teleportation 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.310
 so bakou is a little faster minato 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.290
 but you're really teleport 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.810
 sent mans who teleports really that 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.150
 thunder march there is really nothing 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.920
 of better 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.299
 so that's pretty much that anyway 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.200
 all I have to show you here is 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.959
 it's nickel it works 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.209
 e and then and then here anyway 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.970
 I really hope it's small tutorial 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.069
 tips in quotation marks will finally get you 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.360
 rained earlier and last little thing 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.650
 that I completely ok I 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.360
 completely failing to forget that he is 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.739
 out of the head this is actually my 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.220
 notice all the characters are 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.260
 parchments 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.220
 so it's really super helpful who at 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.019
 federal china where just take off 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.360
 your necessarily my dirty pierced to 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.800
 the boom why but basically good bah 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.069
 stop the roots and that's what we 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.239
 interested no it is also 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.860
 nice after bondoukou all that but 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.180
 really the best tip for me that 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.400
 clearly remains that of kunai you 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.349
 show it one last time if I do not 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.360
 course no unsophisticated controller 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.570
 joystick finally brief you understood the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.840
 principle but I have not dwell there 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.359
 above 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.180
 long time to amos what is it 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.250
 galley to my every time I'm wrong 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.260
 good touch finally I have not 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.090
 start again for three hours on this 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.860
 I hope this little trick you in 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.360
 the more I had done some on 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.729
 generation here I take a little 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.900
 series gp2 offer you two types of 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.370
 characters all this I already have some 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.050
 ideas in mind and in any case 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.169
 this kind of small small series 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.990
 very fast please tell me the same 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.400
 advised me things in the sense if 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.360
 you have problems corner some 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.990
 characters I will try to find you 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.630
 tips 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.500
 so here on this I tell you to very 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.669
 quickly on my youtube channel as 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.669
 usually go hi everyone
