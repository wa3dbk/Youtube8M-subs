good morning children let us learn the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.770 
good morning children let us learn the
number<00:00:04.560> zero<00:00:05.450> what<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.480> zero<00:00:07.669> you<00:00:08.669> know<00:00:08.969> like

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
number zero what is zero you know like

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.619 
number zero what is zero you know like
you<00:00:10.139> all<00:00:10.410> Poehler<00:00:11.339> loves<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.999> play<00:00:12.209> with<00:00:12.480> the

balloons how many balloons Paulo has yes

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.050 
balloons how many balloons Paulo has yes
he<00:00:17.550> has<00:00:17.789> one<00:00:18.480> balloon<00:00:18.990> Oh<00:00:21.170> what<00:00:22.170> happened<00:00:23.060> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
he has one balloon Oh what happened the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.519 
he has one balloon Oh what happened the
balloon<00:00:24.509> flew<00:00:24.929> away<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.679> the<00:00:25.890> air<00:00:26.449> now<00:00:27.529> how

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
balloon flew away in the air now how

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.630 
balloon flew away in the air now how
many<00:00:28.859> balloons<00:00:29.220> Paulo<00:00:29.640> has<00:00:30.560> he<00:00:31.560> has<00:00:31.890> no

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
many balloons Paulo has he has no

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.860 
many balloons Paulo has he has no
balloons<00:00:33.239> now<00:00:34.579> which<00:00:35.579> number<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.300> used<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
balloons now which number can be used to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.939 
balloons now which number can be used to
show<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.460> yes<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.270> zero<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.329> bola<00:00:42.329> has<00:00:42.949> zero

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
show it yes it is zero so bola has zero

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:51.049 
show it yes it is zero so bola has zero
balloon<00:00:47.690> how<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:49.140> write<00:00:49.350> zero<00:00:50.059> remember

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
balloon how do we write zero remember

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.880 
balloon how do we write zero remember
the<00:00:52.050> backward<00:00:52.680> curve<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:54.149> curve<00:00:54.180> looking<00:00:55.079> bad

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the backward curve the curve looking bad

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.840 
the backward curve the curve looking bad
and<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:57.300> forward<00:00:57.629> curve<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.250> looking<00:00:59.460> in

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
and the forward curve the one looking in

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.169 
and the forward curve the one looking in
forward<00:01:00.420> direction<00:01:01.280> let<00:01:02.280> us<00:01:02.429> use<00:01:02.670> both<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
forward direction let us use both of

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:08.840 
forward direction let us use both of
them<00:01:04.189> let<00:01:05.189> us<00:01:05.369> use<00:01:05.670> them<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.030> write<00:01:06.450> zero<00:01:07.850> now

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
them let us use them to write zero now

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.760 
them let us use them to write zero now
we<00:01:09.780> will<00:01:09.960> write<00:01:10.229> number<00:01:10.830> zero<00:01:11.600> first<00:01:12.770> draw

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
we will write number zero first draw

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.179 
we will write number zero first draw
curve<00:01:14.720> facing<00:01:15.720> down<00:01:16.079> and<00:01:17.090> then<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.360> curve

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
curve facing down and then a curve

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:26.649 
curve facing down and then a curve
facing<00:01:20.189> up<00:01:20.900> look<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.070> zero<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:26.250> know

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
facing up look this is zero you know

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.499 
facing up look this is zero you know
even<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.840> pollen<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:28.590> Paulo<00:01:29.009> had<00:01:29.549> looked

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
even the pollen which Paulo had looked

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.139 
even the pollen which Paulo had looked
like<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.840> zero<00:01:31.530> isn't<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:33.829> now<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:35.700> will<00:01:35.909> write

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
like a zero isn't it now we will write

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.130 
like a zero isn't it now we will write
number<00:01:36.720> zero<00:01:37.140> using<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> dots

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
number zero using the dots

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.280 
number zero using the dots
starting<00:01:40.140> from<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:41.250> curve<00:01:42.500> facing<00:01:43.500> forward

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
starting from up a curve facing forward

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.790 
starting from up a curve facing forward
then<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.710> curve<00:01:48.020> facing<00:01:49.520> backwards

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.260 

look<00:01:53.800> this<00:01:54.760> is<00:01:55.000> zero<00:01:57.210> pull<00:01:58.210> ahead<00:01:58.420> one<00:01:59.260> egg

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
look this is zero pull ahead one egg

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.490 
look this is zero pull ahead one egg
he<00:02:01.270> ate<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:02.050> egg<00:02:04.080> now

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
he ate the egg now

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.680 
he ate the egg now
no<00:02:06.400> eggs<00:02:06.850> are<00:02:07.150> there<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.580> how<00:02:09.580> many<00:02:09.640> eggs<00:02:10.300> does

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
no eggs are there so how many eggs does

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.270 
no eggs are there so how many eggs does
Pola<00:02:11.140> have<00:02:11.620> now<00:02:13.080> zero<00:02:14.490> yes<00:02:15.570> Lola<00:02:16.570> has<00:02:17.280> zero

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
Pola have now zero yes Lola has zero

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.330 
Pola have now zero yes Lola has zero
eggs<00:02:20.250> Hey<00:02:21.250> look<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.720> shape<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.470> egg<00:02:23.680> also

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
eggs Hey look the shape of the egg also

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.040 
eggs Hey look the shape of the egg also
looks<00:02:24.640> like<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:25.030> zero<00:02:25.810> right

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
looks like a zero right

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.150 
looks like a zero right
so<00:02:29.160> zero<00:02:30.160> is<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.340> curve<00:02:31.050> starting<00:02:32.050> from<00:02:32.320> up<00:02:32.650> a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
so zero is a curve starting from up a

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.699 
so zero is a curve starting from up a
curve<00:02:34.410> facing<00:02:35.410> forward<00:02:36.510> then<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.930> curve<00:02:39.239> facing

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
curve facing forward then a curve facing

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.710 
curve facing forward then a curve facing
backwards<00:02:42.330> look<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:44.080> number<00:02:44.470> zero<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:45.010> ready

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
backwards look the number zero is ready

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.500 
backwards look the number zero is ready
bye<00:02:46.720> bye<00:02:47.050> kids
