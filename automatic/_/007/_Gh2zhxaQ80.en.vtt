its controller has a really good feeling
to<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:16.530> hybrid<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.220> only<00:02:17.459> difference

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
to it it the hybrid the only difference

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.490 
to it it the hybrid the only difference
between<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.150> hybrid<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.780> other<00:02:18.989> controller

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
between the hybrid and other controller

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.420 
between the hybrid and other controller
is<00:02:20.239> people<00:02:21.239> had<00:02:21.560> people<00:02:22.560> kept<00:02:22.769> on<00:02:22.950> scuff

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
is people had people kept on scuff

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.390 
is people had people kept on scuff
knifing<00:02:23.910> around<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.720> back<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.769> they<00:02:26.160> made

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
knifing around the back so they made

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.670 
knifing around the back so they made
this<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.269> hybrid<00:02:27.630> controller<00:02:28.049> have<00:02:28.470> a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
this the hybrid controller have a

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.490 
this the hybrid controller have a
different<00:02:29.310> back<00:02:29.489> with<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.150> fits<00:02:30.720> nicely<00:02:30.870> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.690 
on the paddles um it's really nice
looking<00:02:37.739> controller<00:02:38.870> for<00:02:39.980> 250<00:02:40.980> bucks<00:02:41.190> i<00:02:41.400> spent

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
looking controller for 250 bucks i spent

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.539 
looking controller for 250 bucks i spent
on<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.239> definitely<00:02:42.870> think<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.739> will<00:02:44.370> be

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
on it I definitely think it will be

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.310 
on it I definitely think it will be
worth<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:46.489> pretty<00:02:47.489> cool-looking<00:02:48.320> not

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
worth it it is pretty cool-looking not

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.810 
worth it it is pretty cool-looking not
even<00:02:49.560> cool<00:02:49.769> looking<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.340> doesn't<00:02:50.670> matter

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
even cool looking it doesn't matter
