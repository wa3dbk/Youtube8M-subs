00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.710
 good 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.099
 Ouch it's everybody knows who 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.960
 when you go and listen to me that bin 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.140
 go nickel and today it's time 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.940
 the second episode of ffa on bo2 so 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.590
 in this episode I will tell you about 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.210
 trumps and killstreaks first of all 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.970
 I come to present the gameplay on 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.010
 is sure sick in melee general jean 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.570
 inevitably I play at peace this 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.269
 ergonomic handle with a first 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.000
 asset determination and ghosts in 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.040
 second match where probably 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.149
 robustness 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.570
 I forget the names dates or so as to 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.960
 this is my opinion and the third advantage 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.480
 I had dexterity and another thing that 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.539
 had to be dead silence 99% of 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.980
 chances this is it and like who 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.899
 strict I played with the turret the 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.210
 hunting right and the drone as in 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.550
 the first episode 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.530
 so first of all the trumps you have 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.350
 the choice be you prefer to use a 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.840
 secondary if you have a weapon that has 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.590
 a rather small a rather small charger 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.240
 I am thinking in particular of the ms mc kee of 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.470
 base a loader of 30 balls and that's 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.540
 very short I know when I played 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.979
 with I had found that really very 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.750
 very small as a loader since she has 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.549
 still a pretty high pace 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.840
 good it's not a jack twist too 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.310
 but the small progression of others I 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.360
 managed to kill the gac was in front of me 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.159
 but I made myself two killed 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.810
 so as I said, here it is 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.790
 dexterity dead silence like 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 third asset as I said I do not 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.610
 know more what I was saying finally good 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.220
 so like 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.840
 like everyone else here is that you 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.370
 prefer to put a secondary one if not 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.650
 you do like me I put a 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.540
 only asset on my weapon on my weapon 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.340
 main djemila buzz at all 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.530
 accessory speak I loved the handle 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.510
 ergonomic gmi I did not put grenade 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.440
 tactical and I put that the betty 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.630
 to arrive if we will talk about it quickly 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.000
 and so I put that two princes trumps 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.220
 2 1 everything first quack 2 has everything 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.220
 as much in third so that's what 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.200
 seems the most interesting after that 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.790
 depends on tears that you have after 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.320
 you are always free to put to 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.880
 large capacity charge so you 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.840
 arrive with the basic sights or if 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.489
 you do not necessarily need a 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.330
 quiet 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.550
 it's true that the silencer is 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.050
 useful when we start and even I I 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.989
 still put on some maps 1 I say 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.239
 not that to be to tell it to me or 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.770
 anything but it's part of 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.380
 our famous technique you have two 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.350
 techniques are taken from the oven 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.220
 favorite I joke stay stealthy and 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.550
 put a silencer 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.810
 either you can put a bath without 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.190
 silent and like that you went 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.780
 attract the enemies will come back more 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.980
 quickly to you and you can do 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.900
 your scrum faster 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.940
 besides I tell you I propose you 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.350
 long gameplay I make some 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.400
 shorter but I tell myself that in four 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.590
 minutes or in three minutes I would not have 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.200
 the time to tell you so much 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.630
 here is the killstreaks 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.400
 so if you start the general hand this 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.750
 which is my case on black ops game of 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.709
 goals the scrum as all the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.320
 world I do not know well yet 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.010
 small I know about 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.090
 responsible not yet perfect 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.980
 besides, you will see in this 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.120
 part i will mostly run this area 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.890
 telling me that normally it's the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.049
 respect in my back you will see that 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.670
 I will not do as soon as he does not want 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.330
 to make effect not closed and that it super 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.330
 super fast 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.230
 there you will see that the turret is 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.030
 really effective but with the time I 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.320
 think it can come and I could 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.450
 bad game really does not really 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.350
 fast rssi I'm doing a very very 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.030
 fast I would put it I would put it in 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.400
 music and I wanted but very sure about 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.930
 my channel just can it if that 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.799
 please, but you will tell me that too 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.540
 in the comments there is no 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.709
 problem I think it's my tour 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.269
 from before who had made two small kits 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.769
 quickly you see that it advances you 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.030
 still if you are in trouble 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.110
 with the first you stick a little bit 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.110
 you put a turret you take from 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.120
 kiel from before is always fun 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.319
 after at the level of killstreaks so I 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.230
 I'm still going to concentrate quickly 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.840
 on it first the drone was 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.430
 almost obligatory me I will put it 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.360
 all the time the hunting drone is 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.190
 very interesting after saying that it 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.130
 to do that 1 kg samuel maybe to be 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.239
 a drone so at the beach that I would put 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.250
 rather the turret and if really see 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.830
 you think you manage that you are 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.890
 a beast you put the micro station 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.099
 Orbital that's also very interesting 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.419
 but general and if you really think 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.640
 that you are that you start 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.680
 really a nice shot finally has well 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.330
 manage to put one that is a 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.400
 a little higher as of lautard the ostar 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.750
 which is a huge carnage I have a 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.860
 part that will arrive either on my channel 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.870
 get on the steam chain or I'm doing a 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.330
 series of over 40 because I have to 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.440
 the star water will be less big carnage 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.060
 otherwise you put stealthy aircraft 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.650
 like that you can frags and while 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.660
 same time as your other than your 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.030
 aircraft is just going to do that it's 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.160
 frags and suddenly you can largely 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.740
 take a lead also on that on 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.630
 the second or even caught up with the one who 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.729
 is in front of you because you have to say 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.740
 that the goal is still wrong and 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.599
 win the general scrum and not to 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.270
 do the best possible ratio or 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.070
 although it is otherwise 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.960
 it's really getting darker 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.409
 dog to shake behind me you 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.210
 may have heard and the little 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.250
 bug the air at the passage there I come from 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.380
 respawn before I even had no 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.610
 of secondary I pass on my knife 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.020
 because I like doing doubles 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.520
 there end doubles to spend on my neck 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.620
 zoo to run faster and the jeanne 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.870
 scorpions you have to customize normal 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.380
 good evening I offer you a weapon that's it 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.200
 pleases 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.110
 really this game is buggy of infinity 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.639
 to use bolden 's words 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.919
 it's based on call of but it's true 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.999
 that he says it this way I had 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.459
 a lot of bugs 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:41.369
 in the image of the hypnosis video on 

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:43.379
 the helicopter on the finally short drone 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:45.929
 the helicopter that follows you koala acts of 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:48.169
 bo two that will charge me in I'm 

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:50.519
 to commit suicide with it was anything 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.860
 I had what bug still I did not 

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:54.629
 bad bug at the connection level in 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.469
 full part I go to a bar on 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:06:00.739
 do not know why stuff like that 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:03.269
 frankly it's really buggy buggy 

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:04.559
 sometimes it happened to me once 

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:08.189
 my weapon disappear I did not see my 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:10.529
 weapon that's really so so when we 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:11.699
 is partly his jane not when when 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.110
 the other ages that became brews that's 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.389
 really buggy from google hope that 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.179
 finally I hope that the updates 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.439
 will do good because otherwise it will 

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:21.599
 to hurt a day a year with a game 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:23.789
 also bugs and frankly I think that 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:25.319
 in three weeks or in two three 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.299
 weeks of two bo2 I had more than 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.639
 bugs in all a modern warfare alley 

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:30.509
 3 finally we will not complain about me 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.949
 I take a lot of fun in everything 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.719
 case in the game and we're already at the end 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.249
 of this part 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:37.349
 so I ended up on a score of 30 to 6 or 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:38.489
 30 to 7 something like that we see 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:40.529
 not the score because whoever 

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:42.649
 stop me the gameplay nicely did not 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:46.469
 not finally did not display the scores 

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:48.869
 so I hope you enjoyed it and we 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:50.279
 soon found for the third 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:52.439
 episode but first I think we'll have 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:53.939
 first a little video apart that will be 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.889
 not who will not be part of the series 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:57.029
 so if you ever liked it, it's not 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.259
 to put a little green thumb in 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:59.969
 comments tell me what you have 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.529
 thought of this video what I will have to 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:03.059
 improve and what you want to 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.409
 I speak at the level of the general scrum 

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:07.909
 in the next episode 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:07.909
 here I am kissing ciao
