00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.309
 First 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.259
 by juan roma 6 kilometers 72 laps 307 kilometers in total 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.119
 five fast sections 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.349
 four slow curves three points and the lifting 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.390
 maximum speed of 306 kilometers per hour 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.509
 We started here a round of the German Grand Prix 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.509
 the formula one simulator of red bull 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.920
 the first mayor agents under the modality of chastity 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.820
 right away and we reached the top 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.750
 that the entrance is pretty bachata 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.950
 that was the time here it would be straight 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.020
 for now we draw this right chair very 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
 will serve to enter the new section 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.280
 loquacious we were strong 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280
 going into the parabolic 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.440
 going down to curve 6 in the closed safety fork an opportunity 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.440
 fantastic to overtake 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.890
 very well for this whole stretch and make an allegedly perfect exit for 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.090
 make sure Tuesday 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.440
 we move away from this fork through a 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.490
 fernando strong entry 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 It is very closed in front of the Mercedes-Benz stand 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 the fastest right 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.070
 and then we go back to the old part 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.060
 the famous fast stretch of joaquin stadium 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330
 we go very fast in the curves 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.660
 it's a very similar hairpin earth and then we went through two small cones 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.610
 with flush changes invisibility in both and we enter a double the fad 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.190
 right 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.630
 there will also be enough 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.260
 and so we finish the round
