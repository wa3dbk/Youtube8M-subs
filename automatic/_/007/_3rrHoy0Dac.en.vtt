included<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.890> think<00:02:40.550> we<00:02:40.670> can<00:02:40.850> all<00:02:40.970> assume<00:02:41.300> that

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
included I think we can all assume that

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.570 
included I think we can all assume that
most<00:02:41.840> people<00:02:42.200> playing<00:02:42.440> battlefield<00:02:43.070> 4<00:02:43.310> right

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
most people playing battlefield 4 right

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.820 
most people playing battlefield 4 right
now<00:02:43.610> are<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.660> people<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.200> hardcore<00:02:45.800> fans

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
now are the people the hardcore fans

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.980 
now are the people the hardcore fans
that<00:02:46.370> still<00:02:46.610> really<00:02:46.970> liked<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.660> series

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
that still really liked this series

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.500 
that still really liked this series
because<00:02:48.890> let's<00:02:49.310> face<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.880> games<00:02:50.120> been<00:02:50.360> out

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
because let's face it the games been out

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.660 
because let's face it the games been out
for<00:02:50.720> two<00:02:50.900> years<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.470> lot<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.100> people<00:02:52.400> will<00:02:52.550> have

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
for two years a lot of people will have

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.220 
for two years a lot of people will have
moved<00:02:52.850> on<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.180> other<00:02:53.270> things<00:02:53.570> but<00:02:53.959> there's

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
moved on to other things but there's

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.229 
moved on to other things but there's
always<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.800> core<00:02:55.160> base<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:55.820> will<00:02:55.940> stay

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
always that core base that will stay

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.259 
always that core base that will stay
with<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:57.230> game<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.340> we<00:02:58.459> can<00:02:58.610> assume<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:58.940> these

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
with a game so we can assume that these

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.910 
with a game so we can assume that these
players<00:02:59.630> are<00:02:59.959> good<00:03:00.320> am<00:03:00.590> i<00:03:00.800> correct<00:03:01.480> why<00:03:02.480> are<00:03:02.540> we

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
players are good am i correct why are we

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.949 
players are good am i correct why are we
given<00:03:03.920> targets<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:04.640> are<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:05.030> ridiculously

given targets that are so ridiculously

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.380 
given targets that are so ridiculously
low<00:03:06.260> doesn't<00:03:07.070> make<00:03:07.190> me<00:03:07.340> feel<00:03:07.610> any<00:03:07.850> better

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.009 
hours I might actually find that much
more<00:03:21.890> entertaining<00:03:22.580> than<00:03:22.760> getting<00:03:23.269> 10<00:03:23.630> kills

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
the acw-r because well that thing's just

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.070

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
much harder challenge of taking down

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.910 
much harder challenge of taking down

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890

and if you can take a few people down
actively<00:04:03.330> with<00:04:03.540> ironsights<00:04:04.110> then<00:04:04.349> you'll

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
actively with ironsights then you'll

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.100 
actively with ironsights then you'll
have<00:04:04.620> absolutely<00:04:05.489> no<00:04:05.670> problem<00:04:06.239> when<00:04:06.750> it<00:04:06.870> comes
