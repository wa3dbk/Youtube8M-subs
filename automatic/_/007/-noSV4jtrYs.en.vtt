00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.490
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.490
 marakasi you watch the show chic 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.970
 position release 42 first location 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.050
 located on lasville map in a square 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.730
 e2 and you need a fast tank wish 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.320
 good vertical angles from us 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.990
 pickups and driving on this Putin 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.219
 Of course it's quite difficult to move forward. 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.309
 to the top 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.760
 but without the help of the allies 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.800
 you can climb and basically on 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.530
 the way you spend is not so much 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.879
 time for that you can easily shoot 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.770
 on enemy tanks 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.070
 because they are unlikely to be expected 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.320
 the fact that you appear here and suddenly 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.870
 suddenly start shooting at them 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.539
 of course then opponents for sure 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.910
 keep warm on you but you can always 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.539
 troll distract highlight 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.479
 and all sorts of dirty tricks are very interesting 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.460
 unusual position but really worth 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.310
 note that there can get art 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.430
 if it stands for example squared to 1 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.799
 or co2 and then instead is not even 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.400
 safe and the next position is 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.490
 on the pass map in square f3 and you 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 a very smart tank is needed as well 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.060
 big overclocking to drop in here 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.100
 slide and position rather peculiar 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 She probably come in order to 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.960
 defend against opponents who 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.049
 for example attack over the bridge 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.420
 or in some other direction that is 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.689
 go to your base and from here you can 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.240
 very good defit as here 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.049
 a lot of bushes and can be due 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.049
 masking even play but surely worth it 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.020
 note that the position is open and if 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.590
 suddenly opponents will light you then they are without 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.200
 problems on oms can shoot 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.080
 in this case, of course, players on the lungs 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.840
 tanks of the third level for 1c nothing 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.569
 could not oppose the enemy 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.580
 but I think for example on hellcat or else 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.510
 on any tanks with good 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.330
 disguise 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.900
 here you can freely shoot 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.989
 enemy tanks and on we still go 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.840
 one wonderful point on the map of the south 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.379
 beach in square n 4 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.599
 and definitely need a fast tank and 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.480
 it also needs a big one 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.620
 acceleration to get here on this mountain 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.959
 maybe it won't work right the first time 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.049
 I warn you, but if you try 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.530
 You can certainly take this interesting 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:55.650
 place and from here you can shoot 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.280
 huge territory where most often 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.799
 there are opponents such as a balcony there 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.150
 where my opponents constantly shine 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.890
 and you just have to shoot them 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.100
 Naturally on this place is extremely important 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.680
 masking your tank if opponents 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.769
 you will shine and hide there will be 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.650
 quite difficult but in general the place is just 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.190
 gorgeous here you can do a lot of damage 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.980
 and on such cheater tanks like e25 you 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.049
 most likely will not even glow well 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.380
 unless of course the enemy arrives 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:35.120
 too close well and in general I think that 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.250
 just chic on we go quite 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.269
 curious position for your defense 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.060
 base on lasville map squared f3 in 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.250
 early you can be here before 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.819
 to shoot at opponents who 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.060
 crushed 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.540
 on the right flank for example from the gut or 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.150
 from the city but if suddenly opponents 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.940
 begin to crush from the gorge that is left 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.010
 flank then from here you can also very 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.220
 even a good defense 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.260
 if you get up here at this place 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.230
 of course you need good angles 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.810
 vertical guidance is also your tank 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.939
 should be small and in the end you 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.109
 can easily throw 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:21.219
 opponent of barts to 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:25.090
 into the roof and they will be extremely uncomfortable with 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:28.659
 you cope on the whole chic. to all 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.539
 I advise to the pluses can also be attributed to 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:34.270
 what is missing art if it is of course 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:37.629
 I haven't moved anywhere and also here 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.030
 it is possible to tank a pretty well tower and very 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:43.740
 for a long time the only thing they can 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.889
 take opponents it's just rush 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.590
 by the crowd 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.779
 then of course they can destroy you 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.840
 if nobody covers you 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:56.229
 Well, in general, just great. 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.389
 and the last interesting place is the position in 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.120
 our release is on the map 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.819
 windstorm squared n 4 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.669
 Any medium tank is suitable in principle. 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.699
 here you go to this place and here you can 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.279
 hide here for this mountain and you will 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.669
 lean out quickly 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:18.699
 shoot at the enemy and then you will 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.580
 hiding again this way opponents 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.479
 unlikely to be able to react as you 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.539
 disappear because of the light only then 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:30.819
 leave give a shot and hide again 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.870
 but the truth is worth noting that rather 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.270
 just deliver here 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.379
 app that so it is worth going here if 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:41.169
 it does not have it if you're just not afraid Well 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:43.990
 and generally a very interesting place to 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.960
 my opinion of course you shoot here 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.150
 from afar by alien glare but in principle 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.180
 it is even safer besides you 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.240
 see where opponents look sogrin and 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.029
 you they on you if not then you can 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.819
 just peeking at this moment when 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:04.180
 they are from the magnitude of giving him a shot 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:06.580
 then you will hide and that's it 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.219
 dear friends thank you so much 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.800
