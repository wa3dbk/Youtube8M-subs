00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.049
 hello my name is romance you 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.480
 probably faced such a problem 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.759
 free country sill installed 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.980
 at the front door to the balcony does not hold in 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.990
 this place is constantly cracked 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.360
 putty spilling paint settles 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.489
 This is due to the fact that this window sill 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.489
 installed incorrectly in this case 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.989
 it was installed on mounting foam 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.509
 polyurethane foam over time from plastic 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.460
 exfoliate and the window sill does not hold but 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.320

 link to the channel in the video description and we 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.409
 back to our window sill given 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.749
 I will fix the window sill on metal 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.730
 plates hide their wall do so 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.190
 so that they are not visible but from the side 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.020
 loggias I set the window sill and show 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.090
 how do you do this so that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.130
 the window sill kept on the window sill 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.260
 cut to the length we need the width 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.770
 and now I prepare it for installation 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.090
 it's just a million holes on the drill 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.090
 in the window sill from the bottom 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.869
 it looks like this 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.399
 diameter fate of action 12 millimeters 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.399
 the main thing is not to drill through 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.530
 so here it happened shot 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.600
 how many 200 remove the carcass shot by 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.360
 the inside of the sill and 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.790
 outdoor where I need more 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.400
 held this hand we hid in 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.920
 the slope and this side is free 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.680
 so here I made a bigger hole 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.270
 and submariners lights war tiled 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.280
 glue 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.220
 first on our inward side 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.660
 here by the way was plastered 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:18.050
 the plaster holds firmly I just you 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:22.970
 cut down and try gave the surface here 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:29.300
 so this way the baby and also 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:31.670
 add here right here on the edge well 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.000
 especially need to pay attention 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.480
 fill with glue from the street so as not to 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.709
 water penetrated to ebb and I also put 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:46.070
 on tile adhesive able to see and 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:52.610
 glue concentration while i can say 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:54.739
 thick when i'm up to him rather even 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.010
 added a little where I consider it necessary here 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.549
 such a bunch of dates filled look at 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.049
 good completely tight 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.959
 stub which goes to repose the matter in 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.269
 I donâ€™t wear one stop yet 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.400
 I want to show you on the video myself 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:17.540
 the window sill comes to insert on 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:22.660
 look for a little bit put a halt to the end 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.760
 and here I just take the glue from us thick 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.709
 there is a panasonic plane just letting go 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.709
 on the angle we need 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.980
 not enough 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.599
 what we get is glue which 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.920
 gets there in the hole it diverges 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.500
 inside the window sill 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.620
 here the excess glue we stand 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.410
 out and them now just tidying up the excess 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.989
 I will try to show of course I think you 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.120
 you can see how the glue came out in the hole and 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.890
 the more glue you give the more he 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.110
 will perform there in the hole and will 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.530
 keep our windowsill and speaking 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.610
 glue and immediately remove the spatula 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:22.440
 where it is not enough, you can immediately add 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:24.630
 waving when installing a windowsill if 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.520
 cottage there is a little bit more glue and he 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.040
 well will when you click it 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.229
 Well pressed to the very bottom important 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.630
 so that the framework was clean now I tell you 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.490
 show what turned out check if 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.020
 see whether everything is between the windowsill and 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.820
 no window at all absolutely not necessary 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.740
 worry that the glue will shrink and 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.320
 windowsill prosyadet here will all 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.720
 good and clear yes I do not put 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.450
 I do not put on the window sill 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.729
 why because she does not hold especially 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.979
 ebb in the street in the street in general ebb 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.800
 when fill the middle there slightly 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.950
 water is going to condensate slopes scream 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.200
