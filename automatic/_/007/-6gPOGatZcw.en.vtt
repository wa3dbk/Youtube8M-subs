00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
so first up is an appropriate question

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.290 
so first up is an appropriate question
from<00:00:17.010> b-dawg<00:00:17.640> 923<00:00:18.600> from<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> UK<00:00:19.410> now

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
from b-dawg 923 from the UK now

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
from b-dawg 923 from the UK now
assassins<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.539> sold<00:00:21.869> zillion<00:00:22.590> copies<00:00:23.010> but

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
assassins one sold zillion copies but

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.189 
assassins one sold zillion copies but
now<00:00:24.090> what's<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.630> happen<00:00:24.930> will<00:00:25.050> there<00:00:25.170> be

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
now what's going to happen will there be

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.980 
now what's going to happen will there be
more<00:00:25.650> missions<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.580> wider<00:00:27.150> variety<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
more missions a wider variety in the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.009 
more missions a wider variety in the
structure<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> storyline<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.810> think<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.869> can

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
structure in the storyline I think I can

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.770 
structure in the storyline I think I can
jump<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.969> AC<00:00:33.149> wanna<00:00:33.510> was

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
jump in on this one and in AC wanna was

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.810 
jump in on this one and in AC wanna was
roughly<00:00:34.170> between<00:00:34.500> five<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.010> six<00:00:35.430> different

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
roughly between five and six different

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.030 
roughly between five and six different
mission<00:00:36.149> types<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.710> time<00:00:37.920> around

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
mission types and this this time around

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.590 
mission types and this this time around
in<00:00:38.370> assassin's<00:00:38.850> creed<00:00:39.030> two<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.420> will<00:00:39.480> be

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
in assassin's creed two that will be

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.160 
in assassin's creed two that will be
roughly<00:00:40.280> fourteen<00:00:41.280> fifteen<00:00:41.879> sixteen

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
roughly fourteen fifteen sixteen

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.540 
roughly fourteen fifteen sixteen
different<00:00:43.170> mission<00:00:43.649> tides<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.370> we

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
different mission tides and with that we

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.090 
different mission tides and with that we
can<00:00:44.670> construct<00:00:45.000> construct<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.530> bigger<00:00:46.829> ones

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
can construct construct like bigger ones

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.630 
can construct construct like bigger ones
because<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.329> start<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.640> escort

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
because we can start with a escort

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.819 
because we can start with a escort
mission<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.239> then<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.050> becomes<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.559> chase

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
mission and then that becomes a chase

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
mission and then that becomes a chase
mission<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.910> finish<00:00:54.270> into<00:00:54.539> an

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
mission and we finish into an

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
mission and we finish into an
assassination<00:00:55.379> mission<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.920> put<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
assassination mission and you put that

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.420 
assassination mission and you put that
together<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.090> creates<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.539> different

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
together and creates a different

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.030 
together and creates a different
entirely<00:00:59.180> mission<00:00:59.720> and<00:00:59.870> we<00:01:00.380> got<00:01:00.620> rid<00:01:00.770> of<00:01:00.830> the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
entirely mission and we got rid of the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.040 
entirely mission and we got rid of the
entire<00:01:01.340> structure<00:01:01.880> of<00:01:02.240> the<00:01:02.360> first<00:01:02.630> game<00:01:02.870> where

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
entire structure of the first game where

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.200 
entire structure of the first game where
we<00:01:03.170> had<00:01:03.380> the<00:01:03.530> investigation<00:01:04.250> part<00:01:04.550> then<00:01:05.089> you

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
we had the investigation part then you

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.330 
we had the investigation part then you
had<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.480> assassination<00:01:06.200> parts<00:01:06.530> that's<00:01:07.070> gone

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
had the assassination parts that's gone

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.430 
had the assassination parts that's gone
now<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.030> world<00:01:08.300> is<00:01:08.420> open<00:01:08.780> with<00:01:08.960> mission

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
now the world is open with mission

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.800 
now the world is open with mission
givers<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:10.000> people<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.120> meet<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.360> it<00:01:11.720> will

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
givers and people you meet and it will

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.260 
givers and people you meet and it will
give<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.080> mission<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:12.590> go<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.820> we<00:01:13.820> roughly

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
give you mission to go to we roughly

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.360 
give you mission to go to we roughly
right<00:01:14.510> now<00:01:14.690> have<00:01:14.930> around<00:01:15.680> 200<00:01:16.220> different

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
right now have around 200 different

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.330 
right now have around 200 different
missions<00:01:17.000> in<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.240> entire<00:01:17.570> game

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
missions in the entire game

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.760 
missions in the entire game
104<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.460> main<00:01:19.730> path<00:01:19.970> main<00:01:20.659> narrative<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.380> 100

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
104 the main path main narrative and 100

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.399 
104 the main path main narrative and 100
for<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:21.979> side<00:01:22.280> quests<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.790> side<00:01:23.000> missions<00:01:23.409> so

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
for the side quests and side missions so

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.260 
for the side quests and side missions so
I<00:01:24.440> guess<00:01:24.680> it's<00:01:24.860> like<00:01:25.010> totally<00:01:25.550> different<00:01:26.090> and

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
I guess it's like totally different and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.650 
I guess it's like totally different and
way<00:01:26.750> bigger<00:01:26.930> than<00:01:27.290> it's<00:01:27.620> an<00:01:27.710> easy<00:01:27.890> one<00:01:28.180> yo<00:01:29.180> yo

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
way bigger than it's an easy one yo yo

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.080 
way bigger than it's an easy one yo yo

this is obvious actually really

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.640 
this is obvious actually really
interesting<00:01:45.310> question<00:01:45.670> because<00:01:46.350> we've<00:01:47.350> made

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
interesting question because we've made

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.400
