chisel<00:02:50.260> ground<00:02:50.530> which<00:02:50.980> I'm<00:02:51.220> not<00:02:51.490> really

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
chisel ground which I'm not really

familiar<00:02:52.360> with<00:02:52.690> guys<00:02:53.080> as<00:02:53.380> much<00:02:53.560> but<00:02:53.860> I've

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
familiar with guys as much but I've

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.380 
familiar with guys as much but I've
heard<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.190> lot<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.370> good<00:02:54.550> things<00:02:54.790> about<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.090> just

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
heard a lot of good things about it just

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.480 
heard a lot of good things about it just
being<00:02:55.600> chisel<00:02:56.020> ground<00:02:56.260> and

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
being chisel ground and

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.580 
being chisel ground and
cut<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.760> ton<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.090> cardboard<00:02:58.720> or<00:02:58.900> work<00:02:59.050> guys<00:02:59.290> and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
cut a ton of cardboard or work guys and

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.630 
cut a ton of cardboard or work guys and
I'm<00:02:59.650> thinking<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.160> gonna<00:03:00.220> be<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.490> good

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
I'm thinking this is gonna be a good

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.360 
I'm thinking this is gonna be a good
knife<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.060> cut<00:03:01.210> with<00:03:01.450> with<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.870> chisel<00:03:02.200> grind

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
knife to cut with with the chisel grind

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.790 
knife to cut with with the chisel grind
so<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.510> far<00:03:04.750> it's<00:03:04.990> really<00:03:05.020> sharp<00:03:05.410> out<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.740> the
