00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.569 

the<00:00:36.540> pump<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.640> inside<00:00:39.920> Dynamat<00:00:40.920> where<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.520> goes

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the pump is inside Dynamat where it goes

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.569 
the pump is inside Dynamat where it goes
their<00:00:41.879> intake<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.840> help<00:00:43.230> take<00:00:43.440> they<00:00:44.280> go<00:00:44.430> out

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
their intake and help take they go out

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.860 
their intake and help take they go out
through<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> side<00:00:45.030> here's<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> power<00:00:45.570> for

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
through the side here's the power for

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.700 
through the side here's the power for
the<00:00:45.930> pump<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.070> encased<00:00:47.610> inside<00:00:47.969> here

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
the pump is all encased inside here

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.010 
the pump is all encased inside here
that's<00:00:49.710> my<00:00:50.100> backup<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.870> I'm<00:00:51.989> using

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that's my backup the one that I'm using

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.520 
that's my backup the one that I'm using
right<00:00:52.379> now<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.579> inside<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.030> drawer<00:00:54.530> it's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
right now I have inside a drawer it's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.580 
right now I have inside a drawer it's
way<00:00:55.770> down<00:00:55.920> there<00:00:55.980> inside<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> towel<00:00:57.590> inside

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
way down there inside a towel inside

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.610 
way down there inside a towel inside
about<00:00:58.829> another<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.640> Dynamat<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.570> having<00:01:01.530> my

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
about another so Dynamat I having my

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.870 
about another so Dynamat I having my
intake<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.640> exhaust<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.660> power<00:01:04.610> in<00:01:05.610> there

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
intake my exhaust and the power in there

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.250 
intake my exhaust and the power in there
so<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.390> keeps<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.780> ultra<00:01:07.380> quiet<00:01:07.560> i<00:01:09.080> picks<00:01:10.080> up

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
so it keeps it ultra quiet i picks up

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.160 
so it keeps it ultra quiet i picks up
the<00:01:10.350> water<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:11.040> four<00:01:11.729> main<00:01:12.600> tanks<00:01:13.049> right

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the water you have four main tanks right

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
the water you have four main tanks right
here<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.530> they'll<00:01:13.650> drain<00:01:13.979> into<00:01:14.310> those<00:01:14.460> tanks

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
here and they'll drain into those tanks

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.899 
here and they'll drain into those tanks
and<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.020> fill<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.070> they're

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and then if you fill this one up they're

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.310 
and then if you fill this one up they're
all<00:01:18.060> connected<00:01:18.479> by<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.790> lower<00:01:20.790> tubing<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.229> if

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
all connected by the lower tubing so if

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
all connected by the lower tubing so if
you<00:01:22.409> fill<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.040> all<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.970> other<00:01:24.180> three

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you fill this one up all the other three

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.920 
you fill this one up all the other three
will<00:01:24.780> slowly<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.979> rise<00:01:26.880> up<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.330> equalize

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
will slowly right rise up to equalize

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.240 
will slowly right rise up to equalize
and<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:29.100> those<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.939> goes<00:01:30.240> down<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:32.070> main

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and so those this goes down to the main

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.690 
and so those this goes down to the main
pump<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.939> comes<00:01:33.240> back<00:01:33.479> out

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
pump it comes back out

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.200 
pump it comes back out
it<00:01:35.700> goes<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> my<00:01:36.390> main<00:01:36.600> valve<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.229> here

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it goes up to my main valve right here

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.679 
it goes up to my main valve right here
I<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> three<00:01:40.770> different<00:01:40.920> places<00:01:41.689> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
I can go to three different places the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.249 
I can go to three different places the
drain<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.320> right<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.860> comes<00:01:44.369> around<00:01:45.259> loops

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
drain one right here comes around loops

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.780 
drain one right here comes around loops
around<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.920> sink<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> goes<00:01:49.170> out

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
around the sink and then it goes out

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.749 
around the sink and then it goes out
this<00:01:50.790> right<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.479> into<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> drain<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.759> I

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
this right here into the drain and I

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.399 
this right here into the drain and I
also<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.740> my<00:01:55.740> mix<00:01:57.110> it'll<00:01:58.110> focus<00:02:00.140> there<00:02:01.140> goes

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
also have my mix it'll focus there goes

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.420 
also have my mix it'll focus there goes
mix<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.700> comes<00:02:02.939> down<00:02:03.149> here<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:05.009> goes<00:02:05.159> down

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
mix it comes down here it goes down

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.089 
mix it comes down here it goes down
it'll<00:02:05.729> split<00:02:06.119> off<00:02:06.329> into<00:02:06.630> these<00:02:06.750> two<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.890> it'll

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it'll split off into these two and it'll

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.169 
it'll split off into these two and it'll
split<00:02:08.340> off<00:02:08.520> into<00:02:08.700> those<00:02:08.910> two

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
split off into those two

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.039 
split off into those two
and<00:02:10.929> then<00:02:11.049> I<00:02:11.079> have<00:02:11.290> my<00:02:11.530> drip<00:02:12.599> which<00:02:13.599> it'll<00:02:13.870> come

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
and then I have my drip which it'll come

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.309 
and then I have my drip which it'll come
up<00:02:14.079> up<00:02:14.620> through<00:02:14.920> here<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.840> then<00:02:17.170> they'll

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
up up through here and then they'll

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.770 
up up through here and then they'll
split<00:02:17.590> off<00:02:17.799> here<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:19.180> then<00:02:19.299> it<00:02:19.390> splits<00:02:19.659> off

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
split off here and then it splits off

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.559 
split off here and then it splits off
there<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.230> then<00:02:20.319> there<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.860> then<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.879> have<00:02:22.120> a

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
there and then there and then I have a

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.229 
there and then there and then I have a
little<00:02:26.459> valves<00:02:27.459> right<00:02:27.609> there<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.060> can

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
little valves right there that I can

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.349 
little valves right there that I can
adjust<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.819> one<00:02:30.819> of<00:02:30.909> them<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.060> dripping

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
adjust so that one of them is dripping

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.710 
adjust so that one of them is dripping
more<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:33.209> equalize<00:02:34.209> them<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:34.510> they<00:02:34.629> all

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
more I can you equalize them so they all

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.429 
more I can you equalize them so they all
drift<00:02:34.989> at<00:02:35.109> the<00:02:35.200> same<00:02:35.379> rate<00:02:36.060> my<00:02:37.109> speed<00:02:38.109> for<00:02:38.319> my

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
drift at the same rate my speed for my

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:47.509 
drift at the same rate my speed for my
drip<00:02:38.709> is<00:02:39.390> based<00:02:40.390> off<00:02:40.689> the<00:02:41.530> voltage<00:02:42.359> of<00:02:45.930> my

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
drip is based off the voltage of my

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.490 
drip is based off the voltage of my
speed<00:02:48.519> control<00:02:48.849> right<00:02:49.000> here<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.049> have<00:02:50.079> a

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
speed control right here and I have a

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.190 
speed control right here and I have a
maximum<00:02:51.159> right<00:02:51.340> here<00:02:51.609> which<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.690> which

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
maximum right here which I can which

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.500 
maximum right here which I can which
goes<00:02:53.560> because<00:02:54.280> my<00:02:54.609> drip<00:02:54.909> speed<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.329> going<00:02:55.450> to

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
goes because my drip speed is going to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.289 
goes because my drip speed is going to
be<00:02:55.709> basically<00:02:56.709> five<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.370> ten<00:02:57.790> volts<00:02:58.180> or

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
be basically five to ten volts or

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.390 
be basically five to ten volts or
something<00:02:58.629> and<00:02:59.170> this<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.439> my<00:02:59.680> max<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.129> gonna<00:03:00.310> be

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
something and this is my max is gonna be

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.869 
something and this is my max is gonna be
12<00:03:00.670> volts<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.680> it'll<00:03:02.680> just<00:03:02.859> do<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> full<00:03:03.340> full

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
12 volts and it'll just do a full full

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.990 
12 volts and it'll just do a full full
stream<00:03:04.209> so<00:03:04.480> when<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:04.659> I<00:03:04.720> can<00:03:05.109> use<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.470> max<00:03:06.000> for

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
stream so when I I can use the max for

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.089 
stream so when I I can use the max for
testing<00:03:07.389> or<00:03:07.599> for<00:03:07.989> when<00:03:08.139> I'm<00:03:08.260> draining<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.920> can

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
testing or for when I'm draining I can

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.220 
testing or for when I'm draining I can
have<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.400> full<00:03:09.670> speed<00:03:10.109> full<00:03:11.109> speed<00:03:11.139> that<00:03:11.620> way

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
have it full speed full speed that way

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.009 
have it full speed full speed that way
and<00:03:14.230> then<00:03:14.379> here's<00:03:14.620> my<00:03:14.799> timers<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:16.269> water<00:03:16.540> I'm

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
and then here's my timers the water I'm

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.729 
and then here's my timers the water I'm
gonna<00:03:17.169> have<00:03:17.379> a<00:03:17.970> am/pm<00:03:18.970> setting<00:03:19.650> for<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
gonna have a am/pm setting for the
